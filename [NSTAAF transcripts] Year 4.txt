hello and welcome to another episode of
01:17
no such thing as a fish
01:18
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:20
qi offices and covered guarded
01:23
my new debt my name is dad schreiber and
01:25
i'm sitting here with james harkin
01:27
andrew hunter murray
01:28
and adam josinski and anna chazinski
01:32
and once again we have gathered around
01:34
my movement
01:35
and once again we have gathered around
01:37
the microphones with our four favorite
01:38
facts from the last seven days
01:40
and in no particular order here we go
01:43
[Music]
01:48
starting with my fact my fact this week
01:50
is that the man who popularized the high
01:53
five only has four fingers
01:56
and this was a basketball player called
01:58
wiley brown
02:00
back in 1978-79 season of basketball
02:04
he and his mate started high-fiving
02:08
and they talked about it really really
02:10
interestingly
02:11
uh like i read an interview where he
02:13
said um you know no one was doing it
02:15
they all did it low there's all these
02:17
low fives going on no one did it high
02:19
and he said then the first time we did
02:20
it
02:21
both of us looked at each other and said
02:23
did that just happen
02:27
really into it it was a magical moment
02:29
can i just ask when you say
02:30
four fingers you mean on one of his
02:32
hands exactly so nine fingers
02:34
yes exactly so so he had nine fingers in
02:36
total he was missing a thumb he lost his
02:38
thumb when he was four years old
02:40
and a prosthetic thumb was made which
02:42
meant that he could still become
02:44
an amazing sports star because he played
02:45
basketball and football
02:47
he was a bit sort of uh carefree about
02:50
his thumb at times he actually
02:52
went to the finals of a basketball match
02:54
having left his thumb back at the
02:56
hotel that he stayed at and they had to
02:58
rescue it be awful if you had to
02:59
hitchhike home
03:01
well you could only do it on one side of
03:03
the road
03:05
i actually hated his thumb his his
03:07
prosthetic thumb did he yeah he tried
03:09
not to wear it so he played basketball
03:11
without the thumb for ages and then one
03:12
of his coaches said you're really good
03:14
without that i bet you'd be even better
03:15
with it
03:15
and they made him wear one and it kept
03:17
on flying off
03:18
matches and he said it made him look
03:20
like a freak because you know it was
03:21
someone would bash into his thumb and it
03:22
would fly into the crowd
03:24
and so he tried not to wear it and the
03:26
coach was adamant
03:27
and so much so that he said if he wasn't
03:29
wearing his thumb he wouldn't let the
03:31
other teammates pass
03:32
to his right hand which really damaged
03:35
the game
03:36
so they could only pass his left hand um
03:39
yeah he wasn't a fan
03:40
um i should say that i got this fact it
03:42
was sent into us by a guy called
03:44
michael buccino he's a listener and
03:47
again
03:48
to quickly have to say this if you want
03:49
to see the finest interview
03:51
ever ever recorded go to youtube and put
03:53
in wiley brown
03:55
talking about the high five it is nine
03:57
minutes of interview
03:58
where they ask a question which is so
04:00
you invented the high five how was it he
04:02
says yeah it's great
04:03
and then they've got nine minutes more
04:04
of interview it's too long
04:07
it's not too long it is i watched it no
04:09
because they run out of questions but he
04:10
does not run out of answers he is
04:13
so enthusiastic and he has a new tale
04:15
for each time the high five started so
04:17
he did it with derek smith who wiley
04:18
brown says
04:19
is the actual creator of the high five
04:22
because in all the stories smith is the
04:23
one who instigates it
04:24
so for example another story is that he
04:27
said he was going up during practice to
04:28
derrick smith
04:29
to give him a low five classic low five
04:32
as they always did and then he said out
04:33
of nowhere smith looked brown
04:35
in the eye and said no
04:38
up high i mean that's [ __ ] awesome
04:42
there was another theory about who
04:43
invented the high five yeah it's
04:45
actually very controversial isn't it
04:46
yeah
04:47
so there's uh there's a baseball player
04:50
called uh dusty baker and another called
04:52
glenn burke and it's claimed
04:54
that when baker was getting back towards
04:55
the dugout burke offered a raised hand
04:57
and baker not knowing what to do
04:59
smacked it again very much the same sort
05:02
of like
05:02
amazing foundation moment and then burke
05:04
went out and he got a home run and then
05:05
on the way back he gave him another high
05:07
five and that was in 1977 that that
05:09
supposedly happened so that's earlier
05:11
it's earliest that three days
05:12
that's maybe an origin do you know glenn
05:15
burke who you were talking about yeah
05:17
he's famous because he was pretty much
05:19
the first major league baseball player
05:21
to come out as gay
05:22
and there was a documentary in 2010
05:24
called out the glenn burke story
05:26
and they said that the dodgers
05:29
executives
05:30
offered him 75 000 to get married
05:33
because it would cause such a problem if
05:36
people found out he was gay while they
05:37
were while he was still playing
05:39
no way uh and apparently when they said
05:41
you know
05:42
would you take 75 000 to get married he
05:45
said
05:45
i guess you mean to a woman
05:48
which is quite a good reply that's a
05:50
great title for a movie
05:52
i guess you mean to a woman oh right no
05:54
no
05:55
out oh the actual movie itself do you
05:58
think um there was any confusion at the
05:59
start when people would say hey how's
06:01
glenn and then you go oh he's out
06:03
and they go no he's nice
06:06
just years of playing yeah that's good
06:08
and then dusty baker just one fact about
06:10
him
06:11
he was famous for liking to chew
06:14
toothpicks
06:15
he said toothpicks are an excellent
06:17
source of protein
06:19
which he was wrong about now so on high
06:21
fives yeah
06:22
uh there is a basketball team called the
06:24
phoenix suns yes have you heard of them
06:26
yeah is that like saying there is a
06:28
football team called manchester united
06:30
it is
06:34
anyway these phoenix suns
06:38
in 2016 they announced that they were
06:40
keeping track of all the high fives that
06:41
their team
06:42
really passed to each other um hoping
06:44
that they would create more camaraderie
06:45
like throughout the season they did this
06:47
and
06:48
supposedly uh teams which embrace the
06:51
most in terms of high fives uh or other
06:53
celebrations are more successful
06:54
yeah i think it's surely more likely
06:56
that if you're more successful
06:57
you score more points then you high five
06:59
each other more yeah that's true there
07:00
is a cause and effect thing there
07:02
but i've read um articles saying that
07:05
um sports players who touch each other
07:07
more are
07:08
supposedly better at the sports and i'm
07:11
pretty sure
07:12
the england cricket team always touch
07:13
each other on the bum whenever they do
07:15
something good yes i think that kind of
07:16
comes from that
07:17
idea sports psychologists most sports do
07:19
yeah there's bum slaps all the time
07:21
if we want to improve our performance on
07:23
the podcast should we start slapping
07:24
each other's butts no i don't think we
07:26
should
07:26
i think that was a high five by the way
07:29
not a bomb slap
07:31
there is a hot is there there is a
07:32
machine that an artist has invented
07:34
where you can it does self high fives
07:37
have you seen it it's unbelievably
07:39
disgusting looking
07:40
this sounds like the saddest loneliest
07:42
machine in the world she's a
07:43
turkish-born artist i think she lives in
07:45
america called denise uh
07:46
ozzugo sorry how does she pronounce her
07:49
surname
07:50
i don't know but i don't think it's like
07:51
that i'm so sorry if i've mispronounced
07:54
it which i definitely have um
07:56
so she cast her own arm right she made
07:59
two casts of her arms and then one of
08:00
them is just
08:01
sticking out of this machine and the
08:03
other one is like rotating
08:05
very slowly like a kebab thing
08:08
and every minute they come into contact
08:10
because it's going around in a circle
08:12
and moving up and it just slowly
08:14
brushes the fingers of the other arm so
08:17
that's not really a high five that's
08:18
how you would imagine michael gove would
08:20
high five
08:22
yeah it's really it's really good it
08:24
only does one high five per minute i'm
08:26
not sure what the point is
08:27
but it's hard it's hard that's important
08:30
okay the
08:31
thumbs up that donald trump's gradually
08:33
destroying for everyone else in the
08:34
world
08:35
um do you know what the origin of that
08:37
is
08:38
of wizardry in um when someone got hit
08:41
in the face by a stray thumb
08:43
and they held it up and said whose is
08:44
this
08:48
it's a strong theory but no um so
08:51
apparently there's a
08:52
thing well there's quite a strong myth
08:53
that says that gladiators you give the
08:55
thumbs up for gladiators if you thought
08:56
they should live and then the thumbs
08:57
down they should die but i think that's
08:58
not true i think you just put your thumb
09:00
out and that meant
09:01
i think we've got no evidence that the
09:02
thumbs up meant live and thumbs down
09:04
meant die
09:06
but desmond morris says that it's from
09:08
medieval times where if you were a
09:09
businessman doing a deal then the way
09:11
you do is you lick your thumb
09:12
and then you press it up against someone
09:14
else's licked thumb and
09:16
that was really like hey deal is done oh
09:18
wow that's like um
09:20
blood brothers but slightly weirdly more
09:22
disgusting
09:23
what it reminds me of is do you remember
09:25
in the last qi meeting anna when you
09:27
were
09:28
trying to show us some pick-up lines
09:31
and you tried one on andy you missed
09:33
this dan um
09:34
she licked her thumb wiped it on andy's
09:37
clothes and said
09:38
let's get you out of these wet clothes
09:40
oh that's yeah
09:41
he was smitten the single most erotic
09:44
moment of my life
09:50
uh marion couples used to shake hands at
09:52
the
09:53
altar oh really so this is then his uh
09:56
bbc history magazine
09:57
claims this but yeah in the 17th century
09:59
you got married and then you shake hands
10:00
with the bride
10:01
because it's like a contract maybe
10:03
exactly the kissing thing
10:04
when i got married in january the priest
10:06
told us that you know it's not
10:08
a thing you don't need to do it it's
10:10
like it's just people
10:11
just started doing it it just caught on
10:12
like the high five and just people
10:14
decided to do but it's never been
10:15
officially a part of the ceremony yeah
10:17
you may kiss the bride is not a line a
10:19
part of the
10:20
popularized i think it was a half-lipped
10:23
man yeah i don't know it's quite
10:26
american i always think of it as not a
10:28
what you may now kiss the bride yes in
10:29
fact that's what he said to me he said
10:31
it's something that was seen in american
10:32
movies and then
10:33
everyone thought oh there's meant to be
10:34
that line and then we started doing it
10:37
so when i was looking at stuff about
10:39
high fives i came across
10:41
a an article about a lollipop man he's
10:43
quit
10:44
because he was high-fiving the children
10:46
as they walked across the road
10:48
and he was told not to do it and he was
10:50
like right fine i'm gonna quit
10:52
okay so just very quickly a lollipop man
10:55
because i didn't know this until
10:56
i got to this country is someone who
10:58
stands by a zebra crossing
11:00
and allows school children to walk
11:01
across and i had no idea he's holding a
11:03
large lollipop
11:04
shaped object yes to stop the cars but
11:06
he doesn't sell lollipops
11:08
crossing is a road crossing with black
11:10
and white stripes on it that the beatles
11:12
walked over on abbey road yes but there
11:13
are
11:14
thousands and thousands of zebra
11:15
crossings it's not like britain has one
11:16
zebra crossing and all school children
11:18
have to cross that before they go
11:20
i was surprised they got the space to
11:22
take that photo anyway
11:24
lollipop man so this guy he was from uh
11:26
plymouth city council
11:28
and then i just carried on reading the
11:30
rest of the google searches on pages two
11:32
and three that people don't normally go
11:34
to
11:34
and there was also a lollipop man in
11:36
edinburgh who was told not to high five
11:39
children
11:39
there was a lollipop lady in the vale of
11:41
glamorgan who had the same
11:43
there was two lollipop men in the essex
11:45
i found
11:46
there was um a guy in uh western
11:49
bartonshire
11:50
who's um left his job because um he
11:53
wasn't allowed to high five kids
11:55
and there was a guy in australia in
11:57
bayside australia
11:59
who was also left his job because um
12:02
well he got told off because he was
12:04
high-fiving children so this
12:05
seems to be a real problem amazing that
12:07
it's like a deal breaker for keeping
12:09
your job
12:11
no high fives i'm out of here that is so
12:15
weird
12:16
it's just a thing that seems to be
12:17
happening all over the world that's
12:19
amazing i bet no one else has made that
12:21
connection in the world
12:22
i bet even they
12:30
is it because it's dangerous so the idea
12:33
is you're supposed to be
12:34
concentrating on the road and not
12:37
high-fiving kids as they go across and
12:39
presumably what's happened i don't
12:41
i might be completely wrong about this
12:43
but it seems to me like a memo's gone
12:44
out to all the different councils
12:46
and they've all gone round checking that
12:48
no one's high-fiving people i don't know
12:50
if that's right but it's it's
12:52
a real coincidence it doesn't take that
12:53
much concentration to high-five does it
12:55
i would have thought you could focus on
12:57
the road as well as also yeah
12:59
but if distributing someone was
13:00
repeatedly high-fiving while driving
13:02
i would not be so comfortable as a
13:05
passenger how would you do that stick
13:06
your hand out the window i guess so yeah
13:08
then you're driving too close to the
13:09
pavement
13:12
no you would high five other drivers
13:14
coming in the opposite direction
13:15
of course what you can't see on the
13:17
abbey road cover is the crestfallen
13:19
lollipop man
13:20
on the other side taking his p-45
13:23
with it yeah don't ever high-five the
13:24
beatles again
13:28
[Applause]
13:32
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:34
that is chozinski
13:35
yeah my fact this week is that when the
13:37
first american woman went into space
13:39
nasa designed a makeup kit for her and
13:43
this is an interview i was reading this
13:45
week with sally ride who is in the
13:47
first group of uh female americans who
13:49
went into space
13:50
and yeah she said that nasa called her
13:52
in for a meeting
13:53
and said look we're really worried about
13:55
this we're sending women out there now
13:57
and we obviously need to design your
13:59
makeup kit so
14:00
what kind of stuff should we be putting
14:01
in there because we're a bit stuck with
14:02
that what did she say
14:04
and uh she said it was the last thing
14:06
she wanted to be thinking about
14:07
at that time effectively this fact is
14:10
about the sort of slightly backward
14:12
massively backward sexism that happens
14:14
to a lot of women look like a minger for
14:16
the aliens do you
14:19
so there was this interview with sally
14:20
rides who uh it was quite sweet saying
14:23
that
14:24
when nasa came to her they were a bit
14:26
confused about various things like they
14:27
didn't know how many tampons they would
14:28
want out in space so they suggested 100
14:30
tampons per person for a week and she
14:32
was like
14:34
do that what if you need to build a fort
14:38
tampon fort will you spend your
14:41
childhood
14:42
it's like a pillow but for a mouse
14:45
but some of them i read an interview
14:47
with another of the women who went up
14:48
who said that when
14:49
they came in and asked them do they want
14:51
makeup and what kind of makeup do they
14:52
want there were loud guffaws by some of
14:54
the women but one of them said
14:55
look these pictures taken in space will
14:57
follow us around for the rest of our
14:58
lives and i don't want to disappear into
15:00
the background
15:01
uh so a couple of them did take these
15:03
makeup kits out oh
15:04
yeah well they sort of specially tested
15:06
makeup that would adhere to the skin
15:08
even in a microgravity what doesn't
15:10
happen with makeup handy is women
15:12
don't put makeup on at the start of the
15:13
day and by the end of the day it's the
15:15
gravity's just pulled it down to the
15:16
bottom of their faces
15:19
it's on your feet that's a good point
15:22
a face on crotch look at about 3 p.m
15:28
no it's extraordinary though they sort
15:30
of it is weird and what's also weird is
15:32
how long nasa took to
15:34
uh and send women into space given how
15:37
long the soviet union did not take so it
15:39
was 20 years
15:40
after it was an odd way
15:41
[Laughter]
15:43
they untook a long time
15:47
so uh the soviet union sent valentina up
15:50
in 1963
15:51
and one nasa official was actually asked
15:53
what he thought about this at the time
15:55
and he said it made him sick to his
15:56
stomach to think of women in space
15:58
but this is the weird thing about
15:59
tereshkova's trip she was only allowed
16:02
to go
16:03
uh because she wasn't menstruating
16:06
oh because i was worried about what
16:07
would happen with periods no they just
16:08
didn't have enough payroll to take
16:10
five thousand pounds
16:14
um no there were all these reports sort
16:16
of worrying about it and what so
16:18
basically all your blood sort of pulls
16:19
in your torso and your head because
16:20
there's no gravity
16:22
so that does yeah that is something that
16:23
on earth uh is affected
16:25
by gravity and there was a report in
16:27
america in 1964 which said it would be
16:29
hard to match i'm quoting here
16:31
a temperamental psychophysiologic human
16:34
and the complicated machine i the
16:36
spacecraft both need to be ready at the
16:38
same time i.e
16:39
we think women will be too mad if
16:41
they're menstruating
16:42
to operate a spacecraft and they also
16:45
worried that
16:47
the blood from that system would also
16:49
float up and cause it could cause
16:51
theoretically a dangerous condition
16:53
called peritonitis
16:54
which can be fatal as they thought well
16:56
maybe what if that happens but the
16:58
reality is that
16:59
normal blood circulation is completely
17:00
different to menstrual blood so it was
17:02
never a risk and actually women going up
17:04
in space is very sensible and a good
17:06
idea because
17:07
they can do everything that the men can
17:08
do but they're smaller generally
17:10
speaking
17:10
yeah you just need less power to get
17:12
women up there
17:14
every bit counts you don't have to send
17:16
them as far because they're smaller so
17:18
they'll look the same size even when
17:19
they're a bit closer
17:20
that's the whole point that's why we
17:22
send people into space so they look
17:23
smaller
17:26
to see what humans would look like if
17:27
they were one centimeter tall
17:30
that's one small step no it's a normal
17:32
step it's just a long way away
17:36
um there's another astronaut called
17:38
svetlana
17:40
savitskaya and um she went up in 1984
17:44
she'd admission first woman to fly in
17:45
space twice um
17:47
in 1995 she gave an interview and she
17:49
was talking about the sort of um
17:51
sexism that was going on with being a
17:52
female astronaut when she arrived
17:55
at the sal u7 as she came in there was
17:58
another astronaut there who
18:00
handed her an apron and told her to get
18:03
to work
18:04
that was her arrival wow in space yeah
18:07
was that a
18:08
tongue-in-cheek thing no no it was very
18:10
much it seems like well women shouldn't
18:12
be up here so i'm going to
18:13
say something extremely offensive so it
18:15
was a deliberate like yeah yeah you
18:17
shouldn't be
18:17
you shouldn't be here put the apron on
18:19
if you're going to be here and clean up
18:20
our shuttle
18:21
wow yeah they've been deliberately
18:22
letting dirt build up on the shuttle
18:24
and jeopardizing the entire mission to
18:26
make this incredibly petty point
18:28
how where do you get the apron from who
18:30
has an apron in space
18:32
he would have had to smuggle an apron
18:34
yeah we would have to craft an apron
18:35
probably from vital bits of the
18:36
spaceship
18:38
on the iss do you know they have to
18:39
vacuum every day really
18:41
yeah because they need to keep it clean
18:43
and they need to keep it clear of
18:45
you know germs and bacteria and um yeah
18:48
so they have to vacuum every day it's
18:49
quite ironic the fact that they're
18:50
bringing a vacuum
18:52
into space
18:56
do they because the stuff isn't adhering
18:58
to the ground because of uh the absence
19:00
of gravity
19:01
so do they just wave a vacuum in the air
19:03
i think they must do they must do right
19:05
those are so easy
19:06
i guess what happens is it kind of
19:07
floats around and then it will just
19:08
stick to things
19:10
yeah we've mentioned before you know you
19:12
get callouses on your feet
19:13
because you're not walking around on the
19:15
ground so your underside of your feet
19:17
gets soft and then the top of your feet
19:19
because you're hooking your feet around
19:20
railings again it gets very hard
19:22
those calluses break off and then
19:24
they're just floating around the space
19:26
station
19:27
bits of your own foot skin so you have
19:29
to vacuum those up
19:31
don't wear socks you should be wearing
19:33
space socks
19:35
i guess yeah i guess so but it is cool
19:38
they have reverse
19:39
feet in space i do love that is that
19:42
what we're saying here that's what we're
19:44
saying
19:45
if you live in space you have reverse
19:47
feet do you know what happened on the
19:49
uh the maiden space shuttle columbia
19:51
mission in 1981 the toilet got clogged
19:54
when they were up in space and they had
19:55
to use these tube-shaped bags which
19:58
attached to your bottom with a sticky
19:59
seal to go to the loo
20:00
it's very unpleasant and then as they
20:02
were re-entering the earth's atmosphere
20:05
the toilet was broken and the vacuum
20:07
dried excrement
20:08
got into the ventilation system and then
20:10
started floating around in the main
20:11
cabin
20:12
no bad bad times that's see you really
20:15
need the vacuum cleaner then
20:17
yeah suck that up you can't suck up poo
20:20
in a vacuum cleaner
20:21
i wouldn't use it again after i'd done
20:23
it if it's vacuum dried
20:25
okay if it's vacuum dried you can which
20:27
is why i always vacuum dry
20:30
[Laughter]
20:33
just one more thing on the extreme
20:35
sexism and space
20:36
theme yeah um great theme it's such a
20:39
strong theme
20:40
it's just a real laugh a minute um so in
20:44
1971
20:45
there's a nasa memo which is about
20:47
psychological issues with long space
20:49
flights
20:50
and so this is in 71 and this is about
20:52
how men can suffer in various ways
20:54
and one of the ways that they'll suffer
20:55
is that they don't have a direct
20:57
sexual release because they're up in
20:59
space all a bunch of men on their own
21:00
and this nasa memo says the question of
21:03
direct sexual release on a long-duration
21:05
space mission must be considered
21:07
practical considerations preclude men
21:09
taking their wives
21:10
so it is possible that a woman qualified
21:12
from a scientific viewpoint
21:13
might be persuaded to donate her time
21:15
and energies for the sake of improving
21:17
crew morale
21:20
space prostitutes
21:24
that sounds like a movie doesn't it
21:32
uh they weren't suggesting that they
21:33
were suggesting that providing a woman
21:35
they talk about sublimation uh which is
21:37
the idea that men will be sexually
21:39
relieved by just being around a woman
21:41
uh it will improve their morale rather
21:43
than being on their own because
21:45
it pointed out that masturbation isn't
21:47
is messy and that
21:48
uh homosexual behavior shouldn't be
21:50
encouraged
21:53
i would say as long as it's freeze-dried
22:00
do you ever go to andy's house you'll
22:02
[Laughter]
22:09
[Applause]
22:10
notice
22:12
okay it is time for fact number three
22:14
and that is james
22:15
okay my fact this week is that the
22:17
indian justice system has a backlog
22:19
of 31 million cases
22:23
31 million
22:26
um and if all of the judges
22:30
managed to deal with 100 cases an hour
22:33
and didn't take any breaks it would take
22:36
them 35 years to get rid of the backlog
22:39
because there's hardly any judges but
22:40
it's like it's between 13 and 15 judges
22:43
per million people yeah
22:44
in india yeah and in america it's more
22:46
than a hundred is it
22:48
yeah yeah um so i saw this in a review
22:51
of a book called when crime pays money
22:54
and muscle in indian politics in the
22:57
economist magazine a few weeks ago
22:59
and what it was really it's an article
23:01
about how corrupt
23:02
politicians are in india and they
23:06
said in this article that if you are a
23:08
politician with
23:09
serious charges hanging over you you
23:12
have an 18
23:13
chance of winning your race and that's
23:15
compared with six percent for someone
23:16
who doesn't have any charges against
23:18
them
23:18
so you're three times more likely to get
23:20
into parliament
23:21
if you have a serious crime against you
23:23
than if you have no crime
23:25
which is insane where's the causation
23:28
correlation
23:29
link there do they speculate yeah
23:31
because i can't believe people are
23:32
voting people in just on the grounds of
23:34
their criminal history well their
23:35
speculation is
23:36
that getting the indian state to do
23:38
things is very difficult because it's
23:40
just
23:40
there's so much bureaucracy and
23:42
sometimes you just have to bang a few
23:44
heads together to get things done
23:45
and so people think well this criminal
23:48
knows how to get things done
23:50
specifically crimes but if he can do
23:52
crimes he can probably
23:53
sort out the roads and the railways and
23:55
stuff like that as well so is it only
23:57
the people who've done crimes well
23:58
that are getting elected if you do
24:00
crimes that well you tend not to go to
24:02
prison well indeed they've been caught
24:04
so i would have thought
24:05
well a lot of these people haven't been
24:07
um found guilty or anything because
24:08
there's still 31 million
24:10
oh yeah it's cases two-thirds of all
24:12
people in prison in india have not been
24:14
convicted of anything
24:16
they're waiting so they still put them
24:18
in jail though there are 400 000 people
24:20
in india in prison uh which is actually
24:22
i think a bit lower than the british
24:24
proportion because britain's got about
24:25
80 000 people in prison so they've got
24:27
five times as many but their
24:28
population's way higher
24:29
but yeah so you might have to wait 10
24:31
years for your
24:32
case to be brought to court and you
24:34
might be innocent that whole time and
24:35
some people can't afford bail
24:37
or some people don't know that bail is
24:38
available to them so they're just sort
24:40
of
24:41
left muldering in jails for years and
24:42
years and years wow and in the lower
24:44
house
24:44
in india the lok sabha um 34
24:48
of the mps have got criminal charges
24:51
filed against them
24:52
so that's more than a third and
24:54
according to this article you can pretty
24:56
much walk from mumbai to kolkata
24:58
without stepping foot outside a
25:00
constituency whose mp
25:01
isn't facing a charge oh my god and
25:03
that's about
25:04
2 000 kilometers
25:07
wasn't there a thing in um in the
25:09
american election this year that you
25:11
told me about anna
25:12
where uh there was a one of the people
25:14
running had a had a uh warrant out for
25:16
their arrest oh yeah the green candidate
25:18
that's why that's why they were running
25:19
[Laughter]
25:23
vote for me vote green
25:30
and it was for um protesting yeah it was
25:33
for vandalism because she
25:35
graffitied something it was a mental
25:36
protest it was in a particular state
25:38
wasn't it yeah so she just
25:39
didn't campaign very much there yeah
25:42
or really anywhere else so obviously
25:46
there are people who
25:47
have to wait a very long time to get
25:48
their cases heard one example
25:50
is a guy an 85 year old man who in 2014
25:55
was granted a divorce that he'd filed
25:57
for 32 years
25:58
wow you're probably made up by then
26:00
haven't you yeah
26:02
yeah well you'd hope so otherwise that's
26:04
a lot of
26:05
resentment that's festering for 34 years
26:08
in 2008 in india government whips um
26:11
sprung
26:12
six mps out of prison so that they could
26:14
vote
26:16
yeah oh if only our works were that cool
26:18
the most rebellious thing they do is
26:20
not obey jeremy corbyn imagine if they
26:22
were springing people out of jail
26:24
so it was going to be a really tight
26:25
vote and they decided oh we're going to
26:27
need these six people so they got them
26:28
out of prison
26:29
that was amazing like on a day trip or
26:32
just all together out of prison
26:34
i think they put them back in oh yeah
26:36
but that's like uh during john major's
26:38
government in the uk
26:39
because he had this wafer thin majority
26:41
didn't he and they kept on having to
26:42
bring in you know if they were mps who
26:43
were really seriously ill
26:45
to get legislation through they were
26:46
practically bringing in stretchers you
26:48
know
26:48
sort of pushing them through the
26:50
division yeah yeah do we know how they
26:52
sprung them out of prison was it a great
26:53
escape style
26:54
tunnel digging sort of endeavor the
26:57
tunnel digging you need to know that the
26:58
vote's coming up a long time in advance
27:02
order 12 bulldozers on taxpayers
27:06
there's one court case in india that's
27:08
been going on since 1878
27:12
i think this was the oldest i could find
27:14
it's
27:15
a long divorce isn't it
27:18
great grandchildren are getting divorced
27:19
uh it's over a plot of land that's less
27:21
than two
27:22
acres uh and it's a fight between a
27:25
sheer muslim family and a sunni muslim
27:27
family
27:27
and uh one side argues that their graves
27:30
are on it and so they need to keep it
27:31
the other side argues it belongs to them
27:33
it's been going on since 1878
27:35
um the election the election commission
27:37
of india says that no person should have
27:39
to travel more than two kilometers to
27:41
cast a vote
27:42
um so in the state of gujarat there's a
27:45
temple
27:45
caretaker who lives in a temple in the
27:48
middle of a forest
27:49
um who is the only person who votes in
27:52
his
27:52
special voting booth okay so the police
27:55
come in whenever there's an election
27:57
they have to go through this massive
27:59
forest with snakes and lions and stuff
28:01
like that
28:02
and then they put the voting booth in
28:04
the middle of the forest and they sit
28:05
there and they wait for him to come
28:07
and he says in the morning he has his
28:09
breakfast that he has a cup of tea and
28:10
he works out who he's gonna vote for
28:13
and then about eleven o'clock he wanders
28:14
down and puts his vote in and they can
28:16
go home
28:17
that is amazing isn't that cool that's
28:19
really cool that's hilarious that they
28:21
haven't specified a time they've just
28:22
got to sit
28:24
turnout's very low this year
28:28
just one thing we've never talked about
28:29
actually that's another weird thing
28:30
about the indian justice system
28:32
is the case of lal bihari who set up the
28:35
uttar pradesh
28:37
uh group of dead people who are really
28:39
dead i've never mentioned this but this
28:41
is totally bizarre
28:42
he's this guy who in 1975 wanted to
28:44
apply for a bank loan and so he went to
28:46
try and get proof of identity from
28:48
the revenue office and he found out that
28:49
he was dead uh because his uncle had
28:51
declared him dead so he could claim the
28:53
land that he had inherited and it turned
28:54
out this is a massive problem and he set
28:56
up his organization
28:57
which uh is to represent people who have
28:59
been declared dead in india even though
29:01
they're alive
29:02
and he eventually in 2004 he
29:06
he eventually in 90 died
29:09
i told him he was dead i told you and
29:11
i'm right
29:14
in 1994 sorry he finally managed to get
29:16
himself declared alive
29:17
but his organization which is the uttar
29:19
pradesh dead people association
29:21
has over 20 000 members and by 2004
29:25
they'd only managed to declare four of
29:26
them alive
29:27
wow i remember reading about him where
29:30
the
29:31
all the times he tried to prove that he
29:33
was alive
29:34
so he started doing things like like
29:36
illegal stuff like you know
29:37
robbing a bank they'd be like we can't
29:39
arrest you you're not alive we can't
29:41
arrest a dead man
29:42
so do you think he was rubbing the back
29:43
they're like oh it's a ghost
29:46
he would just move mugs around
29:50
[Laughter]
29:52
just walk into seances
29:54
[Laughter]
29:58
there was a story i'm saying since there
29:59
was a legal case in the uk that had to
30:01
be redone
30:02
because it turned out the jury this is
30:03
in 1994 the jury had made their decision
30:06
based on a seance yeah it was a double
30:09
murder case
30:10
and they had to spend the night in a
30:11
hotel because uh the case was going on a
30:13
while and they all got really drunk and
30:15
then one of them emptied their wine
30:16
glass turned over and went all right
30:17
let's ask a ghost
30:18
who whether he's guilty or not and they
30:20
did and then they had to redo the case
30:22
because
30:23
that wow isn't it loud why would the
30:25
ghost know like what was the
30:27
i'm not sure i'm not sure the ghost did
30:29
now but like the
30:31
ghost who was the ghost there's the
30:33
ghost of the murdered man
30:36
who killed you did he do it oh so it was
30:38
specifically it wasn't just a ghost well
30:40
it might be because ghosts can talk to
30:41
each other right so the ghost
30:42
whoever it was could have gotten asked
30:44
the murdered person i'll get back to you
30:46
i'm seeing him next week for a ghost
30:48
lunch uh
30:49
i don't know who did that one
30:52
[Laughter]
30:54
this is
31:04
okay it's time for our final fact of the
31:06
show and that is andy
31:08
my fact is that scientists are building
31:10
a special bunker in antarctica to store
31:12
bits of glacier from the alps
31:16
so exciting yeah it's amazing why
31:19
because glaciers are melting all over
31:20
the world and i didn't know this that
31:22
this is a job there's a job of being a
31:24
paleoclimatologist
31:26
so like a paleontologist does dinosaurs
31:28
a paleoclimatologist does ancient
31:30
weather basically
31:31
and all these glaciers they go they're
31:34
really old ice and it contains lots of
31:35
data about
31:36
what was in the atmosphere how much of
31:38
which kind of gas what the weather would
31:39
have been like what the climate was
31:41
so if they melt you suddenly are losing
31:44
tens of thousands of years of data
31:46
so what kind of weather did they learn
31:47
it's like oh it was snowing
31:49
yeah it was snowing before that and
31:50
snowing before that
31:52
cold cold still cold
31:56
they learn about the gases in the
31:58
atmosphere
32:00
um and they have to but they have
32:01
they're not collecting cross sections of
32:03
ice they have these
32:04
circular drills they're like cookie
32:06
cutters and they just bore
32:07
right down into the ice and then they
32:09
bring it up slice it into one meter
32:11
sections
32:11
label them and they're currently
32:13
building this massive bunker which is
32:14
going to be in antarctica
32:16
is this is their research group are they
32:17
the ones called protecting ice memory
32:19
project
32:20
yes okay so this is this big
32:21
international pendulum
32:23
oh yeah yeah do they call themselves
32:27
poops
32:28
i think it's pim uh project i think it's
32:30
just a i could see why they didn't
32:31
bother with the project but
32:34
they make a big deal of that space with
32:36
a pym project
32:39
pimp poor's project
32:44
yeah it's unbelievably cool though
32:46
actually these so these ice cores that
32:47
they pull out just the idea that
32:49
all of this stuff that's happened for
32:51
hundreds of thousands of years is
32:52
literally frozen in time and we can look
32:54
at it
32:54
so find volcanic ash or find when carbon
32:57
dioxide was in was in the atmosphere and
32:59
how much of it
32:59
and that's how they get a lot of climate
33:00
data which i hadn't realized so when we
33:02
say
33:03
you know when you have those graphs
33:04
which show how much co2 is in the
33:05
atmosphere x number of years ago
33:07
very often that's because they've
33:08
studied an ice core and they've found a
33:10
little bubble of it somewhere beneath
33:11
it's been preserved for bubbles
33:13
hundreds of thousands of years it's
33:14
always bubbles it's always the bubbles
33:15
isn't it
33:16
why don't they just keep the bubbles
33:17
that's true because it'd be easier to
33:19
store wouldn't it
33:20
and the reason it's antarctica is that
33:22
even if the power fails
33:24
it's still minus 50 degrees outside yeah
33:26
whereas if you have it somewhere warmer
33:27
right and the power fails obviously all
33:30
your precious data melts
33:31
um do you guys know about project ice
33:33
worm
33:35
uh project ice worm i know what ice
33:38
worms are what no i don't know
33:40
they're worms that live in ice all right
33:42
yeah that's amazing james
33:45
wait is that true that can't be true
33:46
they have worms that live on glaciers uh
33:48
but anna can tell us about her thing and
33:49
then i'll tell you about ice worms okay
33:51
cool let's compare ice worms
33:53
uh so this isn't actually in antarctica
33:55
this is in greenland but project iceworm
33:57
was this american plan in the cold war
33:59
to build this
34:00
massive underground network of tunnels
34:01
below the ice in greenland
34:03
and then um that would be they would be
34:06
missile launch sites so that way if they
34:08
went via greenland then they could get
34:09
easy access to the soviet union
34:11
and we actually did this so if you go to
34:13
greenland way way under the ice
34:15
there's this network of tunnels that
34:16
they started building that's full of
34:18
stuff like sewage and loads of diesel
34:21
fuel apparently
34:22
um some pollutants some radiological
34:24
waste and
34:26
i think 21 tunnels were dug under the
34:28
ground in greenland
34:29
um and then they decided it wasn't
34:31
actually going to work because it wasn't
34:32
viable for people to like live under the
34:34
ice for long periods of time
34:35
they had um hospitals they had a cinema
34:38
they had shops
34:39
yeah yeah what's all this sewage there
34:41
for yeah i don't know why all the sewage
34:43
is there maybe
34:44
made you have a funny tummy if you're
34:46
living makes it easy to freeze dry
34:49
yeah that's true um but it's a problem
34:51
because it's
34:52
the ice sheet might melt on greenland
34:54
and you've got all the radioactive
34:55
sludge which is going to
34:56
no but bad news the ice sheet melts yeah
34:59
the
35:00
seas kind of rise and stuff like that
35:02
good news we find the new cinema yeah
35:05
oh yeah imagine that day when the ice
35:08
melts and there's a like a
35:09
you know an odion yeah covered in
35:11
radioactive waste
35:13
and sewage i can imagine it being a
35:16
hipster destination cinema actually
35:17
yeah people are gonna go it's gonna be
35:19
very good you have to dig through 12
35:21
meters of ice to get there
35:23
okay okay i can't wait anymore what's an
35:25
ice worm oh yeah sorry
35:28
this is
35:32
oh my god well a nice one like i say it
35:34
is just a worm that lives on ice they
35:36
live in glaciers
35:38
and they eat little bits of pollen that
35:40
have been trapped in the glacier
35:42
they're little black things so you can
35:43
see them really easily and do they
35:45
burrow through the ice and live well
35:47
sometimes they do so if it's warm on the
35:50
outside if it's
35:51
above like say two degrees they'll go
35:53
into the ice because
35:54
if they get above five degrees they melt
35:57
and they literally melt they turn to
35:59
liquid
36:00
these worms um it's like an enzyme in
36:03
their body which starts to liquefy their
36:05
whole body so if they go above
36:06
like say two or three degrees they will
36:09
melt
36:10
and you see them on glaciers the little
36:11
black things wow
36:13
that's so terrifying being them it's for
36:16
some reason i feel it's like speed where
36:18
you can't go over a certain amount
36:19
they're obsessively
36:20
watching the thermometer all the time
36:22
yeah
36:24
sometimes glaciers enter this sort of
36:26
super fast
36:27
state and they go how fast not very fast
36:31
so not super fast it's well
36:34
they they call them glacier surges right
36:36
and they move at 100 times their normal
36:38
speed when i read that the fastest
36:40
that they've ever gone is 11 miles per
36:42
year
36:44
that's pretty fast is it that is it
36:47
well it's about 45 meters per day sure
36:50
it's like southern rail
36:51
yeah exactly yeah um but they they are
36:53
moving four times faster than they were
36:55
in the 90s
36:56
in the summer speed of glaciers which is
36:59
that's big where are they going
37:00
uh well they're melting and moving
37:02
downhill downhill and towards the top
37:04
right yeah so that's what a glacier is
37:06
basically it's loads and loads of snow
37:08
that's fallen over
37:09
loads and loads of years and it's just
37:11
slowly with gravity moving down towards
37:13
the sea like a river
37:14
but it's made of ice so it's on land yes
37:17
okay yeah otherwise it'd be an iceberg
37:20
yes okay so that's the difference that's
37:21
what i
37:22
that's what i didn't understand yeah and
37:23
actually a foxes glacier been chose a
37:24
polar bear standing on an
37:26
iceberg you're right yeah so it's a
37:28
completely inaccurate it should be an
37:30
iceberg mint
37:31
yes or they need to change their design
37:34
either way until they do one of those
37:36
two things
37:39
i mean to be honest if we're being
37:40
really pedantic they should show fox
37:42
standing on a glacier so they've got it
37:43
wrong in a couple of ways
37:46
what are you guys doing the better
37:52
there are towns in the alps who are
37:54
still burying soldiers from the first
37:56
world war
37:57
thanks to glacier melt what do you mean
37:59
by that loads of soldiers were posted in
38:01
the alps during the first world war and
38:02
it was incredibly
38:03
obviously very cold extremely harsh
38:05
conditions to live in and they were
38:06
fighting very fiercely over
38:08
almost no territory basically but lots
38:11
of soldiers
38:12
froze to death got caught in the
38:14
glaciers
38:15
uh didn't get caught by the glaciers but
38:17
they incredibly slow like that austin
38:19
powers scene
38:20
edging away from the slow moving well no
38:22
we've established that they're super
38:24
fast so maybe they weren't ready for the
38:26
speed of uh
38:26
okay about 11 miles
38:30
a year how did these guys get into the
38:33
army
38:35
anyway they were caught they're now
38:37
being they're now being discovered as
38:38
the glaciers retreat as they melt
38:40
bodies are being discovered and they're
38:42
being buried so there was a funeral for
38:43
two of them in 2013 and 500 people
38:45
turned up to
38:46
sort of pay their respects were their
38:48
bodies um preserved
38:50
properly like um because i remember um
38:53
when they found
38:54
mallory on everest you know a lot of his
38:57
his
38:57
skin was it was there his body was there
39:00
because they you're probably preserved
39:01
aren't you in the cold i don't know how
39:02
well preserved they were but there is a
39:04
particular town called
39:05
payo where they do a lot of these perils
39:07
because they're near a lot of the
39:08
battlefield sites and that's where the
39:10
bodies are being discovered wow
39:12
amazing it is kind of a if you're
39:14
looking on the bright side of global
39:15
warming
39:16
uh it is good for glacial archaeology
39:18
isn't it because this
39:19
like you say this it's suddenly
39:20
revealing all this amazing stuff so
39:23
uh melting glasses have suddenly
39:24
revealed like lots of roman coins some
39:26
iron age horses
39:28
uh there's a glacier called the medan
39:29
hall glacier i'm not sure anna like
39:32
a couple of coins and a horse makes up
39:34
for losing the entire netherlands
39:37
what if you want your children to go
39:38
into the same line of work as you when
39:40
there's no more ice
39:41
it's only good in the very short term
39:43
well i think we've established that this
39:44
view is a very short-term view isn't it
39:46
i was worried about the long term i
39:47
would be concerned about climate change
39:50
as it is i'm very excited about these
39:52
roman coins
39:54
and a forest so there's a thousand year
39:56
old
39:57
guys that we can always do with more
39:59
forest and there's a thousand-year-old
40:01
forest that's been revealed by a melting
40:02
glacier in alaska
40:04
it's a rubbish forest after all the time
40:05
under a glacier
40:09
a bit depressing exactly dead squirrels
40:11
everywhere
40:14
yeah that's strange isn't it because you
40:16
do want more trees as well you want more
40:18
forests
40:19
but you also want more ice so which do
40:21
you choose
40:22
oh it's sophie's choice isn't it yeah
40:24
but the ice i think will keep the ice
40:26
okay yeah great because you can go for
40:28
us elsewhere where there's no ice but
40:30
you can't put ice
40:31
you can make eyes you can't keep it in
40:34
the amazon
40:35
if you have a refrigerator you can you
40:37
can't turn the amazon into a fridge
40:40
but you could put a lot of refrigerators
40:42
into the amazon it's not a refrigerator
40:44
it's a freezer
40:46
a refrigerator is just going to slow
40:48
down the melting is that why my ice
40:50
cream's
40:51
[Laughter]
40:58
[Music]

[Music]
01:39
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:42
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:44
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:46
covent garden
01:47
my name is dan schreiber and i am
01:49
sitting here with james harkin
01:50
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
01:53
and once again we have gathered around
01:55
the microphones with our four
01:56
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:58
and in no particular order
02:00
here we go starting with you andy my
02:03
fact is that sometimes
02:04
racing ferrets fall asleep halfway along
02:06
the course
02:08
so it's a bit like um the tortoise and
02:11
the hair
02:12
story ah that the hair is a ferret
02:15
the tartus is another ferret that
02:17
doesn't fall asleep all the animals are
02:19
ferrets
02:20
yeah and sometimes they fall asleep i've
02:21
confused things too much by introducing
02:23
it's a bit like sleeping beauty
02:25
it's a sleeping ferret was she halfway
02:28
through a race
02:29
i missed that bit of the story um just a
02:32
sleeping bit really
02:33
right yeah yeah yeah and then a handsome
02:35
prince turns up and kisses
02:37
he's a ferret too this is an article
02:40
from the derby telegraph who did a
02:42
report they've had a ferret race
02:43
up in derby recently at a place called
02:45
long eaton
02:47
and um there's no track what there is is
02:49
a tube
02:51
and every ferret has its own tube oh i
02:52
was going to say not just one tube
02:54
otherwise the person who goes in first
02:56
would be the winner every time
02:58
and also you could just fall asleep and
03:00
that's it yeah
03:02
that would be like having bob sledding
03:04
with just one of those courses and
03:05
you'll go at once oh yeah
03:07
yeah that is not the case in this
03:10
race no every ferret gets his or her own
03:13
tube and you race along it and the coach
03:16
has to encourage the ferret along to the
03:18
other end
03:18
but sometimes the ferret can be winning
03:21
according to a spokesman
03:22
and then decide to lie down for a nap so
03:24
a race can take two minutes or it can
03:25
take 10 minutes
03:26
this place uh in long eaton uh last year
03:29
they had a thing called ferret roulette
03:31
is it like russian roulette yeah
03:34
the ferret's got a gun yeah maybe no
03:37
no you shoot a ferret into the side of
03:39
your head
03:41
it's not like that no okay um it was
03:43
that where you had to bet on which tube
03:45
a ferret would go down
03:47
right you could put on loads of
03:48
different pairs of trousers and one of
03:50
them's got a ferry
03:52
that is ferret roulette that's really
03:54
good
03:55
um i read i think it was the same one
03:58
tickets were 12 pounds each is this
04:00
the same one i didn't check the ticket
04:02
prices all right how many ferret racing
04:04
events can there have been a long eaten
04:05
recently
04:06
yeah probably a few yeah
04:09
tickets were 12 pounds each and they
04:11
included a fish and chip supper
04:14
okay and it might be good i know at my
04:16
local fish and chip shop
04:17
um fish chips and mushy peas is nine
04:19
pound eighty on its own so
04:21
you're paying two pound twenty for the
04:23
ferrets really
04:24
that's very reasonably priced isn't it
04:26
that's very good
04:28
they should really make the tube
04:29
see-through i've just realized because i
04:30
was thinking what you're really paying
04:31
for is nothing because you don't get to
04:32
see any of it until the ferret pops out
04:34
of course the tube is see-through
04:36
no no no no no yeah no dan it's not the
04:38
one i watched well it's a solid
04:44
you clearly paid a bit more than your 12
04:45
quid no it's um there are sections of
04:48
wire in the tube so occasionally you see
04:49
a ferret passing by
04:51
that's more like a way marker than a
04:52
that my one's way better you get to
04:54
watch
04:55
all the workings of the race like a race
04:58
imagine imagine if there was like a pool
05:00
cover on the top of an olympic swimming
05:02
pool
05:04
let's see who pops out at the end oh
05:06
they all drowned
05:07
i shouldn't put that cover up
05:11
um so have you guys heard about ferret
05:12
legging yes
05:14
god it's exciting the best thing in the
05:15
world yeah so it's where you put a
05:17
ferret down your trousers and you see
05:19
yeah how long you can keep it you tie up
05:21
the ends of your trousers put a ferret
05:22
down there
05:23
it's nice for the ferret because it
05:24
reminds it of hunting rabbits i presume
05:26
yes well what's it hunting in that case
05:29
what is it in your trousers that reminds
05:31
the fairy tale
05:36
um
05:40
aren't you not allowed to wear underwear
05:41
and ferret legging you have to have your
05:43
genitals exposed i think in some of it
05:46
it's exposed to the ferret to the ferry
05:49
yeah really definitely would have got
05:51
that memo wrong and arrived
05:53
balls out but that's the only occasion
05:55
where actually you can claim
05:57
you're exposing yourself for a very good
05:59
reason which is to protect
06:01
your genitals from the ferret that's
06:02
true be cheating though
06:04
officer in uh i think this might have
06:07
been in list verse actually that one of
06:08
the biggest names in ferret
06:10
legging is reg miller and he introduced
06:13
the concept of wearing white trousers to
06:15
better display the blood spilled from
06:17
the bike
06:18
in 1972 the ferret legging records stood
06:20
at 40 seconds
06:21
right a few years later it rose to over
06:23
one minute and eventually to 90 minutes
06:26
which is quite a leap yeah and then in
06:28
1977 edward simpkins from the isle of
06:30
wight set the new world record of 5
06:32
hours and 10 minutes
06:33
although he only had one ferret in his
06:35
trousers during the first four hours
06:37
and two for the last 70 minutes simpkins
06:40
sustained two large bites during his
06:41
record-breaking attempt but continued to
06:43
play a game of darts
06:44
undeterred
06:56
he actually won the bdo world
06:58
championships that year
06:59
[Laughter]
07:01
beat jockey wilson in the final but
07:04
that's only because he trained the
07:04
ferret to carry the dart over to the
07:06
dartboard
07:07
and hammer it in apparently what you're
07:10
meant to do when you do ferret legging
07:12
is um is to feed your ferret a lot
07:16
so you don't you don't put a hungry
07:17
ferret down your trousers which is what
07:19
leads to a lot of the bites is because
07:21
four hours in they might get a bit
07:23
hungry and start nibbling on you
07:25
so if you really feed your ferrets you
07:27
should
07:28
you should survive a bite yeah it's
07:30
interesting because ferret is
07:31
i had a look in the slang dictionary the
07:33
partridge dictionary of slang
07:34
ferret is slang for penis and it's also
07:37
an rs lang term which is
07:39
rhyming slang for beret
07:42
that's not it says in the dictionary
07:46
brackets deliberately bad
07:50
i think you can tell by the tone of
07:51
voice in which someone says i've got a
07:53
ferret in my trousers what kind of
07:54
ferret they're talking about do you
07:55
think so
07:56
i think it was almost like i'm gonna
07:57
burn in my trousers that's a penis
08:03
they're banned as pets aren't they in
08:05
certain places i think new york
08:08
i wasn't allowed to bring mine in do you
08:11
know
08:11
which area of britain owns the most
08:14
ferrets
08:15
london pretty much yeah london and the
08:18
south
08:18
east uh it's traditionally thought to be
08:20
a northern
08:22
or especially a yorkshire thing but 27
08:26
of the ferrets in the uk um live in
08:28
london and the south east
08:30
uh yorkshire only has seven percent of
08:32
the ferrets
08:33
no are they domesticated or do we have
08:35
wild ferret um
08:37
this is as pets i think yeah these are
08:39
his pets right i have seen someone near
08:41
where i live
08:41
walking around a ferret on a leash i was
08:44
so excited oh i've seen that before you
08:46
can get little harnesses for them
08:48
mitch used to have a pet ferret john
08:51
mitchinson
08:51
uh of qi wow that's cool i met him
08:57
with him for years uh he had big paws
09:00
and whiskers
09:03
yeah pretty much that's him constantly
09:05
trying to get into your trousers
09:08
good old mitch um so they're they've
09:10
really vicious right
09:11
animals in this kind of group like
09:14
weasels and stoats and ferrets are
09:16
stellar die so yeah mustela die uh
09:18
they're
09:19
so um voracious and such good hunters so
09:22
there was that david ashmore clip of a
09:23
stoke that caught a rabbit that was ten
09:25
times its size and the way they do it is
09:27
they wrap their bodies around
09:28
the animal they're trying to catch so
09:30
they're like a little snake and then
09:31
they bite it always exactly between the
09:33
skull and the spine so it cuts that off
09:36
um but yeah they're really good hunters
09:37
and one of the ways they hunt is by
09:38
doing the
09:39
i think it's called the weasel war dance
09:41
and it's where they just flip their body
09:43
around in
09:43
insane kind of configurations they can
09:46
hypnotize a chicken can't they
09:47
they the idea is that they transfix
09:50
their prey
09:51
uh and their prey is so distracted that
09:53
they get it's slightly different to
09:55
hypnotizing a chicken
09:56
isn't it if they've just uh this is what
09:59
this is what the all black rugby team do
10:00
before every game hypnotized
10:03
war dance is they hypnotize the england
10:06
team
10:06
into being completely pathetic and rugby
10:10
have you heard of the vigilante group
10:12
the 12 just men
10:14
no no they were in a welsh market town
10:16
called newtown there was a report about
10:18
them in the independent in 1992
10:20
and what they did they thought that the
10:22
local punishments dished out to
10:24
criminals you know like for vandalising
10:25
and burglary and things like that
10:27
were really pathetic and weak and that
10:28
the police weren't doing anything so
10:30
they formed this vigilante group and
10:33
they would find out about crimes and
10:34
then they would
10:36
um their spokesman said our plan for
10:38
keeping law and order is simple
10:40
anyone we catch in the act of committing
10:42
a crime will frog march off to the hills
10:44
where there's nobody to hear the screams
10:46
we'll hold him down and slip fred into
10:48
his trousers
10:49
they had a ferret called fred what do
10:51
you mean by ferret
10:52
[Laughter]
10:55
um it will be painful and terrifying but
10:57
it will teach him a lesson he won't
10:58
forget in a hurry
10:59
do you know wizard weasels uh make their
11:02
own fridges basically have their own
11:03
fridge set up
11:05
they do they don't they've mastered
11:07
electricity and they've made
11:09
no they they store food underground and
11:11
they dig underground compartments near
11:13
their den entrances
11:14
i see i see no i see anna you're right
11:16
they have they've mastered the art of
11:18
fridges
11:19
i would say they are somewhere along
11:21
with the outer fridges
11:22
but mastery is a way off and
11:26
let me finish they plug it into the maze
11:30
no fine they they dig holes underground
11:32
because they'll sometimes go on a big
11:33
killing spree
11:34
and then bury most of their prey
11:36
underground where it's nice and cold so
11:37
it gets preserved
11:39
but um they can store huge numbers of
11:40
things in there so scientists once found
11:42
a stash in greenland that was stuffed
11:45
with the carcasses of 150 lemmings
11:48
lemmings yeah lemmings is a weasel
11:50
serial killer who needs to be brought to
11:52
justice immediately
11:53
hang on am i thinking lemming's like the
11:56
size of a sheep right
11:57
no no the size of like a guinea pig
12:01
what are you thinking of i thought it
12:02
was just this cave of
12:04
dead sheep 150 of them what are you
12:07
thinking of
12:08
lemmings aren't they the ones that ran
12:09
off the cliff that disney
12:11
no but but that's the myth right
12:14
what so the trope is like a hundred
12:16
guinea pig sized things ran up the clock
12:20
in my head they were sheep size um okay
12:22
i mean we're all learning so this is
12:24
great
12:25
you've learned about ferret fridges i've
12:26
learned about the size of an animal that
12:28
everyone knows
12:30
can i just tell you one thing about a
12:31
different kind of animal racing
12:34
yeah um so i think the equivalent of
12:36
ferret racing in the us
12:37
is frog jumping contests and this is
12:40
based on a mark twain
12:41
story i think it was the story of the
12:42
first story that made mark twain famous
12:44
that he wrote in the 1860s
12:46
about a fictional frog jumping contest
12:48
in accounting california which it now
12:49
happens every year
12:51
um and they attract up to ten thousand
12:53
people i think
12:54
um lots of people go and attend and you
12:57
can do stuff like blow on the frogs
12:58
nether regions
12:59
and that's what that kind of makes you
13:01
have to pay extra to do that
13:04
or is that included in your twelve
13:05
dollars it's included in the ntv says
13:08
fish and chips do you want to blow up
13:09
the anus of a frog
13:11
it's included so
13:14
when it's a frog jumping competition is
13:17
it height
13:18
distance speed or what i'm pretty sure
13:20
it's distance and
13:21
i think they do three they're allowed to
13:23
do three jumps and then they measure how
13:24
far they've gone in three jumps like the
13:26
hot pop and hot
13:29
exactly but they have to be played
13:32
soothing music so in the rules of this
13:33
game
13:34
they don't they like it they like it
13:36
they prefer it they like a bit of
13:38
soothing music when you're blowing on
13:39
their genitals
13:41
it's a romantic scene if you think about
13:43
it no there are actually rules that say
13:44
when the frogs aren't
13:46
working they have to be kept underground
13:48
they have to be kept in
13:50
a fridge with a massive lemming
13:55
they have to be kept in the dark in the
13:57
cool and be played soothing music
14:00
to calm their nerves yeah wow it sounds
14:02
like the frogs get a pretty good deal
14:03
out of this
14:04
yeah you get to go to a nice competition
14:06
you get your own
14:07
green room and then you get someone
14:09
blowing on your genesis
14:12
i know what your ride is going to be on
14:13
the next
14:16
hairdryer is in the dressing room mr
14:18
murray
14:22
can i i really want to ask people
14:23
something that i have to have a mystery
14:25
this is basically the reason i brought
14:27
frogs right was because i went to the
14:28
countryside this weekend and i went on a
14:29
walk and noticed a dead frog
14:31
on the path i was on and then another
14:33
one and then
14:34
i was with this other person and we
14:36
counted the dead frogs and in the space
14:37
of about half a kilometer
14:39
we counted 59 dead frogs okay and not
14:42
all of them squashed they were all black
14:43
they look like they'd just been frozen
14:45
in time
14:46
kind of black frogs and i don't know why
14:49
and i've tried looking up why there
14:50
would suddenly be 59 dead frogs in the
14:52
countryside of oxfordshire
14:53
and if anyone has any idea what about if
14:55
it was one of those supposedly things
14:57
when it rains frogs
14:59
so if anyone has a better suggestion
15:01
okay so
15:02
there is this idea that sometimes it
15:05
rains frogs
15:05
yeah and the idea is that a water spout
15:08
is created by
15:09
like a mini tornado and it sucks it up
15:11
into the air
15:12
and then they rain down now a lot of
15:14
people think that they're not real
15:16
but what happens instead is it's been
15:18
raining
15:19
a pond kind of overflows all of the
15:21
frogs kind of go into the overflow bit
15:23
of the pond
15:24
and then it dries up because it gets
15:26
evaporated and then they all
15:28
have no water so they all die okay so it
15:31
could have been that
15:32
was it near water we looked for water we
15:34
think it must have been no water because
15:35
the dog disappeared and it came back wet
15:38
yes
15:45
i love that that's your method of
15:46
designing for water is is the dog wet
15:50
and we must keep moving then
15:59
okay it is time for fact number two and
16:02
that is
16:02
james okay my fact this week is that
16:05
according to venezuelan law
16:07
ninety percent of wheat must be made
16:09
into loaves of bread
16:10
rather than cakes or pastries it's very
16:13
harsh
16:14
why well this is what they're calling
16:16
the bread war
16:18
in venezuela at the moment and they're
16:19
obviously having a lot of financial
16:21
problems uh
16:22
and the what the government don't want
16:24
uh bakers to do
16:26
is to waste flour on cakes and things
16:28
like that they want to make sure that
16:29
they have enough bread for all of the
16:30
people
16:32
and they're they're probably arresting
16:33
people aren't they yeah like for making
16:35
brownies and stuff like that as well
16:37
it's not just yeah yeah but this is like
16:40
the history really of
16:41
how important bakers have been you know
16:44
all the way through
16:45
history um bakers have been one of the
16:47
most important people
16:48
in society if they do anything wrong
16:51
they'll get punished a lot more than
16:53
normal people
16:53
it seemed like such a high risk job
16:55
looking into
16:56
history and sort of recorded statements
16:58
about if you mess with the weight of
17:00
your bread if you mis-sell
17:01
your bread you will be killed like that
17:04
it's as harsh as you'll be killed or
17:06
you'll be paraded through the towns
17:08
get this there was a thing where so in
17:10
france
17:11
if you were found guilty of swindling
17:12
customers you would be imprisoned
17:13
immediately and your shop would be
17:15
walled up
17:16
for two years which is pretty serious
17:19
or sometimes the they would have all
17:22
your crimes printed on a massive sheet
17:24
of paper and they would make you wear a
17:25
sandwich board
17:26
through the streets it's quite cool it's
17:29
a sandwich board
17:30
exactly yeah i don't think they called
17:31
it a sandwich board at the time but and
17:32
sometimes this is from a book about
17:34
the uh the history of it the police just
17:36
looked the other way and let angry
17:38
customers often women beat the bakers up
17:41
whoa yeah there was a lot in britain
17:44
until
17:45
2008 that you couldn't sell a 600 gram
17:48
loaf of bread
17:50
the law was that you had to sell it in
17:52
400 grams
17:54
or 800 grams or 1200 grams it had to be
17:56
a multiple of 400.
17:58
really that was a law that was from the
18:00
size of bread and ale
18:02
in 1266 wow and it was still going until
18:05
2008
18:06
when they made it legal to sell a 600
18:08
grand
18:09
most loaves are still 400 or 800 grams
18:11
aren't they yeah yeah
18:12
so even now it's still happening well
18:14
yeah that's just a leftover from the
18:16
olden days
18:17
yeah is it a myth that this is where
18:18
bakers doesn't comes from
18:20
so it's the idea is that um because
18:22
bakers was so afraid of being punished
18:24
for underselling to customers they would
18:26
always
18:26
give them a little bit more than they'd
18:29
ordered wasn't it
18:30
that stopped and i think that's i think
18:32
it's been written in various places
18:34
that's where vegas doesn't come from
18:35
i've never seen anyone asserting that it
18:37
was a myth
18:38
okay and it's the kind of thing that i
18:39
would have seen i think yeah i think it
18:41
maybe it is true
18:42
yeah i don't know if right if it's not
18:44
true if you know about that then
18:46
keep it to yourself there was a
18:50
paranoia in the 18th century that bakers
18:52
would steal human bones and ashes and
18:55
they would use the bowdash to increase
18:56
the weight of their flour
18:58
this is not true there's no evidence
18:59
that ever happened but people really
19:01
hated bakers
19:02
and as a result uh well not as a result
19:04
but just in general bakers had to carve
19:05
their initials
19:06
into the underside of every loaf of
19:08
bread they made really oh wow
19:10
yeah to sort of show this was made by
19:12
fred the baker and it's the appropriate
19:14
ftp it's the appropriate weight
19:17
so in 2009 um venezuela
19:21
banned video games where you shoot
19:23
people did that
19:24
yeah because there was so much shooting
19:26
going on that they thought that this is
19:27
just
19:28
not a good influence so they actually
19:29
took a stand and completely banned it
19:32
but anyway one other thing that they
19:33
almost banned quite recently it's
19:35
because they went through an energy
19:36
crisis
19:37
um the president did come out and say he
19:40
urged all women to stop using hair
19:41
dryers
19:42
because that was using up too much
19:44
energy he thought hair dryers
19:46
specifically
19:47
were causing huge shortages were people
19:49
using them to
19:50
blow on the genitals of frogs and
19:52
jumping competitions
19:55
he said i think a woman this was his
19:57
justification for why they should stop
19:59
i think a woman looks better when she
20:01
runs her fingers through her hair and
20:02
lets it dry naturally
20:04
but yeah they tried to stop hair dryers
20:06
in venezuela as well venezuela has the
20:08
world's largest oil reserves
20:10
does it really yeah saudi arabia in
20:14
2010.
20:15
that's amazing the first documented
20:17
shipment of petroleum from venezuela was
20:20
in 1539 when a single barrel of oil was
20:23
sent to spain
20:24
to alleviate the gout of emperor charles
20:27
the fifth
20:28
wow this oil stuff is great can you send
20:30
another
20:31
million barrels please
20:36
the first bread maker was horse powered
20:39
that i could find
20:41
so the person was the baker was horse
20:43
powered
20:44
yes she was no it's a dough mixer it's a
20:47
mechanical dough mixer that was
20:49
referenced in 150 bc and it was invented
20:52
actually by a freed slave
20:54
and it was this massive basin and it had
20:57
wooden paddles in it that would mix the
20:58
dough around
20:59
and horses were attached to them so they
21:01
just go round and round and mix up the
21:03
dough
21:03
wow quite cool first bread was horse
21:05
drawn yeah
21:06
just one more thing about venezuela yeah
21:08
do you know what it means the name
21:09
venezuela
21:11
it means little venice oh i did know in
21:14
spite of the fact this is almost
21:15
completely unlike the north london area
21:16
known as little venice
21:18
it's not even like venice either really
21:21
no but they will have named it when they
21:22
arrived at
21:23
the gulf of maracaib or whatever it's
21:26
called yeah exactly lake maracaibo yeah
21:29
and just thought there's water here
21:31
there's water in venice the dog's wet
21:35
uh that's exactly right though it was
21:37
amerigo vespucci yeah who is america
21:39
named after him or do we think it's not
21:41
well qi thinks it's not i think it is i
21:44
think it is
21:45
okay but when he got there whatever the
21:47
rights and wrongs of that particular
21:48
story
21:49
uh he saw indigenous stilt houses which
21:51
were designed to avoid floods
21:52
and a guy in a gondola yeah
21:55
a cornetto is that what they have yeah
21:58
so he said this is just like venice
22:07
okay it is time for fact number three
22:09
and that is
22:10
chozinski my fact this week is that gchq
22:13
has an internal ghost hunting club so
22:16
cool
22:17
internal ghost hunting uh it's not
22:20
looking for
22:21
internal ghosts find your inner ghost
22:23
wait is it the
22:24
the first group of spooks to be found
22:26
looking for ghosts
22:30
no it's not that either um this is so
22:33
this came out a couple of years ago it's
22:35
came out in 2013 actually it was the
22:36
wikileaks leak of lots of gchq
22:38
correspondence a lot of which was very
22:40
important
22:42
and then there was this which was just
22:44
an exchange of emails that confirmed
22:45
it's got a ghost hunting group
22:47
and it arranges trips to kind of haunted
22:49
houses it's advertised to staff and
22:51
partners
22:52
whether they are skeptics or believers
22:55
and yes for visits to reputedly haunted
22:57
properties
22:58
that sounds good how they spend their
22:59
spare time yeah that so that was a
23:01
part of a edward snowden leak that was
23:04
the big edward snowden leak
23:06
and um it was that it was one bit of it
23:08
wasn't it where it kind of showed the
23:10
inside social life
23:11
of the people who work at gchq because
23:14
it goes beyond just having a ghost
23:16
um hunting club it would be weird if
23:18
that was the only social life
23:28
[Laughter]
23:30
yeah apparently they have their own in
23:32
sort of internal
23:34
social media platform which is uh called
23:38
a pun on myspace spy space it's good
23:40
that you clarified what that was a pun
23:42
otherwise we wouldn't have got it
23:45
they should call it facebook what's that
23:47
uh parody
23:52
um so they have a good social secretary
23:54
uh
23:55
in gchq and it sounds like they have a
23:57
really fun time
23:58
so uh there was another bit of
24:00
correspondence that was leaked about the
24:02
football tournament they have a sports
24:03
day every year and the main event is a
24:05
football tournament
24:06
in which every team has to have one lady
24:08
player at all times
24:10
but i thought saying lady player sounds
24:12
like a weirdly old-fashioned
24:14
term it also sounds like a bloke who
24:16
sleeps around oh i guess i'm a bit of a
24:18
lady player
24:20
yeah maybe that's what it was asking for
24:23
yes it was amazing though they sport the
24:26
football tournament they had in which
24:27
that rule was
24:28
issued came with a six-page rule book it
24:31
said the wearing of shin pads is
24:32
caps lock on compulsory caps lock off
24:35
there were there were a lot of capitals
24:36
in the correspondence and it made me
24:38
think they're a bit trumpy in the way
24:39
they communicate in gchq they need to
24:41
chill
24:41
out a little bit do you think maybe gchq
24:44
um learned
24:45
the art of shouting in capitals from
24:47
trump when they were wiretapping
24:48
oh yeah good point and if you're
24:50
listening in guys and we know you are
24:53
naughty i can't believe you're
24:54
wiretapping trump i think it's been put
24:56
there from the beginning because if you
24:58
look at it you'll notice gchq was
24:59
written completely in capitals
25:01
every single time yeah so they sometimes
25:04
do little things to engage with the
25:05
public obviously they're
25:06
very very secretive but they had this
25:08
christmas card puzzle last year which
25:10
you may remember yes
25:11
uh so six hundred thousand people tried
25:14
at least the opening stage which is
25:15
amazing that's one percent of everyone
25:17
in the country
25:18
um nobody got it in the time allocated
25:21
three people got close and they each won
25:23
a paperweight
25:26
what was the actual prize if you got it
25:27
all i don't know you became a spy
25:30
i believe so yeah you reckon they tell
25:31
us if the person got it and was become a
25:34
spy
25:34
that's not gonna put his picture on the
25:35
front cover of a newspaper maybe
25:37
hundreds of people got it they've all
25:38
become spies
25:39
yeah you're right that is so i just
25:42
can't believe that if you're in the top
25:44
three
25:44
of 600 000 people they're just giving
25:47
you one paperweight
25:48
that must be a code for something yeah
25:51
exactly it must be an
25:52
extra bit of puzzle on the bottom of the
25:54
paperweight it says midnight tower
25:56
bridge
25:56
yeah yes leave your family behind
26:00
we're going ghost hunting
26:01
[Laughter]
26:03
i went on the gchq website um and they
26:06
have some faqs there
26:07
oh yeah faq does gchq have rabbits
26:12
running around the garden in the middle
26:13
of the building
26:15
uh answer sadly no we don't have rabbits
26:18
in our garden the only wildlife we have
26:20
here are ladybirds sparrows and pigeons
26:23
why would they i think they're ducking
26:24
the big questions about
26:26
their role in working with the nsa you
26:29
might be right about that or i might
26:30
have deliberately chosen the most
26:32
visible of all the questions
26:34
or maybe it's a bit of both yeah do they
26:37
have any moles
26:38
very good yes very good very good well
26:41
there is a question
26:42
do you have a network of underground
26:44
tunnels beneath cheltenham
26:45
so staff can move around the town
26:47
without getting stuck in traffic
26:49
yes and and have all their ferret racing
26:52
uh tournaments in privacy
26:55
it sounds like maybe it was a ferret
26:56
asking about the rabbits actually
27:00
maybe faq's is ferrets
27:06
what is the um so i know that gchq
27:09
is involved in code cracking and
27:12
deciphering and stuff
27:14
are they the sort of digital security
27:16
for the uk
27:17
it's eavesdropping basically i think
27:19
it's essentially our eavesdropping
27:21
agency so it's tapping into people's
27:22
phones it's hacking into people's
27:24
computers
27:24
okay kind of thing but predominantly
27:26
office based
27:28
as opposed to in the field yes so i
27:30
actually read an interview with a woman
27:32
called annie mcmahon i'm not sure if
27:34
that's how you pronounce her name but
27:35
she worked at mi5 and she was describing
27:37
the difference between mi5 mi6 and gchq
27:40
staff
27:40
and she said gchq staff tend to be the
27:42
boffins the types that are technically
27:44
brilliant at things like coding and
27:45
encryption
27:46
but perhaps not brilliant at a party
27:48
okay
27:49
that's their vibe another edward snowden
27:51
leak was
27:52
um it was a list of um gchq techniques
27:56
and their um code names yeah i don't
27:59
know if
27:59
any of you saw that some quite good
28:01
names um the ones which the newspaper
28:03
article picked up on were concrete
28:05
donkey
28:06
angry pirate and swamp donkey
28:09
and then a few others i found a nut
28:11
allergy
28:12
country file dirty devil clumsy
28:16
beekeeper
28:17
and piss tricks wow is that the donald
28:21
trump related
28:24
hacking wiretapping operation
28:25
[Laughter]
28:27
they were all so technical i couldn't
28:29
really understand what they meant
28:30
okay i met a um uh years ago i made a
28:33
ufo documentary remember that back in
28:35
2014
28:36
and i went around meeting a lot of
28:38
people who both believe in ufos but i
28:39
met one guy as well
28:41
called mark pilkington who made a
28:42
documentary about
28:44
the idea that the governments are
28:47
seeding
28:48
uh disinformation into the field of
28:51
ufology and things generally so
28:53
they're kind of creating um distractions
28:57
right and part of the leaks from the
28:59
snowden leak
29:00
was a powerpoint that showed members who
29:03
worked at jchq
29:05
how to spread disinformation it was a
29:07
whole thing
29:08
uh really interesting so do we think
29:10
this whole ghost hunting malarkey is
29:12
just a bit of a
29:13
red herring to throw us off the center
29:15
the fact that they're hacking into all
29:16
of our secrets
29:17
maybe they're going oh i believe that
29:19
the russian embassy is haunted let's go
29:21
and see if we can find something
29:24
oh i think your laptop is
29:29
look the mouse is moving all by itself
29:34
so um outside the front of gchq uh there
29:37
are these things called the listening
29:38
stones have you guys heard of this
29:40
an artist created them there's these
29:42
giant there's nine of these stones and
29:43
they're carved with codes
29:45
and some of them have just odd headlines
29:48
so the theory
29:49
is that the stones are um
29:52
using a very old theory about what
29:54
ghosts were
29:55
which is have you heard of the stone
29:56
tape theory no
29:58
no stone tape theory this was put out in
30:00
the
30:02
1960s i believe um
30:04
the idea is that this person thought
30:07
that when you
30:08
exude energy energy can latch onto
30:10
things in life
30:11
and so the idea is that ghosts are
30:14
merely a sort of
30:15
audio recording as it were not the
30:16
spirit of someone that's hanging around
30:18
is dead but it's it's sort of leftover
30:20
energy like if you're getting murdered
30:22
you exude a lot of energy and it traps
30:24
it there
30:25
and so the idea is that the listening
30:27
stones
30:28
are there to trap human uh conversations
30:31
that they can later listen to
30:33
gghq is spending all of our taxpayers
30:36
money
30:36
just eavesdropping on these stones
30:38
outside the building
30:39
yeah and we're very disappointed is that
30:41
what they're doing they think that dead
30:43
people have trapped their voices inside
30:45
these stones and that's how they're
30:46
trying to
30:47
the blog the blog societyx believes so
30:50
yeah they should go back to doing their
30:51
proper job tapping donald trump's emails
30:54
for barack obama
31:03
okay it's time for our final fact of the
31:05
show and that is my fact
31:07
my fact this week is that there are now
31:09
washing machines in
31:10
india that have a button specifically
31:13
for curry stains
31:15
is it really a button just says curry
31:17
yeah well i saw a picture on the bbc
31:19
website and i don't know if they mocked
31:20
it up as a sort of joke picture
31:22
but um there's one extra button uh which
31:25
is a setting obviously this is a
31:26
panasonic it's a digital
31:28
interface kind of thing but it says
31:30
curry and then it says
31:31
oil as well um there is one for it's an
31:34
extra setting for hair oils yes
31:36
yeah yeah so basically what they've what
31:38
they've realized is obviously the main
31:41
staple of food in india is curry and the
31:44
way that it breaks down in a washing
31:45
machine
31:46
isn't that good predominantly that's the
31:48
main stain that you're getting as well
31:50
so they wanted to deal with that
31:51
so panasonic has spent two years
31:53
analyzing
31:54
the ingredients of curry they've been
31:56
studying water temperatures and so on
31:58
and they've now
31:59
worked out a way that removes the stains
32:01
properly but not many people have
32:02
washing machines in india
32:04
it's only about 10 of the population so
32:06
it's a
32:07
it's a sort of just an innovation that i
32:10
mean i guess 10 of a billion still a lot
32:12
but
32:13
i just quite like the niche sort of yeah
32:15
the dealing of niche
32:16
uh stains they worked out sort of the
32:20
optimal
32:21
current strength of the water and the
32:23
optimum you know the washing time
32:25
it just sounds like a very intense
32:27
washing cycle
32:28
you know when you go to different
32:30
settings on your washing machine it
32:31
claims this is for cotton this is the
32:32
special weave this is for
32:34
and actually isn't it just that the time
32:36
goes up and up and up
32:37
temperature and and yeah time and
32:39
temperature go up and up and up and
32:41
maybe it's absolutely been i think it
32:42
might be the spin speed
32:44
too possibly but they're not are they
32:45
adding in any special ingredient do we
32:47
think they suddenly inject in some kind
32:49
of acid as soon as you click curry if
32:51
you get a red curry on your clothes you
32:52
have to wash it out with white curry
32:54
immediately
32:56
um it's very cool will we get are they
32:58
going to do a british one
32:59
for what fish and chips
33:05
yeah i don't know i don't know what they
33:07
would do for us
33:08
it would
33:14
they have though panasonic it's not the
33:16
only sort of
33:17
laundry uh product that they've been
33:19
looking into
33:20
they've funded 10 of this new product
33:23
which some people
33:24
have dubbed uh a lon laundroid and
33:27
it is a machine that folds your clothes
33:29
for you
33:30
so the company that have sort of talked
33:33
about this and invented this
33:35
say that they've worked out that the
33:36
average person spends nine thousand
33:38
hours of their life
33:39
folding clothes i well i bring the
33:42
average really really far down
33:44
yeah i don't fold any of my quilts i do
33:46
bring it
33:47
quite far up again because i hold my
33:49
clothes very neatly so
33:52
andy as someone who does it a lot you
33:54
were wasting according to them 375 days
33:57
of your life i don't think of it as
33:58
wasting time
33:59
i think i have a better life as a result
34:02
and i think with those
34:03
i wouldn't know what to do with that
34:04
extra time frankly what am i going to do
34:06
on a beach somewhere no thanks i'll be
34:08
folding i'll be in the folding room
34:11
at a beach with unfolded clothes
34:14
so they this machine it's been launched
34:16
and you can see a video it's ridiculous
34:18
and you have to put in one shirt at a
34:19
time
34:20
so far as i could see you put it in it
34:22
closes its doors like an oven
34:24
and then after 10 minutes it's folded
34:27
your shirt
34:28
10 minutes i don't like to boast
34:33
but i've managed to get it down to
34:35
something a little more like seven
34:38
um so what was the company that
34:41
panasonic panasonic did this yeah
34:43
so i think we should um give a little
34:44
bit of balance uh samsung
34:47
yep have got some good innovations in
34:49
washing machines at the moment
34:51
some of the more recent innovations i'm
34:53
not quite sure what all these are but um
34:55
the latest models have got eco bubble
34:58
whatever that is
34:59
wobble technology i don't know what that
35:02
is
35:02
and a magic dispenser that
35:06
is another nickname for the penis
35:08
actually
35:10
yeah i don't want that magic dispenser
35:12
setting anywhere near my clothes that is
35:16
magic dispenser and that's a lot of
35:17
models in samsung have got magic
35:19
dispensers at the moment
35:20
i mean they also have an explosion
35:22
setting at the moment don't they yeah
35:24
it was samsung machines
35:28
i don't think it was an actual setting
35:29
on it but yeah it's uh
35:31
they they like their phones they were
35:33
exploding and so they had to recall a
35:35
lot of washington
35:36
i think it's one of the largest ever
35:37
product recalls in history i think it
35:38
was something like 2.8 million
35:40
yeah washing machines and that is a lot
35:42
that's a lot if if
35:43
if you're wandering at home that is a
35:45
lot of washing machines how many was it
35:47
2.8 million i think oh that's a lot yes
35:50
and they're still actually i read a news
35:52
report about that this morning they are
35:53
still
35:54
hunting for 5 000 in western australia
36:04
yeah my washing machine escaped the
36:05
other day
36:07
genuinely it's it sits behind
36:10
a covered door so you know you pull over
36:12
the cupboard door the washing machine's
36:13
behind it and i put a wash on
36:14
and i came out and i had thrust the door
36:16
open and it was poking about four inches
36:18
out of it good job you got there in time
36:21
to wrangle it back could have been
36:23
rampaging across london as we speak
36:26
i try to find a scientific report on uh
36:29
you know it's that trope you see that
36:31
women sit on washing machines
36:33
because it leads to orgasm because
36:35
they've heard about the magic dispenser
36:37
yeah exactly yeah but um no i couldn't
36:39
find anything
36:40
uh except a lot of videos of women doing
36:43
it which i didn't watch
36:44
i was i was folding at that time no
36:46
that's what the video was
36:47
i guess i had to watch a few to make
36:49
sure that that line was correct
36:51
um well other naughty things you can do
36:53
with washing machines
36:54
yeah keep cocaine in them okay so uh a
36:58
policeman in yorkshire has just been
36:59
found guilty of a range of drug offenses
37:01
but one of the things was he was taking
37:03
drugs that the police had seized and
37:05
then selling it back onto the streets oh
37:06
yeah he found out about this
37:08
uh so he's just been found guilty hasn't
37:09
been sentenced yet and he was found to
37:11
be keeping 11 kilos of cocaine in his
37:14
washing machine
37:15
was he like because it's a white powder
37:17
and then you've got white powder going
37:19
into your washing machine so was he
37:20
pretending it was perfect because
37:22
all the detergents come out of the
37:24
plastic bags the detergent comes in
37:25
again
37:26
well the prosecution lawyer opened the
37:28
case by asking the jury
37:30
what do you keep in your washing machine
37:32
keith boots had over 11 kilograms of
37:34
cocaine worth hundreds of thousands of
37:36
pounds on the street in his
37:38
i found my cocoa pops in my washing
37:40
machine the other day
37:42
and vanilla put them in there because
37:43
our house we were selling our flat at
37:45
the moment
37:46
she thought they'd go through the
37:47
cupboards and they would be put off by
37:49
seeing a box of cocoa puffs
37:52
the cocoa popped out and she put it in
37:54
the washing machine but she didn't tell
37:55
me so when i went to put the washing in
37:56
the washing machine my box of cocoa pops
37:58
are sitting inside was it that she
37:59
thought they'd be put off by
38:00
particularly dirty cocoa pops and they
38:02
needed
38:05
my first question actually on viewing
38:07
any property is are there any coco pops
38:09
on the premises
38:11
i think i think it was partially that we
38:12
didn't have space in the cupboard for it
38:14
and she didn't want it out on display
38:15
i think your wife is embarrassed that
38:17
you eat coconut breakfast
38:20
do you keep finding the cocoa pops yeah
38:25
yeah i should put my crunchy nut in the
38:27
dishwasher
38:29
yeah it's it's like a bloody treasure
38:31
hunt in my house for breakfast in the
38:33
mornings
38:34
have you guys heard of ricky maisel yeah
38:37
ricky ricky mais
38:38
ricky mate i love him no who is that
38:40
who's he rookie maisel says he's the
38:42
world leader in
38:43
escaping washing machines right so he
38:45
climbs into a washing machine or dan's
38:47
wife throws him into the washing machine
38:49
because there's someone coming around
38:51
well he's got something to eat in there
38:55
you have to go after you've had an
38:56
argument did you have to sleep in the
38:57
washing machine i'll be in the machine
39:03
so ricky gets into these machines or
39:05
vanilla puts him in there
39:06
and as long as they're machines with at
39:09
least a 14-inch door and a 27-inch drum
39:11
apparently
39:12
and he boasts that i have successfully
39:14
escaped from 40 brands of washing
39:16
machines in 42 countries
39:18
wow watch a video i've watched three and
39:21
um
39:22
that's why you and dan were both sitting
39:23
there watching washing machine videos
39:25
of women sitting on the view of this
39:27
bloke climbing out of them
39:29
he climbs in and the way it happens is
39:31
it gets he climbs in and it's very small
39:33
it's impressive and it gets turned on
39:34
and he starts spinning
39:35
round and round yeah it gets turned on
39:37
and the soap starts pouring
39:40
it starts filling up and then after a
39:42
certain amount of time
39:43
he starts banging really really hard on
39:47
the window
39:48
and the assistant has to stop it and let
39:50
him know what is that
39:51
and that happens in all three videos i
39:53
think that technically is an escape yeah
39:56
it's like when houdini's wife just lets
39:58
him out of the handcuffs
40:01
so i would think very much don't try
40:03
this at home
40:05
yeah also i'm starting a question ricky
40:07
i don't know
40:08
well yeah i thought the claim to be a
40:09
washing machine escapist was a strong
40:11
one given that what you do is
40:12
scream out for help and the person has
40:14
to open the machine
40:17
um i read a website saying that the
40:19
first modern
40:20
washing machine was invented in 1899 and
40:22
i don't think it's true
40:24
but when i was searching to see if it
40:25
was true i found a movie from 1899
40:28
called
40:29
scrubham's washing machine and i can't
40:32
find the video of it so i'm not sure if
40:34
it even exists because it's so old
40:36
but there is a review from 1902 and it
40:38
was two girls in a hotel laundry or
40:40
experimenting with a new washing machine
40:42
i've seen that video they turn the
40:45
handle the wrong way and the machine
40:47
explodes
40:48
drenching them with suds and wrecking
40:50
the place generally the scene is very
40:52
humorous
40:53
and exciting sounds good sounds great so
40:56
then i went onto imdb
40:58
and search for washing machine and it's
41:01
really weird
41:01
there's hardly any movies called the
41:04
washing machine
41:05
right most of cinematic history and then
41:07
there was one
41:08
in the 90s or something and then in 2010
41:12
there was a movie called the washing
41:13
machine in 2012 there was a movie called
41:15
the washing machine
41:16
and in 2014 there was also a movie
41:18
called the washing machine and they're
41:20
all different movies
41:21
wow so not not reboots not reboots
41:24
completely different
41:25
synopsis are completely different wow
41:28
what
41:28
uh and also there is an actor called
41:31
george washington he's known
41:34
for a country practice 1981 and a place
41:37
to call home from 2013.
41:39
is it one nicest way i would say he is
41:41
not known for those
41:44
in a very nice way i think he is more
41:45
known for being called jordan washing
41:47
machine
41:49
is that double barrel surname or one no
41:51
one word it could
41:52
i mean unless it's some kind of
41:54
autocorrect in imdb or something and
41:56
it's supposed to be george washington
41:57
but
41:57
maybe he was called george who was
41:59
famously known for his
42:01
cameo roles and whatever it is to come
42:04
out
42:04
autocorrect is bad i don't think it's
42:06
that bad that it corrects washington
42:09
a word and a name so my other thought is
42:12
maybe he's called george washington
42:13
and there's another one a famous one so
42:15
he had to change his name
42:17
and this was the first thing he thought
42:20
he's standing in the utility room
42:22
looking at looking around on the phone
42:25
washington's taken george
42:30
um i was reading that in australia um
42:32
researchers
42:33
are on the brink of making a new
42:36
innovation which is clothes that wash
42:38
themselves
42:40
oh yeah so it's quite interesting it's
42:43
it's all about
42:44
um the fabric that they're using and the
42:47
uh what they're harnessing is sunlight
42:49
the idea that as soon as sun touches the
42:51
fabric
42:52
it burns off um whatever organic matter
42:56
is on top of the the fabric itself so it
42:58
says to grow
42:59
special nano structures which can
43:01
degrade organic matter when exposed to
43:03
light
43:04
hang on when i when i'm on the beach in
43:06
the sun
43:07
in my stained clothes uh nowhere near
43:10
andy's folding in the hotel
43:13
um the stains don't disappear
43:16
as i expose myself with the sunshine but
43:19
because you're not wearing the new
43:20
technology you don't have the nano
43:21
structures
43:22
oh so you need the so they're harnessing
43:23
sunlight in a specific way yeah it's
43:25
like you can
43:26
flash sunlight yeah they're in there
43:28
they're inventing
43:29
this thing right yeah okay great i was
43:32
reading a paper about
43:33
the history of the washing machine and
43:34
it's written by a really angry man
43:36
who opened his paper by saying the
43:38
entire history of washing machines is
43:40
one of the most ignored and most
43:41
misrepresented segments of the history
43:43
of technology
43:44
and the whole thing is a diatribe
43:45
against all other washing machine
43:47
historians who keep on
43:49
misquoting these first washing machine
43:51
patents
43:52
he's really upset but i did find in the
43:54
course of that the patent for the travel
43:55
washing machine
43:56
have you guys seen this no no this was
43:59
in 1952
44:00
and they actually trialled this and the
44:01
idea was that people were getting into
44:03
going out in campervans and
44:05
they wanted to be able to wash their
44:06
clothes on the road and it was a washing
44:08
machine where you affixed the drum to
44:10
the wheel of your car to the back wheel
44:12
and as you drove it spun around yeah
44:16
mr mazel was killed after getting into
44:18
the wrong washing machine
44:27
okay that's it that's all of our facts
44:28

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:59
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:02
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:03
covent garden
01:05
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:06
here with james harkin
01:08
anna chazinski and andrew hunter murray
01:10
and once again we have gathered around
01:12
the microphones with our four
01:13
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:16
and in no particular order
01:17
here we go starting with you james
01:21
okay my fact this week is that in 1966
01:23
the chinese press reported that a 73
01:26
year old chairman mao
01:28
had swum 15 kilometers of the yangtze
01:31
river in 65 minutes
01:33
that's twice the speed that michael
01:35
phelps has ever swung
01:38
75. imagine what he could do at 40. 73.
01:42
73 it's amazing that you're given a
01:44
number and you just remember a different
01:46
number
01:47
no i confused it with 65 minutes got it
01:49
so i took the seventh
01:50
from the year when i took the
01:54
73 kilometers in 15 minutes that doesn't
01:57
sound cool
01:58
no he slammed 1966 kilometers
02:02
and 65 seconds okay can you say the
02:05
numbers again
02:06
yes um year 1966 age 73
02:10
distance 15 kilometers and time 65
02:13
minutes
02:13
and the thing is i've read about this
02:15
and it's possible
02:17
that he might have been carried along by
02:19
some very very strong currents
02:21
right but then i wonder if that's really
02:24
swimming
02:24
it's not it's because it could be
02:25
floating but he had um floating
02:27
bodyguards with him
02:29
yeah he did and huge portraits of
02:31
himself
02:32
so there's a picture of him floating
02:34
along with these six bodyguards around
02:35
him and then these like giant pictures
02:37
of chairman mao floating alongside him
02:39
and in front of him but wait when you
02:40
say they were floating bodyguards
02:42
what were they were they they were
02:43
swimming too and they managed to keep up
02:45
with the fastest swimmer
02:47
maybe that's why there were six they
02:49
were positioned strategically
02:51
further up and off the river an
02:52
improvement to olympic swimming would be
02:55
to have a giant raft with the swimmer's
02:57
face on it going behind it
03:00
because often when they're in the water
03:01
you don't know who it is but if there's
03:03
a massive raft with michael phelps's
03:05
face going behind him yeah that's great
03:07
it's interesting he spent so much time
03:09
in a body of water because he never
03:10
bathed
03:11
chairman mao in order to wash himself he
03:14
would have
03:14
servants wipe him up and down with
03:16
towels
03:18
yeah yeah so just wet towels in fact and
03:20
this is a bit early in the podcast we're
03:21
going into this territory but he claimed
03:23
to like to wash his body
03:25
in the body of his women that was his in
03:28
the body
03:29
wash his body in the body of his women
03:31
yes i think what that's saying is
03:32
he liked to have sex with a lot of women
03:34
and he thought that that was enough of a
03:37
cleaning process
03:38
it really wasn't though was it no no i
03:40
had to wipe them off with towels
03:41
afterwards
03:42
i had to go for that really long swim to
03:44
really get it off
03:45
well he is the most polluted river in
03:47
the world isn't it it's unbelievably
03:48
dirty
03:49
so i suppose it suited him well i think
03:51
i think it's got rivals
03:53
maybe it was completely clean before he
03:55
got in
03:58
uh mao used to suffer from very bad
04:01
constipation
04:02
um and apparently if he actually managed
04:05
to get a bowel movement out
04:06
it was like a cause of celebration
04:08
amongst the staff it was seen as a
04:10
as a great i wouldn't be celebrating if
04:11
i was the tall guy
04:17
that's true that's true uh he uh
04:20
he yeah he used to have two to three
04:21
enemas a day
04:24
maybe when he was saying i'm surrounded
04:26
by enemies he was actually saying
04:28
i'm surrounded by animals and the whole
04:29
cultural revolution was a big mistake
04:33
um so there's a lot of work for mao
04:35
lookalikes at the moment
04:36
[Laughter]
04:37
because in chinese television there's a
04:40
lot of things you're not allowed to do
04:42
if you want to write a screenplay i
04:44
think we might have said before you're
04:45
not allowed time travel
04:46
and you're not really allowed wordplay
04:48
and puns and stuff like that they have a
04:49
lot of things you're not allowed to do
04:51
but one thing you are allowed to do is
04:52
historical dramas
04:54
and so basically if you're a talented
04:56
screenwriter in
04:57
china you just write historical dramas
04:59
and usually about mao because he's like
05:01
the most famous
05:02
historical figure and so 44 of all
05:05
chinese shows produced in 2013 were
05:08
historical dramas wow
05:10
you say that i would be surprised if
05:11
that's the same on the bbc
05:16
that's just what you watch um yeah and
05:19
so because a lot of these have mao in
05:21
them there's a lot of work if you're a
05:22
male look alike it's it's one of the
05:24
best jobs you can have
05:25
wow remember there's that chinese guy
05:27
who's an obama look-alike
05:29
is he yeah so he and he gets a lot of
05:31
work in in um
05:32
tv shows and stuff is he is he chinese
05:35
yeah he's chinese but he just he just
05:37
looks a lot like
05:38
obama and he gets hired out as obama
05:41
exactly like obama well he's a look
05:43
alike
05:45
he's looking alive just on crazy claims
05:49
made by dictators
05:50
oh yeah in 2006 a north korean
05:52
publication uh called nadong simon
05:54
reported that kim jong-il had mastered
05:56
the art of teleporting
05:57
and that he could move so quickly that
05:59
american satellites could not track him
06:03
hey have we ever mentioned the
06:04
ex-president of turkmenistan
06:06
almost certainly what i feel like we
06:07
must have
06:09
yeah yeah he's just he was one of those
06:12
characters as well
06:13
claimed crazy things did crazy things um
06:15
he changed the names of the days and the
06:17
months
06:18
uh in the country to the names of his
06:20
family members
06:22
didn't he name bread after his mother
06:23
was that him he renamed bread
06:25
to his mother's name yeah very cool
06:28
on mao so a statue of chairman mao was
06:31
unveiled in 1993
06:33
and uh it was a really big deal it was
06:36
to commemorate him
06:37
it was the i think it was 120th
06:39
anniversary of his birth or something
06:41
okay does that make sense
06:42
um and it was in december so and it was
06:44
in the hunan province so it's cold and
06:46
dark and it's constant rain and sleet
06:48
and you can now if you go to china you
06:50
can buy photographs of
06:52
the moment where the sheet was pulled
06:53
off this giant statue
06:55
the six metre high bronze statue and at
06:57
the same time the sun
06:58
suddenly came out and the moon came out
07:00
and they both shone upon the statue at
07:02
the same time wow and if you go
07:04
i mean do you look very as if you're
07:06
believing it
07:07
i mean that's plausible isn't it it is
07:08
plausible i think it was just the
07:10
um fortuitousness of the event
07:14
i don't believe
07:23
no but it bears credence that this might
07:26
have been in that half
07:27
yeah i just think it sounds suspiciously
07:29
like a propaganda quote rather than i
07:31
think you guys are
07:32
and also it's very trusting no but also
07:34
this is what
07:35
last year or the year before i mean
07:36
china 1993
07:38
1993 okay sorry 25 years ago
07:42
regardless china has been scientifically
07:46
they would know basic things like when
07:48
the sun and the moon's gonna be out and
07:49
might time it
07:50
also don't forget the um trump um when
07:52
he was doing his inauguration speech and
07:55
the rain just mysteriously stopped
07:57
absolutely
07:57
yeah all started no he very clearly
08:01
remembered afterwards in a bit of sunny
08:02
day
08:04
so that's nice just quickly on mao he
08:07
initiated a campaign where you were
08:08
supposed to murder all the sparrows
08:10
it was called the four pest campaign he
08:13
started it in 1958 and the idea was to
08:15
exterminate mosquitoes flies rats and
08:17
sparrows
08:18
and it was really really successful so
08:20
lots of people went out there and were
08:22
supposed to form these kind of
08:23
people's armies to try and kill them it
08:24
was successful in the sense that it
08:26
achieved what it was supposed to achieve
08:28
and then it caused enormous problems
08:30
like these things do so for instance
08:32
the sparrows all being gone meant that
08:34
there was a plague of literal plague of
08:36
locus which now
08:37
weren't being scared off by the sparrows
08:39
and they all the crops and
08:40
had incredibly devastating consequences
08:43
where many you know
08:44
millions of people died and as far as
08:47
what it was trying to do was get rid of
08:48
pests
08:49
it didn't really work no it worked
08:51
doesn't it got rid of those pests but
08:53
it's just such a strong
08:54
lesson in how we definitely shouldn't be
08:56
just trying to randomly wipe out
08:58
something that's annoying us
08:59
yes also if you're on the side that's
09:01
telling you to go out and massacre the
09:03
sparrows
09:04
it feels like you know that you're not
09:05
on the right side don't you the others
09:08
are quite bad
09:08
rats mosquitoes sparrows are so adorable
09:12
they're like the epitome of a sweet
09:14
innocent
09:14
not when they're eating all of your
09:16
brain of course not right
09:17
the word sparrow and the image of a
09:19
little sparrow if someone's telling you
09:21
to trample it down but without
09:22
grain how can you make a loaf of the
09:24
president of turkmenistan's mother okay
09:36
it is time for fact number two and that
09:38
is andy my fact is that seahorses greet
09:40
their partners every day to make sure
09:42
they are still
09:43
alive top tip for all you couples out
09:46
there
09:47
what does that mean exactly uh because
09:49
you'd greet them anyway wouldn't you
09:52
every day i know their intentions well
09:54
if you're a seahorse you might not you
09:55
know
09:56
i don't know that's what i'm asking what
09:57
do they what do they how do we know
09:59
because most likely a seahorse is going
10:01
to say hi to another seahorse if they're
10:03
married
10:03
every day
10:07
in that sentence i'm completely with dan
10:10
he's honestly
10:11
you're joining the side of the lunatics
10:13
you're completely with that are you
10:15
so that the married seahorses young with
10:17
him on that bit are you what partners it
10:19
says
10:19
i've just jumped in with both feet and
10:21
i've decided
10:22
when married seahorses get up in the
10:24
morning obviously they greet each other
10:26
how do we know it's to make sure they're
10:28
still alive you're right what they do is
10:29
they do this courtship dance every day
10:31
before dawn
10:32
for a while which is for two different
10:35
reasons one is
10:36
to check that the other one is still
10:38
alive and the other is to also
10:40
synchronize their mating because you
10:42
know the male carries the
10:44
uh young in his pouch and then he sort
10:48
of
10:48
yeah he's pregnant that's that's the
10:49
thing uh that is we've you've just said
10:51
quite casually but is incredibly amazing
10:54
about seahorses the male carries the
10:55
child yeah um but
10:57
apparently the ritual that they do the
10:58
sort of ritual they move around and sing
11:00
is designed to synchronize their
11:01
movements so the male
11:02
uh will receive the eggs well when the
11:05
female deposits her eggs
11:07
in his pouch okay because otherwise they
11:09
will they won't dock properly
11:11
and just this keeping alive thing is it
11:13
really common for them to die in their
11:15
sleep
11:16
are they constantly dropping dead
11:18
overnight
11:19
i don't know is it so necessary i don't
11:21
know i don't know why it's so necessary
11:23
this is the case i looked into the
11:24
lifespan of seahorses and
11:26
in the wild between one and four years
11:28
in captivity
11:29
four years and they say they just almost
11:32
always make it to four years
11:34
they have a really consistent sort of
11:37
oldest age a seahorse gets to lifespan
11:39
that's interesting that's it so you know
11:41
basically when you're three years old
11:43
you know you've only got a year left
11:44
yeah that's good you can plan stuff
11:46
can't you like the pensions world is
11:48
very stable
11:51
because you know roughly how long you've
11:52
got yeah um i did not know that they
11:54
were fish
11:55
yes yes well i thought there was
11:57
something
11:58
did you think they were horses i didn't
12:00
think they were exactly
12:02
but you thought they were maybe like
12:03
mussels and and yeah i thought all like
12:05
a lobster isn't a fish you know
12:07
and the so they're called hippocampus
12:09
which means horse sea monster
12:11
and they eat super quick they have to
12:14
use in order to actually
12:15
see them eating food high-speed cameras
12:17
in order to catch it because they can
12:18
eat stuff in like six milliseconds
12:20
oh really they're sucking they suck it
12:22
in don't they yeah and also they kind of
12:24
flick their head
12:25
because they got this horse neck and
12:27
they catch the copper pods that they eat
12:29
about 94 of the time which the article i
12:32
read said
12:32
might be the most successful in nature
12:34
but we know that actually
12:37
uh dragonflies are slightly better than
12:39
that we think dragonflies are 95
12:42
but they're similar kind of but it very
12:44
much depends on the prey
12:45
it's like it's all context so you know a
12:48
lion will be terrible at catching a
12:49
copapod but a seahorse would be terrible
12:51
at catching
12:52
a zebra that's true and if i was to go
12:54
to mcdonald's and i wanted to get a big
12:55
mac
12:56
i would have a 100 success rate yeah so
12:59
we are the best hunters now i suppose if
13:02
we are calling that hunting
13:06
that's when james and i go to mcdonald's
13:07
we hunt for the burgers we sort of
13:09
tiptoe
13:10
up and make sure it doesn't see us
13:11
coming so the copapods which they hunt
13:14
this is the reason the sea horses have
13:15
to have to be so good at hunting is
13:16
because the copper pods can flee
13:17
unbelievably fast they can move at 500
13:20
body lengths a second
13:21
which is the equivalent of a human
13:23
swimming at 2 000 miles an hour
13:26
which is roughly as fast as chairman wow
13:30
and seahorses swim incredibly slow
13:32
there's one that's called the
13:34
lined seahorse if you put it into a
13:36
bathtub just your regular length bathtub
13:39
to swim that length would take five
13:41
minutes sea horse racing would be quite
13:42
a cool thing to watch though wouldn't it
13:44
yes
13:44
yeah you could paint a little like a
13:46
little ascot put little jockeys on top
13:48
and
13:48
tiny copper pod jockeys
13:53
would they have to jump over things in
13:54
the water would they be styles and
13:57
be hedges and things like that you think
13:59
you want the jockeys to be the things
14:01
that the seahorses are going to try and
14:02
eat no you're right
14:03
you want the copapod to be going around
14:05
like a hare in a greyhound race
14:06
exactly yeah it'd be amazing if in real
14:09
horse racing there was a chance that the
14:10
horse would eat the jockey
14:12
halfway through the race
14:18
[Laughter]
14:22
seahorse expert by the way yes we do
14:24
helen scales i know it too
14:26
i think we know it better we probably
14:28
introduced you to her once yeah you did
14:29
yeah yeah okay
14:31
i don't know her good
14:32
[Laughter]
14:34
well she's great she's written the book
14:36
called poseidon steed which is
14:37
unbelievably good yeah i have a feeling
14:39
most of stuff that i'm saying right now
14:41
is taken directly from her book
14:42
but it was stuff taken from her book by
14:45
james and put into a script which i've
14:47
then just lifted
14:48
um and uh i looked through the script by
14:50
the way so she was on our show museum of
14:52
curiosity as a guest about
14:53
six years ago seven years ago almost
14:56
even
14:57
this was the opening question we asked
14:58
her in the show oh dear helen as someone
15:01
who's spent the past 15 years learning
15:02
everything there is to know about fish
15:04
perhaps you can answer this for me is it
15:05
true that there is no such thing as a
15:07
fish oh did we
15:08
yeah that was our opinion what did she
15:10
say no that's rubbish
15:12
um in 2009 there was a woman in dorset
15:15
who found a seahorse on her
15:17
drive and she lived three miles in land
15:20
and it was alive how did it get there
15:24
well they think a seagull dropped it
15:28
right it was a really rare endangered
15:30
seahorse wow
15:32
it could be that thing you know that
15:33
riddle about um the man who's found on a
15:35
diving suit in the forest
15:37
it could be that someone was trying to
15:38
put out a fire in her house by scooping
15:40
up water from the sea
15:41
into a helicopter and then dropping it
15:43
onto her house
15:44
and they scooped up the seahorses yeah i
15:47
was thinking of that one where there's a
15:48
guy
15:49
found hanging in a room with a puddle of
15:51
water
15:52
so i was wondering if the seahorse was
15:54
trying to hang itself and he was stood
15:55
on an ice cube
15:56
yeah yeah or a man arrives
16:00
into town on a seahorse on thursday
16:03
and then leaves again friday it's called
16:05
friday the seahorse is called friday yes
16:08
i think it's that a seagull drops it not
16:10
sure
16:11
i just think that's amazing there's an
16:13
endangered animal a lot of them are
16:14
quite endangered i read
16:16
something i think it was on mother
16:17
nature network maybe saying that they
16:18
could be extinct within
16:20
about 30 years which seems radically uh
16:22
pessimistic
16:23
but because they're used so much in
16:25
asian medicine so
16:27
25 million sea horses a year are used in
16:30
traditional chinese medicine
16:32
or some actually the seahorse trust
16:33
claims that it's 150 million a year
16:36
so it's somewhere between those two
16:37
which is a lot because they're thought
16:38
to help impotence aren't they
16:40
yes in china yeah which kind of makes a
16:42
lot of sense now it doesn't stop saying
16:44
it makes sense yeah it doesn't make
16:45
sense
16:45
yeah you're killing them don't say that
16:47
the seahorse grinding doesn't make sense
16:49
it's a terrible idea
16:51
i can't see where culturally it happened
16:53
because as the only males that give
16:55
birth perhaps that has some connection
16:57
to the fact that men now think if they
16:58
eat ground up seahorse they'll
17:00
get fertile and start spewing out babies
17:03
i know it doesn't make
17:04
a lot of sense it doesn't make any sense
17:05
hannah no it doesn't
17:07
um scientists tested seahorse
17:09
relationships
17:10
uh about 10 years ago they did an
17:11
experiment where because everyone thinks
17:13
that they're monogamous and they wanted
17:14
to see
17:15
maybe they're not and so they put little
17:17
wire labels on them colored wire labels
17:19
and sort of match them up with their
17:20
partners
17:21
and then they asked the public to spy on
17:22
them to see if they were sleeping around
17:25
and the scientists one of the scientists
17:26
responsible for it said
17:28
when people hear that this might not be
17:29
true after all i.e
17:31
their monogamy their curiosity is
17:33
immediately aroused and they seem quite
17:34
happy to watch
17:35
for long periods to see if there's any
17:37
hanky-panky going on wow aroused so they
17:40
are an aphrodisiac
17:41
[Laughter]
17:44
sorry fish this week is sponsored by
17:45
ground-up seahorses
17:48
they found out that they flirted with
17:50
both sexes up to 25
17:52
times a day so it's hanky-panky all over
17:54
the shop oh yeah quite a lot
17:56
there's a lot going on every day every
17:58
day
18:00
so yeah it's a lot i mean that's a lot
18:01
wake up check your partners alive
18:06
well might as well do a bit of flirting
18:07
anyway and their flighting is pretty
18:09
intense isn't it their mating rituals
18:11
last for
18:12
days and days sometimes and the way they
18:14
mate is they like interlock their tails
18:16
and they just bob along together with
18:18
tails interlocked for hours on end
18:19
or they dance around a kind of invisible
18:22
maypole
18:23
and yeah it's just very romantic kind of
18:26
animal
18:27
it's very sweet it's adorable it's
18:28
weirdly sweet yeah
18:30
um the eyes move independently of each
18:33
other as well which is actually
18:34
that's because they're trying to check
18:35
out all the other male and female
18:37
artists
18:38
he's got a roving eye yeah but they all
18:40
do
18:48
okay it is time to move on to fact
18:50
number three and that is my fact
18:52
my fact this week is that falcon experts
18:55
put on a special
18:56
hat when they want to collect semen
18:58
basically falcons have been going
18:59
extinct
19:00
or endangered in the wild and so that
19:03
what they were trying to do was
19:04
to force them to mate with each other
19:06
they had to do artificial insemination
19:08
and this guy in america called les boyd
19:10
worked out the best way to do that was
19:12
to wear a special hat
19:14
which he would then walk into a room the
19:15
hat would excite the falcon who would
19:17
then land on his head
19:19
and hump his head until it ejaculated
19:22
into this guy's hat and then he would
19:25
wait for the next vulcan so it's on to
19:27
the hat really
19:28
because i imagine that into a hat means
19:30
it's you turn the hat upside down
19:32
and ejaculate into the into no no no no
19:35
it's no no the hat looks like a waffle
19:36
so it's got all these little holes on it
19:38
and so i think what happens when the
19:40
ejaculate comes out it sort of seeps
19:42
through the holes like swiss cheese
19:43
we should say they're not wearing these
19:44
hats are they because they're
19:46
particularly
19:46
sexually attractive to the falcons the
19:48
hats are specifically there to collect
19:50
the semen but why
19:51
does the falcon i mean this is this is
19:53
an amazing fact
19:54
why does the falcon want to have sex
19:57
with the hat
19:58
i think it is and correct me if i'm
19:59
wrong they introduced the falcon to the
20:01
hat very early on in life
20:02
and it it sort of develops a mother
20:05
complex
20:06
it imprints it and then when they see
20:08
the hat come back in
20:09
all those years later it thinks i've got
20:11
to have it
20:12
and lands on it but wait are they
20:15
introduced to the
20:16
because yeah i think when falcons are
20:17
raised by people they are more attracted
20:19
to people than they are to other falcons
20:20
because they are imprinted so it's
20:22
whatever raises them they become
20:23
attracted to
20:24
i thought it was the humans and then the
20:25
humans put on the house oh why does it
20:26
introduce the
20:27
baby falcons to the humans so what
20:29
happens if the human walks in without
20:30
the hat
20:31
then they strike so there's a real
20:34
debate in the falcon in community over
20:36
whether it's better to buy
20:38
a collecting hat they call it a
20:40
copulation hat
20:41
um or whether it's better to make your
20:43
own because obviously it's much cheaper
20:44
to make your own but
20:45
sometimes you just want a professional
20:47
hat don't you
20:49
because it looks better i guess so but
20:51
there's i don't think anyone's wearing
20:52
this for fashion actually
20:54
they're not very fashionable things
20:55
they've got waffle stuff on the top and
20:58
usually a bird shaggy
21:01
you can see it being a hipster thing
21:02
yeah i could imagine walking around
21:04
shoreditch with
21:05
no i just really i've just remembered
21:07
that's what they do they imitate the
21:08
falcons voice
21:09
yeah so they imitate the falcons
21:11
vocalizations to sound like a lady
21:12
falcon
21:13
yeah i think that's amazing yeah it's
21:15
incredible
21:16
and you can see footage of this online
21:17
by the way they sort of land on the head
21:19
and they're they're just going at it
21:20
flapping their wings this guy's head is
21:23
just being jutted around all over the
21:24
shop and then um
21:26
it ends and and he walks out and then he
21:28
takes it through a tube doesn't he and
21:29
he brings it
21:30
to to inseminate it into the female
21:32
falcon and that in itself is another
21:35
whole process what does he have to put
21:36
on a special
21:38
chest wig or something like that in the
21:40
video that i saw
21:41
he also had like a glove and got hawks
21:44
were mating on that
21:45
the the copulation hat began as a
21:48
copulation
21:49
glove i think because it definitely
21:50
happened on the hand before
21:52
and some genius
21:55
wait a second yeah what if i wear the
21:57
glove on my head
21:59
i think probably because if you have a
22:01
if you have a falcon land on your hand
22:03
you can only stretch it so far and they
22:05
are moving about a lot i mean it's a
22:06
vigorous activity and so you might get a
22:08
wing in the face
22:09
so maybe that was a protection point so
22:11
that yeah yeah yeah
22:12
possibly but does that mean that they
22:14
can be collecting
22:16
goshawk on the hand and falcon at the
22:18
same time
22:19
yeah do you know the other method for
22:20
doing this is called stripping
22:23
it's a more old-fashioned method um
22:26
it's um well none of this high-tech
22:29
digital equipment they're using so what
22:32
you do is you get
22:33
um a little pipette and you uh you have
22:37
to put it it's a sort of tiny suction
22:38
pump into the birds
22:40
the male falcons uh cloaker sort of
22:42
genital opening
22:44
and then you have to use an automatic
22:45
pipette to just you know you just put it
22:47
one notch and it just extracts a little
22:48
bit
22:49
of semen from the falcon right before
22:52
the invention of the automatic pipette
22:54
what you would have to do is uh someone
22:57
on the team would have to suck the open
22:58
end of the pipette
23:00
to get the falcon semen going and
23:04
this is from the book how fast can a
23:05
falcon dive
23:07
peter cappai nolo had some experience
23:09
performing his procedure as an
23:10
undergraduate
23:10
despite keeping an eye out for the rapid
23:12
movement of seminal fluid up the tube
23:14
he occasionally learned the hard way
23:16
that while falcon seaman looks like a
23:17
nice lager
23:18
it tastes rather bitter because it's
23:22
amber falcon seaman so it looks like a
23:23
bit cool but he discovered
23:25
and he's the co-author of this book so
23:27
does falcon semen look like beer
23:29
like if i if we went to the pub and i
23:31
accidentally swapped dan's beer for a
23:33
bite of
23:34
falcon seamen he might not notice i if i
23:37
saw the hat
23:38
if i was like what are you doing wearing
23:40
that james it's just fashion daniel
23:42
we are in shoreditch okay i can
23:45
definitely see there being a beer in
23:46
shoreditch called falcon semen
23:48
that's a really good beer name and yeah
23:50
it is that should be oh no such thing as
23:51
a fish
23:52
brewery yeah release but i put in falcon
23:55
jizz into
23:56
google in order to uh to make sure that
23:58
there isn't already a vehicle
24:01
but what came up is that there's a club
24:03
in america called falcon jazz which is
24:05
what it order corrected it
24:09
you have to wear a special hat to go in
24:11
it sounds like a really fun jazz club
24:13
and it's run by like this
24:14
environmental scientist um why is he
24:17
running a jazz club i don't know and his
24:18
name is tony falco so he's just missing
24:21
the end to be tony falcon and he's in
24:23
the falcon jazz club
24:25
and it's in new york so if you're in new
24:26
york go see go see the falcon jazz
24:29
and that's for a pint of falcon our beer
24:32
there
24:33
falco jazz presents falcon jizz
24:37
i think what's really interesting about
24:38
this fact is it's the current
24:41
method probably the most successful
24:43
falcon breeder in the world
24:45
his name's bryn close he specifically
24:48
breeds falcons
24:49
who fly incredibly fast because falcon
24:51
racing is a thing that happens a lot in
24:52
the middle east dubai and abu dhabi
24:54
specifically
24:55
do it and the shakes and the super rich
24:57
out there by these falcons
24:58
he is the number one breeder of these
25:00
falcons and that's how he collects
25:02
uh the semen of all these of these um
25:05
different falcons
25:05
but anyone listening to this might
25:07
remember ages ago there was an image
25:09
that appeared online of a commercial
25:11
airplane and it was the economy class of
25:14
the airplane and it was just
25:16
packed with falcons sitting there and to
25:18
brin that's a very regular thing
25:20
because that's how they fly all the
25:22
falcons out to
25:23
abu dhabi and dubai was there a business
25:25
class on the same flight full of humans
25:28
people coming in like uh yeah just this
25:30
way so just this way
25:31
falcon you'd need to turn right
25:35
so airlines have specific rules for this
25:36
right there are a lot of airlines that
25:38
will
25:38
the only animals that allow in the cabin
25:40
are uh guide dogs for the blind and
25:43
falcons for falcon racing so emirates is
25:45
one of those airlines where it's
25:47
it says they're the only two animals
25:48
that are allowed but if you buy a first
25:51
class seat
25:52
you're allowed two falcons so i think
25:54
this is
26:02
yeah if you're going to dubai or abu
26:04
dhabi or somewhere like that you buy a
26:05
first-class seat you're allowed two
26:07
additional falcons um on the seat next
26:10
to you
26:10
i get etihad and emirates a lot because
26:13
my sister lives over in abu dhabi i have
26:15
never
26:16
well you're never in first class dan
26:18
that's where they're all hanging out i
26:19
thought you said you have one in economy
26:20
you can't have one in economy yeah
26:22
maybe um so just very quickly on bryn
26:24
close he raises these falcons
26:26
in doncaster near an industrial estate
26:29
um he's been doing it for years
26:30
he says that his falcons can get up to
26:32
75 miles an hour
26:34
the average falcon can get up to 60
26:36
miles an hour so
26:37
he doesn't know what he's doing right
26:38
except that he knows that he's spending
26:40
a lot of money
26:41
on their daily meals and so on in order
26:43
to just build them up to be the
26:44
strongest that they can be
26:46
interesting is he lives in an industrial
26:48
town um i read an
26:50
article a year or so ago about pigeons
26:53
which is that pigeons can fly faster
26:55
through noxious air than they can
26:56
through clean air
26:58
if you get if you have racing pigeons
27:00
they always go faster if you put them
27:01
through horrible air
27:02
and no one knows why it might be because
27:04
they just want to get out of it or
27:06
it might be something to do i don't know
27:07
yeah that's his secret is what you're
27:09
saying
27:10
maybe maybe the doncaster is the one
27:12
secret maybe it's yeah anything else
27:14
he's doing
27:15
do you know how staff at marine parks
27:17
get
27:18
uh seaman out of a killer whale now go
27:21
on
27:21
they used to use a cow vagina you used
27:24
to they lost it
27:28
some real and some artificial although
27:29
where you would make an artificial
27:30
calves vagina i do not know
27:32
i could think of a worse way wearing a
27:35
swimming cab
27:40
another marine biologist had his neck
27:42
broken today
27:50
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:52
the show and that
27:53
is anna my fact this week is that mayan
27:57
women had to prove they could make coco
27:59
with the right amount of froth before
28:01
men would marry them
28:04
this is something i was reading in the
28:06
smithsonian and it's something that's
28:08
claimed by this guy called hayes lovis
28:10
and i have no idea if that's how you
28:11
pronounce his name but he's a cultural
28:13
arts curator at the smithsonian
28:15
and he said the early records of mayan
28:17
marriages in guatemala
28:19
indicate that in some places a woman
28:21
would have to make the cacao so she'd
28:23
have to make the chocolate drink
28:24
and prove that she could make it with
28:26
the proper amount of froth before she
28:28
was able to marry the man
28:29
and this is a thing froth was incredibly
28:31
important so i hadn't realized that the
28:32
froth on the chocolate drinks in
28:34
meso-american civilizations was a bigger
28:36
deal than the actual chocolate drinker
28:38
thing and why
28:39
do we know i guess because it was part
28:40
just part of the ritual right so
28:42
you'll see lots of miso american art
28:44
which shows the women making the froth
28:46
and they'd stand up really really high
28:48
above the vessel that they were pouring
28:50
the chocolate drink into
28:51
and they'd pour it in from really high
28:53
above and it would splash down onto the
28:54
ground
28:55
like two meters high and that would sort
28:57
of froth it up and they'd do that a few
28:59
times so you just pour back and forth
29:00
and back and forth
29:01
so it's just like a ritualistic thing i
29:03
guess it's just showing that you're not
29:05
a complete idiot
29:07
can you pour some stuff into a pot and
29:09
then back and forth okay well i'll marry
29:10
you that's fine
29:11
from quite a height hmm i'd struggle i
29:15
would have been a spinster
29:16
i don't know so um jose dia costa who is
29:18
a spanish jesuit missionary
29:20
he said that the scum or froth had a
29:22
very unpleasant taste
29:24
oh really so i think it's a european
29:26
taste it wasn't that tasty because it's
29:27
hot chocolate but it's not got sugar in
29:29
it i'll pass on the chocolate i'll just
29:30
have some of that falcon semen thank you
29:32
very much that's much nicer
29:35
because they didn't have um cane sugar
29:37
or anything like that
29:38
they could have put honey in it i
29:39
suppose but mostly it was a bitter and
29:42
spicy drink it wasn't
29:43
sweet and yeah they more often put chili
29:45
in it didn't they
29:46
yeah and yet it was really really
29:47
popular in spite of not being delicious
29:49
and sweet like we
29:50
now have um you know when old chocolate
29:53
goes white
29:54
you know that no yeah when it goes off
29:57
when you leave chocolate for a while
29:58
yeah white do you know what that is no
30:00
it's called a fat bloom
30:02
so it's liquid from the cacao bean
30:06
gradually moving towards the surface of
30:08
the chocolate and breaking out on the
30:09
surface like a rash
30:10
it's not bad yeah i wouldn't eat it i
30:13
would
30:13
would you yeah what about green bacon
30:15
yeah i'd love it
30:16
no sorry no green bacon you know bacon
30:19
goes a little bit off
30:21
sheen on it i think that's probably
30:22
still all right i still eat that yeah
30:24
it's nitrate burn that it's
30:26
um the nitrates that they use to cure
30:28
the bacon with and preserve it
30:29
um that's just that reacting with the
30:31
oxygen great so does that implies it's
30:33
on the turn right
30:35
yeah but it's fine it's still okay to
30:36
eat good otherwise i'm in serious
30:38
trouble i mean if it's green and furry
30:40
probably not they used to the mayans
30:44
and the aztecs used to use the cacao
30:46
bean
30:47
as currency that would be their
30:49
equivalent to
30:51
money not exclusively but it was it was
30:53
a traded
30:54
thing so and you would know what it was
30:56
worth so one bean might be worth
30:57
according to this expert
30:58
um sorry 200 beans might be worth
31:01
according to this expert
31:02
um the price of one turkey for example
31:05
okay
31:05
and they think they know that don't they
31:07
because so we can't a lot of this stuff
31:09
we kind of have to guess at because we
31:10
don't have written records for
31:12
a lot of these cultures but they think
31:13
they know that because they found
31:14
counterfeit beans right so
31:16
no yeah the archaeologists keep finding
31:21
what look like cacao beans
31:22
and then they go up close and they're
31:23
little beans made of clay to look
31:25
exactly like cacao beans and they think
31:26
it must be counterfeit currency
31:28
but or it could be you know they use
31:30
them in hot chocolate tastes like
31:33
their equivalent of chocolate money is
31:35
non-chocolate money
31:36
[Laughter]
31:40
one of the suggestions was that the
31:41
counterfeits were to use in ceremonies
31:43
because a lot of religious ceremonies
31:45
involved cacao because it was such a
31:46
valuable thing but
31:48
the point of religious ceremonies is to
31:50
give offerings to the gods right and you
31:51
would have thought if you're offering a
31:52
god what looks like a cacao bean but
31:54
when he tries it
31:55
it's a bit of clay that would actually
31:57
piss through ceremonial things don't you
31:59
like
32:00
like in ancient egypt they would have
32:02
made um
32:03
fake slaves or fake this or fake fake
32:06
slaves for the afterlife
32:10
i'll show you my slaves block of wood
32:13
and in
32:13
china like traditionally they would do
32:16
paper uh versions of things you want in
32:18
the afterlife
32:18
because they knew that you couldn't
32:20
necessarily take your ipad
32:22
to the next life because it's a it's a
32:24
solid thing but you could take a paper
32:25
one
32:26
and it they still do that yeah it's
32:28
amazing yeah i think we have mentioned
32:30
what is it they yeah um they do money so
32:32
you just burn money
32:33
and you burn items that you think they
32:36
would like to take into the afterlife
32:37
amazing if you get to the afterlife and
32:39
you've got a paper ipad there
32:44
i thought when i walked through this
32:45
door it would all transform into the
32:47
real thing
32:50
everyone in the afterlife was all
32:51
wandering around with paper ipad
32:53
mine doesn't do anything either that's
32:55
ridiculous we've no we've no way of
32:57
communicating
32:58
maybe that's what ghosts are trying to
33:00
do
33:00
[Laughter]
33:07
so i didn't know this but cacao bean
33:10
stocks are running lower and lower and
33:12
all the crops are being
33:13
converted to corn and west africa where
33:15
they grow a lot of it and chocolate is
33:17
going to get way more expensive in the
33:18
next few years and eric and mcallister
33:19
mentioned this a few weeks ago
33:20
yes um but there was a guy
33:24
uh in 2010 because you get traders who
33:26
buy and sell loads of cacao beans
33:29
he bought seven percent of the world's
33:32
cacao beans 658 million pounds worth
33:35
mountains of them
33:36
and he was nicknamed chock finger
33:40
chocolate finger it should be just
33:45
his real name's anthony he's just a
33:47
trader who's specialized in cacao his
33:49
whole life
33:50
he knows all about the market movements
33:52
and you know he's spent his whole life
33:53
buying and selling it
33:54
on what he thinks the market will do
33:56
just on the mayans very quickly
33:58
not to do with cacao but um to do with
34:00
those
34:01
massive amazing pyramids that they built
34:04
um
34:04
so back in the 30s they discovered a
34:07
pyramid
34:08
within a pyramid so
34:11
is it in russia um well no but what's
34:14
amazing is last year they've just found
34:16
another pyramid inside
34:18
that pyramid inside the pyramid yeah and
34:21
they
34:21
think there may be a few more inside so
34:23
yeah it's like a russian doll effect
34:26
very very middle there's a toblerone
34:30
yeah this is only last year that they
34:32
announced it that they found this new
34:34
smaller pyramid i would have looked
34:35
outside yeah first pyramid for a massive
34:38
period it could be that we're all living
34:40
inside a massive solar system size
34:43
pyramid
34:44
and that one first one they found is
34:46
actually the second one exactly yes
34:48
why would you make the second russian
34:49
doll so much smaller
34:51
than the outside layer you just wouldn't
34:53
doesn't make any sense yeah that's a
34:55
huge scaling difference between
34:57
well the ones that make when they get
34:58
that big
35:00
the first one took a lot of effort and
35:02
then the next one they're like oh we
35:04
shouldn't they want that thing
35:07
just very quickly we've never mentioned
35:09
before that the first atm machine said
35:11
the first cash machine was based on a
35:13
chocolate bar
35:13
dispenser and so that was invented by
35:16
this guy called john shepard baron
35:18
in the 1960s and 67 and
35:21
he i was reading an interview with him
35:23
well i'm just imagining
35:24
like fivers on one of those chocolate
35:26
machines where it's just about to fall
35:28
down if it doesn't quite fall down that
35:30
would be the worst thing ever wouldn't
35:32
it
35:33
yeah they wouldn't fall properly i don't
35:35
know yeah it would be a nightmare
35:37
um it was done with using checks in the
35:39
olden days so you'd write a check and it
35:41
had a bit of a comeback
35:43
what to get some chocolate out of a
35:44
chocolate machine you'd write a check
35:47
and then six days later once it's
35:49
cleared
35:51
who should i make it out to just a9
35:58
please deliver this check to a9
36:02
you're sincerely mr baron dan you don't
36:05
sign off checks yours sincerely
36:08
i am so lost with what's happening at
36:10
the moment
36:12
clear up number one no you didn't ever
36:14
put checks into chocolate
36:16
machine i'm sorry i gave that impression
36:17
what i meant was he based the cash
36:19
machine
36:20
on a chocolate bar machine but to use
36:22
cash machines in the olden days
36:23
you put a check in and it had a bit of
36:25
radioactive carbon 14 isotope
36:27
which interacted with the machine and he
36:29
used to get in trouble and people would
36:31
say oh we reckon this is dangerous it's
36:32
radioactive wow
36:33
so he said i later worked out that you'd
36:35
have to eat 136
36:37
000 checks for it to have any effect on
36:39
your health okay
36:40
so you put that's how cash machines used
36:43
to work with radioactive
36:45
yeah a radioactive system that triggered
36:47
it to give you some cash
36:48
that is unbelievable but that's not how
36:50
the
36:52
chocolate the chocolate dispenser works
36:54
because it wouldn't melt
36:55
yeah you did used to get radioactive
36:56
chocolate bars when they first invented
36:58
radium or discovered radium they started
37:00
putting them in chocolate bars so
37:01
technically you could have actually put
37:02
a chocolate bar into a cash machine and
37:04
got cash
37:07
but he'd have to get his chocolate from
37:08
the original machine so it's just a
37:09
system that's just working back and
37:11
forth
37:11
he's still stuck between two vending
37:13
machines
37:15
um so this guy this inventor um
37:18
said he then moved up to scotland uh to
37:20
the coast and the next thing he invented
37:22
and the only other thing he invented as
37:23
far as i can tell
37:24
is a device that played the sound of
37:26
killer whales towards seals off his fish
37:28
farm
37:29
um and he said to the bbc only succeeded
37:33
in attracting many more of them
37:36
we shouldn't put it inside a cow's
37:38
vagina
37:38
[Laughter]
37:45
okay that's it that is all of our facts
37:47
thank you so much for listening if you'd
37:49
like to get in contact with any of us
37:50
about the things that we have said over
37:52
the course of this podcast

hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish
00:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:21
qi offices in covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:25
sitting here with james hurricane
00:27
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
00:29
and
00:30
once again we have gathered around the
00:31
microphones with our four
00:33
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:35
and in no particular order
00:37
here we go starting this week with my
00:40
fact
00:41
my fact this week is that at rush hour
00:44
there are more people under the ground
00:45
in london than there are above the
00:47
ground in edinburgh
00:49
wow that's great no you don't mean dead
00:52
people do you
00:53
no i don't i mean rush hour i mean the
00:56
london underground system
00:58
there are more people on trains below
01:00
the ground than there are
01:01
people in total every day actually you
01:04
might have underestimated that because
01:06
did you count people living in basement
01:08
flats
01:10
no i didn't you didn't i bet there are
01:12
even more
01:13
more people what about that what about
01:15
dead people
01:16
yep that's a whole we can't go there
01:20
actually you know you just said dead
01:21
people and vaguely about population i
01:23
found out this week that
01:24
the thing about their this is probably
01:26
something everyone else knows but the
01:27
thing about there being
01:28
more people alive today than had ever
01:31
lived in the past
01:32
is so far wrong it's ridiculously wrong
01:35
so you know you always hear that fact
01:37
and i think there's something like um
01:39
about 100 billion people have been alive
01:41
on earth and obviously there isn't
01:42
nearly that many people alive today
01:44
and so it's just rubbish that's where
01:46
it's come from
01:47
wow anyway sorry back to you busted a
01:49
myth right at the top of the show
01:51
so exciting is this people on the london
01:53
underground yep this is people on the
01:54
london underground i read this fact
01:56
in a bill bryson book called the road to
01:59
little dribbling it was his last
02:00
tour of the uk it was a follow-up to
02:03
notes from a small island
02:04
and in it he's on the london underground
02:06
he got the fact from time out which is a
02:08
magazine in london
02:09
and in it it said that daily there are
02:11
600 000 people
02:13
on the london underground um and the
02:15
population of edinburgh is something
02:16
like 460 thousand isn't it at any given
02:19
moment on the underground well we
02:20
thought that and that's when i sent you
02:22
guys that fact but then i took it to our
02:24
calculations master james and said is
02:26
that possible and james worked out that
02:28
that can't be right
02:29
but you said that it would be right for
02:31
rush hour yeah i think the maximum that
02:33
you might get at rush hour would be
02:35
about six hundred thousand
02:36
and do we think the population of
02:37
edinburgh is around five hundred
02:39
thousand something like that yeah
02:40
just under yeah uh i looked at some
02:42
other six hundred thousands
02:44
at the moment uh and ed sheeran's shape
02:47
of you
02:47
um just passed around 600 000 downloads
02:51
uh quite recently but it's also been
02:54
streamed 121 million
02:56
times since it was released no way
02:59
yeah and it's three minutes 50 something
03:03
long and so if you add up all of those
03:05
streamings together it
03:06
takes you to 893 years
03:09
that people have been listening to that
03:10
song and so if you go into the future
03:13
893 years
03:15
then that's a hundred years after wall-e
03:18
is set
03:19
and it's the time when scientists
03:21
estimate that the um radiation levels in
03:23
chernobyl will be back down to normal
03:26
that long for chernobyl to be back well
03:28
done ed sheeran
03:29
what did i say thanks for clearing up
03:31
chernobyl yeah
03:33
i've understood but i mean if we go by
03:37
what happens in wall-e
03:38
it doesn't look like a place to inhabit
03:40
anymore so but it's 100 years after
03:42
wall-e so maybe
03:43
it sorted itself sorted itself out and
03:45
gone back down that's what happens
03:47
that's
03:47
that's the sequel i've got to quibble
03:49
with your effect dan uh oh
03:50
sure half london underground is
03:53
overground
03:54
oh yeah i'm just force stalling people
03:56
right again
03:58
really half of it is more than half more
04:00
than half yeah god how did we not think
04:02
of that didn't think of that bit
04:03
yeah wow oh sorry i've been keeping that
04:06
under my hat as a sort of
04:07
cool thing to bring up which wouldn't
04:09
necessarily invalidate the whole section
04:12
but let's face it at rush hour no one's
04:14
in those weird outer bits yeah exactly
04:21
the tube does it goes much further i i
04:24
got offered a stand-up gig ages ago and
04:25
it was in zone nine which i didn't know
04:27
existed
04:28
but i was like sure i can see it on the
04:29
map it took something like two hours to
04:32
get there
04:32
yeah and when we emerged from the uh
04:35
from the train because you as you say
04:37
some of it goes overground
04:39
we emerged and there were cows in my
04:42
window
04:42
there was literally a field with sheep
04:44
and cows
04:45
you can see that on the tube it used to
04:47
go even further
04:49
sorry you had a joke i was just gonna
04:51
say this sounds like a really hot gig
04:52
you were at down
05:00
[Laughter]
05:09
it used to the metropolitan line which i
05:10
think is the one that goes up to zone
05:12
nine
05:12
and so most stations don't have the same
05:14
night metropolitan line used to go 40
05:16
miles out of london
05:17
wow used to go all the way to aylesbury
05:19
we should say for overseas people
05:21
uh covent garden where we work is in
05:23
zone one and then if you get a bit
05:25
further out of london north london like
05:26
you can get
05:27
markets now what comes after that dad so
05:30
interestingly if you go to where i live
05:32
it's zone three
05:34
so it's not further out or closer in
05:36
zone two that's just
05:37
that's one further out okay yeah but two
05:39
further out than zone one
05:41
so yeah it's um and then it works its
05:43
way out to zone nine
05:44
well yeah that's great there's quite a
05:46
few in between that but we don't have
05:47
time
05:49
what are the ones in between four five
05:53
um if you go out to one of the far zones
05:57
um so this will be a number higher than
05:59
four and five even
06:01
you can get to the station roading
06:03
valley which is the least used station
06:05
on the entire underground
06:07
uh and they have about 712 passengers
06:11
a day okay and it's not as many as
06:15
edinburgh but it is the same population
06:17
as
06:17
illington the highest village in
06:19
warwickshire
06:22
exactly the same population according to
06:24
the 2011 census so how are they getting
06:26
from illington
06:27
to valley i see what you mean it's not
06:31
the same people
06:32
ah that was confusing um one person who
06:34
does live in ilmington
06:36
is um les wexner who's the man behind
06:39
victoria's secret
06:41
wow not victoria the
06:44
train station in london
06:49
is victoria's secret well it's actually
06:50
65 meters underground
06:54
did you know that over 47
06:57
million liters of water are pumped out
06:59
of the underground every day yeah
07:02
because it's that far down it's below
07:03
lots of water lots of water in the
07:05
ground and it keeps on pouring in they
07:06
keep on pumping it out where do they
07:07
pump it out to
07:08
um zone 10.
07:12
i don't know um that's really cool so
07:15
it's pouring in
07:16
you never see it do you no they no they
07:18
do quite a good job of keeping it away
07:19
from
07:20
the public section yeah yeah yeah quite
07:22
impressive there are rivers that go
07:24
through some of the stations aren't
07:25
there yeah
07:25
sloan square if you look above the
07:27
platform there's a tube and that tube
07:29
has a river in it
07:31
no way yeah uh what is it called
07:34
it's not the fleet is it it's no it's
07:36
the westbourne the
07:37
fleet goes through farringdon right and
07:40
they just look like sewers these days
07:41
but there used to be rivers they used to
07:42
be london's subsidiary
07:44
rivers so there's not like pedos and
07:46
stuff
07:49
for rats and you can you can go to um
07:52
certain shops in central london where
07:55
the owners have in their basement
07:57
they've dug through the ground
07:58
and you can see the river passing really
08:00
yeah yeah so they sort of do it as a
08:02
an attraction that you can go and see
08:03
within their shop the rivers of london
08:05
that no longer exist
08:07
yeah um when they were building the new
08:10
york subway the guys who were building
08:11
it
08:12
were called sand hogs because they dug
08:13
through lots of sand and i was reading a
08:15
newspaper
08:16
report from 1916 and it was about this
08:20
guy called marshall maybe
08:22
who was working in the tunnel to like
08:25
dig the subway
08:26
and there was a pocket of compressed air
08:29
which suddenly kind of escaped
08:31
so he's like got this big shield up in
08:33
the tunnel in front of him and they're
08:34
using this shield to like push forward
08:35
and make the tunnel bigger
08:36
and he said he saw an 18-inch pocket of
08:39
air suddenly appear
08:41
and it sucked him towards it he was
08:44
sucked
08:44
into it he was blasted up through the
08:46
ground so he was blasted up through 12
08:48
feet of riverbed
08:49
and then blasted up through the river
08:51
itself and then held up 25
08:54
feet in the air above the river he
08:56
wasn't grinding through
08:57
earth 12 feet of earth yeah that's what
08:59
riverbed's made of yeah
09:01
it's less it's more plausible for him to
09:03
be blasted through 12 feet of earth than
09:05
two feet of concrete or steel or
09:06
whatever
09:07
no i no no i was thinking was it just a
09:09
tunnel like it was a hole that he was
09:10
blasted through it just happened to be
09:12
going
09:12
i don't believe it so here we go let me
09:15
there's a whole interview with him and
09:16
everything
09:17
there's a nice interview with his wife
09:18
saying it's okay he's fine he's looking
09:20
forward to going back to work
09:21
this is what the uh new york times said
09:23
at the time uh there's a pocket of
09:25
compressed air
09:26
to prevent the river's bottom from
09:27
caving in um so they have some
09:30
i don't know how that works
09:33
but somehow it happened guys and this
09:37
compressed air got loose
09:39
and it saw an 18-inch hole and before we
09:42
knew it was being sucked towards it
09:43
two of his colleagues actually also got
09:45
sucked in and they did perish
09:46
and he uh he survived by blasting up
09:49
putting his arm out in front of him and
09:50
blasting up through the road
09:55
12 feet of riverbed
09:59
and then got shot through and then out
10:00
in the air then there's enough force
10:02
left over
10:03
shot through the the river itself and
10:04
then you have 25 feet
10:06
25 feet
10:10
it's the new york times it's a very
10:11
reckless what year
10:13
what year is it yeah and what date was
10:15
this
10:15
[Laughter]
10:17
february 1916 all right not april
10:21
um yeah it was a little bit insane um
10:25
but there you go there's a picture of
10:27
the guy pictures don't lie
10:29
what flight or good
10:33
that's extraordinary did you say that
10:34
was in new york yeah um
10:36
it was soft ground so that's why they
10:38
were called oh oh well if it was soft
10:40
ground i see
10:41
yeah it was still a river 25 feet after
10:44
12 beds
10:45
and a river and a river i don't know how
10:48
it possibly happened
10:50
i was imagining him being carried up in
10:52
the bubble of air like in a
10:54
submarine oh my god
10:57
do you know what the underground was
10:58
used for during the second world war
11:00
um it was hospitals i thought bomb
11:04
shelter
11:04
yeah that was definitely used as bomb
11:06
shelters but also the central line
11:09
was converted into a fighter aircraft
11:11
factory ah
11:13
it stretched for two miles and it had
11:16
its own train system i don't know if it
11:17
was the actual
11:18
tube trains how did they get the
11:19
aircraft up the escalator
11:23
but what they did is they had some
11:24
compressed air and they would just blast
11:26
them up into the sky
11:28
um isn't that amazing and that was an
11:29
official secret until the 1980s i'm
11:31
without her actually how did they get
11:32
them out
11:33
well in piecemeal i imagine okay well
11:36
they had a lift or something
11:37
right um did you know that roosevelt had
11:39
his own
11:40
station underground station built or
11:43
there was an underground station built
11:45
underneath the waldorf historia which is
11:46
a really famous hotel in new york and um
11:50
it was just for people staying at the
11:51
waldorf astoria so it was one station
11:53
and if you didn't want to go with the
11:54
plebs to grand central station or you
11:56
know one of the proper tube stations
11:57
you could just get a lift underground in
11:59
your hotel and it said if you brought if
12:02
you brought your own carriage with you
12:03
so if you had your own
12:08
carriage
12:10
[Laughter]
12:14
this is sounding nearly as plausible as
12:16
your man am i just coming
12:17
blasted through the river how did i
12:20
spend the morning hallucinating
12:22
oh anna you've got dan's notes there
12:26
so this is uh in uh this is research
12:29
done by this guy called dan brooker
12:30
who's looked into this he's a tour guide
12:32
uh on the new york metro system and he
12:35
said the fdr used it to hide his
12:37
disability so people didn't have to see
12:38
him kind of walking from the tube
12:40
and so there would be trains that led to
12:42
this private underground station that
12:43
could fit his
12:44
big armor-plated car which would then
12:47
drive off the train onto the platform
12:49
and straight into the elevator
12:51
and then his limousine would be lifted
12:52
up the elevator and
12:54
backed out into the grand ballroom of
12:56
the world so he would drive into an
12:59
elevator
13:00
yeah in a limousine and there's already
13:02
a big lift
13:03
but then you get to the left and there's
13:05
actually a plane in there and he's like
13:06
oh wait for the next one
13:10
i don't know anna yeah so yeah this
13:13
researcher says it but it was definitely
13:15
then roosevelt definitely used it to
13:16
hide his disability
13:17
um they used to have first class and
13:19
third class on a couple of london
13:20
underground lines
13:22
but no second class very weirdly ah see
13:25
that's why i had to explain the zone
13:26
system earlier
13:28
it's a very good example of numbers
13:30
being left out yeah and you would have
13:31
to wait at particular bits of the
13:33
platform depending on what class ticket
13:35
you had
13:36
why did they not have a second class i
13:38
wonder it was because
13:40
there's a stipulation in a railway
13:41
regulation act in the mid 19th century
13:44
which said all train companies have to
13:45
offer third class accommodation so poor
13:47
people can afford it
13:48
um and then eventually they just got rid
13:51
of
13:51
first class so now all the london
13:54
underground characters are third class
13:56
basically are they well would you say
13:58
that i suppose that might be true
13:59
bit of a stretch they definitely got rid
14:01
of first class on the lines where they
14:02
had it
14:03
do we know if they had any luxuries yeah
14:06
you did you had
14:07
two gas lamps uh instead of one
14:10
[Music]
14:12
it's a bit like that from the other week
14:14
where you can have two kestrels in first
14:16
class
14:16
[Laughter]
14:19
should we move on soon we've probably
14:20
gone enough on that i have one story
14:22
about
14:23
an underground man sure sure why not
14:26
um so this is a story from 1998 it's the
14:29
report of a man
14:30
who has he a man who broke the
14:33
record for the length of time spent in a
14:35
wooden box underground
14:37
okay well more than dead people no
14:40
for living people this is the living
14:42
people category he was called jeff smith
14:44
he was 37 years old and he beat the
14:46
european record of 101 days
14:49
he stayed underground uh for 150 days
14:54
and the record that he broke was set
14:57
by his mother oh my god
15:00
how many days did she do she did 101 and
15:04
he beat her and then um
15:05
the landlord of the pub in the garden of
15:08
which
15:09
he was buried underground for three
15:11
months
15:12
said um when his mother did it he was
15:15
seven years old he's now 37
15:17
and for the last 30 years it's been his
15:18
ambition to go and bury himself in a box
15:22
did he have some awful rivalry with his
15:24
mother i don't know
15:26
i think it was i think he was proud to
15:27
keep the family record of life and what
15:29
does it
15:29
how do they um how do they keep him
15:32
alive so he's obviously got air tubes
15:35
they probably just pour like peanuts
15:37
down a tube or something because he's in
15:38
the pub
15:39
would you remember there was there was a
15:40
um
15:42
the sort of um there's a book we have in
15:44
the office from a
15:45
friend of ours john bonderson called
15:47
buried alive and they used to make
15:49
caskets for
15:50
people who were petrified of being
15:51
buried alive so one uh
15:53
had an ability that you could ring a
15:55
bell if you woke up in your casket
15:57
and um while you were waiting for them
15:58
to dig you out it had a tube where they
16:00
could send a sausage down
16:02
[Laughter]
16:04
um no he so he had an air tube and he
16:07
said through the air tube inserted in
16:09
the box
16:09
i am very pleased to reach this date my
16:11
mother would be proud of me
16:13
if you were in that beer garden and you
16:15
had a few pints you would start pouring
16:18
beer down i think the beer would be the
16:20
last of his worries going
16:22
down that tube that's a good point
16:25
oh well done for not drowning
16:27
[Laughter]
16:30
imagine if you were one day away from
16:32
getting the record and then a massive
16:34
bubble
16:42
[Music]
16:47
okay it is time for fact number two and
16:49
that is james
16:51
okay my fact this week is that every
16:53
month the same number of people on
16:55
average
16:56
google how to make love as how to make
16:59
slime yeah i i only know one of those
17:02
things one that slime
17:04
yeah sometimes they could be the same
17:07
thing
17:08
that's true i know how to make slime um
17:11
so this
17:12
is an article on mondovo.com which is
17:15
the digital marketing company where they
17:16
looked at the 1000
17:18
most asked questions on google and
17:20
checked
17:21
how much an advertiser would have to pay
17:23
for someone to click on their adverts
17:25
for them
17:26
so if you look at the most google
17:27
question which is what is my ip
17:30
an advertiser would be 0.12
17:34
per click and when it's valentine's day
17:36
would be 12.33 per click
17:39
so that's what they were looking at but
17:40
really i just want to talk about slime
17:43
it's weird though that i hadn't realized
17:45
there's this slime
17:46
craze at all and maybe that's because
17:48
i'm not a young
17:49
child or a parent but there is and there
17:52
are all these stories in america of glue
17:54
shortages which people are saying are
17:55
rubbish but it is true that walmarts
17:57
have had to say
17:58
look we have run out of glue in some of
17:59
our stores and we are trying to keep up
18:01
with demand as quickly as possible
18:02
because
18:03
kids have just started making slime all
18:05
over the place it's amazing
18:07
and there are instagram accounts run by
18:09
teenagers which have got hundreds of
18:10
thousands of followers and it's just
18:12
them
18:12
glooping slime and touching it and
18:14
making the gloopy noises with it
18:16
and there are all these different slime
18:17
accounts and there are slime
18:19
confession accounts which like
18:21
apparently post drama
18:23
about other slime accounts saying so and
18:24
so didn't invent this new kind of
18:26
angel slime or crunchy slime or whatever
18:28
wait that but that doesn't sound like a
18:30
confession that sounds like slime
18:31
accusations yeah i guess what happens on
18:33
the slime confessions
18:34
i admit i didn't make that slide yeah
18:36
okay it's just the rebuttal yeah no
18:38
slime confession
18:39
it's just it's just sort of secondary
18:40
accounts post and they
18:42
you get asked because people just put
18:43
their fingers in the video touching the
18:45
slime
18:46
and they get hundreds of messages from
18:47
people saying give us a face reveal
18:50
is what it's called oh and show your
18:52
face do you ever get the face reveal or
18:54
i think people are a bit wary of showing
18:55
their especially because they're
18:56
teenagers they
18:57
they say i don't want to show my face to
18:58
100 000 people just look at the slime
19:00
really
19:00
i think that's almost what the majority
19:02
of youtubers are
19:04
i mean that's the age where these guys
19:06
are only about the slime down they're
19:07
not there for the fame
19:09
right there for the recognition they're
19:10
not there for the slime
19:12
[Music]
19:17
is it broken we've broken the podcast
19:20
it's finally happened
19:21
yeah that's incredible that is amazing i
19:24
didn't know about that actually i
19:25
haven't seen that in my googling of
19:27
slime
19:27
yeah it's for 2016 it was the top how
19:31
top 10 how to searches in the world or
19:33
maybe in
19:34
america but i think it was the world how
19:36
to and all the others are like how to
19:37
file
19:38
my taxes or how to i don't know whatever
19:40
else and then it's how to make slime
19:42
so they are also divided by region so
19:44
you can find out what people are how
19:45
are googling how to do in various places
19:47
so sheffield wanted to know mostly how
19:49
to pluck your eyebrows
19:51
um people in cardiff and leeds wanted to
19:52
know how to work out percentages
19:54
and in bradford the most common how to
19:56
search was how to age lace
19:59
how to age that was the most common
20:02
thing people wanted to know how to do it
20:04
bradford they're all about lace in
20:07
bradford
20:08
and aging lace what is aging lace
20:11
i guess to make it look older than it is
20:13
or is it telling how old it is
20:16
oh that does feel to me like one or two
20:20
people googling a lot doesn't it
20:21
yeah yeah i've forgotten again
20:26
it's interesting because um all this uh
20:29
slime was very much part of i guess more
20:32
james in my childhood than youtube but
20:35
the toys that we all had or used to have
20:37
them teenage mutant ninja turtles used
20:38
to come with it because they were born
20:40
out of ooze so you used to get this
20:41
little slime with it
20:42
uh the ghostbusters toys you used to get
20:44
yeah with the slimer
20:46
the sl yes limer exactly it was such a
20:48
huge part of toys i don't know if it is
20:50
so much these days that was gunge
20:52
vintage
20:52
like get your own back with dave pence
20:54
and phillips oh yeah you'd always
20:56
involve an adult being gunged
20:57
wasn't it more like putty so the slime i
20:59
remember getting was more like putty
21:01
with toys that's the farty one that's
21:02
the one that you go when you put your
21:04
finger inside
21:05
i don't think you got the slime that was
21:07
the yeah the slime was the predated
21:09
uh the party did it party putty yeah
21:12
okay
21:12
one theory about why kids like uh slime
21:15
so much especially
21:16
in the 90s and early 2000s is because it
21:19
was a time when kids stopped going
21:20
outside
21:21
and when you know kids in the 60s and
21:24
70s would go out they'd be messing
21:26
around with bits of gunge and the
21:28
you know bits of mud and all that kind
21:30
of thing and then this was a generation
21:32
that didn't really play out so they were
21:33
indoors a lot so they had to
21:35
make do with gunge that's amazing yeah i
21:38
don't know if it's true it's a theory
21:39
though it's a really good theory yeah i
21:41
like it
21:41
the first film i could find that
21:43
contains the word slime in the title is
21:45
a film called the slime people from
21:47
1963.
21:49
it was not very well received it got 2.5
21:51
on imdb
21:52
and apparently according to wikipedia it
21:54
was infamous for its extensive use of
21:56
fog machines with the fog becoming so
21:58
thick towards the end that it's
21:59
virtually impossible to see any of the
22:00
action
22:05
it started this guy called robert hutton
22:07
who only got
22:08
the first half of the film
22:12
robert hudson apparently only got work
22:14
this is according to this random book on
22:16
on films he only got work because he had
22:19
a startling resemblance to jimmy stewart
22:21
and when jimmy stewart was called up for
22:22
world war ii he was just cast in lots of
22:24
films
22:30
have you guys ever seen the blob yeah so
22:32
the blob is one of the first ever
22:34
b-movie sci-fi horror films and it is
22:37
one of steve mcqueen's first ever films
22:39
i did not know he was in the blog yeah
22:41
and it's about basically it's about a
22:42
blob which
22:43
uh comes down from space and it starts
22:45
eating things and it just absorbs things
22:47
and then gets bigger
22:48
and so the producer has just died it's
22:51
kind of like a slime basically as the
22:52
blob is sort of this
22:53
sentient ooze which just swallows things
22:55
yeah but these days there is still
22:57
blob fest every year in a town where
23:00
they shot loads of it and you can eat
23:01
blob burgers
23:03
and you can pay a small fee and you can
23:05
run screaming out of the cinema
23:07
that everyone runs screaming out of in
23:08
the film when the blob oozes into it
23:10
what if you want to keep watching the
23:12
film you can't
23:14
do you know that the blob was based on a
23:15
true story no no
23:17
yeah no it really was only give you
23:20
dan's notes
23:22
it was a local report somewhere in
23:23
america um
23:25
some weird substance had been found um
23:28
that was kind of jelly-like
23:29
probably natural i guess it probably is
23:31
like frog spawn or something
23:33
but the fbi were brought in to
23:35
investigate it and then it was in the
23:36
local news then it got
23:37
in national news and then they turned it
23:39
into the story wow i didn't know that
23:41
yeah
23:41
that's very cool did it eat people no no
23:45
i think that was that was a fictional
23:46
adaptation
23:48
um so in paris in the 19th century they
23:51
used to have
23:52
fruit orchards and they used to use
23:55
snail slime to put
23:57
branding on their apples yeah
24:01
so all you do is you you grow an apple
24:03
on a tree and put it in a paper bag
24:05
so it was very pale when it grew and
24:07
then you take the paper bag off
24:09
and you get a stencil and you put snail
24:11
slime in the stencil bit
24:13
and then you would let it grow a little
24:14
bit longer and the rest of the apple
24:16
would go
24:17
a nice color but the bit where the snail
24:18
slime was wouldn't go the color and so
24:20
you could have little brands
24:21
wow that is amazing
24:25
why did we stop doing that i don't know
24:27
we should bring it back we should bring
24:28
it back
24:29
we invented sticky labels and it's
24:30
better than having a sort of snail slide
24:34
i don't think that individually bag
24:36
every apple on your tree
24:38
that is why we didn't do it you're right
24:40
i just think that that is incredible
24:42
though
24:42
yeah snail slime is non-newtonian fluid
24:45
which we've talked about before
24:46
so it's a fluid that doesn't really act
24:47
in the way you'd expect something like
24:49
water to act
24:50
and the reason that's really good for
24:51
snails is that um when they excrete it
24:54
it helps them
24:54
stick to the ground when they're staying
24:56
still and root them in the ground
24:58
and then it helps them move when they
24:59
want to move because under pressure
25:01
it becomes really lubricated and it
25:03
becomes really slippery yeah they
25:04
usually like
25:05
glide like a hoverboard yeah i was
25:07
thinking like a water slide but yeah
25:09
some similar oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
25:11
that's probably better actually
25:13
but yeah they're not hovering are they
25:14
no but they're not touching the earth
25:16
but neither are you if you're wearing
25:18
shoes these are my hoverboats
25:23
um so loads of people have started using
25:24
snail slime for beauty
25:27
this is a big trend now so there have
25:29
been some spas which have let
25:30
snails crawl over your face for a fee
25:33
you play the feed not the snails
25:35
um i read once at the battle of i think
25:38
it was a battle of cressy
25:40
they use snails to crawl over the wounds
25:43
of people on the battlefield because it
25:44
has antibacterial stuff in it
25:46
well the enemy's getting closer come on
25:48
come on
25:52
well they have methods of getting slime
25:54
out of snails now because they used to
25:55
do it in quite a cruel way they used to
25:57
put them in water which had lots of salt
25:59
and vinegar in and
26:00
they'd they'd freak out and they'd slime
26:01
loads because it really hurt them
26:03
but now they've developed in italian
26:05
snail farms a special steam bath
26:08
it's like a spa for snails is how
26:11
they're pitching it
26:12
i bet that's not how it really is for
26:14
the snails it is there are these domes
26:16
which are full of steam and apparently
26:17
they take the shell off put it in the
26:19
locker
26:23
where do they keep the pound coin
26:25
[Laughter]
26:27
so it's quite nice that people in spas
26:29
are using slime from snails which have
26:32
themselves been to a spa
26:33
already oh that's so nice and then the
26:35
people excrete sweat which they then
26:37
give back to the snails
26:46
okay it is time for fact number three
26:50
that is chozinski my fact this week is
26:53
that old faithful geezer
26:55
and yellowstone used to be used as a
26:56
washing machine
26:58
and this is another another true fact of
27:02
mine this week
27:05
so old faithful is this geezer in
27:07
yellowstone national park which is very
27:08
famous
27:09
it's quite reliable when it erupts so
27:10
you can go and see it and i've seen it
27:12
and it's amazing
27:13
and uh in the 1800s when people visited
27:16
yellowstone and it was
27:17
often soldiers because there were a lot
27:18
of soldiers placed in the area
27:20
then they would chuck their their soiled
27:23
or their dirty
27:24
clothes into the crater of the geyser
27:27
and then it's very hot in there
27:28
so it would get all strummed around in
27:31
there and then blasted out
27:32
and it's essentially i think it was it's
27:33
about 90 degrees and it
27:35
erupts every 80 minutes so it's like
27:37
putting your clothes on a 90 degree
27:39
cycle for 80 minutes
27:40
yeah that's a big net that's not
27:42
suitable for woolens as well
27:44
80 degrees at 90 degrees is too hot they
27:47
did say
27:47
all the travellers said that um you had
27:49
to not put your woolen clothes in there
27:50
because they would actually get shredded
27:51
up a little bit i think
27:52
yeah they get completely taunted the
27:54
smell of rotten eggs as well wouldn't
27:56
they
27:56
yes because it stinks sulfuric rotten
27:59
eggs all over the shop
28:00
and someone did acknowledge um that it
28:02
wasn't that
28:03
good a way of cleaning clothes so there
28:05
was one
28:07
there was one book i was reading about
28:09
the history of yellowstone said uh many
28:11
articles that go into her chambers never
28:13
came out again so giza laundering was
28:15
often seen as an enterprise both futile
28:17
and costly wow
28:18
yeah and they would i mean i've been
28:20
seat to see that as well and it's really
28:21
an explosion isn't it so they would have
28:23
gone flying
28:24
yeah yeah i would do it definitely but
28:26
with some old t-shirts and things like
28:27
that well you shouldn't do it
28:28
it's very clear you shouldn't put things
28:30
in the geezers in yellowstone really
28:32
they make it
28:33
very very clear i've never been so i
28:35
think i'm clear i think i'm allowed to
28:36
do it
28:37
no one's told me not to yet but when you
28:39
go because you're not you have to stay
28:40
on the warp boards don't you
28:42
yeah and then you'll see just like a hat
28:44
here and a shoe here that have just
28:46
either blown over
28:47
or oh really do you think that is people
28:50
trying
28:50
to emulate this though i don't think so
28:53
no
28:54
is it left over because stuff used to
28:55
get sucked down and disappear so it
28:56
might be 150 year old
28:58
shoes left over from these socks might
28:59
be they mostly look like baseball caps
29:01
from
29:02
the current era okay this is an amazing
29:06
fact
29:06
it's incredible you could wash the
29:08
dishes by dropping them into like mount
29:10
etna or something
29:11
and it'll shimmy them around and then
29:13
explode them out
29:14
well they tried to wash dishes and
29:15
geezers as well did they they tried
29:17
everything with them
29:18
it's truly bizarre surely you would know
29:20
that they would smash
29:22
being blasted out well for instance you
29:24
would get some geezers which are just
29:26
like a puddle of water which is just
29:28
kind of bubbling wouldn't necessarily be
29:30
firing out
29:31
massive yeah was it specifically old
29:33
faithful
29:34
uh no lots of geezers they did this in
29:36
so there was one geezer that was called
29:37
the handkerchief giza because uh
29:39
you chuck your handkerchiefs in right
29:41
and people used to chuck in soap
29:43
just to make them explode i think did
29:44
they or i think that would
29:46
prompt them to explode yes it does it
29:48
gets between the molecules in some way
29:50
and caught actually causes geezers to
29:51
explode it's mad
29:52
that's amazing yeah it's really odd i
29:54
was reading about the fact that um
29:56
they uh have discovered that yellowstone
29:59
this is quite a while ago yellowstone is
30:00
actually what is classified as a super
30:02
volcano because the whole thing
30:04
effectively is one massive volcano is
30:06
very scary because
30:07
the last time it went off uh it produced
30:10
so much ash
30:11
that you could have covered new york
30:13
state in
30:14
i think it was 20 meters
30:17
of ash and i'm not sure if they've
30:20
actually verified this but i think this
30:21
is the main theory there's the gallatin
30:23
mountains
30:24
and suddenly in between the mountain
30:26
range is a 60 mile
30:27
to 70 mile gap of mountain it's just
30:30
missing it's not there and they think it
30:32
was from the explosion
30:34
that happened it just wiped out 60 miles
30:37
so do you reckon that mountain
30:38
kind of flew up somewhere and landed
30:40
somewhere else
30:41
yes do you know what happens when
30:45
lava explodes out of a volcano
30:49
yeah does it go up and then cool down
30:51
and then fall down like pumice kind of
30:53
stuff or
30:54
kind of but some of it a third of the
30:57
liquid rock
30:58
falls back into the volcano so it goes
31:01
in just
31:01
straight up and back down again wow yeah
31:04
um
31:04
can i just read you really quickly one
31:06
last anecdote basically the only
31:07
research i did for this was people
31:09
putting stuff in geezers
31:10
uh for fun yeah um so just one last
31:13
anecdote which i really enjoyed and this
31:14
was from
31:15
a guy called norton who was a travel
31:17
writer he was one of the first people to
31:18
write about visiting yellowstone
31:19
national park
31:20
and he went with a rich companion who he
31:23
nicknamed prince telegraph because he
31:25
owned all these telegraph lines and he
31:26
was obviously some
31:27
posh toff and so norton recorded the
31:30
prince telegraph couldn't be bothered to
31:32
wash up the crockery on the day that it
31:34
was his turn
31:35
so he dumped it in a small shallow
31:37
looking geezer and smoked a pipe by the
31:39
side of the giza
31:40
in the hope that it would uh it would
31:41
wash the crockery and the giza suddenly
31:43
started spitting and like whirling all
31:45
the contents of the crockery around
31:46
and they so the rest of the group hadn't
31:48
realized that uh prince telegraph had
31:50
done this they just heard this shout
31:52
from him and they turned around and saw
31:54
him he was making an agonizing cry for
31:55
help
31:56
they beheld him with his hat off and
31:57
eyes peeled dancing around his dish
32:00
pan in a frantic attempt to save the
32:01
culinary outfit he would plunge his hand
32:04
into the boiling water
32:05
yell with pain and outward come a spoon
32:07
another plunge and yell and a tin plate
32:09
and apparently he just kept on throwing
32:11
his head down into this water and
32:12
scrambling around and all their crockery
32:14
got sucked into the geezer you've got to
32:16
let it go mate
32:17
yeah i would say a spoon is not worth it
32:18
for losing your hands also
32:20
if it was a porcelain plate maybe but a
32:22
tin plate you're going from hot to hot
32:24
to hot oh
32:25
yeah yeah but he's taken all their
32:27
crockery what if they're stuck in
32:28
yellowstone without anything to eat off
32:30
yeah i guess they'll have to have finger
32:32
food from them
32:33
[Laughter]
32:36
it does have a trout jacuzzi is this
32:38
like your
32:40
sauna for snails
32:43
andy is starting up a whole spa for
32:45
different animals
32:48
you've got the weight room for a camel
32:52
does it have different settings like can
32:54
they turn on the
32:56
what it is is that sometimes there are
32:59
little eruptions in this trout jacuzzi
33:01
which stir
33:02
up lots of crustaceans and other little
33:05
insects that trout like to eat and so
33:07
the trout
33:08
know that this is happening and they
33:09
swim around whenever there's a little
33:11
upburst of liquids it's like having a
33:13
jacuzzi where like sausages
33:14
[Laughter]
33:17
which will be the best jacuzzi in the
33:18
world ever
33:26
okay it is time for our final fact of
33:28
the show and that is andy
33:30
my fact is that uh there are three
33:32
world's largest porch swings
33:35
in nebraska louisiana and ontario and
33:37
none of them
33:38
is on a porch this is a fact that was
33:41
sent in actually uh sent in
33:43
by a guy called jeremy michael voss on
33:45
twitter and uh
33:47
there are lots of porch swings which are
33:49
supposed to be the world's largest
33:51
and you can see them all and nowhere
33:52
near a porch surely we've measured
33:54
them yeah i was going to say the same
33:56
surely we know from all those pictures
33:58
which is the biggest
33:59
not quite but they're sort of all
34:01
similar size
34:02
they're all identical inside it's very
34:04
weird that someone wouldn't um
34:06
it could be that one's the tallest one's
34:08
the widest and one's the
34:10
um whatever the other dp's
34:14
could be that no one could be asked to
34:15
measure them because they're just big
34:16
porch swings
34:18
professional measurers have better
34:19
things to do yeah i don't actually know
34:20
which of them is the largest but there
34:22
are all these sort of world's largest
34:24
things all over the place
34:25
and there are lots of conflicts between
34:27
people aren't there so how large are
34:29
they
34:29
and i don't mean the exact measurements
34:30
i mean if i was sitting on one is it
34:32
like when you go to those places where
34:34
they have big chairs and big tables and
34:35
you're meant to look like uh which
34:37
places are these
34:38
you can go to places that make you feel
34:40
like one of the borrowers where they
34:41
have just giant furniture
34:42
can you yeah dan is looking at me like
34:45
there's one of these places on every
34:46
corner
34:49
[Laughter]
34:51
the world's largest chair is a really
34:54
epic battle between lots of different
34:56
places
34:57
um it started in 1905 and
35:00
strap yourselves in this is gonna be a
35:02
long anecdote uh it started in 1905 and
35:05
gardner massachusetts erected a 12-foot
35:07
tall chair
35:09
and then a place called thomasville
35:11
north carolina
35:12
made one that was 13 feet six inches and
35:14
then those two places
35:16
just got more and more bigger and bigger
35:17
chairs uh eventually
35:19
there was an 18-foot chair in
35:21
thomasville
35:22
uh but then the war happened and then
35:25
after the war there were variously
35:27
largest chairs in bennington vermont
35:30
washington dc
35:31
morristown tennessee binghampton new
35:34
york
35:34
wingdale new york anniston alabama and
35:38
anniston
35:38
alabama had the biggest chair until 2001
35:41
when it was destroyed by a
35:42
storm so all these other towns in
35:45
america had all the biggest chair at
35:46
various times
35:47
but now the world's biggest chair is in
35:49
italy and it's 65
35:51
feet tall 65 feet wow yeah and
35:54
it could be even bigger if it wasn't for
35:56
that dastardly war that interrupted
35:58
them that's the most
36:01
that anyone's ever glossed over the
36:02
second world war
36:06
he was telling the biggest story
36:10
is that the word james is the one that's
36:12
in italy is that in a place called
36:14
manzano yes
36:15
there's another fact about it which is i
36:17
can't believe this
36:18
is that a third of the world's chairs
36:20
are manufactured there
36:22
they might do that because some like in
36:23
china where there's sock city
36:25
and there's like there's some villages
36:27
and towns that just decide that's what
36:29
we do
36:30
we everything here is chair-based or
36:32
soft yeah but if you think about how
36:33
many chairs there must be in the world
36:35
everyone in the world on average is
36:36
gonna weld at least a chair aren't they
36:38
yeah but that's something like how many
36:40
chairs how many chairs are you sitting
36:42
on right now
36:45
one yeah how many socks you're wearing
36:47
well yeah i do see your point yeah
36:49
but there are is it three
36:55
um no i do see that point but
36:58
like around this table there's more than
37:00
one two chairs per person
37:02
yeah that's true and also there are just
37:03
two there's too much variety in chairs
37:05
for them all to be coming from the same
37:06
factory whereas sucks at the same time i
37:08
don't think it can be
37:10
socks aren't all the same i mean not
37:11
even the two that i'm worried about
37:16
so there is a thing in america a lot of
37:18
these are roadside attractions where
37:20
they would try and get people into your
37:21
town
37:22
or whatever so there are a few world's
37:24
largest balls of twine
37:26
oh yeah this is a huge thing on
37:27
wikipedia there's one entry
37:29
about the world's largest board of twine
37:30
and this is what it says it says the
37:32
world's largest ball of twine
37:34
in caucus city was built as a response
37:36
to the minnesota town
37:37
of darwin's efforts to grab the title
37:40
that reads very much like someone from
37:42
corker city
37:44
is unhappy with darwin and they're
37:46
usually the bola twine is it usually
37:48
just one person really isn't it kind of
37:50
just you know like over years and years
37:52
and years just making these balls of
37:53
twine
37:54
yeah it's weirdly pointless what a great
37:56
life that'll be
37:58
everything we do is a little bit
37:59
pointless isn't it i think this is more
38:01
pointless
38:02
we're all gonna die in the end no but
38:05
i'm not sure i want to continue doing
38:06
the podcast
38:09
but this is always the thing the thing i
38:10
find very old with a lot of these like
38:12
the world's largest chair
38:13
is it's not a chair it's a model of a
38:15
chair no
38:16
it's still a chair you can sit on it
38:18
yeah what about the world's largest
38:20
banana which is a model of a banana no
38:22
no because that the world's largest
38:23
banana no no that's that's different
38:24
because
38:25
you'd have to make the inside of a
38:26
banana out of bananas i see i think i
38:29
see the distinction you're drawing and i
38:30
think it's fair
38:31
thank you oh i was coming around to you
38:32
always so this guy's made the world's
38:34
largest knitting needles he claims
38:36
they're 13 feet long and i actually
38:37
don't think they are knitting
38:38
but what does something like disqualify
38:40
is it because you can't knit
38:42
with it by the use of the thing for the
38:44
thing i bet he has
38:45
done some knitting like the world's
38:46
largest chunks yeah the world's
38:48
largest in the knitting needle one i
38:50
often see these
38:52
i see these things because we spend a
38:53
lot of time on the internet but i have
38:55
often seen
38:55
world's most largest functional knitting
38:58
needle as an
38:59
actual record right that's interesting
39:01
okay now i'm intrigued
39:04
i'm so weird underneath our knowledge is
39:06
that i mentioned the world's largest
39:07
knitting needle
39:08
james has often come across a
39:11
functional one
39:15
[Laughter]
39:27
australia has a load of these things
39:29
there's an incredible wikipedia page
39:31
about the big things of australia
39:33
is what they're called and um they're
39:36
about 150
39:38
what's the famous as a big pineapple i
39:40
think yeah they've got the world's
39:41
largest artificial prawn
39:43
world's largest artificial trout
39:44
artificial banana artificial eagle
39:46
that's weird i thought i'd been to the
39:48
world's largest artificial prawn
39:51
but it wasn't i've never been to
39:52
australia bizarre i thought it was in
39:55
maybe it's a touring prawn
39:57
[Laughter]
39:59
it's pretty big james it could probably
40:00
have made it across at the time
40:03
since you've seen it i thought it was in
40:06
florida keys but
40:08
near the coast when i think about it it
40:10
might have been a crayfish
40:13
that is so embarrassing there's one of
40:16
these things done
40:17
there's one thing it's called the big a
40:19
as rock right and it's a 1 to 40 scale
40:22
model of
40:23
rock which way is the scale it's smaller
40:25
oh right
40:26
so wikipedia points out it's technically
40:27
not a big thing as it is substantially
40:30
smaller than the item
40:35
can i can i bring it back to swings
40:36
quickly yeah it was a very big year last
40:39
year for the swing
40:40
uh 2016 because the swing was
40:43
inducted into the toy hall of fame oh
40:46
that's it
40:47
yeah they induct a few things in one go
40:49
so
40:50
um the little peoples i don't know if
40:52
you know that it's a it's a type of toy
40:53
it's made by
40:54
fisher-price um that was inducted
40:56
dungeons and dragons
40:58
was inducted the little people
41:01
they've tied for the most nominations
41:03
because there's a there's a big final
41:04
round and then they pick
41:05
three um so the magic eight ball
41:08
ties with the little people for the most
41:10
nominations of something that's not made
41:12
it into the ball
41:13
so the magic 8 ball is still isn't it
41:14
still not in there yeah and then when
41:16
you shake it it goes not looking good
41:21
so the swing was up against this year
41:23
this is who it had to beat to get into
41:24
the hall of fame
41:25
uh it was up against uno the car yeah
41:29
yeah it was up against care bears it was
41:32
up against rock'em sock'em robots i
41:33
don't know if you remember that
41:35
transformers coloring books
41:38
oh they're an adult thing really these
41:40
days yeah that might have disqualified
41:42
it and bubble wrap
41:43
so it managed to rap it managed to
41:45
defeat bubble wrap
41:46
and wrap's not a tie i wouldn't say well
41:49
it's in the past they have put the stick
41:51
into the toy hall of fame haven't they
41:53
yeah yes no they no they that was the
41:55
that got awarded the oldest toy i think
41:58
or the lifetime achievement award yeah
41:59
yeah
42:00
something like that yeah but yeah so the
42:02
swing has finally made it in
42:04
have you guys heard of kiking what is
42:07
keeking
42:07
it's competitive swinging in estonia and
42:10
it's a really big deal and it's the
42:11
coolest thing ever i could barely watch
42:13
it so
42:14
it's swinging but all the way over um
42:16
and
42:17
so they're solid swings aren't they
42:19
they're solid yeah so they're on poles
42:20
but the challenge is to have
42:21
as long a pole as possible on your on
42:24
your swing
42:24
well so the the instead of rope coming
42:27
down yeah
42:28
they're like big knitting needles i
42:31
understand now
42:33
but it's terrifying right because as you
42:35
swing up that your feet are
42:37
strapped onto the swing but as you swing
42:39
up to the point where you're almost
42:41
going over the top
42:42
you just as you can imagine you hang
42:43
upside down there
42:45
just before you fall back oh yes those
42:47
yeah yeah yeah and they're ridiculously
42:48
high so the the world record at the
42:50
moment is a
42:51
sort of knitting needle of 7.03 meters
42:54
so that means that you'd be hanging
42:56
upside down 14 meters high which is
42:58
about five stories high
42:59
yeah that is you could almost get up to
43:01
the world's tallest chair
43:03
from out there so there's some
43:05
orangutans in
43:06
um the netherlands uh in the
43:10
owen hans and park rainen which have
43:12
obviously pronounced wrong
43:14
uh which is a zoo and they've forgotten
43:15
how to swing in trees
43:18
because they're um they just didn't have
43:20
any trees in where they're living yeah
43:21
so they've forgotten how to do it but
43:22
then they got them some trees
43:24
and they were like great we got some
43:26
trees but now the orangutans didn't know
43:28
how to
43:28
swing in them so they hired an olympic
43:30
gymnast
43:34
to swing in the trees and to try and
43:37
like show them what to do
43:38
that is incredible the idea is to
43:40
encourage them into doing that
43:42
does it not exercise like why do they
43:44
want them to do it well yeah because
43:46
that's what orangutans do they kind of
43:48
what you want from a zoo isn't it when
43:49
you see an orangutan you want it to be
43:50
swinging does this woman dress up
43:54
was it a woman yeah does he dress up as
43:57
an orangutan
43:59
i don't think he does now but you that
44:01
would make sense
44:02
i really hope they come back in a few
44:04
months and the orangutans are all
44:05
landing you know perfectly the pose
44:15
okay that is it that is all of our facts

hello and welcome to another episode of
01:13
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:16
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:17
covent garden
01:18
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
01:20
here with james harkin
01:22
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
01:24
and once again we have gathered around
01:26
the microphones only this time not with
01:28
our four favorite facts from the last
01:29
seven days
01:30
but with the best four facts sent in by
01:32
you the listener
01:33
and so in no particular order here we go
01:37
starting with fact number one and that
01:39
is you chizinski
01:41
yeah my fact was tweeted into us by
01:42
someone called owen nelligan
01:44
so thanks for this owen this fact is
01:46
that the person who invented the lie
01:48
detector
01:49
married the first person he interrogated
01:51
with it did he say will you eventually
01:52
marry me and she said no and then it
01:54
came up as a lie
01:55
well it's so close to that according to
01:57
a book about the history of lie
01:59
detection and polygraphs he
02:01
so this is a guy called john augustus
02:02
larson and he was using a lie detector
02:05
to interrogate margaret taylor
02:07
and it was about a diamond ring that
02:09
she'd had stolen and so
02:11
the result of the interrogation was that
02:12
her diamond ring was found and returned
02:14
to her
02:14
and she was so grateful that she
02:17
volunteered her services to him to play
02:19
criminal in other lie detection tests
02:21
and then after about a year apparently
02:23
he had her on the lie detection test
02:24
and he said do you love me and she said
02:27
no
02:27
and it came up as a lie that's
02:34
no no i really don't oh well if the
02:36
machine's saying it sorry well i guess
02:38
the machine's saying it do you take this
02:41
man
02:42
to be your lovely wedded husband no
02:44
sorry
02:45
[Laughter]
02:47
because it made news the fact that they
02:48
got married it was headline news at the
02:50
time
02:50
uh the san francisco examiner had it on
02:53
its front page it said inventor of lie
02:55
detector traps bride
02:59
they had their wedding as well with all
03:01
the police force there
03:02
and um oh yeah yeah and they played they
03:05
played a prank on them basically
03:06
immediately after the ceremony they
03:08
picked them up
03:10
they handcuffed them and they packed
03:11
them into a paddy wagon and just
03:13
abandoned them
03:14
in a countryside just left them yeah
03:16
it's a classic police prank yeah
03:18
so i'm a bit confused about him
03:20
inventing this thing john august has
03:21
lasted the man who married
03:22
the woman he interrogated yes so the
03:25
invention of the line detector involved
03:26
several stages i guess but what he did
03:29
was
03:29
he integrated a test for blood pressure
03:31
that had already been invented by
03:33
someone called william
03:34
marston and he integrated that with a
03:37
way to measure your pulse your
03:38
respiration
03:39
and your skin conductivity and put that
03:41
all together
03:42
and then that was what became called the
03:44
polygraph so there are lots of different
03:45
people who might have invented it
03:47
yes if only we had a way of telling who
03:50
was the real one
03:53
and you say someone called william
03:55
marston but william marston
03:56
is hugely famous in the world of comic
03:58
books because he is the inventor
04:00
of wonder woman oh yeah yeah so the
04:02
inventor of the lie detector
04:04
also uh well the inventor of one of the
04:06
stages of the lie detector also created
04:08
wonder woman
04:09
and it was his wife um elizabeth who
04:12
helped him sort of connect the dots
04:14
about the idea of emotion
04:15
and blood pressure being combined as a
04:17
thing that you could tell people's
04:19
emotions from i guess for
04:20
truth or false how did he how did he
04:22
trap her with
04:23
the i assume uh
04:35
though is it if you can't lie that's not
04:37
a lie detector because every single
04:38
thing you say will be the truth
04:39
it's just a lie preventer oh yeah yeah
04:41
that's true just very quickly on william
04:43
marston he had a really odd relationship
04:45
because
04:45
they they're not sure who wonder woman
04:47
was probably based on they think that it
04:48
was his wife elizabeth but also they
04:50
think it was this other lady called
04:52
olive
04:53
turns out that they had an open
04:54
relationship and they're based on both
04:57
so just a little nugget though he lived
04:58
with both women didn't he yeah he did
04:59
yeah yeah which of those two was the one
05:01
who wore the weird outfit
05:03
one of them wore the outfit but the
05:04
other one had a golden lasso yeah
05:07
he wasn't a very creative man at all he
05:09
was a bit of a self-promoter wasn't he i
05:11
think that's why we associate him with
05:12
the polygraph these days
05:14
so there was a gillette advert in 1938
05:16
which he appeared on
05:17
to say that um the company's raises were
05:19
better than the competition
05:21
but he's using the polygraph yeah he
05:22
sort of hooks people up to it
05:25
which race is best is a gilletta
05:27
wilkinson sword
05:28
and presumably if they say wilkins and
05:30
swords they can't cut it
05:32
yeah these polygraphs don't actually
05:33
work do they no this is the thing it's
05:35
amazing these things are complete crops
05:36
because they don't work but they're
05:37
still used or are they not used anymore
05:39
used
05:40
but am i right saying in court they
05:42
don't necessarily take them as solid
05:43
evidence they do they do on jeremy kyle
05:45
though right but they're used in lots of
05:47
other processes so there was an article
05:49
this week about how
05:50
trump's having real problems with
05:52
getting a border control
05:53
force up so he wanted to increase us
05:55
border control by thousands
05:56
and actually their numbers are
05:58
decreasing at the moment the us border
06:00
control and one of the reasons for that
06:01
is that two-thirds of them
06:03
fail the lie detector test that you have
06:04
to pass to get into us border control
06:07
i didn't know you do you need to pass
06:08
one to become president i do not believe
06:11
so
06:13
but the so if you are a particularly
06:15
guilty person just in general
06:17
you might fail a lie detector test just
06:19
because you
06:20
think of what would happen if you had
06:22
total light or if you had committed the
06:24
crime that they're asking you about
06:25
yeah so that will cause you a spike in
06:27
blood pressure or a spike in temperature
06:29
or spike in your heart rate or whatever
06:31
and also um you can normalize the
06:34
responses so if they're
06:35
asking you control questions at the
06:37
beginning and you let's say you bite
06:39
your
06:39
tongue or you you know stab the inside
06:41
of your leg with a fork or whatever
06:42
while
06:43
that's happening then that will cause a
06:45
big spike and i think well those spikes
06:46
are normal when he's answering those
06:48
control questions so later on when we're
06:50
asking him about the murder you might
06:51
have the same spike and they'll say well
06:52
no he didn't do it do you think they'll
06:53
be suspicious because you bring a fork
06:55
into the polygraph test
06:58
yeah they might well you're bleeding out
06:59
of your mouth mr murray is it true that
07:03
you stole
07:03
all the fox from the canteen
07:08
yeah so on the guide that this fact is
07:10
about yeah
07:11
he sold the crime that he was put in
07:13
charge of solving so there was this
07:15
mystery on the campus of the university
07:17
of california
07:17
over who was stealing lots of the
07:20
students possessions so margaret taylor
07:21
who he married had a diamond ring stolen
07:24
and he figured out who it was because he
07:25
did a lie detector test on all of these
07:27
students
07:28
and this is how it worked it ended up
07:30
working apparently to prove that the lie
07:32
detector test would work forever more
07:33
the way it worked was he sat someone
07:35
down who was called helen graham
07:37
and asked her if she'd taken the money
07:39
uh she exploded with rage
07:41
tore all of her equipment off ran over
07:43
to the recording device to tear it up
07:44
and said it was outrageous that anyone
07:46
was allowed to use that she had to be
07:47
restrained
07:48
and said that otherwise she would have
07:49
beaten the officer in the face
07:52
so it sounds like she did it and she did
07:55
then admit later on
07:59
so that's how they work they just send
08:02
you flying into a race
08:03
i think that is how they work isn't it
08:04
like really the only way that a
08:07
polygraph could possibly work
08:08
in a court of law is by making you admit
08:12
to something
08:12
right because people think they work
08:14
yeah yeah so they then become truthful
08:17
so there was this was supposedly a
08:19
method they used uh
08:21
in uh bc era to determine whether
08:24
someone was lying or not
08:25
supposedly in india this was used what
08:27
you do is you get a donkey
08:28
and you'd cover its tail in soot right
08:30
and then you put the donkey in a tent
08:32
okay and this is a dark tent and it's at
08:35
night that you do this and then you put
08:36
the suspected liar in there
08:38
and you say we've got a magic donkey and
08:41
you
08:42
you you have to grab the tail of the
08:44
donkey when you're in there and if it
08:46
breaks
08:46
we'll know that you committed the crime
08:48
but actually what it is is if they come
08:50
out and they haven't got set all over
08:51
their hands
08:52
then you know that they didn't even grab
08:54
the donkey's tail in the first place
08:56
so that's how they tell that you're the
08:58
the wrong there's a story that charles
09:00
napier did that who's
09:01
one of the inventors of logarithms but
09:03
he did it with a chicken
09:05
so he had his a dark room put soot on
09:07
his
09:08
and then ask people andy
09:12
i knew you were gonna say it but i'm so
09:14
so pleased when you did
09:17
i know he felt he did a dark room put
09:19
sat on his chicken and then told people
09:21
it was a magic chicken and again it was
09:22
the w it was a people without
09:24
sutter hands who he knew were guilty
09:26
yeah but but actually even if i was
09:27
innocent
09:28
i wouldn't take the risk of the chicken
09:30
actually being magic and wrong
09:34
because
09:36
it could be a magic chicken who's just
09:38
got it in for you yeah exactly
09:40
that chicken's always hated me because
09:43
you do assume that if you pull a
09:44
donkey's tail it probably will bray
09:46
and i think even in the illogical days
09:48
of the bc era
09:50
people knew that they might do that even
09:53
if they hadn't committed the crime
09:55
what are we meant to say for the bc era
09:57
what's the correct way of saying it
09:58
oh i think this was before the time of
10:01
christ
10:02
yeah before the common era i think yeah
10:04
what's the e
10:05
with the bce era james said it actually
10:08
said it literally
10:10
wow but we could switch those two
10:13
sentences
10:15
do you want to know another method of
10:17
telling the truth yes please
10:18
from which era is it from this is from
10:20
the ad era the
10:22
dominar era exactly yeah what does ad
10:25
stand for
10:29
um so this is uh in china it's uh when
10:32
you're being prosecuted
10:33
you have to hold a mouth full of rice
10:36
right during the prosecutor's speech
10:38
now it was believed that when people are
10:40
anxious they stop salivating
10:42
okay so because and you know that
10:43
feeling of having a dry mouth when
10:44
you're nervous
10:45
so if the rice was dry by the time the
10:48
prosecutor finished speaking
10:50
it was believed that you were guilty
10:52
because you hadn't been salivating and
10:54
the prosecutor is talking about your
10:55
crime
10:56
which is unreliable because actually
10:57
they could have just taken lots of
10:58
ecstasy for instance
11:01
that's true does that give you a dry
11:03
mouth yeah i've heard yeah yeah
11:07
you know do you know who invented the um
11:09
first way of detect measuring your pulse
11:12
oh that must be a before common era
11:15
thing isn't it
11:17
it's not so actually maybe it's the
11:18
first way that this
11:20
uh book i was reading claimed uh so it
11:22
was galileo
11:23
apparently but it's really clever so at
11:25
the time people didn't have watches
11:26
where you could you know obviously check
11:28
someone's pulse against the ticking of
11:29
your watch
11:30
you'd typically check it by the sundial
11:36
full day um so he invented this thing
11:38
called the
11:39
pulse syllogium and what he did was he
11:42
rigged up this pendulum so he hung this
11:44
pendulum
11:45
up and then he got the pendulum going
11:46
and it was attached to a thread
11:48
so it was swinging and attached to this
11:50
thread that he could pull on to make it
11:51
longer or shorter
11:52
and he to have the pendulum in one hand
11:55
with his hand on that thread
11:56
and then he'd test someone's pulse with
11:58
the other hand and he'd make the string
12:00
longer or shorter until it was exactly
12:03
in time with that person's pulse
12:05
and that's a really accurate way of
12:06
measuring it because the length of the
12:07
pendulum
12:08
tells you how fast their pulse is going
12:09
and then you know if that's normal isn't
12:11
that really clever that is really that
12:12
it is he was pretty clever wasn't he he
12:14
was okay
12:15
yeah there is a method where so this is
12:18
a test they tried in the uh
12:20
1980s basically there were loads of
12:21
different lie detector tests and would
12:23
they hope that they're going to get a
12:24
really accurate one at some point
12:26
um there's a test called p300 which is
12:28
basically that
12:29
after you see a very distinct image your
12:32
brain will have a little burst of
12:33
activity
12:34
at 300 milliseconds after you see it
12:36
right right so the idea was
12:38
if someone uh had committed a crime
12:40
let's say
12:41
uh i mugged someone who was wearing an
12:44
orange suit
12:44
right and i saw that suit again later my
12:48
brain would register that same burst of
12:49
activity but then an orange suit is
12:51
quite unusual
12:52
so i think if i saw an orange suit i
12:54
would also be
12:55
this is the problem and you have to find
12:56
things that the criminals saw
12:58
and that are unique so maybe he works in
13:01
an orange suit
13:01
factory and he won't register the same
13:04
yeah thing and actually criminals wear
13:07
orange boiler suits don't they yeah
13:09
that's true so he might just be worried
13:11
about the prospect to get into prison
13:12
for a crime he didn't commit
13:13
so that did not work basically so is the
13:15
logic there that if you know that tests
13:17
happening if you commit a crime you
13:18
should do it in a place with no
13:20
distinguishing features like slough
13:26
[Applause]
13:28
[Music]
13:30
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:32
that is
13:33
andy my fact is that liechtenstein
13:36
has roughly two companies for every
13:39
person who lives there
13:41
so this is a fact from a guy called
13:43
richard smith at richard av smith
13:45
so probably we're not saying that these
13:47
people all own two companies are we no
13:49
we're not because a lot of the companies
13:51
are from overseas but they're registered
13:53
in liechtenstein
13:54
because it's a tax haven and they make
13:57
all their money
13:58
from extremely dubious financial
14:00
arrangements they don't make all their
14:01
money or indeed any of their money from
14:03
dubious
14:03
arrangements i'm sure just in case the
14:06
liars are listening
14:07
i'm sure they make a lot of their money
14:09
from practices that are frowned on in
14:11
the wider international community but
14:12
which happen to be legal in
14:14
liechtenstein
14:16
but they make money on false teeth don't
14:18
they i remember
14:20
there's an old qui fact that they're the
14:21
biggest exporters of false teeth in the
14:23
world
14:25
i think china might be about to overtake
14:26
them
14:28
but listen time has been punching above
14:29
his weight for some time yeah they've
14:31
got
14:31
35 000 people it's amazing that
14:34
they export more than china how many of
14:36
the companies are false teeth factories
14:39
almost all of them actually yeah there's
14:41
very little tax haven stuff going on
14:43
are we talking teeth with gums like as
14:45
in full sets of
14:47
dentures individually so not individual
14:49
teeth well i guess
14:51
it depends doesn't it i think it's
14:52
dentures i think it's one company that
14:54
makes all these dentures
14:55
i think it's in lichtenstein it's a
14:57
funny old place isn't it it's an amazing
14:59
little place
15:00
yeah i mean it's named after the guy who
15:02
bought it
15:04
that's pretty amazing and and the family
15:06
who still
15:07
uh are the royalty there are the
15:09
descendants of him so it's still the
15:10
lichtenstein family you just never see
15:12
that because they never use their
15:13
surname
15:14
so weird it's like queen elizabeth you
15:16
know you rarely see windsor
15:18
oh is she not called england
15:19
[Laughter]
15:21
so it's 160 square kilometers which is
15:24
174th the size of yorkshire
15:27
wow i mean i don't know how big
15:28
yorkshire is but it's quite big
15:30
yorkshire's quite big but it's smaller
15:31
than
15:31
like england for instance yeah yeah
15:35
i read a really good fact in lonely
15:36
planet about liechtenstein
15:38
which is that um their last military
15:40
engagement
15:41
was in 1866 it's the last time
15:45
they sent soldiers out uh so 80 soldiers
15:49
uh went out and 81 returned they made a
15:53
friend
15:54
and brought one well what is a friend
15:57
other than someone that you've captured
15:59
well he knows an italian guy who's just
16:01
like i love you guys you're really fun
16:03
let's i'll come back to liechtenstein
16:05
sounds like stockholm syndrome to me
16:08
um in 2007 170 swiss troops
16:12
marched into liechtenstein by accident
16:15
on a training exercise they crossed the
16:17
border
16:17
so basically it's their army going into
16:19
another country which could be kind of
16:21
a bad thing i guess but the truth is
16:24
that liechtenstein's defense is actually
16:26
looked after by switzerland
16:29
witcherstein doesn't really have an army
16:30
of its own that's
16:32
such a confusing defense attack strategy
16:35
that's going through your head so you
16:36
could march in
16:37
and then if anyone
16:38
[Laughter]
16:40
stop hitting yourself they've done it a
16:43
few times actually
16:45
they threw grenades into lichtenstein i
16:48
think in the late 60s really
16:49
and another time they set a bit on fire
16:51
with flamethrowers they started a forest
16:52
fire
16:53
they did ring to apologize after the
16:55
2007 one didn't they i think they
16:57
they went in lichtenstein didn't notice
16:59
they ran away again quickly after they
17:01
realized and then they called the next
17:02
day to say i'm really sorry we
17:03
accidentally invaded you
17:04
and the minister of the interior said
17:06
it's no problem at all these things
17:08
happen
17:08
so that happened again in 2002
17:11
when british marines invaded spain by
17:14
mistake uh thinking that they were
17:15
practicing invading gibraltar
17:17
despite the fact gibraltar has a massive
17:18
rock sticking out of it that they
17:21
and they said well the beach is very
17:22
confusing actually so they stormed the
17:24
shore they had assault rifles they had
17:25
mortars
17:26
they took up a defensive position just
17:28
to face a couple of spanish fishermen
17:30
and a couple of local policemen who said
17:32
gibraltar's over there and the mod later
17:35
on said
17:36
it was clearly an embarrassing and
17:37
unfortunate incident they made their
17:39
apologies and left
17:42
but when they said gibraltar's over
17:43
there does that mean the army
17:45
asked for directions no i don't think
17:47
they did i think the
17:48
the the spanish police must have known
17:50
that they were doing a training exercise
17:52
yeah rather so they were being invaded
17:54
by britain yeah
17:56
although apologizing and leaving it's
17:57
very british way to invade somewhere
17:59
yeah sorry
18:01
the ruler prince of liechtenstein is the
18:04
wealthiest monarch
18:05
in europe wow he's in the billions isn't
18:09
he he's five billion i think
18:10
because they're both in the billions uh
18:12
yeah well the queen's because the queen
18:14
the crown wealth doesn't actually count
18:15
towards the queen's personal
18:17
wealth officially otherwise obviously
18:19
she'd be
18:20
well up there yeah um but yeah he's he's
18:22
loaded but people love him so in july
18:24
2012
18:25
liechtenstein did a bit of a turkey and
18:28
they
18:28
there was a referendum
18:32
i think we can call it that there was a
18:33
referendum on whether the prince should
18:35
have all of his powers extended
18:37
and whether he should have the power to
18:39
veto the results of any future
18:40
referendum and
18:42
76 of the country said yes yeah we think
18:44
if they're
18:45
ever referenda in future you should be
18:47
allowed to overrule them immediately
18:48
so they love the guy yeah they do and
18:51
and he
18:52
um he's an interesting character because
18:54
during that period he threatened to just
18:55
leave
18:56
he was like i think that was why they
18:58
voted yeah he said if it goes the other
19:00
way i'm just going to leave
19:01
i'm going to take all my money i'm going
19:02
to take the name of the country with me
19:04
i have to think of a new name i'm taking
19:06
back that italian who came back with the
19:08
army
19:08
i'm taking everything and he um he
19:11
because they had another referendum
19:12
where they wanted to talk about abortion
19:14
and whether it should be legal because
19:15
it's illegal in like uh liechtenstein
19:17
and they said we want it legal and he
19:18
just went no sorry
19:20
i'm i'm overruling that it's not
19:22
happening he once a year throws a big
19:24
party for everyone in liechtenstein to
19:26
come to
19:27
his the palaces but actually 20 odd
19:29
percent of those wanted him to leave the
19:31
country
19:33
yes the people invited to this party
19:35
we'll put them we'll put them over near
19:36
the toilets
19:37
yeah he doesn't hold grudges like that
19:40
36
19:41
000 people invited to the same party and
19:43
it's supposed to be a garden party on
19:44
his lawn so i just wonder how big his
19:46
lawn is
19:47
i guess if you own liechtenstein the
19:49
whole thing is your garden
19:50
so it's just like that's the party
19:51
wherever you are so just stay at home
19:53
yeah
19:54
well how do you not attend the party
19:55
then if you're annoyed about the
19:56
reference that's why everyone attends
19:58
the party to leave
19:59
30 000 isn't that many though is it like
20:01
if you think about a football
20:03
game like man united game would have
20:05
what 70 000 or something i guess
20:07
it's quite a lot i'm thinking of my flat
20:09
now so i think his garden is probably
20:11
bigger than your flat
20:13
but not by much i know what you're
20:14
saying yeah i've never been to your flat
20:17
no oh sorry yeah we had a party um
20:20
i'm afraid not the whole population of
20:22
the podcast was invited
20:26
[Applause]
20:29
[Music]
20:30
okay it is time for fact number three
20:33
and that is my
20:34
fact my fact was sent in by uh luke
20:37
haynes that was on email
20:39
in 47 bc there was a giant robot
20:42
cleopatra
20:43
walking the streets of alexandria
20:45
squirting milk
20:46
from her breasts onto the heads of
20:48
onlookers okay
20:50
yes this was sent to you personally was
20:52
it that this was sent to
20:54
all of us but i think it was edged
20:55
towards me in the email
20:57
um and do you stand by it well i did
21:00
when i read it and sent it to you and
21:01
let you all research it and now uh
21:03
having googled it
21:04
i can't find any evidence that it's real
21:07
it appears in a new statesman article
21:09
um and it's delivered at the top of the
21:11
piece very confidently as if it's fact
21:13
and i just can't seem to find it
21:15
anywhere else but uh
21:17
i still stand by it okay so i read um a
21:19
review of a book called cleopatra alive
21:22
by stacy schiff
21:23
yes but the review was by mary beard who
21:25
i think we do trust
21:27
uh as a classicist and she wrote
21:30
about a famous procession in honor of
21:32
the god dionysus
21:34
um in the third century bc uh by
21:37
ptolemy ii so that's before cleopatra
21:40
and they wrote that there were floats
21:42
and one of the floats had a large statue
21:44
which stood up mechanically without
21:46
anyone laying a hand on it and sat back
21:48
down again when it had poured a libation
21:51
of milk
21:52
wow so i don't know if this is the same
21:55
thing
21:56
or even if that's true but i you know
21:58
that is from a good source
21:59
yep but it seems to me like maybe two
22:02
things have been conflated i don't know
22:03
though
22:03
was it a statue of cleopatra because
22:05
that would be truly extraordinary before
22:07
300 years before she was born yeah well
22:09
it might not have been before the first
22:10
cleopatra because cleopatra was actually
22:12
cleopatra the seventh yes
22:14
the one who is famous you know for for
22:16
um
22:17
having affairs with julius caesar and
22:19
mark energy and things like that
22:20
she was the seventh you know how she
22:22
hooked up with caesar
22:26
yeah it was it was like their version of
22:29
tinder and this is how it works
22:31
um she was married at the time to her
22:33
brother as
22:34
was customary so she actually married
22:36
both of her brothers both called ptolemy
22:38
and she engineered the death of both of
22:40
them as well i smell a sick car
22:42
um no so she decided that she wanted uh
22:45
to hang out with caesar because he's a
22:46
very powerful man i wanted to have a bit
22:48
of flirting with him and she was having
22:49
a feud with her husband and see
22:51
ptolemy uh and caesar was ptolemy's
22:53
enemy sorry which ptolemy we're talking
22:54
about we're talking about ptolemy her
22:55
brother orton her other brother
22:58
she really had a type did she filling in
23:01
the profile of the dating agency
23:03
must be six foot uh called ptolemy my
23:06
brother
23:09
yeah it was tommy her brother um which
23:11
one
23:13
her other brother
23:18
anyway he said you obviously can't see
23:19
caesar because he's my enemy and so she
23:21
had herself wrapped up in a carpet and
23:24
smuggled into caesar's personal quarters
23:25
and then
23:26
i think this is a famous depiction of it
23:27
she's always unrolled in films of
23:29
cleopatra isn't she
23:30
i love that it's so fun the idea of
23:32
being unrolled from a kind of thing
23:34
you know what it sounds like fun but i
23:36
reckon when you do it it's not gonna be
23:37
much fun
23:38
because the carpet will be round by the
23:40
end of the rolling process but as it
23:42
gets closer and closer towards your body
23:43
as you're being unrolled obviously the
23:45
carpet will be more in your shape and
23:46
you'll be
23:47
sort of bumping over the floor
23:51
yeah as if you haven't suffocated in the
23:53
carpet maybe there's a delay
23:56
climax of just a dead cleopatra rolls
23:59
out in front of us
24:04
inbred then if they were all marrying
24:05
their siblings yes yeah but she wasn't
24:07
having babies with them it was
24:09
all about keeping power that would be
24:10
disgusting right yeah
24:12
it was all about keeping power so she
24:13
married one of the ptolemies when he was
24:15
10
24:15
and that was so that he could be the
24:17
co-ruler oh okay but the thing is i
24:19
don't think they were particularly
24:20
against
24:21
having sex with each other i loved it
24:23
you know i loved
24:24
it um cleopatra had only six
24:27
great-great-grandparents out of a
24:28
possible 16. oh wow
24:32
wow wow but on the plus side she had a
24:34
lot of extra toes
24:37
is that a plus my toes aren't that
24:40
useful
24:40
i feel like i've got enough it would
24:42
make the game of this little piggy goes
24:44
to market go on a long time
24:47
justin's little piggy married his
24:49
brother
24:50
it was also called ptolemy
24:57
just speaking of toes um i found out a
25:00
thing a while ago ancient egypt
25:01
um this is sort of going into robots
25:05
um ancient egypt uh they actually worked
25:07
out how to make
25:08
a strap-on toe for people who'd lost a
25:10
toe
25:11
so that it worked so that they could
25:13
continue to walk like an egyptian that's
25:15
a terrible
25:16
cause that's a terrible joke um no so um
25:19
it's amazing they found it's the oldest
25:20
use of
25:21
um augmenting a human prosthetic where
25:24
they were able to walking in and they
25:25
found that it's because it's a leather
25:26
and wooden
25:27
thing that they would strap onto the toe
25:29
uh the flexibility of it was up to 86
25:31
percent which
25:32
meant that it literally worked like how
25:34
a normal toe would function it wasn't
25:36
so that was like um they must have had
25:38
prototype models and refined it refined
25:40
it so the flexibility allowed them
25:41
perfect
25:42
gate for what they had before really
25:44
there's a specific rule in american
25:46
football that you're not allowed to kick
25:47
the ball with an artificial toe
25:50
really yeah why because that's spring
25:52
loaded or something
25:54
well basically they all pretty much all
25:57
the rules in american football
25:58
because people have done something and
26:00
then they have to make a rule against it
26:01
but one of the best kickers of all time
26:03
i think he just got his record beaten
26:05
for the longest ever kick
26:07
um didn't have any toes on one of his
26:09
feet and he had a special
26:11
like fake toe made so that he could kick
26:13
properly
26:14
and it shouldn't really have helped him
26:16
in any way if you look at it it
26:17
shouldn't have helped but
26:18
obviously his um opponents didn't like
26:20
the idea and so they banned it
26:22
that's really pessy yeah that's a shame
26:24
as if that
26:25
yeah um can i just say this this uh
26:28
prosthetic toe dates back
26:29
between the time of 950 and 710 bc
26:32
it's really odd yeah really advanced
26:35
technology
26:35
i have another thing from around 950 bc
26:38
oh yeah
26:39
okay so this is an automaton by king moo
26:42
of zhu in china i probably pronounced
26:46
that wrong but
26:47
that's how it looks uh he had an
26:49
engineer called yanshi
26:51
and yanshi gave him a human-shaped
26:54
figure
26:55
which walked with rapid strides moved
26:57
its head up and down
26:59
and touched its chin and began singing
27:01
in tune
27:02
okay this was supposedly 950 bc wow
27:06
and it the king obviously thought it was
27:08
amazing
27:09
um but then as the performance was
27:11
drawing to an end the robot winked its
27:13
eye and made advances to the ladies of
27:15
the audience
27:16
[Laughter]
27:17
and so the king demanded that it be
27:19
broken down
27:21
until it was proved that it was actually
27:22
an automaton because he thought it was
27:23
some kind of a live thing
27:25
also it was an automaton and i assumed
27:26
the climax was going to be that that was
27:28
obviously just a sleazy man
27:32
just painted himself silver yeah yeah
27:35
um well i mean it's a story from ancient
27:38
china so maybe it's not even
27:39
the bc era yeah they did have uh amazing
27:41
things in the
27:43
18th century so uh these are automata
27:46
which are
27:47
um so they're recorded we have drawings
27:49
of them and things like that so there
27:50
was one called
27:51
uh the vulcan song duck uh built by a
27:53
frenchman called
27:54
jacques de vocanson in 1738 it could
27:57
stretch his wings
27:59
it could smooth its feathers it could
28:01
splash around in water
28:02
it could stretch out and take corn from
28:04
your hand
28:05
and then it produced realistic horrible
28:08
smelling
28:08
duck droppings wow and this was an
28:11
automaton it was unbelievable
28:12
and sometimes when he was put making it
28:15
perform in front of ladies
28:16
uh developing someone put it in a little
28:18
skirt
28:19
i'm not sure why yeah that's what was
28:22
the purpose that it
28:23
served was it useful no entertainment it
28:26
just provided you with
28:27
duck droppings yeah but that's all ducks
28:30
do to be fair
28:31
well and more ducks you can eat them
28:34
that's true
28:34
i don't know i think like if you have
28:36
one of the greatest engineers in france
28:38
coming to you with his new invention
28:40
that all it is is a
28:42
bit of metal that produces duct
28:43
droppings you might be disappointed
28:47
there are there are actually not even
28:49
real duct droppings they're artificial
28:51
duct droppings
28:52
was it for people you know when people
28:53
can't commit to a child those weird
28:55
people who
28:56
buy one of those strange life-like dolls
28:58
instead was it for people who couldn't
28:59
commit to having a real pet duck
29:03
yeah yeah that was it yeah that's very
29:05
thoughtful
29:06
convention so just back to cleopatra
29:09
quickly
29:10
she was she was pretty wild she seemed
29:12
to have a lot of fun
29:13
in her life according to well the
29:15
contemporary records
29:16
when she got into a carpet warehouse
29:18
[Laughter]
29:20
sometimes they wouldn't find her for
29:21
weeks
29:24
imagine her at the oscars as well and
29:26
cleopatra's not appeared weirdly the red
29:28
carpet hasn't been delivered either
29:30
oh my god what's happening here
29:36
like was it elizabeth taylor who played
29:38
cleopatra she
29:43
[Applause]
29:43
[Music]
29:47
okay it is time for our final fact of
29:49
the show and that
29:50
is james okay my fact this week came on
29:53
twitter through
29:54
at flock of words and it is that
29:58
manatees control their buoyancy through
30:00
flatulence
30:04
very clever yeah scary there's loads of
30:06
good ways that animals um control their
30:08
buoyancy because if you think about it
30:09
if you're living in water
30:11
you want to decide how high and low
30:13
you're going to be done yeah really
30:15
yeah so cuttlefish cuttlefish have a
30:18
bone
30:18
with holes in it okay cuddle bone it's
30:21
known as
30:22
and the hollow structure contains both
30:24
liquid and gas
30:25
and the cuttlefish can change its
30:27
density by varying the quantity of
30:29
liquid within its bones
30:31
that's amazing isn't that amazing yeah
30:33
that's incredible that's
30:34
do we do anything like that as humans no
30:37
we go up and down stairs
30:38
yeah but do we do anything on the way i
30:40
mean i fired a bit
30:43
well think about it this way if you're
30:46
in a swimming pool
30:47
yeah and you hold your breath actually
30:50
you wouldn't sink under the water you'll
30:51
be naturally buoyant yes
30:53
and then if you let all the air out you
30:55
naturally naturally go down right
30:57
okay um antarctic krill do things a bit
31:00
like
31:00
humans they don't have these bones like
31:03
cuttlefish and they don't
31:04
fart like manatees but what they do is
31:07
they kind of tread water
31:08
all the time so they're always kind of
31:10
moving their little swimming legs back
31:12
in front to make sure that they stay at
31:14
the right level
31:14
that sounds so annoying i know imagine
31:16
that your whole life you're just
31:18
treading water
31:18
oh that's a horrible metaphor isn't it
31:22
but they migrate i think daily um they
31:25
migrate and they don't migrate
31:26
um across they migrate down and up yeah
31:29
and they move to different bits of the
31:31
water column
31:32
as it's called depending on um food and
31:34
light and heat and this kind of thing
31:36
so that's how animals know where to hunt
31:37
them are we sure they do that because of
31:39
that and not just
31:40
they're trying to get to the surface and
31:42
then they're so knackered they give up
31:43
and they drop back down to the bottom
31:44
again i
31:45
i don't know i think that sounds more
31:46
plausible yeah
31:49
i was reading that manatees they can um
31:50
they have to hold their breath to be
31:52
underwater so they
31:53
constantly have to come up and
31:55
re-oxygenate
31:56
um and they can take a lot in in one big
31:58
breath at something like 90 percent of
32:00
the oxygen just gets
32:01
re um they change 90 of the air sorry
32:04
their lungs in a single breath in a
32:06
single brain humans only change about a
32:07
tenth
32:08
in a single breath wow yeah so what they
32:10
do though is when they go to sleep
32:12
they go down and they effectively do a
32:14
forum of sleepwalking but sleep sleeping
32:17
sorry sleep swimming sleep swimming
32:20
where they
32:22
they come to the surface and they take
32:23
in breath but they're still asleep and
32:24
then go back down
32:25
wow yeah it's just like a bit of scene
32:27
are they definitely still asleep yeah
32:29
because i can't tell
32:29
it's like a half awake it's like they
32:31
say it's as clo yeah exactly it's
32:33
it's as close to yeah it's like if you
32:36
know that you got up in the middle of
32:38
the night to check the the clock to see
32:40
what time it was or it was 4 am and then
32:41
went back to sleep but you can remember
32:43
that
32:43
it's having a conscious memory but sort
32:45
of also being still asleep
32:47
why don't you keep your clock just
32:48
within view of your bed so that you
32:49
don't have to get up every time
32:51
because my clock is my iphone so you've
32:52
got to press the button to turn it on to
32:54
have a look
32:55
yeah it's a bit more complicated um that
32:58
must be so annoying because they can
32:59
only last about 20 minutes underwater
33:00
max without going out for us yeah but
33:02
these constantly well they nap
33:04
all the time they don't have a long
33:06
period of sleep they're not like eight
33:07
hours in the evening they just nap in in
33:10
small little doses all the time they're
33:11
pretty lazy aren't they manatees
33:13
yeah i've seen them they just kind of i
33:15
don't know have you seen them up close
33:16
yeah oh they look so cool they are quite
33:20
cool
33:20
i saw them in a sea center and also in
33:22
the wild and in a sea center they all
33:24
have
33:24
like scars on them this is a few years
33:26
ago from where boats have hit them
33:28
yeah apparently ninety percent i think
33:30
are scarred from from boats
33:31
wow that's really sound but they just
33:33
kind of they're like cows
33:34
that's because they're called sea cows
33:36
sometimes aren't they and they just kind
33:37
of
33:38
go around the sea just grazing and then
33:40
sleeping for a bit
33:41
what do you want them to do build milk
33:44
squirting robots
33:46
but they look like they're really fat
33:48
and like they've got loads of blubber to
33:50
survive in cold waters and they haven't
33:52
it turns out they're all intestines
33:53
because they're herbivores
33:55
so they have to eat loads and loads of
33:56
plants they eat about a tenth of their
33:58
weight in plants every day
34:00
yeah and so they have to constantly be
34:02
grazing and constantly be digesting
34:03
which is where they get all the methane
34:05
for their flatulence
34:06
from but the lack of blubber means they
34:08
can't survive in cold waters so they
34:10
have to migrate when it gets cold in
34:12
winter
34:12
and sometimes they swim into the you
34:14
know the warm water outlets of power
34:16
plants and things like this
34:17
yeah you get hundreds of manatees in
34:19
florida just converging
34:21
in fact did you see in 2015 they got
34:24
i think 19 manatees got stuck in a pipe
34:27
and a drainage pipe in
34:29
florida did the first one go in and then
34:31
the next one tried to save him
34:35
can you imagine how annoying that was
34:36
with the first one why wasn't he
34:37
shouting back
34:38
going back up guys did they get out okay
34:42
yeah they all got out they were fine
34:43
they were a bit late
34:44
they had to go in and put them on
34:46
stretchers really it's amazing seeing
34:48
them yeah they cut the pipe open
34:50
oh okay right they also there's a
34:52
manatee hotline um
34:53
that you can call in florida to talk to
34:55
manatees in your area
34:58
well there's because obviously there's a
35:00
lot of interesting rules that happen
35:02
in florida with manatees there's stuff
35:03
about you know how to touch a manatee
35:04
there was a case where a dad almost went
35:06
to jail because there was a photo of him
35:08
touching amenities that's illegal
35:10
um no i don't mean disgusting touch like
35:12
literally touching
35:13
humanity yeah i know okay i don't think
35:15
anyone was thinking i thought your face
35:17
suggested that's what i was saying
35:18
no it wasn't at all okay but thank you
35:20
for clarifying
35:21
but so one one thing that they often get
35:24
is phone calls um from people
35:26
saying that um we've got huge problems
35:28
the the manatees are in huge danger by
35:31
the shore
35:31
and often what that is is that manatees
35:34
actually mate
35:35
uh very close uh just off the coast of
35:37
florida and they do it in mass groups
35:39
and it looks like there's a struggle
35:41
going on like because as the water is
35:43
going crazy
35:44
so nadia gordon she's a marine mammal
35:46
biologist um
35:48
with the state agency in florida and she
35:50
says the call we usually get is there's
35:52
a mum manatee
35:53
and all the babies are trying to save it
35:54
but then in actuality the large female
35:56
can have up to 20 something
35:58
males trying to breed the one female and
36:00
that's what's going on so it looks like
36:02
they're in serious trouble and that's a
36:03
lot of the phone calls
36:04
that's what happens you get all the
36:05
males who are trying to mate with the
36:07
female and the females in the middle and
36:09
all the males are trying to get at her
36:11
but they don't have claws or horns or
36:12
anything like that or arms or anything
36:14
so they're just kind of bumping each
36:15
other
36:16
so it's kind of like if you're in a
36:17
nightclub and there was a load of
36:20
men trying to get towards a woman but
36:21
they had their arms by their sides and
36:23
they're kind of bumping each other
36:26
it would be a bit like that it's the
36:27
weirdest simile because no one's ever
36:29
been in that situation
36:30
in a nightclub where all the men have
36:32
their arms tied to their sides
36:33
they're bumping towards the one but i
36:35
think i think clubs would be more
36:37
enjoyable for women if that were the
36:38
case
36:38
it certainly would but i think you can
36:40
imagine that
36:42
i can imagine it i i like that i would
36:44
go to that club
36:45
yeah but what happens obviously is that
36:48
the
36:49
one who's best at barging people out the
36:50
way gets the girl
36:52
but then the other ones what do they do
36:54
well actually they tend to just try and
36:56
mate with each other
36:58
right also in a way everyone wins well
37:01
in a way
37:02
everyone else has come joint second
37:04
though
37:06
so you can so obviously they were
37:08
mistaken for a
37:10
mermaid we think in columbus's journal
37:12
he said he'd seen a
37:13
mermaid what the loads were referred to
37:14
as a mermaid and we think it's a manatee
37:16
and you can kind of see
37:18
why they look if you look into their
37:20
eyes there's something very human about
37:21
their faces well they don't have
37:23
eyelashes
37:24
exactly just like you and their eye
37:27
muscles close in a circular motion like
37:29
an aperture on a camera
37:31
right whoa so there are some differences
37:34
obviously between the
37:38
they have large pendulous breasts they
37:41
do there we go
37:42
that's where the name manatee comes from
37:44
uh it's an old carib word meaning breast
37:47
ah okay and columbus when he saw them he
37:49
did say
37:50
that they rose well out of the sea but
37:52
they're not so beautiful as they're said
37:54
to be
37:54
no well their faces had some masculine
37:56
traits and they had scars where they've
37:58
been hit by boats
37:59
yeah they had no eyelashes and yeah on
38:02
the other hand those breasts were very
38:03
pendulous
38:05
they have been at sea for a long time
38:07
that's true
38:08
i guess yeah and they are terrible in
38:10
[Laughter]
38:16
bed
38:18

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:20
qi offices in covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
00:24
here with anna chazinski
00:26
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:28
and once again we have gathered around
00:30
the microphones with our four favorite
00:32
facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order here we go
00:36
starting with you
00:37
anna chazinski my fact this week is that
00:40
the largest diamond
00:41
ever found in russia is called the 26th
00:44
congress of the communist party of the
00:46
soviet union
00:48
that's its name that's its catchy shiny
00:51
name
00:52
uh it's called this because it was mined
00:54
in 1980 and the 26th congress of the
00:56
communist party
00:56
opened in 1981 in february 1981 so i
00:59
think the diamond was actually named
01:01
before the congress happened
01:02
so the congress was this big meeting of
01:04
all the soviet delegates uh all
01:05
important so was it a complete
01:06
coincidence did they think oh what
01:07
should we call our meeting let's name it
01:09
after that lovely big diamond we found
01:10
last year what was that called yeah
01:12
it was that let's quickly have 25
01:14
smaller conferences
01:17
it does not sound like a great party the
01:19
26th congress of the uh the soviet union
01:21
it sounds it sounds
01:22
pretty grim because the leaders were
01:24
pretty sclerotic and elderly at that
01:25
point
01:26
and it was was it brezhnev who was in
01:27
charge at the time yeah and he spoke for
01:29
five hours didn't he
01:31
did he yeah he did a five hour opening
01:33
speech another thing i like about this
01:35
diamond
01:37
wow five hour opening speech that's sort
01:39
of castro level isn't it
01:40
it's ken dodd-level
01:44
less entertaining i reckon but yeah so
01:47
in the soviet union they just used to
01:48
name stuff
01:49
after really soviet things in a way that
01:52
stopped
01:52
making names kind of nice and attractive
01:54
and pretty and started making them sound
01:56
very
01:56
utilitarian yeah and it all started uh
01:59
after the the october revolution in 1917
02:02
so then they started calling babies
02:04
soviet things so in 1924 one baby got
02:07
called octia brina
02:09
after the october revolution and then
02:11
you got you know stalina when stalin
02:13
became a thing
02:16
they used to make names out of acronyms
02:18
of all their hero's names so a really
02:19
popular name
02:20
was mel's which stood for marx engels
02:23
lenin stalin and then actually when
02:25
stalin was
02:26
when the soviet union distanced itself
02:27
from stalin a lot of people dropped the
02:29
s
02:30
after so when they got rid of stalin is
02:32
that where the name mel comes from
02:34
like from the spice girls yeah i don't
02:36
think i think there might be a different
02:38
origin
02:38
to our version of mel yeah mel c the c
02:41
actually stands for communist
02:44
and they'll be as a bolshevik yeah
02:49
just back on diamonds very quickly i was
02:50
looking down this big wikipedia list of
02:53
all the biggest diamonds and um i i saw
02:56
one that caught my eye called the jane
02:57
seymour diamond
02:58
and the jane seabor diamond is a ring
03:00
which was named after the actress jane
03:02
seymour
03:03
she was very proud of it and when they
03:05
were doing it sort of ceremonies she
03:06
would go
03:07
and put the diamond on and be part of
03:09
the ceremony to show it
03:10
she never owned it she was just sort of
03:12
she loved the idea of it
03:14
but what caught my eye is the fact that
03:15
they are selling it now
03:17
so in july 2016 they announced that they
03:19
were going to sell it
03:20
and it led me down the road of seeing
03:22
how interesting it is when you buy an
03:23
expensive diamond how it gets
03:24
delivered to you it's an eight hour
03:26
luxury experience
03:28
in buying the ring so it begins with a
03:31
journey by
03:32
air via helicopter you get chauffeured
03:34
by rolls royce to a private
03:36
luxury cruise and then on the 57th floor
03:39
of a hotel um you're surrounded by hang
03:41
on does the cruise go to the
03:43
is the shop it's a cruise ship a 57
03:45
stalls yeah there's no light
03:46
yeah they go to the 57th floor of a
03:49
hotel they're surrounded by 10 000 roses
03:52
they have an 18 course modern asian menu
03:55
um with diamond encrusted chopsticks i
03:58
don't really like modern asian oh okay
04:00
so this is why you didn't
04:01
you didn't go for it that's why my wife
04:03
was very cheap engaged
04:06
but to top it off they present the ring
04:08
at midnight while
04:10
fireworks go off in the nice guys round
04:12
that's that's how they're selling this
04:13
ring
04:14
and can you turn it down at that point
04:16
could you say actually
04:17
now that i've seen it that sounds like
04:20
such a slice of hot nonsense
04:21
yeah yeah really so you go on a
04:23
helicopter ride to a cruise ship which
04:24
then pointlessly goes in a circle so you
04:26
can go to a hotel
04:27
yeah go to the hotel first yeah i mean
04:29
yeah well you'd be rubbish on a cruise
04:31
wouldn't you
04:32
i'm going on a two-week cruise but
04:34
actually i end up back where i started
04:35
so i'm not gonna bother
04:36
we're just gonna sit in this harbor for
04:38
three weeks i save a lot of money on
04:40
cruises
04:42
but it's interesting if you buy these
04:43
rings um and you get them insured the
04:46
insurance only lasts for so long there's
04:47
a very famous ring called the burton
04:49
taylor
04:49
ring which was richard burden bought for
04:51
elizabeth taylor it cost 1.1 million
04:53
and because of the insurance she was
04:55
only allowed to wear it
04:57
30 days per year that they're willing to
04:59
insure you for
05:00
and because most times they need
05:01
security yeah it's really odd
05:03
when elizabeth taylor was delivered the
05:05
ring so again the crazy security uh
05:07
she was in monaco at the time and three
05:09
men carrying briefcases one of which
05:12
carried the ring
05:13
all went onto the plane at the same time
05:14
and went sort of different seats
05:15
different ways so no one knew which
05:17
briefcase it was going to be in
05:18
and when they finally delivered to it
05:20
the guy with the briefcase that had the
05:21
ring in it
05:22
also had three pairs of stockings that
05:24
cost 50 cents in america but was
05:26
elizabeth taylor's favorite but she
05:28
couldn't get in monaco
05:29
so along with the ring with the three
05:30
stockings and everyone said she was way
05:32
more excited by the stockings than she
05:33
was by
05:34
the ring that eventually arrived right
05:36
on helicopters and diamonds
05:38
yeah uh this massive communist party uh
05:41
diamond was found in the mia
05:43
mine and the mir mine is one of the
05:45
biggest holes in the world
05:46
that's not very kind james i'm sure it's
05:49
got some i mean a bit better than wigan
05:50
but it's
05:52
it's one of the biggest holes in the
05:53
world and um russia has banned
05:55
helicopters from flying over it because
05:57
they can get sucked in
05:58
i think it gets sucked wow yeah what
06:00
sucks
06:01
well a big diamond breathing monster as
06:06
it inhales
06:07
well what it is is um if you dig a hole
06:10
deep enough it gets really hot at the
06:12
bottom because it's the pressure and
06:14
that heats up the air
06:15
and obviously the air at the top because
06:17
it's in the middle of siberia is cold
06:19
and so you get this convection current
06:20
over there and it can cause a vortex
06:23
and so anything flying over the top of
06:24
it can get sucked down into the
06:26
wow that's cool it's good that isn't it
06:29
why don't birds are
06:30
going to suck down chimneys
06:33
because most chimneys are not the
06:34
biggest hole in the world
06:37
i've understood james right yeah it's
06:39
the it's the depth
06:40
and the difference in heat although i
06:42
suppose a fire is quite hot
06:44
slimy if i if i'm ever flying over that
06:47
and the helicopter starts to get into
06:48
trouble i'll be able to say as we
06:50
plummet this is quite interesting
06:51
actually what's happening it's due to a
06:52
convection thing
06:54
their mia mine in the 1960s made 20
06:57
percent of all the gems in the world
07:00
they found them there and when they
07:02
first dug it it's in
07:03
um it's in near yakuza i think so it's
07:05
really cold in the middle of siberia
07:07
and they had permafrost um so it's
07:10
really icy there
07:11
and even the dynamite wouldn't get
07:13
through the permafrost because it was so
07:14
cold
07:16
wow what that is way cool
07:19
um i have a little more stuff on things
07:21
being named oddly yeah the soviet union
07:23
and elsewhere
07:24
go um okay so loads of
07:28
people during the french revolution
07:30
started changing their names as well
07:31
basically whenever there's a massive
07:32
political
07:33
upheaval people start naming their
07:35
babies crazy things so what will you
07:37
name your baby after um
07:39
jeremy corbyn i would name him saint
07:42
jez um
07:45
so in 1792 basically there had been
07:47
loads of rules up until that point on
07:49
what you could name your babies
07:51
and then there was a rule change during
07:53
the revolution which said no
07:54
any citizen can change their name by
07:56
just making a declaration
07:58
at their local town hall wherever it
07:59
might be and there's a list of things
08:01
that people change their names to and
08:02
they are wild
08:03
so people chose names including amor
08:05
sacred de la patri
08:06
la trois which means sacred love of the
08:08
native land year three
08:10
more aristocrat death to aristocrats
08:13
cool name
08:14
and my favorite is uh uh simon la
08:16
liberte or
08:17
which means simon liberty or death simon
08:20
yeah
08:22
i'll just use simon thanks man someone
08:25
after the egyptian revolution in 2011
08:27
called his daughter facebook
08:29
really yeah because it played a big part
08:31
in you know organizing the protest
08:33
yeah yeah not just because he likes
08:34
seeing people's holidays
08:36
i would imagine that that person is
08:38
going to find it hard to get a facebook
08:40
account
08:42
just on the largest diamond in the world
08:44
yeah it's worth covering it's called the
08:46
golden jubilee although it was
08:47
originally called unnamed brown
08:52
yeah it's a brown diamond didn't have a
08:54
name it's refreshing that does that
08:56
diamond yeah there's a lot of brown
08:58
diamonds what are they they're um
09:00
they're like diamonds but they're brown
09:01
yeah it sounds like a very unpleasant
09:03
euphemism
09:04
coming back from the bathroom kind of
09:05
hobbling oh it's a brown diamond day
09:09
so are they actually color brown or are
09:11
they just sort of they're like they
09:12
murky with
09:13
they're probably murky yeah um oh yeah
09:17
oh well so they actually are brown but
09:18
they're very beautiful yeah
09:20
just for the people at home dan is
09:21
showing us on his laptop pictures of
09:23
brown diamonds
09:24
yes and that is disgusting
09:28
anyway when it was found in south africa
09:29
this brown diamond got all these
09:31
blessings
09:32
it was blessed by the buddhist supreme
09:34
patriarch of thailand visited the pope
09:36
um and then it went to an islamic
09:39
scholar to be blessed by
09:40
by him as well did they do they all get
09:42
to go on the boat trip and then in the
09:44
helicopter
09:46
surrounded by 20 000 roses uh dan
09:49
can you check urban dictionary while you
09:51
have your laptop we don't usually use
09:53
laptops but can you check urban
09:54
dictionary to see if brown diamond is a
09:56
thing
09:56
oh gosh come on um just while dan's
09:59
doing that
09:59
i thought you might like to know there
10:01
was a tradition in england of
10:02
what's called hortatory names so it's
10:06
extreme puritans got names which were
10:08
designed to encourage you
10:10
to behave particularly well so uh one of
10:13
the men who rebuilt london after the
10:14
great fight was called nicholas barbin
10:16
right but his middle name was if christ
10:19
had not died for thee thou had
10:21
been damned that was from sophie haye
10:24
who we know
10:25
yeah a friend of us he's a classical
10:27
historian yeah yeah knows a lot about uh
10:29
pompeii but she also knows about him
10:31
yeah it's not an amazing middle name
10:32
yeah
10:32
you hear a lot of those i think one or
10:34
two of them turn out to be
10:36
myths or you know post hoc things but
10:38
that one is real isn't it yeah
10:40
yeah it is in urban dictionary okay
10:42
what's it mean uh
10:43
it's it's just as we were saying
10:44
basically slang for turd or poo
10:47
i.e my dog has left a minefield of brown
10:49
diamonds in the yard
10:51
okay well it's just a bit of knowledge
10:53
you clocked it
10:54
i don't know if we're gonna call that
10:55
knowledge i'm gonna try and unknow it as
10:58
soon
11:05
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:08
that is my fact
11:09
my fact this week is that scientists
11:12
have announced
11:12
that they finally know why shoelaces
11:15
untie themselves
11:16
good old scientists old scientists do
11:19
you know in russia there's a joke
11:21
because we were talking about russia
11:22
before where you say according to
11:24
british scientists
11:25
and then you say something ridiculous
11:27
and that's like a meme of
11:28
jokes in russia yeah because they have
11:31
this idea that all british scientists do
11:32
is really ridiculous
11:34
shoelace-related studies yeah yeah we
11:36
haven't helped that argument there
11:39
this is a university researchers at a
11:42
university in california berkeley
11:44
and they were studying why shoelaces
11:47
untie themselves surprisingly it's been
11:48
a massive mystery
11:50
to science for a very long time so they
11:52
dedicated their time to working that out
11:54
and it's interesting it's it's all to do
11:57
with the way that we slam our feet to
11:58
the ground
11:59
and it plays with well i didn't think it
12:01
would be to do with how we clap our
12:02
hands
12:05
unless you wear your shoes on your hands
12:10
my pink toe keeps poking through my
12:11
gloves
12:12
[Laughter]
12:15
um yeah it's all to do with sort of
12:17
gravity and so on i i don't fully
12:19
understand it
12:20
[Laughter]
12:22
let me know one of the things that
12:24
they're saying is that when you force
12:25
your foot down
12:26
um you're going you're going when you
12:28
walk when you're when you walk
12:30
because you make it sound down like you
12:31
walk around stamping your feet on the
12:33
ground
12:34
and you slam your foot down like hagrid
12:36
yeah you're looking everywhere like
12:38
a giant uh yeah he uh so not hagrid
12:41
sorry uh when we're putting our
12:42
when we're putting our feet down the
12:44
shoelaces the
12:45
the tips of the shoelaces that are left
12:47
exposed um are being pulled back up as
12:49
you go down
12:50
by gravity almost as if hands are
12:52
pulling them because of the force that
12:53
we go down
12:54
therefore it's slowly loosening them and
12:55
loosening them that's going to take more
12:56
and more steps does that make sense i
12:58
might have made that up yeah so wait the
12:59
the the tips are still pulling towards
13:01
the ground when we're lifting our foot
13:02
up yes
13:03
it's actually the flick so the two the
13:04
two things that caused it i think in the
13:06
study set was
13:07
uh it's caused by a combination of the
13:09
impact of the shoe on the ground as it
13:10
hits the ground which deforms the knot
13:12
itself
13:13
and then the whipping of the laces as
13:14
you lift your foot back up
13:16
pulls the laces uh away from the already
13:18
deformed knot
13:19
so does that mean like if you moonwalk
13:21
everywhere then your
13:22
shoelaces will never come on yeah that's
13:24
absolutely true so they tested it with
13:25
people
13:26
either walking on the spot uh up and
13:28
down without any forward motion and
13:30
shoelaces don't come undone and they
13:31
tested people
13:32
swinging their legs from a chair and
13:33
shoelaces don't come undone and i just
13:35
want to say for the record my shoelaces
13:37
just don't come undone anyway
13:38
so i don't understand what this whole
13:40
what mine come undone all the time do
13:42
they really
13:42
mine do sometimes yeah yeah this is a
13:44
really interesting chat guys
13:47
i always thought that we should add more
13:48
personal touches to the podcast
13:50
so people learn a bit more about our
13:52
personalities and now people know
13:54
that your shoelaces never come undone
13:56
that's true but the mines sometimes do
13:58
yeah um the royal society website
14:00
described
14:01
this study and it was they i think have
14:04
been overrating it a bit because they
14:05
said
14:06
as demonstrated using slow motion video
14:08
footage and a series of experiments the
14:10
failure of the knot happens in a matter
14:11
of seconds
14:12
often without warning and is
14:14
catastrophic wow
14:16
if you're on the edge of a cliff or
14:17
something it can be tricky that's true
14:20
i don't know if this is over-egging it
14:21
as well but they're saying that the
14:22
forces
14:23
uh that act on the tide shoelace can be
14:26
greater than those felt by humans
14:27
on the most extreme roller coaster yeah
14:29
that's what your shoelace is going
14:31
through every time you put your foot
14:32
down it's like
14:33
it's like a massive roller coaster ride
14:35
they're saying 7g
14:37
uh which is seven times the force of
14:39
gravity uh and the
14:40
biggest most powerful roller coaster is
14:43
the tower of terror
14:44
in johannesburg and that's 6.3 g
14:47
and to put that into some kind of
14:49
context uh space shuttle
14:51
someone in that would get 3g you think
14:54
so they near the satellite
14:58
have you ever seen um the website ian's
15:00
shoelace yes no
15:02
yes right it's fantastic isn't it best
15:04
shoelace site
15:05
i would say on the whole internet yep
15:07
okay i agree there's a guy called eaton
15:10
who um has set up the site partly just
15:12
to
15:13
uh uh tell people about his own knot
15:16
which is called the ian knot
15:18
and he says it it stays securely tied is
15:20
much better than the granny knot that
15:22
almost everybody uses
15:23
and um he says that there is a there's
15:26
also a high security version of it
15:28
which is called ian's secure shoelace
15:30
knot but he does say on the website
15:31
note that my ian knot is quite secure
15:33
for all normal activities
15:35
wow anna maybe you're using ian's not
15:37
yeah i think i
15:38
am the knot thing is unbelievable that
15:40
we've all been tying our shoelaces wrong
15:42
i saw this in a ted talk you saw it in
15:44
ian's knots
15:44
um so we are all doing this granny knot
15:47
and the way all most of us are and the
15:48
way you can tell
15:49
is if you get your finger if you sort of
15:52
pull the sides of your shoe apart
15:54
when your shoes are tied in a bow then
15:56
the bow orients itself
15:57
vertically so it orients itself away
16:00
from your body
16:01
whereas if you've done a good knot and
16:02
you pull the two sides of your shoe
16:04
apart
16:04
then the bow orients itself horizontally
16:06
so
16:08
does that make sense i was looking at
16:09
dan's shoes now and they have no laces
16:12
i'm not going to wear them anymore
16:15
fell off one cliff too well you should
16:18
explain that now that you know how to do
16:20
up shoes
16:21
which is basically when you when we do
16:23
them up usually you're putting the
16:25
the very first cross you make with the
16:27
laces the very first one when you're
16:28
doing your shoes in a bow you're putting
16:29
the wrong lace over the top
16:31
and if you do the other one then you'll
16:33
find that it orients itself the right
16:35
way and it's much stronger so you put
16:36
the left hand lace
16:38
over the top of the right hand lace and
16:40
then draw it underneath
16:41
i've just redone it on myself and i
16:43
think because i'm left-handed
16:44
i've been putting the left one over as
16:46
is recommended i was just gonna say i
16:48
bet left-handed people do it differently
16:49
yeah you've been doing it right and
16:51
they're very secure my laces well no
16:52
they do come apart sometimes
16:55
i've given away too much about myself
16:58
i have to say i tried this last night
17:00
and i what my mind was
17:01
blown i would say i'm so excited i'm
17:04
never going to do my laces up wrong
17:05
again
17:06
can i just say on ian very quickly his
17:08
website's called ian's
17:09
shoelace site uh ian feigen is his name
17:12
it's worth pointing out he's made a
17:13
whole site about shoelaces and he
17:15
actually doesn't really overly care
17:17
about shoelaces he kind of does what we
17:18
do he's picked a subject that he wants
17:20
to mine and find out stuff about
17:22
and just create a place that's the the
17:24
place to go to about the knowledge the
17:25
history and so on about it
17:26
so a huge shout out to him for just
17:28
doing that he doesn't give a [ __ ]
17:31
he does yeah about shoelaces he says he
17:32
says on his site i'm really not a
17:34
notting nut i'm just a friendly aussie
17:35
guy trying to contribute to the internet
17:37
he has a celebrity section too does he
17:39
yeah what do taylor swift john mcenroe
17:42
and reese witherspoon have in common
17:43
they all wear shoes
17:45
well they're all celebrities who i
17:46
believe may be tying granny knots thanks
17:49
to the telltale sign of crooked shoelace
17:50
bows that run along the shoe instead of
17:52
across the shoe
17:53
celebrities are human too so who are
17:55
they taylor swift john mcenroe john
17:57
mcenroe reece witherspoon so if i'm
17:58
looking for
17:59
celebrities they're not going to be the
18:00
first three that i look for taylor swift
18:02
might be
18:03
but john mcenroe probably would be down
18:05
in the thousands
18:07
and so basically he's checked a lot of
18:08
celebrities to get down as far as john
18:10
mcintyre
18:12
and yet he doesn't care about shoelaces
18:14
yeah i think he went straight to john
18:15
mcenroe because tennis is one of the
18:18
jobs you'd have where you'd really want
18:19
strong shoelaces you may have won a few
18:21
extra grand slams
18:23
and he's probably got a shoe like no one
18:25
else on that list probably has a shoe
18:27
but he'll have a sponsored shoe well you
18:29
know you have you have shoes there's
18:30
tennis players they all
18:31
also have shoes there's other people no
18:33
but i mean like the mcenroe shoe they
18:35
might be
18:35
yeah yeah okay right yeah i'm saying
18:38
sports people
18:38
tend to have shoes do they yes zola budd
18:42
didn't
18:43
who i'm sorry that's a very niche
18:45
reference
18:46
but she used to run without shoes she's
18:48
very famous
18:49
that is a fantastic joke for those who
18:52
know who zola budd is
18:54
sandy shaw
19:00
yeah oh yeah she's never got shoes in
19:01
the video clips what did she do
19:03
baggins does that work for you guys yes
19:05
yes okay yeah yeah we got the reference
19:08
yeah he didn't have any lucrative
19:10
sponsorship deals as he went to mordor
19:13
so um on knots okay this is so cool
19:17
every single cell in your body has two
19:20
meters of dna in it
19:22
right hmm but according to science
19:26
uh anything longer than about 139
19:28
centimeters is likely to get
19:29
tied up in a knot spontaneously just due
19:32
to being agitated
19:33
about 50 of the time so how does our dna
19:36
not get into this massive
19:38
tangled ball and there are loads of
19:40
theories and scientists don't know
19:41
it's so cool so one of the latest
19:43
theories is that it's got these
19:45
i'm going to miss explain it because
19:46
it's quite complicated but it's
19:47
constantly slipping through these
19:49
rings like proteins and basically they
19:51
get it gets bunched up in lengths like
19:53
carriages in a train so you're
19:55
interacting a bit with the rest of the
19:56
length in your carriage but you're not
19:58
interacting with other lengths of the
19:59
dna
20:00
okay so it gets bunched up into balls
20:02
which kind of rub against each other
20:04
just basically it gets bunched up into
20:06
sections which are much
20:07
less likely to form knots okay is that
20:10
like if you put
20:10
loads of uh elastic bands in a box or
20:13
something they'd all get tangled up with
20:15
each other maybe but if you put a lot
20:16
elastic band balls then they wouldn't
20:19
get tangled up with each other
20:20
that i mean that would be a great
20:22
explanation if it was true i don't know
20:24
because i really understood that very
20:25
it's true i don't know if it is maybe it
20:27
is
20:28
okay here's hoping let's go so the idea
20:30
that that things
20:32
get tangled um was discovered by dorian
20:35
ramer and douglas smith
20:36
and they won an ignobel prize for
20:38
physics in 2008.
20:40
and what they did was they put a load of
20:42
cards in a rotating box
20:44
and they did it more than three thousand
20:46
times and they found that almost always
20:49
it all got knotted up and this is why if
20:51
you put your headphones in your pocket
20:53
or if you
20:53
you know all that kind of stuff it
20:55
always gets tangled right yeah
20:57
basically their explanation is if you
20:59
have a cord
21:01
there is only one way that it's not
21:03
knotted mathematically
21:05
the way that it's not knotted is nothing
21:06
is over the top of each other
21:08
whereas there are hundreds and thousands
21:10
of ways that it might be knotted so it's
21:12
just much more likely that it'll be in
21:13
one of those knotted states and one of
21:14
the not knotted states
21:16
oh okay but that's if it moves so they
21:18
haven't really cracked the mystery of
21:19
when i
21:20
wrap christmas lights up in a perfect
21:23
role and put them in a box where they
21:25
stay
21:25
motionless for 360 days and then get
21:29
them out why are they tangled
21:31
you only have your christmas lights up
21:32
for five days a year
21:37
yeah all this preparing for christmas
21:38
more than a week in advance it's
21:40
[ __ ]
21:41
miserable life elite
21:42
[Laughter]
21:49
maybe it's tiny earthquakes
21:54
because there's always tiny earthquakes
21:55
yeah it must be that but it does depend
21:57
on the length of the cable as well so
22:00
so if uh if a cable is shorter than 46
22:03
centimeters which i imagine anna's
22:05
christmas lights probably are
22:09
you can put them on a tiny twig of a
22:11
tree
22:14
but if it's shorter than 46 centimeters
22:16
it will rarely if ever get knotted right
22:18
so all you have to do is buy headphone
22:20
cables which
22:20
are shorter than 46 centimeters and
22:23
ensure that you're constantly holding
22:24
your phone
22:25
near your face uh the shoelaces get at
22:29
least 12
22:29
mentions in the bible no no no no no no
22:32
yeah no wrong it's true i got this from
22:35
ian's shoelace site
22:37
and he has a section called shoelaces as
22:40
seen in and you can see he's listed
22:41
and then jesus's shoelaces came undone
22:45
and lo he tied them in ian's knot
22:49
genesis i've got one here what else
22:52
and on the eighth day
22:57
can you give us any quotes yeah give us
22:58
a chapter in first yeah so genesis it's
23:00
that i would not take a thread or a
23:03
shoelace
23:03
or anything that is yours lest you
23:05
should say i have made
23:07
a room rich okay here's the possible
23:10
support for that
23:12
wasn't urtsy the iceman who was about
23:14
5500 years
23:16
ago he lived then his shoes were done uh
23:19
weren't they with kind of
23:20
leather songs yeah with some very
23:23
rudimentary laces
23:24
so it's not inconceivable yeah here's
23:26
one from american king
23:27
uh james version john 127. here it is
23:31
who coming after me is preferred before
23:33
me whose shoelace
23:34
i am not worthy to unloose oh yeah okay
23:38
okay yeah all right fine wow all right
23:41
we're buying it didn't think that was
23:42
gonna work see
23:44
ian he knows his stuff hey if i say the
23:48
phrase
23:49
i like your shoelaces to you what is the
23:51
appropriate response
23:52
oh thank you ian and may i say you're
23:56
not has made all the difference in the
23:57
world to me
23:58
is that it it's not it is thanks
24:02
i stole them from the president does
24:04
that ring any bells with you
24:06
it didn't for me and i wonder if i'm
24:07
being uh sort of internet
24:09
it feels to me like it's a thing that
24:12
you might say to prove you're a spy
24:14
so like if you're reading the newspaper
24:16
in a park and someone said i like your
24:17
shoelaces you would say that response
24:19
yeah and they would know you were a spy
24:21
it's very close it's what people
24:23
who use tumblr um say to detect that
24:27
another tumblr user in the real world so
24:29
you it's a code that they all know to
24:31
say i like your shoelaces
24:32
you've just spoiled it now no because
24:34
they all know it yeah but
24:36
now everyone else knows it
24:39
though it used to be the dennis the
24:40
menace fan club from the bino used to
24:43
have a secret
24:44
thing that you would say to people here
24:46
i was a member of that do you remember
24:48
the secret code no i don't
24:49
oh no you weren't a real member oh my
24:51
god you were one of the fake members
24:53
they used to top you off
24:55
or your parents have just been doing a
24:57
letter every week from dennis to you
25:00
dear sandra i'm not going to say what it
25:03
is but if anyone ever sees me in the
25:04
street and you used to be a member
25:06
then i still know it see james knows how
25:08
to keep a secret then
25:12
so you know the extra hole on a shoelace
25:15
so you know when you often type your
25:16
shoes
25:17
yeah and there's kind of an you get to
25:19
the top and then there's an extra hole
25:20
kind of just behind that often slightly
25:22
lower especially walking boots you get
25:24
this
25:25
um and so usually i just don't do
25:26
anything with it the purpose of it
25:28
is for preventing blisters so what you
25:31
do is you tie all your shoelaces up to
25:32
the top like normal
25:33
and then you keep your shoelace on the
25:36
same side and thread it through that
25:38
next hole
25:39
to create a loop and you do that on both
25:41
sides and then
25:42
you weave the shoelaces on opposite
25:44
sides through the loops you've created
25:46
and this tightens it around your ankle
25:48
and stops you from getting blisters
25:49
that's great yeah look up a vid it's
25:51
simple and effective
25:54
that's what they would teach you that
25:55
when you're in scouts would they yeah
25:57
they're good i'm really giving away a
25:59
lot about my childhood here
26:00
but they never taught me did they not no
26:03
no you weren't really a scout
26:04
well your parents just sent you a letter
26:06
from baden powell every week yeah that's
26:08
right
26:15
[Applause]
26:19
okay it's time for fact number three and
26:21
that is andy
26:22
my fact is that nelson's ship hms
26:24
victory nearly didn't get out of the
26:26
dock it was built in because it was too
26:28
big
26:29
it was a classic mistake they thought
26:31
we're gonna build this fantastic big
26:32
ship
26:32
and they built it and the night before
26:34
the launch the dockyard foreman
26:36
looked at it and he thought i wonder if
26:38
it's too big
26:39
and uh and he he measured the ship at
26:41
his widest point and then he measured
26:42
the dot he found his horror
26:44
it was nine and a half inches wider than
26:45
the dock that's a rookie area
26:48
i had a complete amateurism and so like
26:51
he told his boss who apparently fell
26:53
into despair
26:55
i said what are we gonna do the ship
26:56
will get stuck if we try and launch it
26:58
it'll be massively embarrassing
26:59
and then the shipwrights and the
27:00
carpenters who were working at the dock
27:01
just you know
27:02
just wore away the docks timbers and
27:04
removed bits and they managed
27:06
to save that crucial uh you know they
27:08
must have removed about a foot
27:10
so it got through but imagine it would
27:11
have had about a couple of inches on
27:13
either side yeah
27:13
so exciting i read that um his boss was
27:16
called john allen
27:18
and he was already suffering from
27:20
violent and frequent attacks of abilius
27:22
disorder in his bowels
27:24
and this could not have helped his brown
27:26
diamonds will not have been amused
27:30
so you know i mean this was uh said at
27:32
the time that uh
27:34
hms victory nearly didn't make it to the
27:36
battle of trafalgar but it was launched
27:37
in 1765
27:38
40 years before so it probably would
27:40
have caught up well it was a long way
27:41
away wasn't it
27:42
from the location where did they build
27:44
it in new zealand or something
27:46
set off towards the battle 40 years
27:47
before
27:51
this isn't the only time this has
27:52
happened so um isenberg kingdom brunel
27:55
built the world's first proper big iron
27:58
ship it was the first iron steam shipped
27:59
across the atlantic
28:01
it was a massive deal it was uh ss great
28:03
britain and it was built to be a
28:04
passenger service between bristol and
28:06
america but when
28:07
he built it it was in bristol docks in
28:09
1844
28:10
and it got trapped in the locked gates
28:12
and i was reading a letter of apology he
28:14
wrote to
28:15
um people at a meeting he was supposed
28:17
to be at the next day
28:18
saying he wasn't able to get there
28:19
because this huge boat he built he got
28:21
trapped because the lock was too small
28:22
and he'd been up all night having to
28:24
dismantle the masonry of the lock
28:26
in order to get it out and that's brunel
28:28
who you would have thought knows what
28:29
he's doing who would
28:30
it must be a thing you just forget to
28:31
check that last minute
28:33
exit door a bit that you could click
28:36
because it has happened a lot
28:37
there's a different one slightly uh this
28:40
could get out the dock but have you
28:41
heard of
28:41
the url it was called yeah the ural it's
28:45
a famous ship i've not heard of it no
28:47
but it's a place called the ural
28:48
mountains
28:49
okay all right so this was this was
28:51
commissioned in 1989
28:52
and it was 265 meters long 36
28:55
000 tons basically it was so large
28:58
that nowhere was big enough to dock it
29:02
so they had to dock it just off the
29:03
harbor and just use it as a place where
29:05
uh soldiers and naval officers could
29:07
just have as a base
29:09
and and track things and so on and now
29:10
they've now decommissioned it but they
29:12
just couldn't use it it was too big
29:13
and it was supposed to be because it
29:14
became basically a barracks didn't it
29:16
but it was supposed to be a huge thing
29:17
for the soviet union it the technology
29:19
on it was amazing so
29:20
it was powered by nuclear reactors it
29:22
was huge like you said um it had the
29:24
best in like electronics and
29:25
intelligence it could uh
29:27
it could see um satellites from out of
29:29
space i could see
29:30
any ballistic missiles that might be
29:32
coming towards it it was supposed to be
29:33
an amazing intelligence gathering
29:35
ship that traveled around the world and
29:37
yet they just built it too big
29:39
um so hms victory um
29:42
this is quite cool um it was the same
29:45
age as nelson basically
29:46
as in when they had the battle uh i
29:48
think he was 48 and the ship was 47.
29:51
okay so not the same age yeah all right
29:55
different news at school but when else
29:57
they would but they would have known
29:59
each other yeah
29:59
yeah yeah yeah he was big sister
30:03
when nelson was born was he too large to
30:05
fit out
30:12
oh god um
30:16
but um this is really cool so in three
30:18
years before the battle right he went
30:19
around the forest of dean which provided
30:20
all the wood for the
30:22
you know the napoleonic navy and it was
30:24
six thousand trees
30:25
and he was appalled at what he found
30:27
right because loads of the forest was
30:28
unavailable timber merchants were saying
30:30
no you can't have this bit and lots of
30:31
the rest of it have been kind of ruined
30:32
by charcoal burners and
30:34
nelson said parliament should plant lots
30:35
of new forest right and
30:37
a few years after he died in trafalgar
30:39
they did planted lotus forest and
30:41
two of the oaks planted during that ship
30:44
uh building tree planting drive provided
30:47
raw material to restore
30:49
hms victory 200 years later oh that's so
30:53
nice how cool is that yeah that's very
30:54
cool
30:55
do you know how it got its name the name
30:57
victory yeah victory
30:59
was it not named until after the battle
31:00
of trafalgar it was just
31:02
named brown
31:07
um it was named they say potentially
31:10
because i think it's not fully known to
31:12
commemorate the victories that were
31:13
happening in the year of 1759 which were
31:15
a lot
31:16
and they called that year the year of
31:17
miracles anis
31:19
mirabilis if i'm pronouncing that
31:21
correctly it's the year of miracles
31:23
um but i suspect it was the other thing
31:25
because on the article it says
31:26
or it may have been chosen simply
31:28
because out of the seven names
31:30
shortlisted victory was the only one
31:31
that was not in use
31:33
so the other six were already massive
31:35
ship names
31:36
yeah so i reckon
31:40
the battle of trafalgar was obviously uh
31:43
very heated uh that's an understatement
31:45
but
31:46
nelson was shot at the height of the
31:48
battle and his ship was tangled with a
31:50
french ship i think maybe a spanish one
31:52
and there were snipers in the rigging of
31:53
that ship shooting people on deck
31:55
but listen listen to this so nelson it
31:57
seems like he really had a death wish
31:58
because he was walking up and down on
31:59
deck in spite of that
32:01
um he was dictating to his secretary who
32:03
was called scott at the time
32:06
scott got blasted in half by a
32:08
cannonball
32:10
okay so so so nelson's assistants
32:13
quickly pick up his body and they throw
32:14
him overboard nelson's response is just
32:16
to say
32:16
is that paul scott if you get hit by a
32:18
cannonball it could literally cut you in
32:20
a cannonball is fighting yeah these are
32:22
i mean that's a huge heavy lump of metal
32:23
traveling at 100
32:24
i'm not saying that it couldn't kill you
32:26
but i thought it would splatter you
32:28
rather than just cut
32:29
like literally well maybe it was almost
32:31
cut into i don't know anyway it probably
32:33
wasn't a clean cut
32:35
it's like a guillotine no um
32:42
so anyway scott is no longer available
32:44
for secretarial duties to put it
32:45
mountain
32:46
uh so then the next person to replace
32:48
him is called thomas whipple
32:49
he arrives on deck nelson probably
32:51
continues dictating to him
32:52
yeah then whipple dies almost
32:54
immediately because a cannonball doesn't
32:57
uh hit him but it passes him and it's
32:58
believed he was killed by the shockwave
33:00
from
33:01
whoa whipple pull yourself together
33:06
um wow i know so and this is what nelson
33:08
was just walking up and down
33:10
in unconcernedly and eventually you know
33:11
he was hit poor old whipple
33:13
because he would be nervous having
33:15
probably witnessed what just happened to
33:16
your predecessor
33:19
in 2005 there was a big anniversary of
33:21
uh trafalgar
33:23
and uh it included a fireworks display
33:25
which used the same amount of gunpowder
33:27
that hms victory used
33:29
in the battle of trafalgar wow and so
33:32
how much was that i think it was about
33:33
12 tons cool that might be wrong but
33:35
there was also a naval battle
33:36
reenactment right but
33:38
they didn't say these are the british
33:41
ships and these are the french because
33:41
they didn't want to annoy the french
33:43
because relations were quite good and
33:44
they didn't want to say we beat you um
33:46
so they just said it was a reenactment
33:47
of a sort of naval battle that would
33:49
have taken place at that time
33:52
i think it's very considerate yeah i
33:54
don't have a lot of sympathy for the
33:56
political correctness gone mad
33:57
phrase but that really does feel like
34:01
they also featured a simulation of the
34:02
death of nelson where nelson was played
34:04
by alex naylor who is described in the
34:06
newspaper accounts at the time as a
34:08
professional nelson look alike
34:10
were they not allowed to simulate that
34:12
he actually died in case it offended
34:14
dead people and so well they weren't
34:16
actually allowed to kill
34:18
alex naylor no i think political
34:20
correctness has not gone far enough
34:22
i want to see the guy who played scott
34:27
it's i mean there can't be much work for
34:29
a nelson professional
34:30
so i didn't look up if he's still
34:32
working or still doing it but
34:34
i'm sure it's a sideline it's weird you
34:35
know in covent garden when you see the
34:36
people being statues that you don't ever
34:38
see that
34:38
of someone being you do but he's on a
34:41
massive column so you can't see
34:43
he's been holding that strong sorry this
34:46
is my spot ah that guy is hogging that
34:49
plin
34:51
[Music]
34:51
[Applause]
34:56
okay it is time for a final fact of the
34:58
show and that is
34:59
james okay my fact this week is
35:02
that in a chocolate hob knob
35:06
[Music]
35:07
can you check urban dictionary for that
35:10
my fact is
35:11
that in a chocolate hub knob the
35:13
chocolate is on the bottom
35:17
so for i don't know if hobnobs are
35:20
international
35:20
are they all over the world are they in
35:21
america in australia i can't remember
35:24
it's mostly british it's a chocolate
35:26
biscuit a hobnob it's like no
35:28
hobnob is like an oat biscuit uh and
35:30
they have chocolate hob knobs which are
35:32
oat biscuits with chocolate on them
35:34
and most normal people would probably
35:36
assume that the chocolate was on the top
35:38
it's only on one side it's only on one
35:39
side yeah but then
35:41
someone posted a picture on facebook and
35:44
asked mcvities who make these biscuits
35:47
which side is the chocolate on the top
35:49
or the bottom and they said
35:50
we take our hobnobs and we dip them in a
35:54
pool
35:54
of chocolate and so that means that the
35:57
chocolate
35:58
is on the bottom they actually say
36:00
reservoir
36:01
of chocolate and they use it a lot and i
36:03
want to i've been googling reservoir of
36:05
chocolate and i can't find that
36:06
that's inaccurate though because you
36:08
don't produce chocolate by waiting for
36:09
it to fall from the sky
36:10
and then storing it for years as you do
36:13
with the water reservoir so it should be
36:14
a pool
36:15
maybe they do i don't know well but then
36:16
can we trust them about this up-down
36:18
situation because actually reservoir
36:20
does imply reserving
36:22
something like it's a reservoir of water
36:24
is something where you're keeping the
36:25
water
36:26
there for when you need it right yeah
36:27
whereas the chocolate i imagine they
36:29
probably
36:29
change it pretty much every day i would
36:31
hope so yeah
36:32
but here's my controversial hot take
36:36
oh on the packet of chocolate hob knobs
36:38
yeah they clearly depict a hobnob
36:41
with the biscuit side facing down and
36:43
the chocolate time facing up
36:44
so either they are lying or you've got
36:46
your packet upside down
36:48
and all the words should be either all
36:50
the words should be upside down
36:52
or the biscuit should be the other way
36:54
up yeah maybe they're showing the
36:55
biscuit
36:56
upside down on the why why would you do
37:00
that
37:00
but it's their decision right it's their
37:02
decision to them basically we're going
37:04
on what macvittie say and
37:05
it's their product so they're allowed to
37:07
say what they want and they say it's on
37:08
the bottom so it's on the bottom
37:10
and it's all the chocolate biscuits
37:11
isn't it that they dip well here's
37:13
another bit of evidence
37:15
um even even we could hear the inverted
37:20
quotes around the word evidence there if
37:23
you take a digestive biscuit
37:25
yeah okay they're not called digestive
37:26
biscuits in america are they because
37:28
they don't help your digestion i can't
37:29
remember what they're called over there
37:31
but they're just basically biscuits um
37:33
the top
37:34
is rounded and has a mcfitty's logo on
37:37
and the bottom
37:37
has kind of crisscross on it and then
37:40
when you
37:41
have a chocolate digestive it's the
37:43
crisscross bit which has got the
37:44
chocolate on it
37:46
so that it's much more clear that it's
37:48
the bottom oh yeah that's a really good
37:50
point yeah but if i saw someone eating a
37:52
chocolate hobnob
37:54
upside down and when i say that i mean
37:56
with the chocolate side on the bottom
37:58
i would think they were mad because now
38:02
whenever i see anyone eating a chocolate
38:03
hobnob the other way around i'm going to
38:05
go excuse me
38:07
that's upside down but for again for
38:10
overseas
38:11
uh listeners the uh who have switched
38:14
off a long time ago
38:17
but sort of the massiveness of this news
38:19
in this country i told my wife this this
38:20
morning and she
38:21
and you're now divorced yeah she
38:23
couldn't believe it she said yeah she
38:24
said how dare you slapped me and walked
38:26
away
38:26
it's it's uh it's big news it's kind of
38:29
like in america when
38:30
um when and we said this on the podcast
38:32
a long time ago
38:33
uh someone wrote to nike to say is it
38:35
nike or nike and and the owner came back
38:37
and said it's nike
38:38
yeah and everyone's like well we've been
38:39
saying nike for years and it's just a
38:41
confirmation thing but it's massive here
38:43
i
38:43
wonder how much control they have over
38:45
it once it goes out into the world
38:47
you don't get to choose how people
38:49
pronounce a word that's true yeah and
38:50
you don't get to choose how people eat
38:52
hobnob
38:53
yeah thank god but you do get to you do
38:55
get to choose
38:56
what your official answer is yeah but
38:58
you also get to choose
38:59
how you depict it on the packet if they
39:01
really were committed but it looks like
39:02
they could put an
39:03
upside down they would put a hobnob on
39:06
the packet
39:06
the other way up but then you wouldn't
39:08
be able to see the chocolate very well
39:09
oh yeah
39:14
but yeah i think the reason that they
39:16
show it upside down is so that you can
39:18
see that it's a chocolatey one and not a
39:20
normal that's a really good point that's
39:22
such a good point
39:23
otherwise you'd just be buying digestive
39:25
biscuits thinking in the hope there
39:26
might be some chocolate underneath the
39:28
word
39:28
chocolate on the packet what what
39:30
further proof do you need well in okay
39:32
it says biscuit on the packet why do you
39:34
even need a picture
39:35
yeah why doesn't all of our packaging of
39:37
all of our things just have
39:39
an explanation of what everything is
39:43
in fact they're sold in flat packets
39:45
where they're all on their edge
39:46
so this is a nonsense that's the correct
39:48
way up to each other
39:50
on its own put it vertically into your
39:54
mouth
40:00
i was looking into mcvities oh yeah yeah
40:02
mcviddy's
40:03
been around for a very long time
40:04
mcvitties uh
40:06
made the wedding cake for queen
40:08
elizabeth and philip's wedding
40:10
did they yeah mcvitty's provided the
40:12
official wedding cake
40:14
everyone said it was upside down they
40:17
had the little squashed bride and groom
40:19
underneath
40:19
it but interestingly um
40:23
they actually had 12 wedding cakes in
40:25
total they had the official one which
40:27
was made by mcvities but this was 1947
40:30
there was a lot of rations
40:31
going on at the time 11 cakes were
40:32
donated by different countries from
40:34
around the world
40:35
to say you probably can't afford your
40:37
own cake because of the rationing that's
40:38
going
40:39
slam wow all the
40:42
impoverished commonwealth countries
40:44
scripting and saving to make a cake just
40:45
so they could deliver a sick burn
40:47
but
40:51
yeah so they would send ingredients
40:52
sorry for sending all the you know the
40:54
marbles and all our treasures for the
40:55
last hundred years
40:57
you probably can't afford your own cake
41:01
um but yeah they they um it's weird it
41:04
says
41:04
the official cake was made using
41:05
ingredients given as a wedding gift by
41:07
australian girl guides um i don't know
41:10
if that means then mcvitty's turned that
41:12
into a cake or if mcvities wasn't the
41:13
official official but yeah
41:15
you know the main cake was six feet tall
41:17
was it the mcfiddies one presumably
41:19
yes and it had a it had a metal uh
41:21
knight on a horse on top of it
41:23
did it pretty cool cake just one more
41:25
thing prince william's
41:26
wedding 2011 his groom's cake for his
41:30
wedding
41:30
uh was 1700 macvittie's rich tea
41:34
biscuits
41:35
oh terrible choices yeah it's made from
41:37
those it wasn't like them stacked on
41:38
each other it was
41:39
i guess crumbed up and used but it was a
41:41
mcfiddies cake as well so that's two of
41:43
the british royals who've had wedding
41:44
cakes from mcvities oh wow
41:46
you know the guy who uh actually knew
41:49
from this year
41:50
the guy who invented a lot of chocolate
41:52
biscuits died recently he died at age 81
41:54
it was last month and apparently he
41:56
created cheddars many cheddars
41:58
and he created cracker wheat and he
42:00
created hobnobs
42:02
and he worked for uh meredith and drew
42:05
which became united biscuits which are
42:06
the company that owned mcvitie's
42:08
uh in in 1960 and he invented a whole
42:11
bunch of recipes and apparently people
42:12
who worked at the company would just
42:13
write down these recipes and then they'd
42:14
shove them in a box somewhere and
42:16
years after he left the company they
42:18
were running out of ideas and they went
42:19
through his recipes and they made all
42:20
these biscuits
42:21
the word hobnob used to mean to toast
42:23
each other with drinks
42:25
did it it's in 12th night
42:29
isn't it yeah first mentioned 12th night
42:31
i was i saw this on the inky fool
42:33
blog by a friend of ours called mark
42:35
forsyth
42:36
and he said that the first record is in
42:38
twelfth night where an angry jewelist is
42:41
described
42:42
as hobnob is his word gift or
42:45
taked and hobnob meant to give or take
42:48
it's like um
42:49
you know positive or negative plus or
42:51
minus give and take
42:53
hobbin the whole card meant to have a
42:55
knob meant to not have
42:57
makes sense oh really technologically to
42:59
haven't have knob
43:00
[Music]
43:03
um and they're derived from ships
43:05
biscuits
43:06
which would have been used at the battle
43:08
of trafalgar to eat
43:10
but chef's biscuits they were kind of
43:11
designed to be unbreakably hard you had
43:13
to dunk them to get them soft enough to
43:14
eat yeah
43:15
and even if you did dunk them sometimes
43:16
because biscuit means twice cooked
43:18
it's from the i think a french or
43:20
probably originally latin biscuit i mean
43:22
twice cooked
43:22
to make them hard bake them twice but
43:24
some chips biscuits were baked four
43:26
times
43:27
for a really long voyage if you needed
43:29
really tough food
43:31
um i was reading actually i found a old
43:34
book which was talking about the process
43:36
of making navel biscuits so this is a
43:38
book from 1815
43:40
which was describing this guy who went
43:42
to a biscuit factory what was the
43:43
biscuit factory then
43:44
and he described the mass production of
43:46
biscuits which involved five men around
43:48
the oven
43:48
and it involved lots of tossing lumps of
43:50
dough to each other and then
43:52
getting it exactly on the peel which was
43:53
the big plate at the right time
43:55
but the first thing that had to happen
43:56
was the dough had to be kneaded
43:58
and the way the dough was needed was uh
44:00
it's placed on top of a piece of
44:01
machinery called a horse
44:03
and a man literally rides the horse up
44:05
and down
44:06
until the dough is sufficiently needed
44:08
wait a minute so where is the dough
44:09
is it though in between his bottom and
44:12
the horse
44:14
the toes in between the horse and the
44:16
table oh okay
44:18
but he needs to get on the horse in
44:19
order to move it about right i see
44:21
because i was thinking about how
44:23
um like the huns used to tenderize their
44:26
meat
44:27
by putting it in their trousers and then
44:29
riding all day and then by the end of
44:31
the day it was tender
44:32
and i was wondering if these biscuits
44:34
were made in the same way
44:37
the hobnobs were named by john murphy
44:41
they were going to be called oak
44:42
crunchies before that and he has a
44:44
history of naming things
44:46
he named british telecom prozac and home
44:50
base
44:52
he's a professional namer of things
44:54
that's just his job he just goes and
44:55
yeah he saw a kind of gap in the market
44:57
of when people were naming new companies
45:00
and he's like i could do that
45:01
it's just all the things you need to
45:03
lead a happy life aren't they those cool
45:04
things
45:05
bt home base of prozac yeah and hobnob
45:10
uh he says um when it comes to naming
45:12
one it's in thirds
45:13
one third is strategy one third is
45:15
creative
45:16
and the final third is checking that the
45:18
name is available
45:22
and he also invented i don't know if
45:24
we've mentioned this before uh
45:25
cello scrotum do you remember that no so
45:28
cello scrotum was
45:30
a a condition a medical condition that
45:33
cellists got
45:34
and apparently like rubbed against your
45:36
scrotum when you played the cello
45:37
presumably played it wrong
45:40
but he said
45:45
he he wrote to a newspaper uh actually
45:48
to the bmj to the british medical
45:50
journal
45:50
saying that he was a doctor and that
45:52
he'd come up with this thing called
45:54
cello scrotum and a lot of cellists were
45:56
getting it but actually it was a trick
45:57
and he was
45:58
trying to make fun of the fact that all
46:00
of these like housemaids knee and
46:02
golfer's elbow and all these kind of
46:04
things were kind of taken on and he was
46:05
trying to
46:06
make fun of it it wasn't real it wasn't
46:08
real i think
46:09
uh most checklists this is a
46:12
generalization are women
46:14
sure if you've got cello scrotum you
46:17
really have been playing it wrong
46:19
um in april last year five men uh were
46:22
uh
46:22
imprisoned for stealing a trailer with
46:25
twenty thousand pounds worth of biscuits
46:27
in it
46:28
yeah that was the street value of the
46:30
biscuits the production value was 12 000
46:31
pounds
46:32
okay um but they nicked the trailer and
46:34
it was found abandoned without the
46:35
biscuits in it
46:37
i don't think the biscuits were
46:37
recovered and so they eventually omitted
46:40
theft these five men
46:41
they were sentenced to each of them to
46:42
between 16 and 44 months
46:44
and as they were sentenced one of them
46:46
shouted would you like a biscuit
46:48
[Laughter]
46:52
that's great did the judge at any point
46:54
say they absolutely took the biscuit
46:57
[Music]

and so now it's time for this week's
00:44
show very excitingly we have one of our
00:47
favorite
00:47
friends in the world american comic john
00:50
hodgman guesting on this episode now
00:54
before he came on our show anna and i
00:56
actually went on to his show judge john
00:58
hodgman that just went out this week
00:59
in it he settles a dispute that is
01:01
specific about our
01:03
relationship between anna and i on the
01:05
podcast and
01:06
before we begin this show we're going to
01:08
play you a little excerpt from that
01:10
night
01:10
because it's relevant to what happens
01:11
later in our show so
01:13
without further ado previously on
01:16
someone else's podcast
01:20
our final dispute on stage from the hit
01:22
podcast no such thing as a fish
01:25
here with a dispute please welcome dan
01:27
schreiber and
01:28
anna toshinski
01:33
dan and anna no such thing as a fish is
01:35
one of my very favorite podcasts and
01:37
it's a real i've met you before dan
01:38
we're
01:39
old friends we're practically brothers
01:40
and i look forward to seeing you at
01:42
christmas
01:42
uh and i've never met you before and
01:44
it's a pleasure to see you in person but
01:46
let's get to the dispute what is the
01:47
problem
01:48
anna the problem is that we present a
01:51
factual podcast that people actually
01:53
listen to buzz marketing your podcast on
01:54
my podcast
01:55
yeah that's the reason we're here we're
01:57
doing a show tomorrow a few tickets
01:59
no uh and every week dan has to provide
02:02
us
02:02
with one fact and to present on the
02:05
podcast and i keep having to reject his
02:07
facts
02:08
on the grounds that they're not
02:10
interesting and they're not facts
02:12
yeah and i i argue that they are
02:16
well you and i both know that
02:19
non-facts are usually more interesting
02:20
than facts but
02:22
do you dispute i mean you're disputing
02:24
the factuality of what he is asserting
02:26
is that correct let me give you an
02:27
example so
02:28
um one fact that dan's presented for
02:30
consideration is that the real reason
02:32
the titanic
02:33
sank is not that it hid an iceberg but
02:36
that so many time travelers visited it
02:38
at the same time that the weight of them
02:40
all
02:40
pushed it underwater
02:44
is your uh problem with him that he puts
02:46
forward these facts or believes
02:48
no my problem is that i think it's very
02:49
dangerous for us to be spreading these
02:51
facts
02:52
you know if donald trump has told us
02:53
anything it's that people hear tiny
02:54
little random bits of stuff that they
02:55
half remember and then cling to them for
02:57
life
02:58
and i think they'll half remember what
02:59
dan said and then think it was the truth
03:01
and then go away with these insane
03:03
convictions you understand that in our
03:05
country we've given up on facts
03:08
did you end up discussing this on the
03:09
podcast no no no he's tried we cut it
03:12
out right well um
03:14
i am going to be a guest on the podcast
03:15
this monday and that's the fact that i'm
03:17
going to bring
03:18
so i look forward to discussing it then
03:20
i find in favor of dan just because it's
03:22
a great theory
03:22
sorry anna dana ladies and gentlemen
03:32
[Applause]
03:35
[Music]
03:37
hello and welcome to another episode of
03:40
no such thing as a fish
03:41
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
03:43
qi offices in covent garden my name is
03:46
dan schreiber and i'm sitting here with
03:48
anna chazinski james harkin andrew
03:50
hunter murray
03:51
and special guest john hodgman and once
03:54
again we have gathered around the
03:55
microphones with our four
03:57
favorite facts from the last seven days
03:59
and in no particular order
04:01
here we go starting with you hodgman
04:04
hello my fact is not many people know
04:08
that the real reason the titanic sank is
04:10
not because it hit an iceberg
04:12
but because so many time travelers
04:13
visited at the same time
04:15
the weight of all the bodies forced it
04:17
under the ocean's surface and this is a
04:19
verified fact
04:20
i can't believe we're doing this
04:24
we're torturing anna with this one so
04:27
john invited dan and i to go on his
04:29
podcast at the weekend called judge john
04:31
hodgman
04:32
where he settles a dispute the dispute
04:34
was
04:35
my problem with the fact that dan's
04:36
facts aren't real facts
04:38
and instead of settling in my favor he
04:40
settled in dan's favor
04:42
and has presented this ridiculous fact
04:44
for the class there's no question she's
04:45
obviously one of dan's
04:46
you were correct this is not a fact
04:50
other than i think dan your argument was
04:52
it's a fact that some people think this
04:54
yeah it's a fact that there's a theory
04:56
there is a theory a completely
04:58
untestable theory
05:00
do you think anyone thinks it and i mean
05:02
really thinks it so
05:03
the first time i heard this was uh by
05:06
neil degrasse tyson
05:07
he's the american scientist he has this
05:09
podcast it's called
05:10
star talk and it's a theory that someone
05:12
had sent into him
05:14
and so he discussed it and yeah that's
05:16
where i first heard it so
05:18
yeah if it's good enough for neil
05:20
degrasse tyson it's uh
05:24
i'm not sure i also went back and
05:25
watched that video and i'm not sure it's
05:27
good enough
05:28
for him either if we watch it now and
05:31
it's him saying good enough for me
05:33
i did i did attempt to reach out to him
05:35
through his co-host of that podcast the
05:37
great comedian eugene merman
05:39
but so far i've not heard back neil
05:41
degrasse tyson if you're listening to
05:42
this in the future
05:44
please use time travel to tell us the
05:46
source of where you heard this
05:48
conspiracy theory
05:50
stephen hawking you may know uh held a
05:52
dinner party
05:53
in 2008 for future time travelers
05:56
he put out and no and no one attended
06:00
except for him because he sent out the
06:02
invitations after the party was over
06:04
yeah but it could be that everyone in
06:05
the future
06:06
really hates him well i mean there are a
06:08
lot of reasons why
06:09
it was not proof although he took it as
06:11
proof and he
06:12
he actually sat there in this room with
06:15
glasses of champagne and canapes and a
06:18
big banner saying welcome time travelers
06:21
and talked about how this uh this
06:23
undeniably proved it on a tv special
06:25
that he made
06:26
and i have to say i watched that segment
06:28
and stephen hawking i never thought i'd
06:30
say this seemed a little bit of a smug
06:31
about it
06:34
i mean no no offense dr hawking you're
06:36
obvious but i mean you know maybe no one
06:37
wants to have
06:38
dinner with you especially after
06:41
especially after this smug display of
06:43
self-righteous
06:45
there is a there's a short story by e.m
06:47
foster where exactly this happens time
06:49
travelers come back
06:50
and they and they come from the you know
06:52
a few centuries ahead and they
06:53
they're just passing through a little
06:54
village and they're on a sort of uh
06:56
coach tour
06:57
looking at people and people get so
06:59
annoyed by it in our time
07:00
that they make a tourist attraction out
07:02
of the time travelers
07:03
they say come and look at the time
07:05
travelers and put up big you know signs
07:07
and get audiences and that annoys the
07:08
time travelers so much they stop coming
07:10
yeah that's that's a good that's a good
07:11
way to get rid of them for sure
07:13
but you know another explanation for why
07:15
stephen hawking didn't have dinner
07:16
guests that night
07:17
is the is the many worlds theory which
07:20
is that
07:21
in fact there is a universe in which
07:23
time travelers did come back
07:25
and that every time we travel through
07:26
time we resolve paradoxes by creating a
07:28
new
07:29
entirely new timeline a new universe
07:33
this is a real theory and it's a and and
07:36
more generally scientifically accepted
07:38
the
07:39
the many worlds interpretation of
07:40
quantum mechanics was first proposed by
07:43
hugh everett uh in 57 or so
07:46
is the relation of rupert um no
07:50
but he is he is the father of mark
07:53
oliver everett
07:54
of the band eels really yeah and and
07:57
in and in fact um mark oliver everett
07:59
made a documentary about his father
08:02
uh called parallel uh world's parallel
08:04
lives
08:05
and the theory of before we get into
08:07
that is the many worlds
08:08
interpretation now this is a little bit
08:10
above my i don't
08:12
i did a lot of reading on quantum
08:13
mechanics today don't worry we'll all be
08:15
able to explain it okay yeah thank you
08:16
very much
08:17
but the idea is that the every uh
08:19
quantum effect
08:21
exists in all possible states until it
08:23
is observed and then it settles to one
08:25
state and that's called wave function
08:26
collapse right
08:27
and the idea of many worlds
08:29
interpretation is that there is no wave
08:30
function collapse
08:31
because every possible universe that
08:34
exists
08:35
exists do i understand that more or less
08:37
correctly yeah pretty much
08:38
this is also the worst schrodinger's cat
08:40
comes into things
08:42
so um an object can occur in two
08:45
possible states until you actually look
08:47
at it and then when you look at it it
08:48
goes in one way or the other
08:50
way function collapse exactly that yeah
08:52
and then so if you have a cat in a box
08:54
then it's both alive and dead at the
08:56
same time until you actually look at it
08:58
and then you'll find out whether it's
09:00
alive or
09:00
dead and whatever it was saying was that
09:02
there is a universe in which it is alive
09:04
there is a universe in which it is dead
09:05
there is a universe where it is not a
09:07
cat there is a universe where is a
09:09
live cat dead cat hybrid here's the
09:12
interesting thing about that
09:13
is if you are the cat then um
09:16
in some universes you will be dead and
09:18
some you'll be alive but the only ones
09:20
you will ever know about are the ones
09:21
where you're alive
09:22
so actually in these kind of theories it
09:25
could be that
09:26
when we're experiencing things we're
09:28
only experiencing the
09:29
universes where we're still alive yeah
09:31
do you know what i mean
09:32
absolutely so there'll be lots of
09:33
universes where we're dead so the final
09:36
you
09:36
which is still kind of excellent and
09:38
still understanding things will be the
09:40
last one which possibly lived
09:42
and if you every time you every time you
09:44
cross the
09:45
street you are hit by a car yeah and you
09:47
die
09:48
except for i'm a survivor just like
09:52
destiny's child said
09:54
yeah that's what that song's about
09:57
this is a good argument for john hodgman
09:58
exceptionalism i feel like
10:00
that's why this is why i have lived i
10:02
have i'm virtuous and that is why i've
10:04
lived to this
10:05
elderly age about schrodinger he um
10:08
his idea of the cat thing was he was
10:10
taking the piss out the theory he was
10:12
saying how can this even be true because
10:14
then you know this thing about the cat
10:15
would be true so he kind of didn't
10:18
really like the theory and he had
10:20
another thing called schrodinger's flea
10:22
which he did like and which he used to
10:24
explain how
10:25
um electrons can go from one level of
10:28
energy to another they kind of jump up
10:30
quickly like a flea
10:31
so the theory that he liked was
10:33
schroedinger's flea but the one that he
10:34
didn't like was schrodinger's cat i can
10:36
tell you why i can tell you why
10:37
schrodinger's flee didn't take off not
10:39
enough cats
10:41
cats are extremely popular yeah he did
10:44
the animals definitely the wrong way
10:45
around
10:46
an idiot he did also i think he lived
10:47
with two women for a while did he which
10:49
is possibly him putting his quantum
10:52
experiments into action but yes it is
10:55
it is true and and you know everett was
10:58
essentially laughed out of
10:59
mainstream science initially for this
11:01
theory he was summoned to copenhagen to
11:03
meet
11:04
niels bohr and niels bohr called him
11:05
incredibly stupid
11:07
uh to his face i believe hold on neil's
11:08
boss summoned him to copenhagen
11:10
specifically in order to call him
11:11
incredible
11:12
he was invited to meet niels bohr in
11:14
copenhagen and
11:15
niels bohr rejected the idea outright
11:18
and he quit
11:18
being a physicist and became a defense
11:20
contractor and then it was only later
11:22
that the idea which is now
11:24
more or less considered to be yeah
11:26
feasible at least
11:27
is now accepted um i've only researched
11:29
the titanic
11:31
well i found out a real conspiracy
11:32
theory about the titanic that it was
11:34
switched
11:34
with its sister ship the olympic in in a
11:37
massive insurance scam
11:39
this is not true i'd like straight but
11:42
all right but loads of people have
11:43
proposed this for a very long time
11:44
because
11:44
the olympic had been in an accident and
11:46
there are all these theories that
11:48
um the ships were kind of given the old
11:50
switcheroo and that
11:51
actually one of them was a thousand
11:53
times lighter than it should have been
11:54
and
11:55
that's because the olympic was actually
11:56
a bit of a lighter ship and the titanic
11:58
had been bogged up
11:59
so um yeah it's it's complete bunk but
12:02
there are there are so many theories
12:03
about the titanic
12:05
my favorite um titanic conspiracy theory
12:07
is the one
12:08
about the film that actually titanic the
12:11
film was about jack dawson traveling in
12:14
time
12:14
yes because he accidentally makes
12:18
constant reference to stuff that
12:19
happened
12:19
after the titanic sank there's that
12:21
famous one where he talks about ice
12:23
fishing on a lake though
12:25
like with sosa which yeah wasn't built
12:26
until about four years later
12:28
that's right it's a man-made lake in
12:30
wisconsin yeah
12:31
yeah his his backpack is his swedish
12:34
army issue from 1939
12:39
and his haircut is clearly from the 90s
12:43
the other thing he refers to is a roller
12:45
coaster on santa monica
12:47
bay santa monica beach which again
12:48
wasn't built until three years
12:49
afterwards he said he's gonna take rose
12:51
on it and
12:52
you know he may have been planning to
12:53
take rose on it but how did he know it
12:55
was going to exist
12:56
there must have been plans though oh
12:58
you're saying he's gone through the
12:59
planning of
13:00
monica bay it's more feasible that he's
13:02
a time traveler to be honest
13:04
i read some of the same websites as you
13:06
did obviously and the
13:08
the problem with the theory is that he
13:10
saves rose from committing suicide
13:13
if she had gone overboard they probably
13:15
would have stopped the ship and looked
13:16
for her
13:16
and that might have prevented them from
13:19
hitting that iceberg so he basically
13:21
cared more about rose than every single
13:22
other person on that ship put together
13:24
you know some people just want to watch
13:26
the world burn yeah
13:29
maybe he was the first titanic tourist
13:31
maybe he was just there to see it happen
13:34
but it did it did have a collision
13:36
almost collision just as it was leaving
13:37
southampton
13:38
it um it was so big that it pulled
13:40
another ship towards it
13:42
uh the the titanic and um it was because
13:44
of gravitational fields
13:46
no because
13:50
um but the captain he very craftily
13:52
navigated
13:53
um and and so avoided a smash and set
13:56
off on the voyage
13:57
so if he hadn't obviously they would
13:58
have been delayed by a few hours or a
13:59
day or something
14:00
or they would and they would have met
14:01
the ice in daylight perhaps hey speaking
14:03
of the movie uh do you guys know
14:05
when the first ever movie was made about
14:08
the titanic
14:09
was that a night to remember or really
14:12
really soon afterwards so okay it was
14:13
called
14:14
saved from the titanic it was made in
14:16
1912
14:17
and it was made 29 days after the event
14:20
happened after the titanic sank
14:22
it starred this lady called dorothy
14:24
gibson and she was an actual survivor
14:26
of the titanic they talked her into it
14:29
uh they make her wear the
14:30
actual dress that she was wearing when
14:32
she was on the titanic you can even see
14:34
that there's all these press photos that
14:36
they've released
14:36
at the time where she's in the dress to
14:38
promote the movie
14:40
and yeah that that exists some people
14:42
said it was amazing
14:44
others said too soon
14:45
[Laughter]
14:48
she saw look i i don't blame her she saw
14:50
her opportunity you know what i mean
14:51
that was
14:52
i you know i i've been on i've been on
14:54
some cruises
14:55
i've been an entertainer on some
14:57
caribbean cruises
14:58
and and i don't know i was on a cruise
15:01
at the same time that the carnival
15:02
triumph
15:04
uh cruise ship um which ended up being
15:07
the most ironically named cruise ship
15:08
because it was not a party and it was
15:10
a pure failure uh where their electrics
15:14
went out and they drifted at sea for
15:16
five or six days and it almost
15:18
immediately turned to
15:20
anarchy cannibalism yeah practically so
15:23
people were
15:23
people were urinating and defecating in
15:25
the halls because apparently they didn't
15:27
realize they were surrounded by an ocean
15:29
and sleeping on deck because they didn't
15:31
have air conditioning anymore and it was
15:33
a big news story and i was so angry
15:36
that i was on this functioning cruise
15:37
ship rather than this poop
15:39
this poop cruise as it came to be known
15:41
because then as soon as i got back i
15:43
would go i'd be on the today show
15:44
you would minor television personality
15:47
suffers poop cruising
15:49
plus you could have claimed payment
15:50
presumably for the extra five days that
15:52
you would have been forced to entertain
15:53
everyone
15:56
i have this image of me in in a in a
15:59
fool's
16:00
garb dancing in front of the
16:02
self-appointed king of the
16:04
of the ship after society has broken
16:07
down
16:09
skating on feces
16:14
have we ever mentioned the fact just on
16:15
titanic films
16:17
there wasn't any footage when the
16:19
titanic left because it wasn't really
16:21
that big a deal
16:22
so people were more excited about the
16:23
olympic which left the year before
16:25
um and so there wasn't any actual
16:27
footage and when they showed the news
16:28
reels of you know the titanic sunk
16:30
in cinemas then they had to use footage
16:33
of the olympic and they just scratched
16:34
out
16:35
all uh the names on it because they
16:37
didn't have any footage of titanic
16:39
so when they were like look at this guy
16:40
leaving and they added a license plate
16:41
that said sync right yeah
16:43
oh that's the one well maybe that
16:44
contributed to the conspiracy about them
16:46
switching yeah
16:48
yeah that's amazing because all the
16:49
stuff i read is that it was a huge event
16:52
you know that they said that lots of
16:53
people turned out to wave it off i think
16:55
there was i think there was a big
16:56
objective
16:57
it turned out yeah but it was probably
16:58
like you know all the families are the
16:59
people who are actually going moving to
17:01
america
17:01
people are waving off the poop cruise
17:03
too
17:05
if it was marketed as the poop cruise i
17:07
would wave it off cheerfully
17:10
when the titanic took off 22 tons of
17:13
soap
17:14
and uh beef and mutton fat were smeared
17:16
on the slipway to get it into the sea
17:19
nice that sounds delicious yeah
17:22
so there is a man named andrew basiago i
17:25
don't know if i'm pronouncing his name
17:26
correctly but it's like
17:28
aseau cheese or asiago cheese with a ba
17:31
in front of it he has a website called
17:33
project pegasus he
17:34
claims that when he was a seven-year-old
17:36
child in the late 70s
17:38
he was recruited by darpa which is the
17:40
defense advance research projects
17:43
agency to be part of project pegasus
17:46
where they were training children to
17:47
become time travelers and he was sent
17:48
back through time
17:50
several times he visited gettysburg he
17:53
went to the ford theater
17:54
uh during the time of lincoln's
17:56
assassination three times and met
17:58
himself once there as a child
18:00
but he never actually saw the
18:02
assassination he never made it up to the
18:03
box
18:04
in time and so you can that's the thing
18:07
you could travel back in time to 1912 to
18:09
go see the titanic but you could
18:11
get on the wrong ship you know yeah i
18:13
mean maybe yeah
18:14
i think just keep going back until you
18:16
get the right ship keep going back until
18:18
persuade and usher to take you up to the
18:20
box guys
18:21
but darpa of course did create a whole
18:23
bunch of crazy things
18:24
that are not time travel didn't darpa
18:26
invent the internet pretty much
18:28
yeah the arpanet it was originally
18:29
called um the back when
18:32
darpa was arpa it's changed its name
18:34
twice from arpa to darpa
18:36
then to arpa and back to darpa it sounds
18:38
like it's invented by dr seuss
18:43
and arguably it's both at the same time
18:45
alex bell
18:46
uh who's in the qy office right now um
18:48
he's wearing a darpa
18:50
t-shirt uh so what's that in reference
18:52
no he's wearing
18:53
he's wearing a dharma initiative t-shirt
18:56
from the tv show loss
18:57
[Laughter]
18:59
which also which also uh dealt with a
19:02
lot of time travel
19:03
and in specifically it embraced um of a
19:07
kind of obscure
19:08
principle about time travel because
19:10
obviously time travel introduces a lot
19:12
of paradoxes in the various thought
19:13
experiments
19:15
and one of the explanations to get
19:16
around paradoxes
19:18
is the novikov self-consistency
19:20
principle
19:21
which was used in lost to explain
19:24
you can't change the past because we
19:26
were here that's the time travel
19:28
happened and we were here
19:30
so what we did is what happened and
19:32
nothing it's
19:33
basically there's there's do you see
19:35
what i mean i do but i'd like to refer
19:37
you to back to the future too
19:38
yes it makes it very clear how you can
19:40
end up in a different future where
19:41
donald trump is president basically
19:46
[Applause]
19:50
okay it is time for fact number two and
19:53
that is
19:54
james okay my fact this week is that
19:56
during the californian gold rush
19:58
a pair of boots could cost the
20:00
equivalent of 2
20:01
300 in today's money was it one specific
20:05
pair
20:06
yeah no it was any pair and this is what
20:11
happened because they were so much in
20:12
the middle of nowhere and because the
20:13
population had got
20:14
so high in such short amount of time and
20:16
they just didn't have provisions
20:18
people just had to pay top dollar for
20:20
everything uh and there's loads of
20:22
examples of this an individual lemon
20:23
would sell for the equivalent of twenty
20:25
dollars today
20:27
jesus yes but presumably most people
20:30
hadn't found
20:30
gold right because it was only a small
20:32
percentage of people who actually
20:34
struck really lucky so did most people
20:36
just not go go without lemons
20:38
people would find bits of gold um but
20:40
yeah basically
20:41
you could become rich doing anything
20:44
apart from looking for gold
20:46
really in that time everyone else made a
20:49
shitload of money and the people who
20:50
actually went looking for gold one or
20:51
two people did but mostly
20:53
struggled um they would do just as badly
20:56
as they did
20:57
when they were doing whatever else they
20:58
did so for instance there was a farmer
21:00
who sold onions who made
21:02
a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in
21:03
1849 just for selling onions
21:06
how do you know how much that is per
21:07
onion and how that compares to the lemon
21:09
i don't know
21:11
lemon has to be more than you think the
21:13
good thing about lemons is it cures
21:14
scurvy or stop scurvy
21:16
red exactly yeah yeah how long did this
21:18
last for
21:19
until everyone was broke um well so it
21:22
started the
21:23
gold rush in 48 1848 and it went on for
21:27
about three or four years
21:28
but you know there's still some people
21:29
looking for gold out there now like
21:31
it's still worth a try i bought these
21:35
boots
21:35
i'm going to get like bloody bullies
21:37
where all the farms were abandoned
21:39
weren't they so this is another reason
21:40
why food was really expensive is people
21:42
just
21:42
left their farms so as a result land
21:44
goes followed all the food has to be
21:45
imported right yeah the other thing is
21:47
no
21:47
there were basically no women around and
21:49
they at that time were
21:50
doing all the cooking so the men were
21:52
just going out to eat all the time they
21:53
weren't going home
21:54
yeah 75 of men in california gave up
21:57
their
21:58
jobs to become gold prospectors whoa
22:01
and one in a hundred men in the whole of
22:03
america
22:04
became gold prospectors whether that was
22:06
already living in california
22:07
or making the trek san francisco was
22:10
built with wood from the
22:11
ships that people took to get to the
22:13
gold rush yeah that's so cool
22:15
i had no idea abandoned their boats as
22:16
soon as they got there and there was
22:18
such a housing boom they ran out of
22:19
lumber and they
22:20
chopped the ships up yeah imagine people
22:23
the one guy who
22:24
actually was coming back for your ship
22:28
and we parked in harbor c
22:31
this is the number slot it's become a
22:34
house
22:36
so the first millionaire in california
22:38
was a guy called sam brannon
22:39
uh he was a journalist he owned the star
22:42
and he also had a store which kind of
22:43
sold provisions
22:45
and then someone came into his store
22:47
with some gold to buy
22:48
um some you know shovels and whatever
22:51
and he realized that they'd found gold
22:53
and so what he did instead of going out
22:54
to find gold himself
22:56
he smartly went round all the shops
22:59
bought all the shovels all the pickaxes
23:00
all the pans
23:01
everything that you would need put them
23:03
in his shop and then went into town
23:05
going there's gold in them their hills
23:07
everyone went crazy when oh no we need a
23:09
shovel he's like well i know where you
23:11
can get a shovel my shop
23:12
and so he became a millionaire from
23:14
selling provisions to
23:15
idiots the shovel millionaire yeah
23:18
very clever not as exciting as going and
23:21
mining for gold though
23:22
no i would have been one of the gold
23:24
idiots i went mining for gold the other
23:26
day
23:26
did you in alaska yeah how did you do it
23:28
were you panning panning yeah
23:30
nice did you find any i only found the
23:32
ones that they deliberately put in for
23:33
taurus to fight
23:35
these chocolate gold nuggets they put
23:38
like tiny flakes in how much did the pan
23:40
cost five thousand dollars
23:41
[Laughter]
23:43
were you in chicken by any chance
23:45
chicken no i was in juno
23:47
oh chicken is another place in alaska
23:49
where you get a lot of pounding for gold
23:51
is it as a popular population is 23 in
23:53
winter
23:54
seven yeah but when harsh winter
23:57
[Laughter]
23:58
but in panning season goes up to
24:00
hundreds juno alaska which is the
24:02
capital of alaska is not accessible by
24:04
road from the united states that's right
24:06
you can only fly there
24:08
yeah we'll get a boat i'll get it or get
24:10
a boat yes i suppose
24:11
yeah if you've still got a boat yeah
24:13
right so you haven't turned it into a
24:15
house in san francisco
24:17
actually when i was in juneau you kind
24:19
of see that the all the cruise ships
24:21
come in and the population just
24:23
goes massive during the day and then
24:25
everyone gets back on the boats and then
24:26
the evening it's empty
24:28
yeah and is that paranoia about people
24:30
turning their boats into houses like if
24:31
you don't
24:32
go back here every day you've got it
24:34
you've got to have a poo somewhere and
24:35
you've got to go on the deck of your
24:36
ship
24:39
i'm just going back to juno because i
24:41
was there last week um
24:42
there's a bar there it's very old bar
24:45
and
24:45
they've kind of got a history of gold
24:47
miners used to go there
24:48
and they have sawdust on the floor and
24:50
apparently this is what they always used
24:51
to do
24:52
have sawdust on the floor of miners bars
24:55
i thought that was the soak up vomit
24:56
yeah right
24:57
yeah you would think that but actually
24:59
apparently the reason was
25:00
so they would pay for their drinks with
25:02
little bits of gold
25:03
but obviously once you're drunk you're
25:05
going to drop your bits of gold don't
25:07
you
25:07
but if you drop them into sawdust then
25:10
you won't be able to find them
25:11
so that you would drop them there and
25:12
then the next morning the owner of the
25:14
tavern
25:15
would kind of sweep up all of the
25:16
sawdust put it in water
25:18
the sawdust would float but the gold
25:20
would sink and they'd get the gold down
25:22
and they'd get loads more gold
25:24
same principle is why all entertainment
25:26
for the gold miners was ball
25:28
ponds uh get the miners in the ball
25:31
ponds they drop all their gold
25:32
i can't find them among the balls there
25:35
was a there was a little
25:36
a little moment of cultural translation
25:38
there yeah sorry what are they in
25:39
america ball pits
25:41
were there ball pits here really yeah
25:44
you had one in my garden as a boy we had
25:46
a ball plant
25:48
because the ball lake was further down
25:50
the ground
25:51
that sounds much more gracious
25:59
[Laughter]
26:02
another one of these businessmen who'd
26:03
set up a business to to profit
26:05
was uh levi strauss oh yeah yeah yeah
26:08
yeah so he came over
26:09
he was he was selling uh canvas tarps uh
26:12
so that they could take out there and
26:13
then
26:13
as a result the business started booming
26:15
and then he got into levi jeans and now
26:16
we have
26:18
you're presumably wearing levi jeans uh
26:21
no
26:21
why would you presume that i just assume
26:23
all genes are levied
26:25
and presumes fashion for me misplaced
26:28
yeah so levi jeans sort of uh because
26:31
the miners were very fashion conscious
26:33
yeah gotta look good with your gold they
26:35
needed clothes with rivets on them
26:37
and then it took ages to remove the
26:38
crotch rivet i think
26:40
didn't they there was a crotch ring you
26:43
mean
26:44
they kept the tradition of having the
26:45
crotch rivet as opposed to it took
26:46
actual
26:47
hours together let me just slip out of
26:50
these
26:54
another item of clothing that um people
26:56
needed actually was
26:57
egg carrying jackets because the gold
27:01
rush was quickly followed by the egg
27:03
rush
27:04
and this was that's everyone running
27:08
back to the cruise ship isn't it
27:10
yes um no this was they needed some
27:12
protein to get their mining done
27:14
so they ran out of eggs quite quickly
27:15
and someone spotted it on the far allen
27:17
islands which was just off san francisco
27:19
there were these seabirds
27:20
that laid these gigantic eggs apparently
27:22
they were twice the size of chicken's
27:23
eggs and they laid
27:25
red yolks and transparent whited eggs
27:28
but they were in high demand and it was
27:30
incredibly dangerous to get to these
27:32
islands
27:32
they were full of great white sharks the
27:34
the waters around them
27:35
and extremely turbulent seas but people
27:38
went there and they harvested these eggs
27:40
and obviously they could sell the eggs
27:41
at a huge price because no one else is
27:43
getting eggs
27:44
like lemon style prices exactly they
27:46
were up there with the
27:47
lemon island was next door um but what
27:50
they used to do was they used to get
27:51
there get all the eggs they could into
27:53
their specially made egg jackets which
27:54
had lots of pockets for eggs and then
27:56
they'd smash
27:57
all the other eggs on the island because
28:00
because because they
28:04
wanted to keep it scarce no in fact
28:07
because they'd come back the next day
28:08
but they needed to know which ones were
28:09
the fresh ones
28:11
so they smashed the ones that i've been
28:12
there before
28:14
yeah there was oh yeah clever right yeah
28:17
anyway then there were these egg wars in
28:18
the early 50s because it was taken over
28:20
by one private company this island and
28:22
then another company tried to
28:24
invade still exist i'm sorry to
28:26
interrupt you a bit do they still exist
28:27
i really want to know i don't know if
28:29
anyone's ever had
28:30
one of these giant and what kind of sea
28:31
bird are we talking about here uh
28:33
it's a kind of it looks like a penguin
28:35
and it's called a common myrrh
28:36
m-u-r-e yeah that's kind of an
28:40
unpleasant name for what provided a
28:42
quite a valid
28:44
comes from will be a small version is it
28:45
a little oh yeah yeah yeah
28:47
have you heard of a hang town fry no no
28:50
hang town fry is a something you get in
28:52
san francisco
28:54
and it is um it's derived from the gold
28:57
rush it was sir it's a it's an
28:59
egg dish and the legend again we're
29:01
dealing with legends here is that
29:03
when someone struck it big in the gold
29:05
rush they would someone went in
29:07
and ordered i just give me anything that
29:10
involves the most expensive things you
29:11
have
29:12
so a hang town fry was uh
29:16
an omelet made of expensive eggs and
29:18
mixed with bacon which was shipped in
29:20
from the east
29:21
and fried oysters on top and it's
29:25
served in a pair of boots served in a
29:27
spare golden boots
29:30
and it was originally in placerville
29:31
california which was then known as hang
29:34
town because they hanged a lot of people
29:36
there
29:37
uh justice was harsh in placerville oh
29:39
i'd give my desirable breakfast a
29:41
different name i think that didn't have
29:43
so much association with killing people
29:45
it's kind of got a cowboy sound to it i
29:46
suppose i suppose
29:48
people of the west are weird yeah
29:51
they want vengeance with their breakfast
29:56
that's such a good film name vengeance
29:58
vengeance for breakfast
29:59
when they cook it they smash all the
30:01
other eggs in the kitchen that's right
30:02
just to make sure
30:05
so were there a lot of rushes in that
30:08
period
30:08
like egg rush gold rush i read that
30:11
there was the silver rush
30:12
which was in uh calico which is now a
30:14
ghost town
30:16
um anything else there was another gold
30:18
rush which uh
30:19
melbourne was casually not making too
30:21
much fuss about down under but melbourne
30:23
became the richest city in the world in
30:25
the 1850s i think because they had a
30:27
gold rush gold was found there
30:29
and people did better in melbourne than
30:31
in san francisco it seems like
30:32
i think there were fewer of them so
30:34
maybe that helped there was a thing in
30:35
australia
30:36
where in uh the west of australia in
30:38
kalgoorlie
30:39
uh sorry kalgoorlie i can't say it
30:42
kalgoorlie kalgoorlie how are we
30:45
spelling it
30:48
chicago
30:56
so this this in western australia and um
30:59
they
30:59
had a similar sort of gold rush but what
31:01
they didn't notice was there's a
31:03
different type of gold
31:04
which is it just wasn't recognized as
31:06
gold properly at the time because it
31:07
wasn't shiny and it wasn't gold
31:09
anyway the point is is that they thought
31:10
it was a bit of a waste rock so they
31:12
were paving the streets with it and
31:13
suddenly this
31:14
they discovered that it was an element
31:15
of gold inside it so suddenly they
31:17
realized that they'd been paving the
31:18
streets
31:19
with gold effectively and so all the
31:21
roads were dug up
31:22
and they were then collecting it and
31:24
making lots of money are you sure that
31:25
sounds a bit like a
31:27
lie you've been spun by your jewelry
31:28
dealer for the engagement you've got
31:30
it's a different type of gold not shiny
31:33
it may look
31:34
like tarmac to you sir but actually
31:37
um she'll love it i have heard of that
31:39
kalgoorlie
31:40
thing actually i think it is if you do
31:42
ever go on a caribbean cruise prepare
31:44
for a lot of seminars on tanzanite
31:46
the mineral of the future yeah really
31:49
they are really pushing tanzanite hard
31:51
is that what you were entertaining
31:52
people with on your cruise
31:54
i was a tanzanite salesman
31:57
i just thought of another rush um there
31:59
was an alpaca rush
32:00
in america oh no let me tell you yeah
32:03
that was
32:04
you know that's a big deal i think a lot
32:05
of people lost a lot of money on the
32:07
track yeah and that's not that long ago
32:09
maybe 15 years ago or so
32:10
how do you mind for alpacas
32:12
[Laughter]
32:18
and in western new england there was a
32:19
huge llama and alpaca boom
32:22
people started raising alpacas and
32:25
llamas
32:26
for their uh fur to make into textiles
32:28
and yarn and
32:29
junk and they're also uh adorably dumb
32:32
to look at
32:32
oh my god they're my favorite animal if
32:34
anyone if any fans want to get me a
32:36
present and get me a llama
32:37
they farm them quite intensively and so
32:39
not that intensively
32:40
you
32:45
you did see them though in western
32:47
massachusetts and throughout the united
32:48
states there was a huge boom in alpaca
32:51
farming uh and then it went alpaca bust
32:54
and um people were buying alpacas from
32:57
south america for
32:58
tens of thousands of dollars and then
33:00
they were selling them for fifteen
33:01
hundred dollars or something like that
33:04
the market collapsed yeah it was it was
33:06
the case that you would be able to buy
33:07
a young alpaca and then grow it up and
33:10
then you make a load of money
33:11
that was only for about a couple of
33:13
years right and then suddenly
33:14
people realize these things are
33:16
definitely not worth that much money
33:17
right like tulip mania i guess
33:19
yeah yeah but i'll pay anything for them
33:21
seriously
33:21
[Laughter]
33:23
do you live in an apartment yeah let me
33:25
recommend a vicuna
33:28
it's the smallest of the llamas okay
33:31
thank you it's more it's more of a like
33:33
a lap
33:34
llama you know what i mean such a good
33:36
tip yeah yeah because we've only got one
33:38
small sofa and there's already yeah
33:39
yeah you can squeeze live happily with a
33:41
vikunian okay
33:43
thank you just sit on the llama you've
33:46
got two sofas right there oh yeah yeah
33:48
that's really good
33:50
you're not really allowed to use them
33:51
you're not really you shouldn't use the
33:53
sofas but also i don't think
33:54
you're allowed to sit on their backs
33:56
because they snap
33:58
um oh yeah they're mean creatures no
34:00
sorry
34:04
get the off me
34:08
you're saying that i would break a llama
34:10
in half if i sat on that thing i'm not
34:11
saying anything about anybody but i am
34:13
saying
34:14
you can damage their backs there are
34:15
photos of edwardian gentlemen having a
34:17
great time sitting on llamas but i think
34:19
yeah current medical advice says we
34:21
shouldn't they're among the gentlest of
34:23
the vertebrates
34:24
[Laughter]
34:27
[Applause]
34:28
[Music]
34:31
okay it is time for fact number three
34:33
and that is andy
34:35
my fact is that the area of australia
34:37
owned by british people is larger than
34:39
britain
34:41
that's amazing don't cough after
34:44
my back
34:46
i'll take this moment you've made your
34:47
opinion oh that's all
34:52
i see that's a great fact handy thank
34:54
you very much james well i'll tell you
34:56
um so what this means is
34:59
basically australia is absolutely
35:01
massive and uh
35:02
they've just done a survey of sort of
35:04
foreign land ownership because there's
35:06
been a lot of um
35:07
kerfuffle about this in australia and
35:09
the amount owned
35:10
by british companies is 27.5 million
35:13
hectares
35:15
and britain itself is only 24 million
35:18
hectares although i mean technically one
35:21
british person owns the whole of
35:23
australia right
35:24
technically none of these people own the
35:26
land they're just leasing it from her
35:27
majesty the queen
35:29
yes um that's true the largest
35:32
non-state non-monarchy private land
35:36
holding on earth
35:36
is this family called the kidman's um
35:38
who they
35:41
they own a bit of australia which is
35:43
larger than
35:44
scotland it's larger than hungary it's
35:46
three quarters of the size of england
35:48
and they recently tried to put it up for
35:50
sale it was founded by a man called sir
35:52
sydney kidman in 1899 who uh went off as
35:55
a teenager with a one-eyed horse
35:56
and founded a load of these castle
35:57
stations all over australia um
35:59
it went up for sale last year it would
36:01
have taken about a week just to visit
36:03
the property as it's in a few different
36:05
places and you'd have to
36:06
get a plane between them all yeah only
36:08
150 people live there
36:10
it's basically a series of massive
36:11
cattle stations out in the yeah
36:13
i think it's the outback i'm not not
36:15
quite sure where the outback begins and
36:16
ends yeah and didn't they try and sell
36:18
it recently they tried to sell it but
36:19
they
36:20
denied it was blocked because they were
36:21
selling it to a chinese majority-owned
36:23
consortium
36:23
the australian government said no you're
36:25
not allowed to do that trying to keep it
36:26
australian owned
36:27
i read a headline about the largest
36:29
foreign landowner in china
36:31
being ikea i'm not really sure what this
36:35
means but according to
36:36
a reuters report from a couple of years
36:37
ago ikea was the biggest foreign
36:39
landowner in china with 6.89
36:42
million square feet which doesn't seem
36:43
like very much compared to 29 million
36:46
hectares but
36:47
maybe maybe maybe it's uh that
36:49
might just be one
36:51
massive branch of ikea actually takes a
36:54
week to get around that
36:55
yeah yeah exactly yeah the largest
36:57
electoral district in australia is
36:59
bigger than mongolia
37:01
what what yeah it's called jurac and
37:04
it's in wesleyans in wa
37:06
and yeah it's bigger slightly bigger
37:07
than mongolia i should have written down
37:09
those figures it's
37:10
it's about a thousand kilometers squared
37:11
bigger than the square kilometer area
37:14
i just can't believe it because mongolia
37:16
it's huge yeah
37:17
i know i don't get it didn't i i read in
37:20
1933 that western australia
37:22
voted to leave australia so like a
37:24
brexit they just said we don't want to
37:26
be a part of australia anymore they did
37:27
the vote it was successful and then they
37:29
just australia said no we're not we're
37:31
not letting you do it
37:32
yeah it was a poll i think wasn't it
37:34
yeah yeah it was so it wasn't a
37:36
vote it was to see if they would want to
37:38
leave and then i think they said they
37:39
would so the government was like cool
37:40
let's not have an election
37:44
it was just advisory yes
37:47
western australia i wrote down that it's
37:48
got 2.6 million people
37:50
over 2.5 million square kilometers
37:53
it is ver and most of those people are
37:55
all crammed into
37:56
is perth western australia yeah yeah so
37:59
basically everyone there is in perth
38:00
yeah and there's a town called kimberly
38:03
which has a population a third the size
38:05
of wembley stadium when full
38:07
um but is three times the size of
38:09
england
38:09
[Music]
38:11
i've stayed in kimberly have you yeah my
38:13
grandmother lived there
38:14
yeah yeah yeah and i went panning for
38:16
gold there did you yeah
38:18
yeah what a weird connection yeah there
38:20
is a place where they get opals
38:22
um and i think they have a lot of people
38:24
living underground there because it's so
38:25
hot
38:26
all the opal miners all live underground
38:28
yeah so the heat is so great that
38:30
they've decided okay let's actually just
38:31
build
38:32
underground so you go and you can see
38:34
these amazing pictures online
38:35
of just everyone's houses i mean they're
38:38
not that amazing because they just look
38:39
like a lounge room but
38:40
but they're underground yeah you have to
38:43
picture that bit in your head when
38:44
you're going
38:45
i have a feeling they might have a golf
38:46
course which you can only play at night
38:48
time because it's too hot during the day
38:50
but i might have made that up well at
38:52
least golf survives
38:54
[Laughter]
38:56
it is the ultimate survivor it'll be
38:58
there after the apocalypse it's so hot
38:59
do they have grass or is it one massive
39:02
bunker yeah it's a sand
39:03
course yeah i think it's compacted sand
39:06
yeah they also have a ball pond but all
39:08
the balls evaporated
39:13
because australia sells sound to saudi
39:15
arabia
39:16
sand and camels because saudi arabia's
39:18
sand doesn't work for building in its
39:19
camels don't work for eating
39:21
um so australia's got plenty extra i saw
39:24
i saw
39:25
um i went my sister lives in abu dhabi
39:27
and we went on a kind of desert trek and
39:29
you can go and
39:30
and ride on camels and see the camels so
39:32
you go in these uh 4x4 cars you get to
39:34
the bit
39:35
and what they have is this kind of edge
39:36
of a huge sand dune where they lead the
39:38
camel to
39:39
and they point it backwards and the
39:41
camel poos off the edge and they tell
39:43
you go look at the amazing
39:44
um toilet of the camels and you walk to
39:46
the edge of this sand dune
39:48
and you just see this you know this like
39:50
terrifying
39:51
world just below you yeah but what
39:53
they don't tell you is that obviously
39:55
they're very much the ships of the
39:56
desert
40:01
but yeah like you you know some people
40:02
were almost falling off the edge right
40:04
into it because you're on the lip of a
40:05
sound
40:05
and if someone's sorry i don't mean to
40:07
interrupt if someone said to me
40:09
go over to that cliff and look at a
40:11
bunch of camel poos
40:12
[Laughter]
40:13
i would say no thank you i'm fine here
40:17
i believe you that it's there tourist
40:19
attractions are few and far between
40:21
there
40:21
i believe was it impressive then what'd
40:24
you say
40:25
yeah it was amazing yeah yeah yeah it
40:26
was just a huge mound of poo
40:28
as you know off the edge of a sand dune
40:31
yeah it's incredible it sounds good
40:33
um so some more bits about australia's
40:36
level of hugeness and isolation the most
40:40
isolated post office in australia is
40:43
also in western australia it's 32
40:45
kilometers from the nearest customer
40:47
so everyone who uses that post office is
40:49
having to drive 32 kilometers wow
40:52
how do you might as well just keep going
40:54
deliver your letter yourself
40:57
wow have you heard of the school of the
40:59
air no
41:00
this is a school for australian children
41:02
who live in such remote places that it's
41:04
absolutely impossible to get them to a
41:05
school basically
41:06
and it used to be done over the radio
41:09
you'd have an
41:10
hour of lessons and then you'd have a
41:12
workbook which you would complete with a
41:13
you know an older brother or a parent or
41:15
something like that and now these days
41:16
of course they do it over the internet
41:18
but this is a thing that happens there
41:19
are children educated
41:20
did a teacher then have to drive 200 000
41:22
miles around everyone's houses to do the
41:23
marking yes
41:24
[Laughter]
41:26
i have a hat for a place that's called
41:29
mystery island which is off of vanuatu
41:31
and it's a hat that says mystery island
41:33
they have a big sign i've seen pictures
41:34
of it and my friend used to go there and
41:36
he used to do cruises so he was the
41:37
comedian on a cruise
41:38
last time he went they were told that
41:40
mystery island no longer exists
41:42
there was something to do with a tsunami
41:43
that had hit somewhere and the ocean
41:45
level it just
41:46
it just took it down those shifts what
41:48
made it mysterious before it disappeared
41:50
because that's pretty much the most
41:51
mysterious thing i can think of
41:53
i think it was because uh the way it was
41:55
positioned that if you came into rough
41:57
seas
41:57
the seas were so rough that it was
41:58
impossible to get to the land and the
42:00
land is actually
42:01
oh i see smash so it's a mystery island
42:03
because you never knew when you could
42:04
get
42:04
on board or a time traveler visited it
42:07
and named it from the future knowing
42:09
that it was going to mysterious
42:11
yeah possibly yeah but i went on
42:13
tripadvisor and it's reappeared so
42:15
mystery island is back
42:16
do you know something that's under
42:18
australia this is new zealand
42:20
no yeah it's the world's longest natural
42:23
electric current
42:24
it's more than six thousand kilometers
42:26
long you can see a map of it is this
42:28
enormous line
42:29
stretching all the way under the
42:30
continent and then carving out wow yeah
42:32
it's caused by the earth's magnetic
42:34
field as it shifts it generates this
42:35
current
42:36
unfortunately it's very weak and could
42:37
not light a lamp
42:41
so it's really pathetic but it is there
42:42
it is massive did you see in the news
42:44
australia's gps is five feet off yes
42:47
that's incredible so it's been shifting
42:49
faster than people were expecting so
42:51
it's something like seven centimeters a
42:53
year
42:54
it's been going so now it's five feet in
42:56
the wrong spot
42:57
where it says you have now reached your
42:58
destination no i haven't
43:01
all of australia is moving seven
43:03
centimeters a year yeah
43:05
they knew it was going to happen it's
43:06
just that gps is aware of this and knows
43:08
it has to update
43:09
uh regularly so the last time i updated
43:11
was 1992 i think people have kept on
43:12
clicking
43:13
delay delay i'll update later i'll do it
43:15
tomorrow
43:16
since 1992 yeah but it could be quite
43:19
dangerous because if there's a
43:21
uh robot trucks in future for instance
43:22
could use gps
43:24
to be transported around and they could
43:26
be driving on the wrong side of the road
43:27
if they're
43:28
a few centimeters out yeah yeah head-on
43:30
collisions
43:31
is it is it the case did you read in the
43:32
story that that's faster than most
43:34
other all other con is the fastest
43:36
moving continent really
43:37
yeah yeah it's running a scarfering from
43:40
new zealand like
43:41
nobody's business how fast it's seven
43:43
seconds seven centimeters a year
43:44
i think it was that i don't know yeah
43:46
it's not very much
43:48
it's not too much you're a huge
43:50
continent
43:51
give it some credit does australia have
43:55
any land ownership anywhere else in the
43:56
world
43:57
they have some islands don't they yeah
43:59
but in kind of surrounding is there any
44:01
like just canada somewhere in canada
44:04
kind of thing
44:04
have we got anything yeah yeah just a
44:06
little a little i think they own slough
44:08
soup soul of australia yeah i'm just
44:12
curious
44:12
no i don't think so oh they claim um
44:15
they claim us
44:16
um a kind of a pie piece of antarctica
44:19
yeah with a bunch of others if you add
44:22
together that
44:23
and uh all the rest of the stuff the
44:25
queen owns um
44:28
then the russian federation is no longer
44:29
the largest single political entity on
44:31
earth
44:32
but russia also claims all of the north
44:34
pole and some of the south pole as well
44:36
yes
44:36
oh well there we go all right and most
44:38
of eastern europe
44:39
[Laughter]
44:42
your move queenie
44:51
okay it's time for our final fact of the
44:53
show and that is chozinski
44:56
my fact is that in the first half of the
44:58
20th century multiple countries
45:00
considered draining the mediterranean
45:01
sea
45:03
and this is something yeah why not
45:07
were they looking for the lost city of
45:08
atlantis um they weren't although
45:10
weirdly the
45:11
new continent that it created was going
45:13
to be called atlantropa
45:15
so this was the brainchild of an
45:17
architect a german architect called
45:18
herman sorgel
45:20
and he was promoting this from 1928
45:22
until he died in 1952
45:24
and he had this vision of world peace
45:26
and thought almost emptying the med was
45:28
the way to do it
45:29
so he wouldn't completely empty it but
45:31
it would decrease in level by like 100
45:34
to 200 meters
45:35
is this the idea of like we'll all come
45:37
together if i
45:38
cause an ecological catastrophe
45:42
yes in a crisis people work together
45:45
it was the idea that um we could use a
45:48
lot of the land so obviously we know
45:49
there was a problem with laban fraume
45:51
and living space around that time
45:53
and people europe wanted to expand its
45:55
population into different places so it
45:57
was the idea of creating all this new
45:58
land
45:59
i'd say there was a perceived problem
46:01
with that um
46:02
all right we know whose side you're on
46:05
the allies
46:07
exactly still going with that old team
46:11
getting an inkling as to whose side
46:13
you're on now to be fair
46:15
they're also called the allies they're
46:17
just her allies
46:19
exactly um actually so this guy wrote a
46:22
bunch of books promoting this idea and
46:24
he had a quote from hitler on the fly
46:25
leaf of one of his books in 1938
46:28
which was could not put it down
46:30
[Laughter]
46:36
so how are they going to drain the
46:37
mediterranean pull the plug um
46:39
he was going to uh it was going to take
46:41
a long time i think it was going to take
46:43
150 years
46:44
and just buckets
46:49
the idea was damming up all the places
46:51
where water could get in so damn up the
46:53
strait of gibraltar
46:55
um dam up the dardanelle uh dam up the
46:57
bit between tunisia and sicily
46:59
uh and eventually water would stop
47:01
coming into the med and it would dry up
47:03
and also all these dams would be the
47:05
locations of huge hydroelectric
47:07
power plants and so the power generated
47:09
by them
47:10
would provide power for everyone and the
47:12
final advantage of his plan
47:13
was that it would be so costly for all
47:16
countries that signed up and all
47:17
countries would have to sign up
47:18
that they wouldn't have any money to
47:20
fight each other after that
47:21
[Laughter]
47:22
and he said if if any country uh starts
47:25
threatening peace
47:26
then the hydroelectric power would be
47:28
cut off the idea was that the power
47:29
would be
47:30
central central control exactly
47:33
administered yeah yeah so there was a
47:35
disadvantage wasn't it going to turn
47:36
a lot of north africa into a massive
47:38
inland lake yes it was
47:40
yeah which disadvantage though it well
47:42
it didn't enter into his plans that
47:44
quite a lot of people lived in north
47:45
africa
47:46
well i'm not sure he thought of it that
47:47
way but actually there have been
47:49
plans to turn a lot of north africa into
47:52
a lake anyway
47:53
like separate plants uh yeah saharan sea
47:56
people have been um suggesting this uh
47:58
actually the french government when they
48:00
owned a lot of north africa
48:01
looked into it properly and what they
48:04
found is there's
48:04
quite a few depressions in the sahara uh
48:08
that are
48:08
under kind of sea level and they thought
48:10
maybe we could get some water in there
48:11
and it would
48:12
instead of being a desert would become a
48:14
place where people could live more
48:15
comfortably it would be a desert with a
48:17
lake in it
48:19
that's probably true but they actually
48:21
had some funding but it was withdrawn
48:22
when surveys revealed that many areas
48:25
were not as
48:25
far below sea level as had been believed
48:28
so they thought these depressions were
48:30
below sea level but actually they were
48:31
higher because they were in high land
48:33
do you know about the last time that the
48:34
mediterranean dried up
48:36
no this was a thing called the messinian
48:39
salinity crisis
48:41
which happens six million right off the
48:42
tongue yeah they need they need some
48:44
branding
48:45
um it's when it became landlocked that's
48:48
it spain and morocco
48:49
crashed into each other basically and
48:51
seven centimeters per year
48:52
yeah yeah pretty slow but we're seven
48:55
centimeters away from them
48:58
you just don't think ahead darling
49:02
and so the climate is really dry and so
49:04
the med is prone to lots of evaporation
49:06
and as a result of that uh drying
49:09
process there are salt
49:10
deposits on the bottom of the med which
49:12
in some places are two miles
49:14
thick whoa yeah and during the time it
49:17
was closing when they were moving
49:18
towards each other
49:19
uh the basin of the med evaporated and
49:21
then re-flooded 69
49:23
separate times and then it finally was
49:26
cut off completely 5.6 million years ago
49:28
theory
49:28
is that one of these floodings um could
49:31
have been
49:32
what caused a lot of the flood myths in
49:34
various religions isn't it
49:35
yeah but that's so pretty human it's so
49:38
pretty
49:38
million years ago it's fine because it
49:40
eventually re-flooded properly 5.3
49:42
million years ago
49:44
and that's the biggest flood that earth
49:46
has ever seen and that
49:48
flooded in the space of i think a few
49:49
months or maybe a year
49:51
and the flood waters would move at 100
49:52
kilometers per hour i think
49:54
as they seeped back in and it was caused
49:56
by a bit of land
49:58
just caving in at one of the little
50:00
joints gibraltar wasn't it that was when
50:01
the straits of gibraltar were created it
50:03
was that
50:03
gradually tipping over and then
50:05
gradually you know wore away more of the
50:07
bridge and it gets faster and faster and
50:09
it sounds amazing what happens to you if
50:10
you're a fish in that
50:12
sort of just in that moment yeah like do
50:14
you die is that too fast is there too
50:16
fast for a fish
50:18
kilometers an hour isn't too fast yeah
50:20
sure but there certainly is too fast for
50:22
a fish
50:23
is it i would say so yeah and is a
50:25
spin-off podcast
50:26
[Laughter]
50:30
what speed well i don't know what the
50:31
speed is but like for instance there's
50:33
too windy for a human
50:35
yeah for instance like you know if if if
50:38
something's hitting you at a certain
50:39
speed
50:40
be it air molecules or water molecules
50:42
or anything or a wall
50:44
yeah there is too fast for a fish but if
50:46
you're going with the tide if you're
50:47
going with
50:48
if you're going with the wind though no
50:50
but no no with dan on this one wouldn't
50:52
geforce wouldn't the
50:54
you're going with the medium in which
50:57
you are traveling is carrying you along
50:58
900 kilometers per hour it's like you're
51:01
fishing a car at that point yes that's
51:02
what i'm thinking
51:03
yeah the turbulence of the water that
51:05
might cause some stress
51:07
crushed into your fish mate yeah right
51:09
you wouldn't experience it as moving at
51:11
100 miles an hour because
51:12
you're in the car right yeah and and
51:14
then what's weird is that when the fish
51:17
got back home all the fish at home would
51:19
be it would be thousands of years later
51:21
for them
51:23
it's called time dilation it's the only
51:25
scientifically proven form of time
51:26
travel actually
51:29
[Music]

01:25
all the most interesting stories that we
01:27
found
01:27
from 2017. this is one that i want to
01:30
get into the book
01:31
mafia members in sicily have been banned
01:33
from becoming godfathers
01:35
so this is an archbishop who has said
01:38
that at baptisms if you are involved in
01:40
the mafia you are now not allowed to
01:42
become
01:43
a godfather here's one that i've got
01:45
when they voted for the uk general
01:47
election
01:48
there was only 13 mps that didn't vote
01:50
for it and one of them did it because
01:52
it was going to interfere with this
01:53
honeymoon
01:55
okay this is one that i'd like to get in
01:57
this is something that's been revealed
01:58
in the last couple of weeks
01:59
and it's that a norwegian slow tv show
02:03
that follows migrating reindeer has had
02:05
to be suspended after the reindeer
02:07
stopped moving all together
02:10
i've gotten a fact that i'd like to get
02:12
into the book oh yeah which is that
02:14
jeremy corbyn
02:15
has won seven elections for
02:18
parliamentary beard of the year
02:20
wow really yeah and it's practically
02:22
unparalleled in modern history
02:24
is he the current reigning champ current
02:27
labour leader uh yeah
02:28
depending on when you're listening to
02:29
this um is that what he spends all his
02:32
time
02:32
campaigning for them yes he won the
02:34
actual beard of the year quite a long
02:36
time ago i think
02:37
yeah as opposed to the niche
02:38
parliamentary bill yeah yeah i think
02:40
that's like um a qualifying round
02:43
hopefully i make the regionals yeah well
02:44
he he made global beard of the year oh i
02:47
think it's british spirit
02:48
a british beard of the year okay yeah he
02:50
won he is the reigning champion yes and
02:52
he won
02:53
i think with 64 of the vote last year
02:55
which is slightly more than he won
02:57
that year's leadership contest with when
02:59
when is the next uh championship
03:02
uh it'll be this year so in time uh i
03:05
meant month is it in time for our book
03:08
i think it will be in time for the book
03:09
so we'll be able to announce
03:11
whether he's won at a record seventh
03:12
time let's hope so because if we had a
03:14
book of news of 2017 and we weren't able
03:16
to get in the results of beard of the
03:17
year
03:18
it would just be a joke
03:21
sorry i think you mean parliamentary
03:22
beard of the year yeah
03:25
yeah so that's it the book's going to be
03:27
just packed with all that sort of stuff
03:29
and we thought we would spend this
03:30
episodes not telling you our most
03:32
interesting fact that we've learned over
03:33
the last seven days strictly from
03:35
all of history but we would pick
03:37
something that we want to go into this
03:39
book and pitch it to each other
03:40
so that's what we're gonna do starting
03:42
with you andy
03:44
my fact that i would like to get into
03:46
the book
03:47
is that ideas proposed for the u.s
03:50
border wall
03:51
include a trench full of nuclear waste a
03:53
one-way mirror
03:55
and three million hammocks next to each
03:57
other
03:58
three million hammocks yeah that is not
04:00
so much a serious proposal but no
04:03
because you could just go under them
04:04
or over them depending on how high up
04:06
the tree they're tied
04:09
ah so are there gonna be trees along
04:10
this border i think it's not a fixed
04:12
proposal yet i think you could plant the
04:14
trees
04:14
you'd have to have something to attack
04:16
the hammocks too yeah is the idea that
04:18
you get to a hammock it looks so
04:19
comfortable you lie down have a nap and
04:21
you never make it across
04:22
i think that's the idea okay there is an
04:24
artist
04:26
whose name is jennifer meridian who's
04:29
proposed that one she's proposed also a
04:31
wall of pipe organs
04:32
uh and a wall of lighthouses thousands
04:34
and thousands of lighthouses
04:36
so this was a big push wasn't it for uh
04:38
proposals to be sent in
04:39
so they they had a little five day
04:40
window where you could submit your
04:41
proposals
04:42
uh and then they're going to pick around
04:45
20 finalists in about a month or so
04:47
and they're going to build prototypes of
04:48
their sections of them how they're going
04:49
to
04:50
build a prototype of the nuclear waste
04:52
one
04:54
just a little bit of depleted uranium
04:56
exactly yeah
04:57
uh i don't know but the one-way mirror
04:59
is very interesting
05:00
incredible idea you can see mexico from
05:03
the usa but they can't see you
05:04
yeah what's the what's the point in that
05:07
i have no idea
05:08
you could still see someone approaching
05:10
if they were going to try and climb the
05:11
mirror
05:11
and you don't know if you're if if
05:13
you're approaching for the mexican side
05:14
you don't know if
05:15
you're being locked down okay i thought
05:17
it was just the mexicans go towards and
05:19
go oh no it's just exactly like here we
05:20
might as well say
05:23
and there are loads of proposals one of
05:24
them has a monorail going all the way
05:26
along the top
05:26
oh yeah like a hyperloop they're calling
05:28
it right yeah but it's a monorail it's a
05:30
monorail yeah okay
05:31
what's the difference between those two
05:32
things oh one sounds super futuristic
05:34
and the other
05:35
monorail yeah we've all seen that
05:37
episode of the simpsons
05:40
i read the rules for um the proposals
05:42
yeah the idea of what the
05:43
wall needs to withstand uh it's
05:47
nissa would stand attacks from here's
05:49
the quote sledgehammer carjack pick
05:51
axe chisel battery operated impact tools
05:55
any kind of handheld tools and not only
05:57
does it have to
05:58
sort of deal with the impact but it
06:00
should be able to deal with it for up to
06:01
four hours
06:02
so specifically for us so four hours of
06:05
a sledgehammer meanwhile there's some
06:06
bloke next to you
06:07
with the chisel it's like why do you
06:10
need to specify
06:11
the chisel when you've also got the
06:13
carjackers smashing into it
06:15
for four hours
06:19
we've made it car driving proof but
06:20
there's a chisel weakness unfortunately
06:23
it's like the death star there's going
06:24
to be just one
06:26
little weak spot so it's a very stupid
06:29
idea obviously yeah
06:30
and they want it ideally to be 30 foot
06:32
tall and
06:33
um so all the proposals had so it's a 30
06:35
foot tall mirror
06:36
which is quite cool he's become more
06:39
flexible on the 30-foot thing yeah i
06:40
think he's gone
06:41
he said anything over 18 feet might be
06:43
okay one of the problems
06:45
is that um they obviously need to build
06:47
their the wall on their side
06:48
of the land on the american side of land
06:50
but there's a lot of american landowners
06:52
who have houses and property that go on
06:55
the other side of these
06:56
rivers and bits of land generally so to
06:58
build the wall he's actually going to be
06:59
sealing out
07:00
a lot of americans and they're going to
07:02
be stuck in mexico
07:03
unless they sell their land so he's
07:05
trying to buy the land back
07:07
from them for the government he knows
07:09
there's going to be problems
07:10
so he's planning to effectively go into
07:13
legal war
07:13
with a lot of americans so in 2006 they
07:16
started building a load of walls um
07:18
at various points and there were 442
07:21
lawsuits that were reviewed by cnn from
07:23
the time
07:24
and 93 of them are still open wow
07:28
and that was for a much shorter wall was
07:30
that because also in 2006 i think george
07:32
bush
07:33
approved a virtual wall i think we've
07:34
talked about the idea of virtual worlds
07:36
before but um he worked on that uh it
07:38
was the project was shelved in 2011 and
07:40
it that
07:41
air cost a billion dollars sorry is that
07:43
a billion real does it or billion
07:44
virtual dollars
07:46
sadly i think it's real dollars yeah um
07:49
but the thing about the virtual wall was
07:50
that it uh
07:51
worked by a system of sensors that were
07:53
supposed to be able to tell when
07:54
migrants were crossing the border
07:56
but apparently it was really ineffective
07:57
in windy conditions it mistook trees and
08:00
plants for people
08:01
it was constantly thinking that animals
08:03
crossing the border represented
08:05
suspicious activity
08:06
right yeah one person is proposed
08:08
leaving a four inch gap at the bottom of
08:10
the wall
08:10
so that little animals can cross
08:14
the one problem is that there are 111
08:16
species which
08:17
cross the area currently proposed for
08:19
the wall right and so lots of them will
08:21
you know struggle to mate and breed and
08:24
live a full
08:25
fulfilling life i wonder if all the
08:26
animals will then evolve to be four
08:28
inches tall
08:30
like tiny buffaloes going over the range
08:34
i've got an idea what about this you you
08:36
kind of make a
08:38
a very slight incline from about two
08:41
miles out
08:42
and it just gets more and more inclined
08:44
inclined inclined inclined and then on
08:46
the mexican side it's a
08:47
sheer drop you know i mean like a cliff
08:50
so from the american side it just looks
08:52
like a normal bit of land okay this is
08:54
like a haha in an english country garden
08:56
exactly like that yeah well that's a bit
08:58
like the apparent border between north
09:00
and south korea right
09:02
which i didn't know about north korea
09:04
claims there's a wall
09:05
dividing it from south korea and that
09:07
the u.s and south korea
09:09
built this wall a few decades ago during
09:11
the cold war
09:12
and they say on their side it's got like
09:14
a little crenellations where guns are
09:16
and it's got checkpoints along it and it
09:18
says big wall and then it says on the
09:19
other side on the south korea side
09:21
is just covered in turf and grass and so
09:24
nobody knows that it's there from the
09:25
other side
09:26
and the u.s and south korea totally deny
09:28
that they ever built this wall
09:31
there's evidence someone did a
09:32
documentary i think where they claim to
09:34
be showing pictures so we've got no idea
09:36
if north korea is divided from south
09:37
korea by a wall i saw a photo of because
09:40
there are doors on the border where
09:42
um the north koreans and south koreans
09:44
have police and
09:45
they open up to either let people in and
09:47
when they open up the door
09:48
if it's too if it's a police officer
09:50
opening the door on the south korean
09:52
side
09:52
the rule is is that another south korean
09:54
officer has to be holding on to them
09:56
because they might be pulled through by
09:58
the north koreans it's
09:59
there's photos you can see online where
10:01
they're like holding like by the arm
10:03
another south korean police officer
10:04
opening a door yeah it's amazing
10:06
that's so funny do you know the first
10:08
ever demarcation before
10:10
between um america and mexico when they
10:13
first decided to do it
10:14
they just drew a line really
10:22
you know like in old sitcoms where you
10:24
would draw a line around half of the
10:26
house and yeah they're allowed only on
10:27
your side and the other side
10:29
with a marker pen i don't know what it
10:31
was with i guess it was just a light
10:33
hair
10:33
probably sandy yeah well that's true
10:37
uh and then paint sand you can't paint
10:40
sand
10:41
you can move the line which is quite
10:44
handy
10:46
our country looks a bit smaller today
10:49
and then they just started making fences
10:51
and the reason they made fences because
10:52
they didn't want mexican animals to go
10:54
into american territory because they had
10:56
like diseases and stuff like that
10:57
really yeah so it wasn't for people and
11:00
when they made it for people even
11:01
it wasn't stopped mexicans from coming
11:03
in it was to stop chinese immigrants
11:05
from coming in
11:06
really yeah so was that like start of
11:08
the 20th century or something uh it was
11:10
during the depression i think so yeah
11:13
yeah okay so
11:14
last week uh congress approved spending
11:17
for replacing existing fencing
11:20
different to building a new wall there's
11:22
there's a strong argument that this is
11:23
never going to happen
11:24
um so they approve spending to replace
11:27
existing fencing along 20 miles which is
11:29
one percent of the border
11:31
uh and to add gates to existing barriers
11:33
apparently so it'll be
11:34
i think slightly more porous the border
11:36
than before because it'll have
11:37
yeah gates um but anyway sean spicer got
11:40
into a massive row with the press
11:41
because he was saying look at this great
11:42
wall
11:43
and everyone said hang on that stuff was
11:44
a fence when you described it in january
11:46
like literally exactly the same
11:48
structure you were calling it a fence
11:50
and he said no it's a wall it's
11:52
definitely a wall it got really touchy
11:53
about it
11:54
that's clever though it probably cost a
11:56
lot less to just have a chat with the
11:57
oed and bribe them to change the
11:59
definition of the word wall
12:00
to a line of paint in the sand
12:04
but if you just do like they did with
12:06
the north and south korea thing and just
12:08
say
12:08
there's a wall there when there isn't a
12:10
wall there
12:11
i don't think that's beyond trump's um
12:14
you're right he can do it it'll be
12:15
unbelievably cheap to do
12:17
yeah yeah all he has to do is say hey
12:19
guys we did it we made a wall
12:21
and everyone goes there's no wall here
12:22
he's like yeah there is yeah
12:24
what are you what about you're a wall
12:28
there was a design that someone came up
12:29
with in 2009 so well before trump was
12:32
even thinking about being a candidate
12:34
um which was a barrier which is lined
12:36
with burrito carts so it's a proper wall
12:38
and barrier
12:39
yeah but along the ground like those you
12:41
know those um
12:42
desks you have to meet people in prisons
12:44
to visit them so you can have a bit of a
12:46
conversation with them yeah yeah so
12:48
there's a barrier there which is
12:49
permeable you can see through it and you
12:51
can pass things through it
12:52
burritos and it's you can pass burritos
12:54
through uh
12:55
who's passing to who um i imagine you're
12:57
selling burritos probably the burrito
12:59
seller to the burrito buyer
13:01
yeah okay yeah they can go both ways
13:03
yeah because money could go the other
13:05
direction exactly and or if you wanted
13:07
to sell hot dogs in the other direction
13:09
you could do that yeah okay so it was a
13:11
an american professor called ronald real
13:13
and he said the burrito wall
13:14
accommodates for a food cart to be
13:15
inserted into the wall
13:17
uh seating is built into the wall and
13:19
food conversation or a bi-national game
13:22
of ftse can occur across the border
13:25
wait a minute so you can play footsie so
13:27
there must be maybe that's that
13:28
four-inch gap
13:31
but you know there is like there is an
13:32
existing wall in various parts of course
13:34
and over there they sometimes play
13:36
volleyball no or they have
13:38
historically they have yeah and they'll
13:40
sometimes have poetry competitions like
13:42
rap battles
13:43
wow but volleyball you wouldn't be able
13:45
to see which way the ball was going
13:47
until it was on your side of the world
13:48
that's why the administration that's why
13:49
the americans want a one-way mirror
13:53
to win at volleyball no
13:56
really it hasn't touched the ground over
14:00
here
14:05
okay it is time to move on to fact
14:07
number two
14:08
and that is james okay
14:11
um i think we might have some north
14:14
korean stuff
14:15
in this book oh yeah in this book of
14:16
2017 uh
14:18
very much in the news and so here's my
14:20
north korea fact
14:21
north korea's national airline air corio
14:25
owns 10 times more taxis than it owns
14:28
airplanes
14:29
taxis yeah they only have 15
14:32
airplanes and i found that they've
14:36
recently branched out into taxis
14:38
and i found that they have about 150
14:40
taxis and what's
14:42
what we think might have happened is
14:43
there's a load of sanctions obviously
14:45
against north korea so they're not
14:46
allowed to fly to as many places as they
14:48
used to be
14:49
so they need to find other ways to make
14:50
money and one of the ways they're doing
14:52
it is branching out into things like
14:53
soda and cigarettes and in this case
14:57
taxis and this is this is quite a famous
14:59
airline isn't it because they're they're
15:00
famously rated one star
15:03
they're the only one star airline in the
15:05
world
15:06
yeah but not for danger for yeah quality
15:09
of service
15:10
which is important to emphasize i think
15:12
there's only been one
15:13
fatal accident on air korea and that was
15:15
1983. that was a car crash
15:20
that was at a time when the airline was
15:22
called cac
15:23
so c double ak i suspect that's how you
15:27
pronounce it
15:27
um but yeah it's perfectly safe it's
15:29
just the service is very bad um
15:31
do they ever drag people off planes
15:34
who've got a perfectly legal ticket
15:38
um but the uh the in-flight
15:40
entertainment sounds like fun
15:42
oh yeah you get um uh
15:45
patriotic songs sung by the band
15:48
moranbong
15:50
and uh i looked into moranbong a bit
15:52
more and he actually put them
15:54
together kim jong-un simon cowell of
15:56
north korea
15:57
yes wow um no he put them together and
16:00
um they are 20 members and they're all
16:03
young women
16:04
and they're all quite senior military
16:05
ranks as well so sometimes they perform
16:07
in uniform and sometimes they perform in
16:09
uh mini skirts and high heels
16:10
multi-talented yeah
16:12
you don't want to get the wrong costume
16:14
when you're going to war do you
16:15
[Laughter]
16:19
although there was that military march
16:20
in north korea a couple of years ago
16:22
which showed the female soldiers
16:23
marching and they were all wearing
16:24
really high heels do you remember
16:26
oh yeah yeah extraordinary yeah yeah
16:28
you've got to
16:29
appreciate because it's quite hard to
16:31
walk in high heels isn't it
16:32
yeah if you can march in them then that
16:34
they're good soldiers i think that's
16:36
yeah it's quite a good policy you're
16:37
right because if you can do well
16:39
in high heels then you're definitely
16:40
going to do okay in your trench boots
16:42
but they um they've got songs sorry to
16:44
be obsessed with murambong
16:46
but the tracks they sing
16:49
include let's support our supreme
16:51
commander with arms
16:52
uh we think of we think of the martial
16:54
day and night
16:56
the martial as kim jong-un uh they also
16:58
play the theme from rocky
16:59
and my way but with the original lyrics
17:03
or
17:04
i don't know hmm so sorry i
17:07
feel like i went on an extender about
17:09
there
17:10
so is it is it a solid 20 people or are
17:13
they
17:13
sort of on a rotational no that's solid
17:16
and then they disappeared for a while
17:17
and then they came back with no
17:18
explanation like take that
17:22
um so a lot of the news with north korea
17:24
has been the missile
17:25
tests uh and the most advanced missile
17:28
is the
17:29
musudan it's that's the music not the
17:31
musu comet dan
17:35
and they've done eight attempts and it's
17:37
failed six
17:38
times okay so that's a 75
17:42
failure which is a worse failure
17:44
percentage than sunderland have had
17:46
this year sunderland have failed to win
17:49
67
17:50
of their premier league matches in the
17:51
bottom of the league wow and i believe
17:53
donald trump has actually dispatched a
17:55
fleet
17:56
to sunderland and start doing well
18:00
should we be concerned i i don't think
18:02
that's gonna happen okay
18:04
um so the weapon that the us would use
18:07
if they were gonna launch a strike on
18:08
north korea's nuclear facilities
18:10
uh is this thing called a mop which is a
18:13
stands for
18:14
massive ordnance penetrator um it is a
18:18
30 000 pound bomb and it can smash
18:20
through
18:21
200 feet of earth or 60 feet of concrete
18:24
before it explodes
18:25
god what 60
18:32
it's what i mean is it just big and it's
18:34
heavy or does it got a drill on the
18:36
front
18:36
it's a bit like do you know when you're
18:38
drilling underground and you get a
18:39
pocket of air and it fires
18:41
[Laughter]
18:45
listeners of a previous episode will
18:46
notice a similar sounding bit of
18:48
[ __ ] from
18:49
anna it's using that same technology
18:52
though
18:53
but in reverse what it is done actually
18:56
it's got a little chisel on the front of
18:58
it
19:00
i just want to say i've had multiple
19:01
people write in and confirm that story
19:03
was true about the guy being sucked
19:04
through the earth
19:05
and this one
19:08
this one's blown through the earth not
19:10
sucks but it's the same general
19:12
event does it have an explosive as it
19:14
hits the earth which is a sort of
19:16
first explosive and then as soon as it's
19:18
lower then it has a
19:19
i don't actually know how the technology
19:20
worked that's a really good idea there's
19:22
a mini explosion
19:23
yeah i thought it was more like a a
19:25
drill like it dives down so hard into
19:27
the earth it just penetrates
19:28
sixty sixty feet of coffee concrete
19:32
two hundred feet of earth yeah um so
19:35
yeah
19:35
that's something that's a hill it could
19:37
get through a hill
19:38
yeah that's mad remember that i said
19:42
that if you
19:43
cornered a badger on the street that it
19:44
could um
19:48
i don't remember this so hang on you're
19:50
in a street and you've cornered a badger
19:53
yeah street corner uh yeah it's i guess
19:56
it's a street corner you're in a
19:57
cul-de-sac in a colder circuit
19:59
a badger doesn't know where to go it's a
20:00
concrete street um the claws of a badger
20:03
are so
20:03
sharp uh that it can grind its way
20:06
through the
20:07
concrete floor so you're supposed to get
20:09
a batter on the end of this
20:10
bomb and then it drills down or just
20:13
badger claws
20:14
so it just slices through the uh the
20:16
ground
20:17
there are also plants that can go
20:19
through concrete aren't there
20:21
like you can get weeds and you can get
20:23
fungi and stuff that can actually
20:24
grow through concrete so if you weren't
20:26
bothered about how long
20:27
it took a plant on the end of your bum
20:32
and then when it comes it would have to
20:35
be a negative geotropic
20:37
plant because it's digging downwards oh
20:39
yeah yeah with roofs that are more than
20:41
60 feet long
20:44
um this year this year um a guy called
20:48
kwang
20:48
song han became the first north korean
20:51
to ever score in serie
20:53
a in italy which is the top league in
20:55
italy so
20:56
he scored against the goalkeeper who he
20:59
beat
21:00
was joe hart the england number one
21:03
goalkeeper
21:04
oh yeah not the one who was fired for
21:06
eating a pie
21:08
he's not he's not england's goalkeeper
21:10
now he's
21:12
sutton united's goalkeeper i'm confusing
21:14
southern united in england
21:16
there's a fact that i hope makes it into
21:18
the book uh which james found about
21:21
that goalkeeper who got fired for eating
21:22
the pie do you remember it
21:24
um he got a new job didn't he but i
21:26
don't know what it was his first job
21:28
after it was that he was um a food
21:30
taster for
21:31
tex-mex hex mex restaurants yeah post
21:35
being goalie for sutton
21:36
anyway so it's quite good that england's
21:38
goalkeeper is the first um
21:40
goalkeeper ever to let in a goal from a
21:42
north korean in syria
21:44
maybe they might spare us when they
21:46
sweep the power
21:48
in gratitude for that they were also
21:50
actually speaking of north korean sport
21:52
on the nuclear testing site their main
21:55
nuclear testing site which is just
21:56
outside pyongyang
21:58
i think a us satellite the week before
22:01
last spotted a volleyball game being
22:02
played
22:03
so that's nice that these guys are
22:04
having fun in their off time yeah right
22:06
on the site are you sure that wasn't by
22:07
the border wall that you were talking
22:08
about
22:09
between south and north there is no wall
22:11
there oh there is no
22:12
well i think if volleyball's going on
22:14
there is a [ __ ] wall
22:16
it's a wall on one side and then a two
22:18
mile gradual decrease
22:22
so you hit the ball over the wall and
22:24
then it just keeps rolling and rolling
22:26
and you have to walk two miles to
22:28
collect it yeah i got a couple of things
22:30
about just general
22:32
uh airline news from around the world
22:35
um singapore airlines are um flying now
22:39
not using
22:40
uh your classic air fuel um but cooking
22:42
oil
22:43
they're flying using cooking oil yeah
22:46
they are
22:47
so this is a thing that they are trying
22:49
to reduce aviation emissions
22:51
and they've launched this thing it's
22:52
called the green package
22:54
and it's powered in part by sustainable
22:57
biofuel which is used from cooking oil
22:59
so if you're ever flying singapore
23:01
airlines there might be a moment
23:02
which i never will be
23:06
sorry to be a fossil fuel stick in the
23:08
mud uh
23:09
but i would do it
23:12
is it extra virgin or are we talking
23:15
sunflower oil oh i don't know
23:17
no not sure because you only want the
23:18
high quality stuff i think it's true
23:20
yeah do you remember there was that bus
23:21
in was it bristol that was
23:23
poo powered yes it was going to be
23:25
running on
23:26
um would you rather travel on a poo
23:28
power plane or a extra virgin olive oil
23:30
powered plane
23:31
um oh wow yeah given the choice
23:35
as long as they both work it doesn't
23:37
really affect your
23:39
flight does it it might do do you know
23:41
the fumes if the fumes could seep up
23:42
through the carpet
23:43
you certainly rather the oil but yeah i
23:45
i rarely go on airplanes to think oh i
23:47
can just smell kerosene the whole way
23:50
no but you do get the smell of it on the
23:52
runway don't you when you're crossing
23:53
from the terminal building sometimes to
23:55
go into the plane you can smell a bit of
23:56
fuel there oh yeah
23:58
so if it's stank of poo i probably would
24:00
go with the cooking order
24:01
yeah delicious cooking oil yeah cool um
24:04
i got another one which is i'd love to
24:06
get this in the book it's my favorite
24:07
character that i discovered in the last
24:08
year or so
24:09
it's the iraqi transport minister um so
24:12
plain airplane news from him
24:14
that happened in the last month is that
24:16
while flying in a plane
24:18
as a passenger with 200 other passengers
24:20
on board
24:21
he went to the cockpit and said i would
24:24
like to land the plane
24:25
and they said okay i guess we have to
24:27
let you you're the iraqi transport
24:29
minister he's quite powerful guy
24:31
um and he could just do that was it an
24:33
iraqi plane
24:34
uh yeah yeah yeah yeah no it wasn't he
24:36
wasn't like on british airways covered
24:38
in
24:38
imagine if john prescott during the new
24:41
labour government that tried to land the
24:42
plane
24:43
i've done a poo and i'd like it to power
24:45
this plane
24:50
so apparently they let him take control
24:52
of the planes to land the plane
24:54
and uh they said it was almost fatal
24:57
uh but unfortunately the captain managed
25:00
to get
25:00
back into the controls in time in order
25:02
to stop them why did he let him i'm
25:04
sorry this whole
25:05
is the transport minister he's an
25:06
important guy you don't maybe yes yeah i
25:08
don't know maybe he's a massive deal so
25:10
okay this is a quote from the pilot when
25:14
you're on a plane you don't go
25:15
right who's the most important person
25:17
here
25:19
well you know i'm actually the mayor of
25:22
swindon
25:26
okay
25:28
this is a quote from the pilot post the
25:30
event the minister did not do a good job
25:33
he slammed the front of the plane into
25:35
the ground
25:36
all the iraqi planes in future will have
25:38
to have a fake cockpit basically
25:45
[Applause]
25:49
okay there's time to move on to fact
25:51
number three and that
25:53
is my fact which i am pitching to get
25:56
into the book
25:57
and that fact is that all nasa
25:59
astronauts
26:00
are wearing hand-me-downs now
26:03
uh when a bigger astronaut when they
26:06
grow up enough to fit into the suit yeah
26:09
exactly no this is this is a new story
26:11
that's just come out and that's a fact
26:12
that
26:12
uh sort of emerged from it it's that
26:14
nasa has suddenly realized
26:16
that of all the functioning spacesuits
26:18
that they have for their astronauts to
26:20
do their
26:20
uh when they go outside of the
26:22
international space station
26:24
they're running out because they only
26:26
made a batch of them
26:27
and they haven't made any more so
26:30
they're really running low on them
26:32
and every time a new astronaut goes up
26:33
they're basically using a hand-me-down
26:35
they're using a previously used
26:37
astronaut suit spacesuit and um
26:40
yeah so they're they're uh they've got i
26:42
think 17 more missions and
26:44
let's say the backpack alone that's part
26:46
of the suit they've only got 11 of those
26:48
that are left that are functional and
26:50
they don't think they're going to
26:51
survive in order to finish
26:53
all of the missions and so they've got
26:54
more missions and they have suits
26:56
basically at this point i think if you
26:58
don't have the suit don't go on the
26:59
mission i mean
27:02
well we booked it in now it'd be a shame
27:05
to cancel
27:06
last year nasa had a what they called a
27:08
very tweedy a poop challenge which was
27:10
asking for designs to
27:12
go to the toilet in your spacesuit but
27:16
it had to be a hands-free in-suit toilet
27:19
device
27:20
right which could work for up to six
27:22
days
27:23
the main winner and i don't have the
27:25
full details but it was a small
27:27
crotch-based airlock
27:32
okay to poo through well
27:35
i don't think that's the answer but
27:38
you could apparently stick things in
27:40
through it which i do not understand
27:42
either i see what okay i see what it is
27:46
so it sort of hangs off your bum and
27:47
then presumably you press a button and
27:48
it opens it and you pull into it and
27:49
then you press a button no
27:50
it's on the crotch it's on the crotch
27:52
it's not it's a bit like a burrito wagon
27:54
[Music]
27:55
what happens is the poo goes in one side
27:58
like a burrito
27:59
and then closes up and then someone
28:01
opens the other side and then
28:02
takes the burrito out
28:06
not eating at your mexican restaurant
28:09
well the southern united gold keeper
28:11
said it was very nice
28:15
anyway yeah i'm sorry i don't fully
28:16
understand the designs of the winner but
28:18
there were three winners one was that
28:20
one the second place was
28:22
it's just words here an air push urinary
28:24
girdle i don't know
28:26
the third place was kind of an external
28:27
catheter thing okay
28:29
actually on airlocks non-feces based
28:33
the new spacesuit that they're designing
28:36
now and that they're hoping to get out
28:37
before they have to cancel all these
28:38
missions it's gonna cost 4.4 million
28:40
dollars and one of the
28:41
uh most important innovations on it is
28:43
that
28:44
it has got what's called a suit plate
28:46
interface port
28:48
which basically means that you don't
28:50
have to go through an airlock anymore to
28:51
leave the spaceship because you just
28:52
dock into your suit
28:54
so the suit is like docked to the
28:55
outside of the spaceship and then you
28:57
just walk into your scene
28:59
and then uh you don't have to like go
29:01
through because you usually have to go
29:02
through an airlock door
29:03
yeah or go through an air lock and then
29:04
go into the space station
29:06
that doesn't sound like a good idea
29:09
that's that's like why don't you change
29:10
into your uh
29:12
scuba gear underwater so if something
29:14
goes wrong if anything goes wrong in
29:16
space
29:16
and you're exposed to the vacuum of
29:18
space you're dead in seconds
29:20
you'd have a couple of minutes yeah come
29:22
on dan what
29:23
chill out a couple of minutes to put
29:26
about 45 minutes to put those suits on
29:28
is the space suit part of the outside of
29:31
the ship though
29:32
no so i don't think it's like you put it
29:34
on and then there's just a big hole in
29:35
the ship as you leave
29:40
but does a barrier close behind the suit
29:43
i'm not sure so this is what the woman
29:44
said who designed them she said it
29:46
allows astronauts to enter and exit the
29:47
outfit
29:48
by docking with the vehicle um so
29:51
i'm not sure exactly how it would work
29:53
but i'm sure they've worked out a way of
29:54
sealing the vehicle behind them
29:56
i think that's pretty cool you would
29:57
hope that's not cool yeah i was reading
30:00
a thing about um
30:01
so uh in the news of the last few weeks
30:04
peggy whitson
30:05
who is um the commander of the
30:06
international space station she broke
30:08
the record for the longest
30:09
time an american has been in space she
30:11
already holds a number of other records
30:13
um
30:14
for being in space and she's commanding
30:16
it for the second time as well
30:18
and um amazing person and they did a
30:21
broadcast between the international
30:23
space station and
30:24
the white house the oval office so trump
30:26
and ivanka and another astronaut
30:28
why was the funk of that she's
30:29
everywhere
30:31
she's pretty important she was going to
30:33
fly the thing
30:36
uh yeah um he uh so there was a chat
30:39
that was going on between them
30:40
and uh you could see both at the same
30:42
time and
30:44
there was this moment which they're a
30:45
bit confused about and they're not sure
30:47
if trump was joking
30:48
they were talking about he said when are
30:49
we going to get to mars and peggy said
30:51
well you know we're we're doing
30:53
all these amazing bits of research up
30:55
here and down on earth and we think by
30:57
2030s we could start getting to and he
31:00
said
31:01
no i think we need to do it in my first
31:03
term it'd be disappointing if it's in my
31:04
second term
31:05
but that's still okay and so she was
31:08
like
31:09
um and but then people at nasa are like
31:11
did did was that like a jfk moment did
31:13
he did he mean that
31:14
we have to do we have to get to mars in
31:16
three years
31:18
so yeah i don't know but but we've got
31:21
nothing to wear
31:24
it was a weird broadcast because at
31:25
points i watched most of it trump
31:27
just suddenly gets bored it just looks
31:30
quite bored talking to astronauts in
31:32
space
31:32
and he also looks like he's thinking i
31:34
wonder what studio in hollywood they're
31:36
filming this in
31:37
like i imagine he's a moon landing
31:39
denier and he just thinks
31:41
yeah you're not there right i know i
31:42
know about you guys they actually
31:44
discussed the urine thing didn't they
31:46
he asked about how are you wait which
31:47
with the trump urine thing or the
31:48
astronaut
31:51
um he actually might have lied in his
31:54
answer given that because they they
31:55
discussed the astronaut urine thing they
31:57
avoided the trump urine thing actually
31:59
um and about the recycling the urine so
32:01
they drink recycled urine
32:02
um when they're up in space and she said
32:05
to him it's really not as bad as it
32:06
sounds and he said well that's good glad
32:08
to hear it better you than me
32:10
so one of the problems is that um with
32:13
these suits the ones that are breaking
32:14
so uh one of the ones that broke not too
32:16
long ago uh
32:18
it started letting the water supply in
32:20
and the astronaut
32:21
potentially could have drowned inside
32:22
his own suit they had to get him
32:24
immediately back into the international
32:25
space station take all the stuff off
32:27
so that's one of the big problems is as
32:28
soon as something goes wrong inside the
32:30
suit
32:31
um taking this astronaut out of the suit
32:34
in time to save them it does take a
32:36
super long time
32:37
i'm really surprised it takes so long to
32:39
make them you would think like okay we
32:42
we need one before 2024.
32:45
it can't be beyond the realm of man to
32:47
be able to do that that's true
32:49
if you have a million quid you would
32:51
think you'd be able to do it i don't
32:52
know
32:53
from kennedy announcing we're going to
32:55
go to the moon to getting to the moon
32:56
was about nine years
32:57
we're now saying that it'll take us
32:58
roughly that long to make a suit well
33:00
we're going to mars in three years so is
33:02
it true
33:03
no one's gonna have any suits on
33:05
[Laughter]
33:07
mars mission ends an immediate disaster
33:11
no one could have foreseen as they
33:14
stepped out
33:14
[Laughter]
33:22
okay it is time for a final fact of the
33:24
show and that
33:25
is josinski yes my fact that i would
33:28
like to get into the news book is that
33:30
as of last week whenever state media in
33:33
tajikistan
33:34
mentions the president they now legally
33:36
have to refer to him by his full title
33:39
which is the founder of peace and
33:41
national unity
33:42
leader of the nation president of the
33:44
republic of tajikistan
33:45
his excellency emma mali rahman
33:48
and they have to do that every time they
33:50
mention him can they cough after it and
33:52
say
33:53
wanker
33:57
so i think this might be the only news
33:59
book that comes out this year that has a
34:00
full section of tajikistan
34:02
[Laughter]
34:04
so get it for that apparently it takes
34:07
15 seconds for it to scroll along the
34:09
screen on the news which is
34:11
like if you're trying to show a news
34:12
bulletin the president's announced
34:14
15 seconds is a long time to have one
34:16
name scrolling for
34:17
but apparently you're allowed to say
34:19
leader of the nation uh
34:20
like if it's really a short bulletin or
34:22
something you're allowed to okay
34:23
that's nice that's nicely informal isn't
34:25
it please just call me leader of the
34:26
nation
34:27
well they've speculated i think this is
34:29
this is something the bbc picked up
34:31
and it was reported by radio azad lick
34:34
and
34:34
it was the director of tajik state radio
34:37
who made the announcement
34:38
and he just said the mandatory use of
34:40
the full title is required by law
34:42
and didn't elaborate so i think unless i
34:44
think it's still we're still just
34:45
speculating going
34:46
i think you're probably okay if you say
34:48
lead of the nation sometimes we'll only
34:50
find out when someone tries it
34:51
yep um so uh emma mali ramon the
34:55
president
34:56
of uh tajikistan has been saying his
34:59
full name
34:59
sorry the founder of um
35:02
he is uh a very undemocratic guy
35:07
as in in may last year he uh made people
35:09
vote over whether he should be president
35:10
for life
35:11
he won remarkably that's not
35:13
undemocratic no you're right they're
35:15
voting
35:16
94.5 percent of the vote well they like
35:18
him yeah
35:19
they'd better uh because there's a lot
35:22
of human rights depression a lot of
35:23
torture and things like this
35:25
149th out of 180 on the
35:28
free press listing wow so
35:31
pretty low down yeah um and he's passed
35:34
a law which gives him immunity from all
35:35
criminal charges for life
35:37
which is exactly the sort of thing that
35:39
normal honest guys always tend to do
35:43
yeah yeah he does um so he's banned a
35:46
few things
35:47
generally that i've just got obviously
35:49
he's done that if he's making
35:50
um news outlets call him by that full
35:52
name um
35:53
one thing he's blocked is youtube uh
35:56
youtube not allowed
35:57
there anymore mainly because of a video
35:59
that went online
36:00
of him dancing drunkenly at a wedding
36:04
and singing karaoke really badly yeah so
36:07
he said okay this needs to be
36:08
banned so he's banned the whole website
36:11
youtube yes
36:12
come on we would we all would do that
36:16
if i had the power there'd be no
36:17
facebook no youtube
36:20
pretty much nothing no it's not all
36:22
banning things that he does we should
36:23
say he has taken a lot of positive steps
36:25
too
36:26
so police in tajikistan have been told
36:28
that they have to go to the theater
36:30
once a month but on different days so
36:33
there isn't one
36:34
incredibly large audience on one day i
36:35
don't know how to coordinate all going
36:37
on different days
36:38
if they all go on the same day there's
36:39
going to be no police around
36:41
that's true apart from in that one
36:43
theater imagine your bad luck if you go
36:45
to rob that theater
36:49
i could have literally robbed anywhere
36:51
else in the country
36:52
but it's meant to be to help their
36:54
spiritual and moral awareness and there
36:55
is a photo
36:56
going with the the news story of these
36:59
incredibly bored looking men in suits
37:01
yeah it is it's just because though the
37:03
interior minister who's called ramazan
37:05
rahim zoda uh just went to the theater
37:08
last month
37:09
and said oh my god this is really fun
37:11
and likes it
37:12
and so said i think everyone should do
37:14
it he just went and thought it was good
37:15
thought they should do it too
37:16
i quite like that imagine if everything
37:18
theresa may didn't enjoyed we all then
37:19
had to do
37:20
uh would that be good we're all going
37:22
[ __ ] sunset
37:23
come on guys um he
37:26
another thing that he has put in place
37:28
as a ban is that
37:30
uh so everywhere in tajikistan there are
37:32
pictures of him
37:33
giant billboard pictures of him and he's
37:35
ordered that in
37:36
all of the smaller towns and cities uh
37:40
any mayor or anyone who's in the
37:42
position of power there
37:43
has to take down the picture if they're
37:44
in it with him because he doesn't want
37:46
to be associated with giving them the
37:48
publicity of friendship
37:50
on yeah so he's he said and the way that
37:52
they did it was they called up all the
37:54
local officials
37:55
on the phone and uh they said hi are you
37:59
the local official yes i am
38:00
um i have a message here from uh the
38:03
president
38:04
and then they played a voice recording
38:06
of him down the phone line to them
38:08
where he says you are no longer allowed
38:09
to have my photo up if you're in the
38:10
photo
38:11
with me and so it's an audio message
38:13
they played down the phone to each
38:14
person that they called up
38:16
is embarrassing that's so weird it's a
38:18
bit like
38:19
when you split up with your ex but you
38:21
kind of like the photos so you kind of
38:23
get rid of them from the photo isn't it
38:25
like that
38:25
yes yeah yeah or when you call up their
38:27
best friend and you play a recording of
38:29
yourself
38:30
down the phone at them saying i want my
38:33
stereo back
38:35
i want the careless whisper cd
38:37
[Laughter]
38:40
wow well it's and it's like that do you
38:42
remember during the coup
38:43
in turkey president erdogan appeared on
38:46
tv but it wasn't him appearing on tv
38:48
it was someone holding up a phone on the
38:49
camera while they were mid-skyping him
38:52
yeah that's not actually one other thing
38:54
that we'll probably go in the book is uh
38:55
melanchol just speaking of people
38:57
appearing and appearing in weird
38:58
technological ways melancholy who was
39:00
voted out of the french election in the
39:02
first round
39:02
but was the very left-wing candidate it
39:04
was appearing by hologram so he was
39:06
appearing in
39:06
seven or eight states at once but it
39:09
wasn't even a hologram
39:10
i found out it was a what was it called
39:12
pepper's ghost it was called pepper's
39:15
ghost
39:15
which is a cooler name than hologram so
39:17
he's like um
39:19
he's like tupac yeah exactly two part
39:21
did the same thing and it basically
39:22
means you appear in a similar way but
39:24
it's two-dimensional whereas a hologram
39:25
is three-dimensional but it's basically
39:27
a hologram it's not a hologram
39:28
yeah but it's a it looks like one do you
39:30
understand what i'm saying when i say
39:31
it's basically that
39:32
yeah but you know you know what i'm
39:34
saying when i say monorail but it's a
39:35
hyperloop
39:42
i just know it's got very tense i'm just
39:44
saying maybe if he used the hologram he
39:45
might have got to the second round
39:46
melonshot
39:47
did campaign partly via computer game
39:51
what he was what what like he like
39:54
infiltrated
39:55
diddy kong racing like in minecraft no
39:58
his supporters he was quite tech savvy
40:00
it didn't um
40:01
uh as much good as it could have done
40:02
but he developed his supporters
40:04
developed a computer game called fiscal
40:06
combat
40:07
uh uh with the sort of k like in mortal
40:10
kombat
40:10
and you played melonshot in it and you
40:13
had to go around
40:14
uh finding businessmen and then shaking
40:16
them up and down
40:17
and as you shook them up and down their
40:18
pocket coins flew out of their pockets
40:21
and you were taking tax from the wealthy
40:22
doesn't sound fun to me
40:24
i've played it it is quite fun is it
40:26
yeah because it's exactly that too
40:28
uh 2d style it's pretty good i mean
40:30
james you're the only person left alive
40:32
still playing pokemon go
40:33
so i don't know if you're a good arbiter
40:35
of what is fun
40:38
well i'm gonna be trying to get some
40:39
pokemon go facts into this book
40:42
we were almost late just for the
40:44
listeners we were almost late to the
40:45
meeting for our book deal
40:47
uh because we thought james was in
40:49
charge of the
40:50
google maps leading us the way to the
40:52
building but in fact we were following a
40:53
man chasing down pokemon
40:55
well we got the book deal and i got on
40:57
onyx
41:00
um something about elections in
41:01
tajikistan actually which is quite
41:03
interesting
41:03
um you can run for opposition uh but
41:06
there was no real proper opposition in
41:07
the last election
41:09
uh the closest person who came to being
41:11
a proper opponent was someone called
41:12
inahol
41:13
bobazarova which is a cool name um but
41:16
so what you have to do to be eligible to
41:18
run
41:18
as a candidate for election in
41:20
tajikistan is
41:21
you need to get 210 000
41:24
signatures to be eligible to run so
41:27
let's just put this in context to remind
41:29
you how the british system works um
41:30
in the uk you need to get 10 signatures
41:33
to be a candidate for election yeah just
41:34
10 signatures from your consistency
41:36
in the u.s if you want to run for senate
41:38
you need between 1 and 2
41:40
000 i think in most places sorry between
41:43
1 000 and 2 000
41:44
between one and two
41:50
which only has a population of 8 million
41:52
you need to get 1 in 40 people in the
41:55
country
41:55
to sign saying that you should be a
41:58
candidate and she still managed to get
42:00
202 thousand
42:01
and she was eight thousand thousand
42:03
short oh my god that
42:05
i think i think i'd forge a few yeah i
42:07
mean like right
42:08
duplicate a few i think it might get you
42:10
in trouble with this guy
42:11
[Laughter]
42:12
but i'm just gonna check them all in
42:14
secondly i'm sure
42:16
isn't that such a slap in the face
42:18
though she's a super cool woman look her
42:20
up she won a
42:21
an award given by michelle obama last
42:23
year or the year before like most
42:24
influential good
42:25
people women in the world or something
42:26
oh really but yeah hard luck on her yeah
42:30
uh tajikistan has the cheapest pint of
42:33
beer
42:34
in the world that you can buy yeah
42:36
really
42:37
30p per pint that's pretty good yeah 30p
42:40
30p and i think the second cheapest is
42:43
36p
42:44
which is um made by bhutanese monks
42:48
so that's the the next cheapest one i
42:50
think so i drunk beer in bhutan
42:52
and i remember it being quite expensive
42:53
you got over charged you funded the
42:55
whole night
42:56
they saw you i'm pretty sure it was
43:00
expensive actually maybe only
43:01
six quid for a pint yeah sorry we have
43:04
to bring it in from tajikistan
43:08
another thing tajikistan has which is
43:10
kind of cool um
43:12
is the world's most dangerous tunnel
43:15
uh yeah that sounds great sounds awesome
43:19
sounds kind of cool i'd say i did say
43:22
kind of
43:23
um in what way and who decides that it's
43:25
the most dangerous
43:26
i think just the general public so it's
43:28
nicknamed death tunnel i think and the
43:29
reason it was built it was built in
43:31
i think it was started being built in
43:33
2007 um and the reason it was built was
43:35
because before that you couldn't drive
43:37
from north to south tajikistan without
43:39
having to cut through uzbekistan
43:41
and uzbekistan is not very friendly to
43:43
judy kazan a lot so actually actually
43:44
quite a dangerous trip
43:46
if you have to go visit your mum in the
43:47
north to go there so they built this
43:49
tunnel it's five kilometers long
43:51
um and it opened up a few years ago but
43:53
it had uh had no lighting so it's pitch
43:55
pitch dark in there um it's got uh
43:58
massive potholes
43:59
it has falling rocks all over the place
44:00
and you actually have to sign a form
44:02
before you go into the tunnel saying
44:04
that you understand the danger of
44:05
driving through this tunnel of being hit
44:07
by falling rocks or something
44:08
um it's got no ventilation at all oh i
44:11
think it's got maybe one fan right in
44:13
the middle
44:13
and so that means that it's filled with
44:15
exhaust fumes so visibility is only a
44:17
few feet
44:18
and this does mean that if you break
44:20
down for instance in the middle of it
44:21
you will get carbon monoxide poisoning
44:23
within
44:24
a very short amount of time so people
44:26
who are driving through this tunnel say
44:28
they get dizzy and nauseous as they do
44:30
it because it's so
44:31
blocked up with um carbon monoxide but
44:34
it is a great way to get from north to
44:36
south as you can start
44:40
how long is it sorry five kilometers
44:42
five o'clock that is quite a long way
44:44
it's a lot lighter it's a lot of oxygen
44:47
yeah i think they are improving it there
44:51
was a thing last year when they
44:52
got extra fun
44:56
yeah they're approving it you no longer
44:57
have to sign the form
45:05
okay that's it that is all of the
45:07
potential
45:08
facts that are gonna be making it into
45:11

01:34
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:37
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:39
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:41
covent garden
01:42
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:44
here with andrew hunter murray anna
01:46
chazinski and james harkin
01:48
and once again we have gathered around
01:49
the microphones with our four favorite
01:51
facts from the last seven days
01:53
and in no particular order here we go
01:56
starting with fact number one
01:57
and that's my fact my fact this week is
01:59
that the chinese government
02:01
are planning on giving their national
02:03
anthem a speed limit
02:06
so this is a plan at the moment
02:10
they haven't enforced it yet apparently
02:12
in the next month or so
02:13
um a paper will be proposed to enforce
02:16
this they believe that the anthem
02:18
is being abused by the people singing it
02:21
really yeah yeah
02:22
they've called it a damaging situation
02:24
um they're saying it's not universally
02:26
respected
02:26
and cherished people are laughing when
02:28
they're singing they're singing too fast
02:30
they're singing too so they're thinking
02:31
too furious yeah they're singing
02:35
so uh the song is called march of the
02:38
volunteers
02:38
right uh it's uh originally although
02:41
anyone not volunteering will be in
02:43
trouble
02:45
it originally appeared in a movie
02:46
soundtrack did it yeah it was part of a
02:49
movie uh
02:50
the movie was called you're now not
02:51
allowed to fast-forward that movie
02:53
anymore
02:56
yeah it was in a movie called children
02:58
of troubled times and it was actually
02:59
quite a political
03:00
movie um and the song was written
03:02
specifically for it and
03:04
uh what ended up happening was uh people
03:06
started singing it um and it caught on
03:08
more and more and people thought this
03:09
would make a good anthem so it became
03:11
the official anthem
03:12
um how are they gonna deal with the
03:13
laughter issue because you can still
03:14
laugh
03:15
at tempo you could have got any plan to
03:18
well yeah yeah there's going to be uh
03:21
you're going to get dressed down
03:22
basically you'll be criticized and
03:23
corrected or put in more casual clothes
03:26
yeah yeah so it's like muffy day
03:29
no it's different because dress down
03:30
friday isn't when you come in and just
03:32
get told off all day
03:35
it is when i do it but interestingly the
03:38
chinese government they banned
03:39
their own national anthem uh three years
03:42
ago from all sorts of places
03:44
so they said you're not allowed to sing
03:46
it outside
03:48
major sporting events or formal
03:50
diplomatic occasions so you're not
03:51
allowed to sing it
03:52
at your wedding if you want to or at a
03:54
funeral or anywhere which has apparently
03:56
an inappropriate atmosphere
03:57
right do mornings and funerals have
03:59
particularly similar atmospheres
04:02
[Laughter]
04:06
so germany banned their own some of
04:08
their own anthem didn't they
04:09
oh yeah did they mean like a bit of the
04:12
song yeah they banned the first couple
04:14
of verses because it was associated with
04:16
um the nazi regime and there was that
04:18
really embarrassing moment
04:19
uh i think it was last year a couple of
04:21
years ago it was a
04:22
u.s germany football match like a
04:25
friendly football match i think and
04:26
there was an opera singer there from
04:27
america called will
04:28
kimball who was singing as a mark of
04:30
respect to the germans the german
04:32
national anthem but he started
04:34
singing the lines that were associated
04:36
only with nazi germany
04:37
deutschland deutschland
04:41
which when you hear those words you do
04:42
think immediately of hitler that's the
04:44
version i've been singing this whole
04:45
time is that really not the version
04:46
anymore
04:47
yeah you're not meant to sing that it's
04:50
in german i didn't know i didn't
04:52
i don't know what i'm saying it's
04:53
because the only words you know really
04:54
are deutschland
04:56
yeah and uber means good right good yeah
04:59
so it sounds until you get to that level
05:01
it sounds like quite a good
05:02
lyrics what's that what's the word that
05:04
tips it over there's no word that's bad
05:05
it just means germany germany overall
05:07
it's just like the fact that hitler
05:08
itself is not a bad sound but the
05:10
association now with hitler the man
05:12
made it a name you probably hopefully
05:14
won't call your child
05:16
and in the same way the national anthem
05:17
was often sung by the nazis
05:19
so now it's got those bad associations
05:21
um speaking of people
05:22
who um made national anthem faux pas
05:26
is it faux pas or foes i think
05:30
have we ever mentioned about opera
05:32
singer tony henry uh who sang the
05:34
croatian national anthem
05:35
before england v croatia and instead of
05:38
singing
05:39
mila kuda si planina meaning my dear how
05:42
much we love your mountains
05:43
he sang mila kura see planina meaning my
05:46
dear my penis is a mountain
05:48
oh there was an aussie uh
05:51
formula one winner we spoke about him on
05:53
the show do you remember his name i
05:54
can't remember his name off the top of
05:55
my head australia
05:56
not the one who pushed his car yeah who
05:58
won it on foot oh yeah problem was it
06:00
yeah jack rabbit i think it's him when
06:01
he won the formula one
06:02
once um they realized they didn't have
06:04
the aussie national anthem
06:06
because they thought it was god save the
06:07
queen and so they were like what do we
06:09
do
06:09
and um all they could think to do was
06:11
find a drunken trumpet player who just
06:13
played happy birthday
06:17
that's amazing in luxembourg not in
06:21
luxembourg and the olympics in 1952
06:23
luxembourg weren't expected to win
06:24
anything
06:25
and they won the 1500 metres i think
06:28
and they got gold and the band who was
06:31
supposed to play all the anthems hadn't
06:32
been given the score and didn't know the
06:33
luxembourg national anthem because
06:34
they'd all assumed that luxembourg
06:35
wouldn't win anything
06:36
and there's you can see a bit of it on
06:37
youtube but they just improvised the
06:39
whole thing
06:40
they just completely make it up it's
06:42
like when an actor puts on his
06:44
his resume yeah i can speak hungarian
06:46
yeah definitely and then he gets to the
06:48
casting
06:49
i was looking into music in china
06:51
generally now
06:52
in terms of record sales where do you
06:55
think china sits
06:57
rank wise worldwide in terms of
07:00
interesting do you mean are we including
07:02
things like streaming and stuff like
07:04
that just basically spending money on no
07:05
spending money on music
07:06
i'm gonna say because they've got a
07:08
billion people they're at the top
07:10
or at least in the top five i would say
07:13
they're 12. they're 12 in the world um
07:16
and largely that's to do with piracy
07:18
that they've only just started to crack
07:20
down on
07:21
but they're only starting to boom now
07:23
because of this crackdown that's gone on
07:25
but if you look at their lists of
07:26
best-selling albums
07:28
it's still really back in the day where
07:29
so what do you mean it's like they
07:31
only they listen to stuff from the 80s
07:33
like um bon jovi well it's just
07:34
nothing's taken so it's mainly chinese
07:36
artists and
07:37
korean artists and taiwanese artists
07:39
that you wouldn't have heard of um
07:41
but number four best-selling album
07:43
physical album of all time in china
07:45
is titanic the soundtrack oh yeah so
07:48
we're talking 1998
07:50
or 1912 depending on when which
07:53
soundtrack you're talking about
07:56
live recording of people screaming just
07:58
the band going down
07:59
because they carried on playing today
08:00
but um wait a minute but our
08:02
best-selling single of all time
08:04
at least until recently was white
08:05
christmas so it's not like our
08:07
best-selling songs are all
08:08
new is it no no but it's because people
08:10
just weren't buying they were buying
08:11
pirated albums
08:12
i have a question yes when bon jovi
08:16
introduces himself yeah do you think he
08:18
says the name's
08:19
jovi bon jovi and then he pauses and
08:22
then he says
08:23
john bon jovi actually does it in three
08:26
steps i think he
08:27
is bon jovi is bon his middle name oh
08:30
this is what i'm trying to get at is it
08:32
his real name first of all don't know
08:34
no i don't think it is but if it is it
08:36
must be as middle cause it's not
08:37
hyphenated is it
08:38
so it's not a double barrelled but it
08:40
doesn't think it's mother bond it's not
08:42
the joby
08:42
lowercase bit lower case though no no
08:45
it's uppercase do you think that when
08:47
jacob rees-mogg
08:48
introduces himself he says the name's
08:50
mog
08:51
reese mark jacob reese mark yes i do
08:55
yeah all right well yeah in that case
08:57
maybe he does
08:58
because i imagine those two are the same
09:00
i like the names mog very much
09:03
the cat
09:07
did you know that in tang dynasty china
09:09
so just over a thousand
09:11
years ago i think that was then you were
09:13
supposed to greet and bid goodbye to
09:15
people by improvising verse on the spot
09:17
whenever you did it
09:19
if you're an educated person you had to
09:21
improvise a bit of poetry
09:22
how did you do the improv did you ask
09:24
for a word
09:27
just a non-geographical location like a
09:29
school or
09:30
at school
09:34
they've actually just banned some songs
09:35
haven't they oh i think sorry i think in
09:36
2015 they banned
09:38
some songs so the chinese ministry of
09:40
culture released a list of 120 songs
09:42
that are banned for being
09:44
immoral and just on that list uh there
09:47
was included a song called college
09:48
self-study room
09:50
which is about a guy having a difficult
09:52
time finding a quiet place to study for
09:54
university
09:55
banned for being immoral wow what does
09:57
he do instead of study
09:59
um i didn't actually understand the song
10:01
because i'm not fluent
10:03
um i'm just trying to think what
10:04
immorality that might be in this song
10:06
i see you think he gave up on trying to
10:08
find the study and ended up masturbating
10:10
instead or something
10:13
it's like he could read by mind
10:21
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:24
that
10:24
is james harkin okay my fact this week
10:27
is that in 1921
10:29
78 of shaving brushes sold in new york
10:33
contained anthrax and did it make it
10:35
froth better
10:36
or why were they putting that in there
10:38
it wasn't put in there on purpose
10:40
it is the fact that shaving brushes used
10:43
to be and sometimes still are made out
10:45
of badger
10:46
and they used to get high quality budget
10:49
fur from
10:50
russia and then they would disinfect it
10:53
in france
10:54
but then around the war time they
10:57
stopped
10:57
sanitizing it and badge hair is actually
10:59
okay because it's not that susceptible
11:01
that's susceptible to anthrax poisoning
11:03
but when russia fell apart a bit
11:06
we had to start importing horse hair
11:08
from china and japan
11:10
and horsehair is much more susceptible
11:12
to anthrax and so
11:13
suddenly that became an issue ah yes
11:15
you're right and
11:16
um what people thought at the time
11:17
during the war was it those diabolical
11:20
tactics of the enemy
11:21
they said it was down to but then they
11:23
realized that it wasn't anything to do
11:24
with that
11:25
occam's razor is the simplest thing
11:26
we're not cleaning our hair properly
11:28
occam's
11:29
razor love it because you're shaving
11:31
yeah
11:32
interestingly these brushes are still a
11:35
problem
11:36
yes because people love to buy antique
11:39
shaving brushes or anything to do with
11:41
um what people like to collect vintage
11:43
things and they like to use it hipsters
11:45
mainly and
11:46
uh they'll be using these brushes the
11:48
hipsters all have beards
11:50
because they're aware about the anthrax
11:52
situation
11:53
going on after they lost some key
11:55
hipster
11:56
members of their party to anthrax do you
11:59
know
12:00
just on shaving how they used to train
12:03
barbers well so
12:07
you can't take them to someone's face
12:08
immediately because they have a sharp
12:10
object
12:10
exactly so was it on an animal it wasn't
12:13
on an animal though that would have been
12:14
good
12:15
maybe there was some animal training i'm
12:16
sure there was was it on an arm
12:18
you do it on your arm that's a good idea
12:21
was it on bearded people
12:26
good thought you do an apprenticeship at
12:29
the morgue
12:29
[Laughter]
12:31
actually that would be quite good at the
12:32
morgue although if you made a mistake
12:33
you wouldn't know about it because they
12:34
don't bleed
12:35
you're right the [ __ ] that's why they
12:38
ended the policy i'm the best barber in
12:40
the world
12:43
um no okay what else could it be then
12:45
something with very thin skin
12:47
donald trump
12:54
[Laughter]
13:00
well they're delicate we've got we've
13:02
got a trainee barber in
13:05
would you mind whipping your balls out
13:07
for us then we will do the face i
13:09
promise
13:10
it's his first day but he's been great
13:12
in the theory modules
13:16
something with thin skin
13:26
[Laughter]
13:32
testicles
13:34
i had no idea balloons so balloons start
13:36
off hairy and all the ones you get
13:38
have been through the trainee
13:42
so do you put you must put hair onto the
13:44
balloon
13:59
it is a good idea though isn't it
14:00
because if you nick them they pop if you
14:02
nick them they pop i'm like the corpses
14:06
it could be a bloated corpse with a lot
14:08
of hair inside it
14:10
so no you you paint the face on and then
14:13
you
14:13
put the shaving foam on and then the
14:15
trainee has to scrape it off
14:16
right yeah oh my god that's really
14:18
interesting yes
14:20
how do they do it now i don't know well
14:22
there's so little call for it these days
14:24
oh well yes but you know there's a
14:28
hairdresser's nearby here that does
14:30
shaving themselves so i had a
14:31
i had my beard done but not not a clean
14:34
shave not with a razor but
14:36
um yeah they what they do is they have
14:37
someone standing over and and they train
14:39
someone to do it and you just have to
14:41
accept whatever happens
14:42
that's the that's they just say this
14:44
might not work and
14:45
how is your testicle these days
14:49
do you know how you shave in space i
14:52
think
14:52
it would be just as easy as out of as
14:55
not out of space
14:56
but not in space i think i know a bit of
14:59
the answer to this
15:00
but should i say it or yeah go for it is
15:02
it that you do normal shaving with a
15:04
buzzer
15:05
but you have a vacuum cleaner next to
15:07
your head
15:08
and you suck in all the hairs yeah so
15:10
you vacuum your face as you oh so you
15:12
don't feel the air with hair
15:13
exactly this is what they have to avoid
15:14
they have they have this special really
15:16
sticky
15:17
uh shaving foam it's called astro edge
15:20
right
15:20
and it sticks to the face but it traps
15:21
stubble in it and then
15:23
you have to well actually you can just
15:25
sort of like wipe that into a bag or
15:27
something
15:29
but when you have your hair cut in space
15:30
you have to have a vacuum cleaner next
15:31
to you
15:32
that's it when you have your snip snip
15:33
and then suck suck yeah
15:38
i don't know what kind of hairdressers
15:39
you go to
15:43
in shaving news in recent shaving news
15:45
oh yeah um
15:46
so since december there are cats in this
15:50
small town in virginia
15:51
that have been being taken away having
15:53
their bellies
15:54
shaved and then returned to their owners
15:56
otherwise unharmed
15:58
and no one knows who's doing this what's
16:00
happening police say they're not sure
16:01
what crime has been committed if it's
16:03
upsetting the owners so can the
16:04
perpetrator please stop
16:05
i suppose it's someone who can't get
16:07
hold of balloons
16:08
[Laughter]
16:16
okay it is time for fact number three
16:19
and that
16:19
is andy my fact is that the cargo hold
16:22
of the largest plane in service
16:24
is longer than the first flight of the
16:26
wright brothers
16:30
so how long is it it's pretty long anna
16:33
pretty long okay on we go
16:36
um i wonder if cause they didn't go very
16:39
high
16:39
the wright brothers either so i wonder
16:41
if they could have actually done the
16:42
whole flight in there i think they might
16:43
have been able to do it i mean
16:44
that's so the first flight was 120 feet
16:46
long yeah okay
16:48
yeah and how long is this cargo as i
16:50
said to anna
16:52
it's quite long let's talk about some
16:55
other statistics
16:58
the whole plane measures 275 feet
17:01
in length in length yeah okay so that's
17:05
about 100 meters
17:06
yeah it doesn't sound like 84 meters but
17:08
it's very
17:09
wide and how long did you say this the
17:11
ripe other thing was
17:12
120 feet okay so that figures doesn't it
17:15
yeah
17:15
god that doesn't sound that long cause i
17:18
thought that was the long
17:19
the biggest plane that's about to
17:21
overtake this one
17:22
is being built by paul allen who's the
17:24
co-founder of microsoft and that
17:25
is going to be uh apparently it's going
17:28
to be
17:28
wider than a football field oh no but
17:31
this one is this one is wider than a
17:32
football field
17:33
well that's unbelievably wide it's very
17:35
wide football field is between
17:37
is i think you're allowed between 50
17:39
meters and 100 meters for the width of a
17:41
football field
17:42
these planes are meters yeah you're
17:44
you're
17:45
like okay andy's plane that you're
17:48
talking about yeah
17:49
is 275 feet in length yeah and
17:52
its wingspan is 290 feet there we go
17:56
oh wow it's wider than it is long yes um
18:00
so i think i really i've just realized
18:02
that when i was
18:03
thinking about width i forgot to include
18:05
the wings yeah whichever i should never
18:06
design
18:07
right yeah yeah you've made a car
18:12
i was including wings well that's not
18:14
that impressive
18:15
okay as you were um and there is only
18:18
one of it
18:19
it's the amazing thing they've built one
18:21
they've been there is a second one which
18:23
they've been working on for 30 years
18:25
on and off mostly off um
18:28
anyway sorry it's called the antonov
18:30
an225 maria which is a ukrainian
18:33
plane yeah and um it can fit 10 tanks
18:36
inside or
18:37
50 cars depending on what you need to
18:39
move around so it's maximum takeoff
18:41
weight
18:42
uh is 640 tons yeah wow
18:45
i mean that is so i checked out a few
18:47
things that are about that weight
18:49
yeah christ the redeemer statue is about
18:52
that weight
18:53
and you could strap it on top it's like
18:55
with the arms over the wings
18:57
well it looks like an aeroplane doesn't
18:58
it does
19:00
it's quite wide if you include the arms
19:02
which either probably doesn't
19:06
wow that was 640 tons wow incredible so
19:10
actually if you had a plane carrying
19:12
that you wouldn't even be able to
19:13
get pilot in there because you'd already
19:15
be exceeding the weight limit
19:17
yes would have to be flying the plane
19:19
himself you'd have to chop off like a
19:20
finger or something or
19:29
but that's the that's the takeoff weight
19:32
includes the weight of the plane i think
19:34
doesn't it yeah
19:35
so um actually it would be too heavy to
19:37
carry
19:38
is that including the pedestal of the
19:39
christ the redeemer because it's mostly
19:40
the pedestal
19:41
i'm not sure actually awful if it's not
19:43
and you did include the pedestal i guess
19:44
you just wouldn't take off
19:46
yeah so here's something that you could
19:48
carry possibly
19:49
um the the volume of this cargo
19:53
hold is 46 000 cubic feet
19:56
and that is approximately the same
19:58
volume as the second largest tree in the
20:00
world
20:02
now the problem is the tree is tree
20:04
shaped so the cargo hold isn't tree
20:05
shape so you need to chop it up a lot
20:07
right
20:07
but you theoretically could chop it up
20:09
and get it in if you
20:11
put it nicely in like tetris turn it
20:13
into a turn it into a book
20:14
or a series of books and have it as a
20:16
library speaking of books do we have a
20:17
book coming out soon
20:19
made from the biggest tree in the world
20:22
i'm not sure i want
20:23
it if it's made from the biggest tree in
20:24
the world no yeah you do transported
20:26
here by the biggest plane in the world
20:30
sorry it wouldn't work because you add
20:32
water to make paper don't you
20:34
i was reading about the world's biggest
20:36
private jet
20:38
okay so the world's biggest private jet
20:40
um it's been bought
20:42
by prince al saud of saudi arabia
20:45
he's a saudi prince and he has
20:49
done some extraordinary things to it so
20:51
it's ginormous it can fly 800 passengers
20:53
uh it can go 8 000 miles before
20:55
refueling but obviously it's his own
20:57
private plane he doesn't want 800 people
20:59
on there so he's transformed
21:00
the plane into this incredible
21:02
mansion-esque
21:04
house it's got a cinema in there it's
21:05
got a steam room in there
21:07
it's got the most impressively of all
21:08
it's got a prayer room where all of the
21:10
mats are on the ground
21:11
are electronic and no matter where you
21:13
are in the sky
21:14
they electronically turn towards mecca
21:17
so when you go into prey it's
21:18
facing that is pretty clever but what if
21:20
you're hovering directly above mecca
21:22
it's very cool yeah they just kind of go
21:25
vertical do they
21:27
thought of that that's true um trump's
21:29
private plane
21:30
is pretty pimped out as well he did an
21:33
interview before he became president
21:35
where he was talking about it
21:36
and he said describing his own plane
21:39
it's bigger than air force one which is
21:40
a step down from this in every way
21:42
it's not bigger than air force one don't
21:44
know why he said that it's much smaller
21:45
than it is because he's a pathological
21:47
liar
21:50
but the president has her private fleet
21:52
of planes which are not
21:53
air force one right so we all hear about
21:57
air force one but actually
21:58
there's uh there's a set of planes
22:01
they're four special boeing 747s and
22:03
they are called together they are what
22:06
is known as the national airborne
22:08
operations center
22:09
right where ethos one is kind of
22:11
ceremonial and comfortable
22:12
uh these planes are basically war rooms
22:15
right and so they're built in the 70s
22:16
and they're staffed by you know military
22:18
analysts and strategists and it was if
22:19
you're in a nuclear war you would be
22:20
flying around in these things not an air
22:22
force one
22:23
why aren't they not to be comfortable
22:24
they
22:26
because you need to fit more soldiers in
22:27
um and they have
22:29
five mile long antenna which trail
22:31
behind them
22:32
right no they don't yes trailing
22:36
wire antenna oh yeah with a banner on it
22:39
one of those advertising banners
22:41
make america great again listen i'm
22:43
quoting there was a whole feature about
22:44
these on politico it said the planes
22:45
included special gear like a five mile
22:46
long training wire antenna that would
22:48
ensure that the president could remain
22:50
in contact with the nuclear submarine
22:51
fleet
22:52
even after ground-based communications
22:54
have been destroyed attached to a
22:56
submarine though no no i'm not suffering
22:58
at the other end
22:59
pirouetting through the air no but if
23:02
ground-based communications have been
23:03
destroyed you need a very long antenna
23:05
yeah
23:05
five miles is a long antenna it's very
23:07
long but what's behind you as long as
23:08
there's no one flying in the five miles
23:10
behind you and you're moving so fast
23:11
through the sky there won't be
23:13
no i just don't get why you're denying
23:14
this thing which i have a direct support
23:16
i just think five miles is a very long
23:18
antenna because it's extremely long
23:20
that's so that's going to collect radio
23:22
signals
23:23
that was disputing the length of the
23:24
antenna
23:26
how high are you up in the air when
23:27
you're in a normal flight because maybe
23:29
they attach a message to the end of the
23:30
antenna and they point it downwards
23:32
so you just grab a piece of paper as
23:34
they fly by oh i mean yeah
23:36
five you're actually all right five
23:37
miles is very long because
23:39
it's so long you're not are you normally
23:41
five miles up in the air if you're 30
23:43
000
23:43
feet what that is what 10 000 yards yeah
23:47
and how many 1760 yards
23:56
quick spell sos in the sand so do people
23:59
have to jump out of the way of it when
24:00
it comes along the ground towards look i
24:02
think we've entertained
24:09
[Laughter]
24:11
do we think maybe trump said it was five
24:13
miles
24:15
uh you know north korea has a plane that
24:17
can fly backwards
24:18
no it doesn't it does it's called a
24:21
hummingbird
24:23
it's a very tiny plane but this
24:26
is a it's really cool because it's
24:28
camouflaged as in
24:30
it's painted no one can see it no one's
24:33
ever seen
24:34
it guys there's a backwards plane
24:36
[Laughter]
24:39
this may look like a plane going
24:41
forwards but actually
24:42
it's a backwards plane going backwards
24:45
thank god the enemy are flying away
24:47
oh no
24:48
[Laughter]
24:50
the way you can tell is there's a five
24:52
mile antennae at the front
25:02
okay it is time for our final fact of
25:03
the show and that is
25:05
anna chazinski my fact this week is that
25:08
pooh on a table will look closer to you
25:10
than it actually is
25:13
and this is just if there's poo on a
25:15
table uh
25:16
and you think it's only a meter away uh
25:18
it's actually probably like
25:19
just over a meter away yeah and then we
25:22
all thought you were being really weird
25:23
downstairs when you put that on the
25:24
table but actually
25:26
some first-hand research just testing it
25:28
out uh yeah i read this on the website
25:30
nautilus which is very good website and
25:33
uh there was an article about
25:34
how we perceived distance and i think it
25:37
was a
25:37
study that was done by someone called
25:39
janine stefanucci
25:40
who's a professor of neural science in
25:43
utah at the university of utah
25:45
and yeah it said that she put kind of a
25:47
blob of chocolate on a table
25:48
and led her study subjects to believe
25:51
that it was
25:52
feces and then made it look like
25:56
feces and then they thought it was
25:57
closer than it actually was so
25:59
actually it's quite an ethical
26:00
experiment isn't it she's decided
26:02
not to put actual poo on the table she
26:04
has well then she's lied to people
26:06
is that ethical white lies are fine i
26:09
think
26:10
yeah yeah i see what you mean but yeah
26:12
this is about
26:13
how if we're afraid of things then we
26:16
perceive them as being closer and loads
26:18
of studies have been done that confirm
26:19
this
26:20
if you were to try and throw a bean bag
26:22
at a poo
26:24
then you would be likely to miss it on
26:26
the far side you throw it too far
26:28
whereas if you're gonna throw a beanbag
26:29
at something nice like a bar of
26:30
chocolate that didn't look like a poo
26:32
then you would miss on the short side
26:34
and they've done experiments where
26:36
people haven't done that no it's i'm
26:39
just i'm extrapolating slightly but
26:41
they've done
26:42
um they've done experiments where they
26:44
would give you a 25
26:45
gift card right and ask you to throw a
26:47
bean bag at it wow and they found that
26:49
people were always short of that
26:51
because it's desirable and they think
26:53
that it's close
26:54
i mean that is if anything that's a tele
26:56
format just waiting
26:58
to happen you're right throw the beanbag
27:00
at the pooh
27:01
no no well yeah we could do it that way
27:03
or we could do it just with like gift
27:04
cards and stuff because the thing is no
27:06
one really wants to win the poo so it's
27:08
possible what the prize is at the end of
27:09
the throw the beanbag at the pool
27:11
you don't have to you can win the 25 it
27:13
just it's
27:14
hidden in the poo it's basically we have
27:16
all these boxes from
27:17
um deal or no deal yeah they're probably
27:19
just in a warehouse somewhere
27:21
so we can get them and if we get the
27:22
million pound box and then get people to
27:24
try and throw bean bags into it they're
27:26
always going to be short
27:27
yeah so we never have to pay anything
27:29
out and it's a great format
27:30
although andy raises a really good point
27:32
if you put poo around
27:34
the voucher so and you know there's a
27:36
voucher in there but you can also see
27:38
that it's covered in poo
27:39
do you see it as closer or further away
27:42
i suppose that's where the jeopardy
27:43
comes in in our format
27:47
what's the show called again it's throw
27:48
the bean bag at the million pounds
27:50
covered in poo
27:51
yeah i think it's an itv2 show
27:53
[Laughter]
27:56
um spiders look bigger if you're scared
27:58
of them yeah
27:59
yes that's right and in direct
28:01
proportion to how scared you are
28:02
exactly and they tested it by getting
28:05
people who were very scared and then
28:06
only slightly scared of spiders and
28:08
they showed them a sliding scale so
28:10
literally at slightest code you could
28:11
drag
28:12
a little clicker along and there was a
28:14
picture of a fly at one end and a lamb
28:16
at the other
28:17
and you had to rape the spider but
28:19
surely
28:20
people who are really scared of spiders
28:22
i don't care how scared you are of a
28:24
spider
28:25
you don't think it's the same size as a
28:26
sheep
28:28
i think it was very slightly further
28:30
along right okay
28:33
i believe so uh in other science poo
28:36
news
28:37
okay um very exciting studies been
28:40
published james and i were talking about
28:41
this the other day
28:42
scientists have finally worked out how
28:44
long it takes animals to poo
28:46
oh yeah finally finally well we've
28:49
cracked so many secrets but this last
28:50
one has eluded us for so long well 2016
28:53
was the year that we cracked how long it
28:54
takes them to urinate and 2017 is a
28:57
fantastic
28:58
sequel what next year
29:01
horrible thing will we discover next
29:02
year but they studied a bunch of animals
29:04
right so this applies to
29:06
both let's say something as big as an
29:07
elephant all the way down to something
29:09
as small as a mouse
29:10
they both spend 12 seconds it's amazing
29:12
so from
29:13
the size of a spider to the size of a
29:15
spider
29:15
[Laughter]
29:18
yeah so uh this is um the researcher
29:21
patricia yang i guess this should
29:23
technically apply to humans as well
29:25
yeah uh because she's saying if it takes
29:27
longer than 12 seconds i'd say you
29:29
should go
29:29
see someone about it um but then she
29:32
says you have to factor in the fact that
29:33
you might be reading a book or newspaper
29:34
or playing a
29:35
an iphone game or do it on the table for
29:38
an experiment
29:40
they published their scientific paper in
29:42
a journal called soft
29:44
matter no yeah um
29:47
yeah so yeah it's it's quite an exciting
29:49
discovery
29:50
is it sorry is it the same as the urine
29:52
discovery as in
29:53
all animals it's the same for uh
29:56
regardless of science
29:56
that's the discovery all mammals yeah uh
29:59
and obviously there's quite a big
30:00
difference but i think david who
30:02
who did the urine one is part of this
30:04
group as well
30:05
yeah and the idea being that with humans
30:08
if you have a problem with the urinary
30:10
or or defecation or something then you
30:12
can kind of just talk to the doctor and
30:13
tell him
30:14
but with an animal it's sometimes hard
30:16
to tell if there's a problem
30:17
but if your animal if you've got a horse
30:20
and it's taking
30:21
40 seconds to wee or two seconds to weed
30:23
then that's so far out of the range that
30:25
you know there's something wrong
30:27
you know what i mean so it's just a way
30:28
of telling illness or so it's useful
30:30
science
30:31
yeah it's useful science yeah cool and
30:33
uh 12 seconds
30:35
just a interesting relevant amount of
30:37
time for this particular podcast
30:39
anyone know why 12 seconds have we only
30:41
been recording for 12 years
30:43
12 seconds is the same length of time
30:46
that the wright brothers first flight
30:47
was
30:49
flew for 12 years one of them start
30:51
pooing
30:54
land as it landed
30:57

[Music]
00:15
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:18
no such thing as a fish
00:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:22
qi offices in covent garden
00:24
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:26
here with
00:27
andrew hunter murray anna chazinski and
00:30
james harkin
00:32
and once again we have gathered around
00:33
the microphones with our four favorite
00:35
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:37
particular order
00:38
here we go starting with you andy
00:42
thank you for that incredibly forgetful
00:45
introduction
00:48
my fact this week is that chicken's eggs
00:50
turn from pointy end first
00:52
to the blunt end first just before they
00:54
come out
00:55
like a baby like a baby i don't know if
00:58
babies have a pointy end but
01:00
they think that when a baby's getting
01:01
ready yeah i guess head is a healthy end
01:04
so when you're getting ready to be born
01:06
babies will go into dive position
01:08
well most babies do well i was a breach
01:10
as was my brother
01:12
so i wonder if chickens have the same
01:14
thing where sometimes you get a breech
01:16
one where
01:17
eggs awkward eggs yeah and sometimes
01:18
they have to cesarean it out because
01:20
it's the pointy end first and it's just
01:21
too difficult
01:23
um yeah which seems counterintuitive
01:25
doesn't it so why do they come out um
01:27
that end first i don't know once you get
01:29
past the most rounded bit
01:31
it probably just fires out yeah it's
01:33
exactly like a baby that's why it's
01:34
harder with a baby when they come out
01:36
next first because
01:37
you have to push hardest right at the
01:38
end don't you babies should come out
01:40
like you know like in the pencil
01:42
position like a pencil dive
01:44
or like a diver the other way around
01:47
with the hands in a diving position
01:49
that'd be good
01:50
that's how i imagine tom daley was born
01:55
my waters are broken and there's lots of
01:57
um
01:59
judges hold up i was i was talking about
02:03
tom daley the other day
02:04
i have a theory that and it might not
02:06
even be a theory it might be a fact
02:08
but if you're a diver and you dive off
02:09
high boards yeah half of your
02:11
training must be just walking upstairs
02:15
no it's not a fact no i think that's a
02:17
fact what do you mean by training
02:19
well because if you if you're not used
02:21
to walking upstairs
02:22
like anna and i walked up some stairs
02:24
the other day and i almost died
02:25
uh you lose your energy and he's got to
02:28
now do a dive once he's at the top of
02:29
there and those boards are really high
02:30
they're really steep stairs but they are
02:32
elite sports people not like you walking
02:34
up the stairs at covert garden but they
02:36
must they must part of their training
02:37
must be like
02:38
climb up some stairs it must be there's
02:41
no possible reason why you wouldn't
02:42
train them to climb stairs all the time
02:44
actually then elite divers have chair
02:46
lifts uh so they can conserve their
02:48
energy there we go
02:50
yeah done do you understand that if you
02:52
get fit
02:53
at one thing sometimes that means you're
02:54
fit loads of other things
02:56
so if i become like a champion runner
02:58
yeah i'll also probably find it easier
03:00
to go upstairs
03:00
i don't i i disagree with that different
03:04
muscle groups
03:04
have you seen these divers they're like
03:06
super fit i'm not saying they're not
03:08
like
03:08
flabby ass people trying to get up the
03:11
stairs are they
03:12
i'm annoyed that i've been bounced into
03:14
the position of now supposedly saying
03:16
that divers are not fit
03:18
you know because all those conversations
03:19
where they take a rest halfway up
03:21
they have to sit down now if the if the
03:24
whole point of diving was to make the
03:26
biggest splash possible
03:27
yeah then you would have a lot of
03:29
out-of-shape people climbing up
03:31
yeah yeah and then that would be a
03:32
problem yes but because they might not
03:34
make it to the dive well that would be
03:36
part of the
03:36
that's part of the competition so you
03:38
have to be big enough to make a massive
03:40
splash but
03:40
not big enough that you can't get to the
03:42
top
03:43
and that's the two tensions yeah yeah
03:46
sumo diving i'm surprised this isn't a
03:47
thing
03:49
you're right yeah so hang on you're
03:51
saying that do you mean half the time
03:52
that divers spence i'm just saying i i
03:54
didn't
03:54
factor in that that's half the gig
03:56
getting up to the board but then i think
03:58
if you wanted to be an elite diver and
04:00
you spent half of your training time
04:03
climbing up and down stairs and only
04:05
half of your training time learning how
04:06
to actually dive
04:08
probably you would but no that's right
04:11
they must do
04:12
how long does it take to get up those
04:13
tests 30 seconds once you're at the top
04:15
how long do you spend faffing around
04:16
getting ready for the dive probably
04:17
about 30 seconds they're probably
04:18
catching their breath again
04:20
they're not all that's not where all
04:22
training happens of course with
04:24
um divers they do a lot in mats and
04:26
stuff like that it's a lot of gymnastics
04:28
and stuff
04:28
yeah i didn't know that oh so i see
04:30
you're just saying they spend half their
04:31
time because to practice they do have to
04:33
go upstairs whereas dan's saying they
04:34
actually
04:34
need to practice going if you got there
04:38
and you'd only had time to complete the
04:39
first half of your modules
04:51
something about the man who discovered
04:53
this the man who discovered
04:54
and just to remind you the fact that
04:56
chicken's eggs turn from pointy end
04:58
first to blunden first just before they
04:59
hatch
05:00
he was an egg uh scientist he studied
05:03
birds and vertex
05:04
and he was called heinrich uh wickman
05:07
vickman
05:08
and he found out by marking the eggs
05:10
with a pencil
05:12
up the birds just an hour before they
05:14
laid the eggs
05:15
so he inserted a pencil into the bird's
05:18
cloaca
05:19
oh i know anyway i got this in a book
05:22
called the most perfect thing
05:24
it's a book all about bird's eggs by a
05:25
guy called tim burkhead and i do
05:26
recommend it it's really interesting
05:28
book
05:28
an egg shape is that specific shape is
05:32
the most pleasing shape
05:33
that it could be to us so they've done
05:35
some brain tests that look at the kind
05:37
of surface curvature that humans find
05:38
most pleasing
05:39
and across all societies it's that exact
05:41
curvature so if it goes more pointy or
05:44
more squashed then we don't enjoy
05:45
looking at it as much
05:46
and i think it's because we've evolved
05:48
to think that that's what a healthy
05:50
uh bit of tissue and development would
05:52
look like but what's interesting
05:54
is that different eggs are different
05:55
sizes for different birds aren't they so
05:57
is this a chicken egg you're talking
05:58
about
05:59
chicken egg yeah interesting but they're
06:00
often quite you do get more rounded eggs
06:02
but you don't get like
06:03
really long thin ones very often
06:06
because then the bird that was born in
06:09
them
06:09
like maybe a snake's egg would be like
06:11
that a stick a stick bird
06:13
flamingo egg would be like that yeah
06:17
um but you do get round ones you do get
06:19
round ones yeah
06:20
who do who do round ones but some other
06:22
some other
06:23
birds do it there was a theory i don't
06:25
think this might not be true anymore but
06:27
the idea that the egg shaped ones don't
06:30
really roll out of nests very well
06:31
and the ones which are more rounded are
06:33
ones that lay eggs on the floor
06:35
yeah so they don't they might not fall
06:37
out of trees as likely yeah are you
06:38
going to debunk that theory
06:40
i've i've read a debunk but i can't i
06:42
didn't look into it properly there is
06:43
something in this book about it as well
06:45
exactly i can't remember chapter and
06:46
verse
06:46
yeah they could have done um in order to
06:49
find it out with modern
06:50
technology uh a sort of x-ray video
06:52
because do you remember
06:53
there's that incredible um photo of what
06:56
a kiwi bird looks like just before it
06:57
gives birth
06:58
i used to have that picture on my wall i
07:00
found it we just love the curvature so
07:02
much
07:03
well it's just because it's you're
07:05
looking at it going is this a
07:06
is this a kiwi with an egg in it or is
07:09
this an
07:10
egg with a kiwi over it it's both really
07:13
it's both they're both the same size
07:15
are you inside your clothes or are they
07:17
outside of you
07:20
i think there's james it's both isn't it
07:21
but yeah that's right
07:23
the equivalent if a kiwi bird when you
07:25
see this picture and i highly recommend
07:27
google
07:29
i'll this picture on my twitter i'll put
07:30
on accuai podcast as well it's
07:32
equivalent to a human giving birth
07:33
to a four-year-old that's how big
07:37
the egg is and they're often wearing
07:38
jumpers and things so that'll be
07:40
especially scratchy and difficult
07:43
[Laughter]
07:47
did you know that uh mammals evolved
07:50
milk
07:50
in order to wet their eggs well i don't
07:53
even understand that yeah
07:55
i know like cooked chicken eggs
07:58
uh not we didn't we didn't evolve milk
08:02
so we could poach a good egg in here
08:06
egg what eggs so millions of years ago
08:08
when our ancestors were still laying
08:11
eggs they didn't have shells
08:13
so they had like quite a porous membrane
08:16
and that meant that they would dry out
08:17
really easily
08:18
and so we evolved milk people think now
08:22
in order to like put it over the eggs
08:25
and
08:25
make sure that they didn't get
08:27
dehydrated and then
08:28
we realized evolution realized that
08:31
quite a good use of this milk would be
08:33
as a way of transferring some nutrients
08:35
into the the offspring in our egg and so
08:38
we developed more and more nutrients in
08:39
our milk
08:40
and then kept putting that in the egg
08:41
and then eventually um
08:43
that our milk became so nutrient-filled
08:45
that it became just something we could
08:46
nurture a baby with
08:48
that is cool wow i was reading
08:52
that you can know what color an egg is
08:55
going to be from a chicken
08:56
by looking at its ears chickens don't
08:58
have external ears
09:00
do they they have earlobes heavier lobes
09:02
do they
09:03
yeah prominent you'll have seen them i
09:06
think maybe you just didn't think of
09:07
them as being earlobes
09:08
uh yeah so um if they have white
09:11
earlobes they'll have
09:12
white eggs and if they have red earlobes
09:15
they'll have brown eggs
09:16
this the article stresses is not always
09:19
the case
09:20
right okay but but they do say that it's
09:23
it's something that people have noticed
09:24
more often
09:25
than not it's almost always the case i
09:27
think you can tell it's gonna be a color
09:29
similar to the earlobes are you
09:30
andy is imagining a chicken with human
09:33
ears
09:34
yeah yeah and it's disgusting yeah
09:37
have you ever seen a chicken do you know
09:38
what a chicken is yeah okay
09:40
yeah i just was because this is your
09:42
fact so i was just checking you had
09:44
googled chicken before you
09:46
yeah came in here yeah i think it's not
09:48
the first thing you see when you look at
09:50
a chicken though is it you see the
09:51
feathers and you see the beak
09:53
you it's not the initial and sometimes
09:56
the little feathery trousers
09:57
you know the little spurs they have
09:58
those are pretty cute oh yeah those were
10:00
the big
10:00
yeah cowboys tug but it's not like
10:03
elephants where
10:04
the first thing you see is the ears the
10:06
first thing you see
10:07
on an elephant is the trunk james well
10:09
i'm looking from the side
10:11
yeah it's facing away from you not
10:16
category
10:21
okay it is time to move on to fact
10:23
number two and that
10:25
is james okay my fact this week is that
10:27
the former prime minister of georgia
10:30
has started taking famous trees from
10:32
around his country
10:33
digging them up and then planting them
10:35
in his own garden
10:37
he's like he's personally digging them
10:39
up he's digging them up it's amazing
10:41
so i was re so for our book which is
10:43
coming out in november
10:45
i was reading about the world
10:46
geopolitical situation and there's
10:48
things happening in georgia
10:49
there's elections in abkhazia where
10:51
they're trying to get out of georgia
10:52
and while i was reading that i came
10:54
across this guy and i can't believe i've
10:55
never heard about him before
10:57
he's called um bedzina yvenish philly
11:00
and he's taking trees from around the
11:01
country and either driving them or
11:03
putting them on a ship
11:04
and then taking them to his house and
11:05
planting them and he says
11:07
it's my hobby i really love big trees
11:10
giant trees
11:11
are my entertainments how many famous
11:14
trees are there in georgia
11:16
not as many as they used to be
11:17
[Laughter]
11:20
so this is the thing he reckons it's a
11:21
good idea because before the people who
11:23
have the trees on their land
11:25
might not have been properly looking
11:26
after them and so if he puts them on his
11:27
land then he'll be able to look after
11:29
them on his arboretum
11:31
but ecologists are skeptical well he
11:33
does say doesn't he though that he'll
11:34
plant 10 trees for every one that he
11:36
takes away or i think at least he did
11:38
that for one of them he did that for
11:40
this giant tulip tree it was a 650 ton
11:43
tulip tree whoa i thought tulips are
11:45
like small
11:46
uh yeah i i thought they were as well i
11:49
guess this is just one 650 ton
11:51
tulip yeah that you know is context
11:53
actually it's all in the way the photo's
11:55
done so you know those fields of tulips
11:56
you see
11:56
in the netherlands those are actually
11:58
all massive well you do see the odd
12:00
windmill though so maybe
12:02
dutch windmills are absolutely massive
12:03
they're even bigger i think yeah
12:05
maybe he's just duping them all maybe
12:07
he's told them it's a tulip tree so he's
12:08
like i'll just give you these extra
12:10
seeds you could have ten of them have as
12:12
bad as you want um
12:13
this guy he does sound amazing though he
12:15
is incredible and he's got this
12:17
mansion hasn't he which is kind of
12:19
disgusting if you look it up and it's
12:21
basically is the james bond mansion it's
12:24
like a giant glass spaceship
12:26
yeah and it um it's it's on a mountain
12:28
side isn't it so it overlooks the
12:30
capital of his country from a
12:31
mountainside yeah cool
12:33
so the indy when it interviewed him and
12:35
uh when he went there
12:36
um he said there are eight different
12:39
breeds of peacock
12:40
and i have them all so he does
12:43
he really likes collecting loads of
12:45
stuff basically yeah he has loads of
12:47
animals doesn't he has
12:48
uh zebras um what else
12:51
kangaroos kangaroos penguins penguins he
12:54
is also rumored to have a shark tank
12:56
he does yeah yeah he does because he has
12:59
to keep importing loads of salt for it
13:01
all the time i think like gallons of
13:02
salt
13:03
apparently in the hallway of his house
13:04
he has a work by gilbert and george
13:06
with a slogan that says say off to
13:08
rich bastards
13:10
his net worth is 4.8 billion dollars
13:13
yeah i think his net worth is like 50 of
13:16
the gdp of georgia
13:18
it's between a third and a half
13:20
depending on which source you read but
13:21
it is
13:22
yeah well he sounds like the right man
13:23
to be the former leader of the country
13:25
doesn't he yeah he's if he is basically
13:27
the gdp of georgia
13:28
well indeed yeah that's true um just
13:30
quickly on uh
13:31
trees in georgia because i don't think
13:33
i'm going to get another chance to get
13:34
my trees in georgia fact now
13:36
next week yeah it's possible you could
13:37
put it in the book oh yeah
13:39
well just in case i don't do that
13:43
so basically georgia breed christmas
13:45
trees and
13:46
you know the tree that we call the
13:47
nordman fur and it gets called the
13:48
caucasian fer it's basically the famous
13:50
christmas tree in europe as in 45
13:53
million gets old all around western
13:54
europe each year
13:55
um these trees are grown
13:59
elsewhere but they're originally from
14:01
georgia as in the seeds that grow them
14:03
are all from georgian christmas trees
14:05
and people in georgia climb up them
14:06
and they're massive okay so it's quite
14:08
dangerous there are fatalities every
14:09
year
14:10
they collect the cones which have got
14:12
the seeds inside them and then they sell
14:14
the seeds to places like denmark and
14:15
then denmark
14:16
actually does the work of growing and
14:17
selling the trees but jordan misses out
14:19
because obviously you need loads and
14:21
loads of pine cones and then they get
14:22
sold for much more it's like
14:23
drugs you know it starts off quite cheap
14:25
but street value of these
14:27
trees is massive so the georgians i
14:30
think they want to break into that and
14:31
start growing their own trees say no to
14:32
pine cones kids yeah
14:35
hey while we're uh just on christmas
14:36
trees did you guys know
14:39
that elephants floss using christmas
14:42
trees
14:43
hmm have you guys heard that no i don't
14:45
think that's true
14:46
it's true it's true elephants floss
14:48
using uh christmas trees
14:50
at least that's what i read in uh
14:51
germany they've got this tradition every
14:53
year so they give their christmas trees
14:54
to the elephants
14:55
at the zoo and uh people just hand over
14:58
their trees and
14:58
the elephants eat them they can get
15:00
through like three trees a day but they
15:02
also have been seen flossing with them
15:03
so i guess flossing
15:04
the tree out of their teeth holding it
15:07
with their trunk and then in and out
15:08
between their teeth
15:09
yeah i mean i haven't seen any pictures
15:11
because they don't have opposable thumbs
15:13
do they
15:14
so it must be with their trunk that's
15:15
the only prehensile part of their body
15:17
yeah but it's weird that you would try
15:18
and get a tree out with a tree
15:20
and how would would it help would it not
15:22
be that that tree would get stuck
15:23
oh yeah then you get a slightly larger
15:25
tree it's there's the elephant version
15:27
of the old woman who swallowed a fly
15:29
it's the elephant who flossed with a
15:30
christmas tree yeah
15:32
eventually has to swallow a tulip tree
15:34
which is the biggest on earth apparently
15:37
um speaking of trees by the way very
15:38
quickly we have just discovered that
15:40
there are more trees on earth than we
15:42
thought there were
15:43
so there are now 427 million hectares
15:47
more trees than we thought there were on
15:49
earth how many did i think there were
15:51
427 million hectares less than the
15:53
number you've got in your head
15:55
yeah so minus that from whatever you've
15:57
had uh to put it into context
15:59
by the way that is if if all that tree
16:02
the new tree was put
16:03
into a place a single place it would
16:05
take up 60 percent
16:07
of the surface of australia that's
16:09
actually kind of less than i thought it
16:10
would be
16:11
yeah but no that's is that only the
16:13
bonus trees that we've got it's not all
16:15
the trees in the world is it yeah yeah
16:16
that's
16:16
that's the extra bonus trees so we can't
16:19
just go nuts and start cutting down all
16:21
the trees
16:22
because we're the prime minister of
16:24
georgia or the ex-prime minister of
16:25
georgia yeah what it does mean is that
16:26
he's got a lot more to collect now
16:28
but he's not collecting every tree he's
16:30
just collecting individual examples
16:32
is he collecting all the trees in the
16:33
world no it's just the famous treat oh
16:35
we don't know do we because we only know
16:37
where he's got two so far we don't know
16:38
where he's going to start because maybe
16:39
he's starting with the most famous but
16:41
his list includes every single tree on
16:43
the planet
16:43
and he's just working his way down
16:45
that's the least famous exactly yeah
16:46
what is the least famous tree
16:48
nobody knows well only he knows and his
16:52
mother
16:53
um did i ever tell you guys that my dad
16:56
is how i used to live when i was born in
16:58
hong kong we lived in an island just off
17:00
hong kong called discovery bay
17:01
and my parents lived in this house and
17:03
next door to them their neighbor had a
17:05
tree in their front yard and my
17:07
dad used to love this tree he just used
17:09
to think i want one day to have a tree
17:10
in my front yard as well
17:12
and so he he went out he got really
17:14
drunk one night
17:15
and he came back and he doesn't really
17:18
remember what happened but in the
17:19
morning my mom went outside opened the
17:21
doors and went
17:22
roger what have you done and he quickly
17:25
jumped up and he saw what he must have
17:27
done in his drunken state which is
17:28
clearly he was walking home he saw the
17:30
tree thought god damn it i want that
17:32
tree
17:33
so he dug it up and he brought the tree
17:36
over
17:36
and he planted it in our front yard but
17:39
what he had failed to do
17:41
was to cover up his tracks so he saw the
17:44
tree
17:44
planted beautifully at our yard with a
17:46
huge trail of debris and dirt leading to
17:49
a gigantic hole
17:50
sitting in our neighbor's front yard
17:53
amazing
17:54
you know i think actually even without
17:56
that trail of earth your neighbor might
17:57
have just about figured out what was
17:59
going on there
18:00
i know i know that swing
18:03
you're saying that your dad went drunk
18:05
okay on his way home
18:07
dug up a tree presumably he was just on
18:10
his way home so he wasn't carrying his
18:11
spade with him
18:12
yeah the implication is he dug it up
18:14
with his bare hands also i can only
18:16
imagine dan's dad
18:17
likes trees that are tree-sized so it
18:19
must be pretty big right yeah so you dug
18:21
up this tree with
18:21
all he he thought i want that tree went
18:23
home got the spade
18:25
well the home was just next door so it
18:27
was very convenient he couldn't get this
18:29
yeah he could have dug it up with the
18:31
cart and he got his kebab
18:33
yes you're right because in australia oh
18:36
no in hong kong sorry
18:37
hong kong all kebab cartons are made of
18:38
reinforced steel
18:40
uh in case of you know burning your
18:42
hands well anyway he put the tree back
18:44
so no one needs to press criminal
18:45
charges or anything
18:47
i don't know if the guy ever noticed by
18:48
the way my mom woke up really early in
18:50
the morning
18:51
unless he was a very late riser i think
18:53
you probably noticed
18:54
so your dad may be replanting it before
18:57
this guy woke up
18:58
i think he may be wake up he's like this
19:00
is orientated in a slightly different
19:02
one
19:03
that swing was on the other side that
19:06
poor guy has had mental health problems
19:08
for the rest of his
19:09
life just had a nervous breakdown yeah
19:11
he actually invented the character of
19:12
groot for the guardians of the galaxy
19:14
film about a mischievous tree
19:16
um just quickly while we're talking
19:18
about moving trees whether illegally or
19:20
legally or
19:21
you know with a polystyrene carton yeah
19:24
if you don't have a polystyrene carton
19:25
to hand you can get these unbelievably
19:27
cool things and they're called tree
19:28
spades
19:30
so they're these massive boxes right
19:32
they look like a big uh
19:33
sort of space egg and you surround the
19:36
tree with it i don't know quite where
19:37
you
19:38
uncouple it and surround the tree and
19:40
then what it does is it has these
19:41
massive
19:42
round edged blades which dig into the
19:44
ground
19:45
very carefully lift up the entire tree
19:47
roots and everything
19:49
and then they can tilt it sideways and
19:51
put it onto for example the side of a
19:53
van or whatever
19:54
and then probably on the back of a van
19:56
not the side of a van yeah yeah
19:59
that's amazing that sounds like it's
20:00
it's giving it a pot
20:02
like it's the egg shape underneath is
20:04
created the part exactly
20:05
and the really cool thing is they've
20:06
been doing this for hundreds of years or
20:08
at least i think 150 years
20:10
and they were doing this in brooklyn but
20:11
just without the big mechanical element
20:13
but they still had these cool devices
20:15
too
20:16
so without the mechanical element it's
20:17
just a spade well
20:23
150 years not a lot of people know that
20:25
no they have these big tree moving
20:26
wagons
20:27
but oh right wow so they put them onto
20:29
the wagon sideways do they
20:31
yeah because yeah the prime minister of
20:33
georgia the ex-prime minister of georgia
20:35
didn't do that
20:35
he sent his sticking upwards no
20:39
yeah so there's some amazing pictures
20:40
online i'll try and put them on my
20:42
twitter
20:42
um there's one where he has a tree on a
20:45
kind of a raft
20:47
and he's taking it on the black sea and
20:48
it's just sticking up that's
20:50
right they are they look incredible you
20:52
should look at the picture it's
20:53
incredible if you took it from someone's
20:54
land
20:55
you wouldn't necessarily know he was
20:56
stealing it it just might look like oh
20:58
it looks a bit further away today
21:02
so then he took them along the coastline
21:03
of the black sea but the coastline the
21:05
black sea is really shallow
21:07
and so it got stuck there and so he then
21:09
had to make
21:10
a new road to take the tree along
21:13
and then that road collapsed so he had
21:16
to make a new road
21:17
and also one time he he took um a tree
21:19
on the highway
21:20
and it was a magnolia tree and when he
21:22
was taking it it got stuck on a
21:24
eucalyptus tree that was growing on the
21:25
side of the road
21:27
did it take the eucalyptus tree with him
21:29
was it just like a tree chain
21:31
buy one get one tree he's a hell of a
21:34
lot of hassle this hobby of his isn't it
21:36
yeah his wife's probably saying you need
21:38
to collect something smaller yeah
21:40
or maybe he's just getting drunk every
21:41
night and finding these trees in his
21:43
garden everywhere
21:45
um just because you you mentioned
21:47
christmas trees earlier
21:48
um i was reading this amazing story
21:50
about the christmas tree shipping
21:52
industry which used to be huge in the us
21:53
they used to ship
21:55
hundreds of christmas trees on ships and
21:56
there was this particularly famous ship
21:58
called the rouse simmons ship
22:00
and uh it used to carry thousands of
22:02
trees and
22:04
then in 1912 it had this very famous
22:06
accident and it sank
22:08
so it was carrying 5 500 trees from
22:10
michigan to chicago across lake michigan
22:13
and it was captained by this guy called
22:14
shernaman who was so famous as a
22:16
christmas tree
22:17
importer that people called him captain
22:19
santa and
22:20
uh he used to go he used to land in
22:23
chicago and he really liked giving out
22:24
christmas trees to the poor and people
22:26
who couldn't afford christmas well you
22:27
know
22:27
it doesn't quite make sense because
22:29
santa arrives after the tree has been
22:31
sorted out
22:32
basically santa doesn't bring the tree
22:34
down the chimney maybe captain santa
22:36
comes and sorts that out is like santa's
22:38
boss yeah
22:40
[Laughter]
22:42
they should give him his full title it's
22:44
very confusing that's
22:46
so cool so captain santa um yeah used to
22:49
do this
22:49
and then there was this awful there's a
22:50
storm that sunk the whole ship and it
22:52
killed everyone on board and
22:54
all the trees sunk so for years
22:56
afterwards fishermen on lake
22:57
michigan would catch huge christmas
22:59
trees
23:01
but what i quite like is uh first of all
23:04
his business partner who would always
23:05
wait in chicago with him was called
23:07
claude winters
23:08
quite nice nominative determinism wow
23:10
yeah and also captain santa claus
23:12
winter it's one letter away from santa
23:14
claus winters
23:15
yes yeah okay um anyway just the other
23:19
bizarre thing about this
23:20
accident was that the captain santa left
23:23
a message in a bottle when he knew the
23:25
ship was in trouble
23:26
and he corked it using the small piece
23:28
of a cut pine tree from one of the trees
23:30
that was on board
23:31
and he left this message and it got
23:32
picked up and the message just said
23:34
everybody goodbye
23:36
i guess we're all through uh leaking bad
23:39
god help us leaking bad that sounds like
23:41
a new netflix show doesn't it
23:44
it's about the white house
23:53
okay it is time for fact number three
23:55
and that is my fact
23:56
my fact this week is that u.s military
23:59
medics
24:00
use longer needles than normal because
24:03
soldiers are often
24:04
too buff for the regular ones i think
24:07
this sounds like a boast
24:08
by the american army yeah it does
24:10
doesn't it yeah you should see the size
24:12
of our condoms
24:13
it's just a bit too convenient that is a
24:16
common thing isn't it in armies that
24:18
they send
24:19
like enormous condoms we saw jimmy carr
24:21
the other day and he told us that story
24:23
about churchill
24:24
oh yeah there was a gun where they had a
24:27
sheath kind of thing put over it
24:29
and it was made by durex and so it was
24:31
like a condom but it was the size of a
24:33
machine gun
24:34
it was to stop the gun jamming or
24:36
freezing
24:37
yeah and so what they did was they got a
24:39
big consignment of them
24:40
and then churchill supposedly said well
24:43
let's label it
24:44
british condoms small
24:48
so let me give you a bit of background
24:49
of where i got this fact from i'm
24:51
reading a really good book called grunt
24:52
by mary roach
24:54
and she went round looking at all
24:56
innovations going on in the military and
24:58
classic merry roach investigation
25:00
finding out very much
25:02
what we love you know the quirky facts
25:04
about certain things so this book's
25:05
military
25:06
and she spent time with a bunch of
25:07
medics and this was told to her that
25:09
basically
25:10
um a lot of the soldiers are so muscular
25:14
particularly around the pecs and they
25:17
often need to give them injections when
25:18
they're out in the field for collapsed
25:20
lungs and they were finding
25:21
um in autopsies when they were doing it
25:23
later because in autopsies
25:25
they all get an autopsy any soldier that
25:28
dies gets an autopsy
25:29
when they were going to check out the
25:30
collapsed lung and putting the needles
25:32
in
25:32
none of them were reaching and they
25:33
thought this is no use for the field so
25:36
needles i don't know if it's all the
25:37
needles but certainly there's a lot of
25:39
needles that are extra large
25:40
long needles that's amazing yeah they
25:43
also have to make bigger needles for
25:45
obese people i think
25:46
do they right they did a study for um
25:49
with some obese people
25:50
and they put the needles into their
25:52
buttocks
25:54
uh to see if the um stuff would get to
25:56
the muscles
25:57
and they found that in less than a third
25:59
of the patients what they injected was
26:01
getting through to where it needed to be
26:03
yeah so they need to start making
26:05
needles which are now longer for obese
26:07
people as well
26:07
it's terrible if you've got a fear of
26:08
needles yeah although
26:10
so a good way of combating a fear of
26:12
needles has just been developed
26:14
never have any western medicine
26:18
no because if you get acupuncture you've
26:19
really got to learn
26:22
no if you've got a fear of needles uh
26:23
the scientists have developed this thing
26:24
which is a pill that's covered in
26:26
needles that you swallow and that
26:28
injects you from the inside
26:29
what and that's to get you over it and
26:30
this is really cool so i think
26:32
this has been tested it was tested on
26:34
pigs the last time i read about it but
26:35
it might have been updated and it was to
26:37
administer
26:38
insulin and basically it's these little
26:40
pills and they cover them in tiny
26:41
needles
26:42
and then they have an outer coating of
26:43
the pill and when the pill gets into
26:45
your stomach
26:46
then the outer coating of the pill
26:47
dissolves and all these tiny tiny
26:49
needles prod the lining of your stomach
26:51
and they administer the drug straight
26:52
into your bloodstream but do you have to
26:54
pass the needles out later on i think so
26:57
but they we're talking like one
26:58
millimeter less than a millimeter i
27:00
don't know that still sounds painful
27:03
maybe they dissolve um maybe they do
27:06
dissolve
27:06
yeah they're really tiny well here okay
27:09
here's a
27:09
less painful one if you don't want to
27:11
swallow needles um
27:14
this is this is used um i don't know if
27:16
it's if it was
27:17
this is just the trial i was reading
27:19
about but they definitely have developed
27:20
this and it has been used
27:21
um so instead of having a morphine
27:23
needle let's say in order to numb you
27:25
uh you can instead now have a lollipop
27:28
wow sticking into you no yeah yeah that
27:31
sounds like it'll be more painful than
27:33
it would be
27:34
yeah i would rather have morphine if i
27:36
were in pain than a lollipop
27:38
well interestingly on any day of the
27:39
week i'll have more thing than a
27:40
lollipop
27:41
interesting it's not your classic
27:43
lollipop obviously
27:45
um it's it's uh they call it the
27:47
fentanyl
27:48
lollipop um and it's basically the drug
27:51
so it's got a drug in the lollipop you
27:53
eat it and it absorbs through the
27:54
tongue and the mouth and that's really
27:57
fast apparently
27:58
so it spreads really quickly and they
28:00
can also tell when you've had too much
28:02
so because you're because you've got a
28:04
bird's head
28:05
exactly because if it does go into you
28:07
know it's a painkiller it first goes
28:09
into your tongue
28:10
it's going to be like at the dentist
28:11
isn't it where you can't talk yes
28:12
exactly yeah you must
28:14
numb your tongue but they can obviously
28:16
if they see that enough
28:17
of the drug has been put into the
28:18
patient they can stop putting more by
28:20
simply just just
28:21
taking it away yeah and then you're just
28:23
going to be crying
28:26
because there was that there was an art
28:28
installation once of a guy
28:30
who gave babies lollipops and then took
28:32
them off them and took photos of them
28:34
crying
28:34
oh yeah that's quite controversial well
28:37
unsurprisingly
28:38
unsurprising unsurprisingly have you
28:41
seen one of these lollipops
28:45
yeah do you know where the word uh
28:47
syringe comes from
28:49
uh cyrinx is a
28:52
thing in a bird which makes it like a
28:54
larynx
28:55
oh it is from the word sirens but
28:58
i didn't know that bird thing because
29:00
cyrex was in greek mythology she was
29:02
uh no he look she uh sarinks she was a
29:06
name
29:06
and she was being chased by the god pan
29:08
right and then she disguised herself as
29:11
some water
29:12
reeds okay clever but
29:15
not clever enough because pam then
29:16
chopped the reeds off and blew into them
29:19
to make a whistling sound and that's
29:21
where he got his panpipes
29:23
but it's also where the word syringe was
29:26
taken from because you you know it's a
29:27
long thin tube of something
29:28
that must be where the sirens of or a
29:31
syrinx of a bird comes from because it's
29:32
the whistling sound
29:34
and that's what they use to make their
29:35
tweets there we go
29:38
i have some things on muscles cool yeah
29:41
um so
29:42
there's a guy called zhang jingkwan in
29:45
china
29:46
who holds a world record for pulling the
29:48
largest vehicle
29:50
um by pressing a rice bowl onto his
29:52
abdominal muscles creating a suction
29:55
and then attaching it to a vehicle and
29:56
pulling it how large was the vehicle
29:58
it was 3305.5 kilograms
30:03
and he he pulled it for 10 meters wow
30:07
just through suction that adhered
30:09
adhered to his muscular abdomen
30:11
i would have thought that there would
30:12
always cause you're not flat enough
30:14
to be able to for the suction quality
30:18
i'm really impressed that's incredible
30:20
yeah i think he did it to impress people
30:23
it's worked like a tron it's it's half
30:26
worked i'd say anna
30:27
yeah and then it's worked on you i'm not
30:28
impressed you're not impressed no
30:30
he's pulled a three-ton vehicle
30:33
using suction on his abdomen i think
30:36
that's a very bad way of trying to pass
30:38
your driving test
30:39
i think if only he did i told you he
30:41
wasn't trying to do that he was trying
30:42
to impress people
30:43
oh i see well he hasn't done that either
30:46
okay did you guys know
30:47
one fact about the u.s military yeah
30:49
sure and their pens
30:52
do you know they all use the same pen
30:54
just the ones
30:55
they're sharing this sorry general
30:57
mcmaster's got the pen today
31:02
do you mean pen as in thing you write
31:03
with or that you keep animals in
31:08
uh yeah the pen they write with it's
31:09
called a skill craft pen
31:11
it's the same company that's been making
31:12
their pen since i think uh i think the
31:14
1920s
31:16
but apparently every every american
31:17
listening will apparently know what it
31:18
is
31:19
it's used in war zones it's designed to
31:21
fit into u.s military uniforms and
31:25
it's designed not to be so impossibly
31:26
large that it doesn't fit into a normal
31:29
human pocket
31:30
all right yeah uh so they've got this
31:33
pen that fits snugly into their uniforms
31:34
it's specifically designed
31:37
that it can do that but it can stand in
31:39
for a two inch
31:40
fuse apparently it's designed for that i
31:42
don't really know how a pen does that
31:43
what
31:44
um it comes in handy during emergency
31:46
tracheotomies which i think
31:47
a lot of you guys can do no pence can't
31:49
do that you know oh
31:50
oh yeah there's a study done and
31:52
actually most pens are not suitable for
31:54
tracheotomies
31:55
well guys you better get the skill craft
31:56
if you feel like you're gonna need one
31:58
so is it where you put a
31:59
pen okay you'll see it and yeah you'll
32:01
see it in movies sometimes someone's
32:03
choking and then someone goes ah i'm a
32:05
surgeon and here's a biro and i'll stick
32:08
it in your neck and you can breathe
32:09
through the pen kind of thing
32:10
but anyway if you're ever in that
32:11
situation it probably won't work oh but
32:14
it would be quite
32:14
stabbed in the neck unless you have one
32:16
of these special
32:18
skill crafts exactly anyway more legends
32:20
about this pen
32:21
um so the main thing about it is they're
32:23
all manufactured by blind workers
32:25
so it was set up i think during the
32:27
great depression as a way of giving work
32:29
to people who would otherwise find it
32:30
really difficult to find work
32:32
so everyone who works in the factory
32:34
makes this uh doesn't have sight
32:36
and there are 16 page specifications for
32:39
exactly what the pen has to be able to
32:40
do
32:41
it needs to be able to write
32:42
continuously for a mile and in
32:44
temperatures of up to 160 degrees and
32:46
down to minus 40 degrees
32:48
all quite important for the army if
32:50
you've got secret messages that you need
32:51
to get
32:52
i don't know when you're going to be in
32:53
the army and you have to write a line
32:55
that's
32:55
a mile long well maybe you need to show
32:58
your troops the way to the nearest base
33:00
yes and it's a mile away um
33:03
wow that sounds amazing it's it's
33:05
surrounded by legend
33:07
apparently the length of the pen is
33:08
equivalent to 150 nautical miles on navy
33:11
maps
33:12
and that makes it easy for uh people in
33:15
the navy to navigate because they use
33:17
that pen
33:17
and they know that that equals 150 miles
33:19
on the map i mean they could just look
33:20
at the scale of the map i guess but
33:22
sometimes
33:22
because 150 if it was 100 i could see
33:25
that almost 150 isn't that round the
33:28
number do you know what i mean
33:29
but they need to stay quite mentally
33:30
alert so it's important to test their
33:31
math skills
33:33
at the same time but i presume they're
33:35
two inches long because they can be used
33:37
as a two inch fuse
33:38
uh yeah maybe there's a bit that's uh
33:41
detachable
33:42
but actually two inches is quite small
33:44
75 centimeters long and that obviously
33:46
would fit
33:47
snugly inside the average soldier's
33:49
uniform
33:50
five centimeters okay it's about that
33:52
long which is a short pen
33:54
that is it's like it's more like um it's
33:56
like a lad brooks pen
33:57
yeah or an argos pen yeah yeah
34:01
so they're not that short right it must
34:02
be a detachable bit okay
34:04
okay anyway just thought i'd want to
34:06
know about the skillcraft pen that's
34:07
great
34:09
i have one more thing about needles so
34:11
you know how mosquitoes
34:13
bite you yeah yeah they've got six
34:16
different
34:17
they've got six different needles which
34:19
i didn't know really yeah so they have
34:21
this really complicated multi-part drill
34:23
bit so they have two which drill through
34:25
the skin
34:25
right they have two more which hold the
34:28
edges of your skin
34:29
apart and there's a fifth one which
34:32
drops
34:32
saliva into you to stop your blood
34:35
plotting and then there's the sixth one
34:36
which actually sucks the blood up wow
34:38
but that's not even the cool thing the
34:40
cool thing is
34:42
how much volume would you say of blood a
34:43
mosquito can fit
34:45
inside it well your the hand gesture
34:46
you're making is about large melon size
34:49
so yeah mosquito yeah so i would say
34:53
it could fill 45 of its body 50
34:56
of his body okay four-year-old child
34:58
okay
35:01
so if you look at um um ticks
35:04
on yeah yeah they can get much they get
35:07
about a thousand percent of their own
35:09
body
35:09
well here's what are mosquitoes
35:11
mosquitoes can fit
35:12
ten times as much blood into them as the
35:15
size of a mosquito
35:16
not through swelling up wow what they do
35:19
is
35:19
as her gut fills up the female mosquito
35:22
separates
35:23
the water in the blood she's sucking up
35:25
from the actual red blood cells
35:27
and she squeezes the water out of her
35:29
bottom
35:31
so she can fit more red blood cells
35:32
which is the good stuff that you can get
35:34
so does that mean that when a mosquito
35:36
is biting you it's
35:37
also pissing well it's your blood though
35:40
is the water from your blood
35:41
it doesn't matter when you're urinating
35:43
it doesn't matter it's like no this
35:45
isn't urine because i was drinking
35:46
orange juice earlier right
35:47
yeah it's orange juice officer
35:52
it's just orange juice i'm pouring away
35:53
here please don't arrest me
35:56
also at that point is it a mosquito with
35:58
blood in it or
36:00
is it a lot of blood it's with a
36:02
mosquito area it's actually both is it
36:04
yeah
36:05
okay
36:06
[Applause]
36:11
okay it is time for our final fact of
36:13
the show and that is
36:14
chozinski my fact is that if you drew a
36:17
dot
36:18
in indelible ink on your eardrum it
36:20
would appear on the outside of your ear
36:21
within a few weeks
36:22
and are you using the skillcraft pen so
36:25
beloved by the us army
36:27
yeah i was just thinking the skill craft
36:29
pen would be good if you wanted to put
36:31
it in the cloaca of chickens
36:34
specifically designed to fit in the
36:36
chicken claw yeah
36:38
and in a human and also a chicken's
36:40
cloaker if you put it on a map
36:42
it's exactly 150 kilometers
36:46
if you don't have your pen but it messes
36:48
up the map
36:50
yeah wait so how does it work what do
36:52
you mean it's
36:53
so the way um the eardrum works is that
36:56
the skin grows outwards in a spiral
36:58
um because it needs to carry dead skin
37:00
out away from the eardrum and then to
37:02
the outside world where it falls off
37:04
um and so and it grows at about the same
37:07
rate as fingernails i think what and so
37:10
the skin starts off in your eardrum and
37:11
then it's carried out picks up earwax
37:13
picks up all the dust transports it
37:14
outside the ear
37:16
falls out same speed as continents move
37:19
because they always say that's the same
37:21
as a fingernail don't they they do
37:23
wait so and also it's a bit like a uh
37:25
conveyor belt system exactly it's
37:26
exactly
37:27
all the skin on your body does that
37:29
originate in the ear or does it
37:32
does it start is there a barrier where
37:34
it stops
37:35
growing outwards if you drew a little
37:37
dot on your eardrum
37:39
yeah then it just moves around the body
37:43
you'd have if you want to get a tattoo
37:44
very slowly
37:48
how did you get that i'm not saying that
37:50
the body is built from the air
37:53
it just falls off and you leave it
37:55
behind but it must fall off at a certain
37:57
point
37:57
yeah how far out of your ear before it
38:00
falls out
38:01
on your foot at the end of the big toe
38:05
it falls off that's why your socks are
38:07
always full of loose skin
38:09
with dots on them yeah that's right uh
38:12
no it just actually most
38:13
most of it is reabsorbed actually i
38:15
think most earwax is reabsorbed back
38:17
into the body before it reaches the
38:18
outside
38:19
so i'm confused about this because
38:20
obviously you get earwax in the ears and
38:22
this is related to the eardrum
38:24
uh yeah so induced at the eardrum ear
38:27
wax but ear wax is actually mostly dead
38:29
skin
38:29
yeah it is yeah okay okay that's what
38:32
was confusing me because
38:33
yeah i didn't know what it was made so
38:35
it's got this kind of waxy stuff but
38:36
it's
38:37
basically the big mass of it is bits of
38:39
dead skin from your eardrum
38:41
so um it's produced by these glands
38:43
inside your ear which i think
38:44
are in the sort of outer ear so the dead
38:46
skin spirals up a bit and then
38:48
picks up the sticky substance in from
38:50
these glands
38:51
and it's got like fatty acids in it's
38:53
got cholesterol in it uh other fats
38:55
and it also has alcohol in it so i
38:57
really wanted to find out what the exact
38:59
alcohol content of earwax was and then
39:01
work out
39:01
the equivalent of a pint yeah i can't
39:04
how much earwax would you have to eat
39:05
before you went over the legal limit
39:07
yeah
39:09
poor policeman who pulled you over
39:12
you just got a mouth full of ear wax you
39:14
know those medical trial things that
39:16
people go and do
39:17
to test things out imagine being that
39:19
the gig you get
39:20
how much would they have to pay you to
39:22
agree to eat enough ear wax to get you
39:24
drunk
39:24
well we don't know how much it is you
39:26
see for all we know it's just
39:28
like one little tiny bit of earwax is
39:30
enough to put you over the limit let's
39:31
say a
39:32
shop glass full of earwax right
39:35
well i'll i'll we'll negotiate but i'll
39:37
start at 10 000.
39:38
10 000. for probably a
39:44
[Laughter]
39:47
okay i think hannah's currently leading
39:50
the bid at the moment
39:51
i reckon we can crowdfund 10 010 pounds
39:55
and then you can both do it
40:01
so japanese mothers clean out their kids
40:03
ears with these um
40:04
ear ear rakes they're called mimikaki
40:07
and
40:07
then when japanese people grow up they
40:09
really like the feeling of it and so you
40:10
get ear salons where you go and you pay
40:12
quite a lot of money to go and have your
40:14
ears cleaned out same kind of thing
40:15
but the thing about this is if you start
40:17
which all of you would have read when
40:18
you start looking up ear wax and
40:20
is there's not a single medical
40:22
professional worldwide who doesn't say
40:23
straight away do not put
40:25
anything in your ear it's really really
40:27
bad for you yeah but then weirdly we're
40:29
all putting our fingers in our ears
40:31
while we're talking about this yeah
40:32
i mean you just did it i did didn't i i
40:34
know in my ears
40:38
i wonder if people listening to this are
40:39
also putting their fingers in their ears
40:41
and it's the kind of thing that you just
40:43
automatically do
40:44
like you know some kind of social things
40:47
that
40:47
are they're catching like a yawn kind of
40:51
thing yeah
40:52
i spoke to a doctor once he said you
40:53
should never put anything smaller than a
40:55
courgette in your ear and the thing was
40:58
obviously you can't fit one of those in
41:00
but you shouldn't put anything else in
41:01
right yeah that is exactly the case
41:03
that's probably true of most like holes
41:05
in your body
41:06
you shouldn't put anything smaller than
41:07
a courtyard
41:10
um a couple of years ago they found a
41:12
cat
41:13
abandoned in norfolk right some people
41:15
found an abandoned cat and it had
41:17
three ears really and were they all
41:20
belonging to it or had it just
41:22
it was just eating a mouse it had this
41:24
extra ear
41:26
on its on its left-hand side in front of
41:28
its other ear
41:29
can you guess what they consider calling
41:30
it oh
41:32
um it's really good okay
41:36
yeah yeah kitty kitty oh that's very
41:38
good very good
41:39
kitty kitty kitty surely sure yeah well
41:42
no it'd be
41:43
ear kitty
41:46
um shall i shall i tell you
41:50
i'll tell you what they called it and
41:51
then you see if you can guess why they
41:52
thought about calling it captain kirk
41:55
okay okay because he had a wild frontier
41:58
or something it was an old joke isn't
42:00
that
42:01
yeah where did they go in star trek the
42:02
final frontier the final frontier
42:04
frontier oh yeah and they considered
42:07
calling it that and then they called it
42:08
brian
42:12
after three-year brian is that the worst
42:15
fabric turn on your name
42:19
um speaking of cats in 1968
42:23
new york vet robert a lopez wanted to
42:25
discover whether it's possible for the
42:27
ear mite which you get in cats
42:29
to infest humans so he removes some
42:32
mites from a cat's ear mix them with his
42:34
ear wax
42:35
and then introduce them into his ear
42:39
and it turns out they can infest
42:40
people's ears
42:48
so it was extremely painful um you know
42:51
this it was loads of sounds in his ear
42:53
all the time
42:54
and they traveled deeper into his
42:56
eardrum and they got louder and louder
42:59
by the third week he was completely deaf
43:01
in the ear oh my god
43:02
in the fourth week the mice activity was
43:04
75 reduced
43:06
which is good but he could feel the
43:08
mites crawling across his face at night
43:12
on the inside or the outside uh across
43:15
the
43:15
yeah outside of his face probably trying
43:17
to find the new ear
43:21
and so he finished that and then did the
43:23
experiment two more times
43:26
with his other two ears
43:30
and found that the effects diminished
43:33
which he said that maybe his body found
43:34
an immune
43:35
reaction against the mites ah that's
43:37
good so there are two ways of avoiding
43:39
uh suffering from
43:40
cat mite infestations either infest
43:42
yourself repeatedly
43:44
or just don't do it in the first place
43:47
there was a woman who she had a spider
43:48
in here didn't she she had a live
43:50
tarantula in her ear
43:52
you're thinking of the nursery rhyme i
43:53
think yeah
43:55
because it was the fly first there was
43:56
an old lady who put a fly in her ear
44:00
i don't know why i now she can't hear
44:01
you
44:03
no there was there was a woman who had a
44:04
live transfer removed from here
44:06
she inserted the courgettes to get rid
44:08
of them
44:15
okay that's it that is all of our facts
44:17
thank you so much for listening if you'd
44:19

00:15
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish
00:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:21
qi offices in covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:24
sitting here with anna chazinski
00:26
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four favorite
00:32
facts from the last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order here we go
00:37
starting with you
00:38
jacinsky my fact this week is that tibet
00:41
is suffering from a shortage of butter
00:42
sculptors
00:44
are they yeah this is people who make
00:46
sculptures out of butter
00:48
when you say shortage it means they must
00:49
have some of them still they do have
00:51
some but they must need a lot of them
00:53
i'm not sure that's the case because if
00:54
you had none you could still have a
00:55
shortage it would just be an extremely
00:57
severe shortage
00:58
i think i think that's when it starts
01:00
being called an absence yes
01:01
yeah yeah so buttersculpting in tibet
01:05
is very popular and it goes back a
01:07
really long way and it's part of
01:09
their buddhist celebrations and so in
01:11
the uh
01:12
biggest tibetan buddhist festival which
01:14
is called the monlam festival
01:16
then the largest day of it is uh like
01:19
the day when they light all these butter
01:20
lamps and they make all these butter
01:22
sculptures
01:22
and it's a way of celebrating buddha and
01:25
buddha's victories
01:26
yeah because he sounds a bit like butter
01:28
it's exactly because i can't believe
01:30
it's not buddha
01:31
yeah i i wanted to laugh but and i was
01:34
laughing really hard inside there
01:37
it's got everything it's kind of had
01:39
everything the reason i didn't laugh at
01:40
it is because there is no such thing as
01:42
i can't believe it's not butter anymore
01:43
that's true they changed it
01:45
yeah they changed the name to i can't
01:46
believe it's so good
01:48
for everything what i'm not sure it is
01:51
good for everything is it no no it's not
01:53
as versatile as they're claiming but
01:54
they might they're building
01:55
houses it's good for building statues
01:57
yeah well i can't believe is salt butter
02:00
yeah maybe i don't think that's the
02:01
reason you didn't laugh
02:11
because when you said it that was what
02:13
was going through my brain right rather
02:15
than
02:15
what a great job so they um specifically
02:18
use
02:19
yak butter as opposed to uh cow milk is
02:22
that different
02:23
is it more like muscle it's it's yes
02:25
exactly it's a solid substance yeah it's
02:27
it's a lot thicker
02:28
is it uh yak butter generally is
02:31
used for most things in tibet i was
02:34
talking to my auntie bettina
02:36
she lived in tibet and i and i as a
02:37
child i went to tibet uh in 1994
02:40
and it was my friend's birthday up there
02:42
and we had a yak cheesecake it was made
02:44
from yak butter and yak cheese
02:46
it was the hot we couldn't get the knife
02:47
into it it was so hard
02:49
the chef was experimenting with new uses
02:51
of yak for
02:52
these southern western meals so they
02:54
also had yak pizza that they were trying
02:56
to work on as well
02:57
which was using yak butter as well um
03:00
but yeah so when you say it's used for
03:01
most things i think that is a bit like i
03:03
can't believe it's not butter saying it
03:05
can be used
03:06
for everything slightly i mean do you
03:07
ride on yak butter well they
03:09
according to bettina my auntie she said
03:11
that it would be used in place of say
03:13
blue tack so i guess like yak tank
03:16
um do they use it medicinally
03:20
they use it as moisturizer okay yep and
03:22
they also my auntie said people used to
03:24
use it and she did as well as a barrier
03:26
because the winds
03:27
would be so painfully cold as they were
03:30
hitting your face that it was a sort of
03:32
sort of like masking device to stop the
03:34
cold wind from
03:35
sound like there's a balaclava yeah
03:37
exactly it's like a moisturizer
03:38
balaclava sometimes though a lot of a
03:40
slice of bread will blow into your face
03:42
and it'll stick there and then if
03:44
another one hits
03:44
way you turn it into a sample the real
03:46
risk that you'll be picked up and eaten
03:49
they use it for their main tea as well
03:51
yak butter tea
03:52
is a traditional drink is it nice i
03:55
didn't i didn't have it when i was up
03:57
there
03:57
i think i've had butter tea is it
04:00
i'm sure there's some fermenting process
04:01
that goes on yeah i never made it
04:04
rancid or a well they put yak poo
04:06
in it because the way that
04:07
they do they do because the way they get
04:09
the tea is off a block of
04:10
uh tea what do they do they give you
04:12
some yank butter tea and they go would
04:14
you like poo with that
04:15
yeah oh just half a pound but we're the
04:18
same because i
04:19
always when i have a cup of tea i put a
04:21
bit of a cow manure in there
04:24
what it says is that to bind the tea
04:26
particles together because they will be
04:28
chopping they're scraping the the tea
04:30
off a compressed block of tea and it
04:31
would be all bitty in too much it feels
04:33
like your auntie is setting you up for a
04:35
really
04:36
good practical joke when you go there
04:38
yeah that's true yeah
04:39
she she gave me so much information and
04:41
she said as well by the way her name
04:43
bettina is an anagram of
04:44
uh tibetan which is quite cool oh wow um
04:47
yeah and she said just yesterday they
04:48
moved house they have a folding table
04:50
that they had in tibet when they were
04:51
living there and they haven't unpacked
04:52
it
04:53
for many years it still smells of yak
04:55
butter wow because they used to just
04:57
have blobs of it on there i don't know
04:58
why
05:00
um so butter has been used medicinally
05:02
in the past hasn't it and they used to
05:04
think i was reading this in a book
05:05
called a history of food
05:07
and it didn't give a specific date it
05:09
just said until quite recently
05:11
it was thought that if you put a pot of
05:12
butter next to a sick person it would
05:14
absorb their disease
05:16
and they would recover you do get people
05:18
putting butter on bruises
05:19
that's the thing is that yeah the
05:21
ancient egyptians used it
05:23
okay they would put a bit of butter on a
05:25
bruise with some powdered mummy
05:27
really yeah why were they using powdered
05:30
mummy i think they just had a lot of
05:31
mummy to use up
05:32
right it's like oh we've got so much
05:34
rosemary we'll have rosemary and
05:35
everything
05:37
i was reading an article by um that
05:40
interviewed elaine
05:41
kosrova who's a historian of butter and
05:44
she thinks that it was like a magical
05:46
holy thing
05:47
because no one really knew how it was
05:48
made sure i mean so
05:50
you would get some milk and you put it
05:52
in some animal skin or something like
05:54
that and then the right kind of bacteria
05:56
would have to be there for it to churn
05:57
and turn into butter
05:58
but quite often it wouldn't work and
06:00
people wouldn't know why it wasn't
06:01
working
06:02
and so sometimes it works sometimes it
06:04
didn't and they thought it was magical
06:05
for that reason
06:06
oh really oh that's so in uh in iceland
06:10
i think they um icelandic people used to
06:12
pray to the god of
06:14
blacksmiths for better butter because in
06:16
a similar way they didn't know how it
06:18
was made and they thought it was like
06:19
gold
06:20
because it just had that gold goldy
06:22
shine um and so they thought let's pray
06:24
to the guy who's responsible for metal
06:25
because he'll sort out our butter
06:27
shortages i can't believe it's not
06:28
better
06:30
yeah you're really pushing this job
06:32
you'll be a surprise
06:34
to one of these moments do you know
06:37
where else they have
06:38
the big butter uh statuary industry is
06:42
massive in america yeah i didn't know
06:44
about it i don't know about this and
06:45
everyone in america watching us will
06:46
know
06:47
absolutely about it huge lots of statues
06:51
sorry right state farms and state fairs
06:53
and things and they always have
06:54
massive butter sculptures and they had
06:57
well there's one woman who
06:58
uh just recently retired she did it for
07:00
50 years
07:01
in iowa every year she just made a cow
07:03
out of butter cool
07:04
and they reused the butter as well what
07:07
to eat or for
07:08
more strawberries from all statues in
07:12
between so they don't have to use
07:13
another
07:13
you know 100 kilos of butter to make a
07:16
cow wow
07:17
this started in the 1800s in america
07:19
where they would
07:20
make things not just out of butter but
07:22
out of lots of foodstuffs
07:24
so they were making loads and loads of
07:26
foods because the land was so good for
07:27
growing
07:28
and there was one where they have this
07:30
thing called cereal architecture
07:32
where someone made a palace out of corn
07:34
and grass and stuff like that
07:37
they made a liberty bell out of oranges
07:40
uh and they made a life-size
07:41
night out of prunes it's like a weird
07:44
childhood fantasy world
07:46
i think it's to kind of show off that
07:48
they've got all this amazing all these
07:49
juices
07:50
yeah we've got so many prunes we can
07:53
waste some of them by making them into a
07:54
night
07:55
yeah yeah because the person who started
07:58
it i think was a woman called caroline
07:59
shark
08:00
brooks who was this really famous
08:02
sculptor in america
08:04
and um so she displayed her sculptures
08:06
at the world fair
08:07
she uh she has this one called dreaming
08:09
i length which if you look it up it's
08:11
really beautiful
08:12
how did she get them to the world fair
08:14
would she stop down there
08:16
or she scored them there and the problem
08:18
was she
08:19
she wanted to use her kind of butter and
08:20
she had to get it all the way to europe
08:22
because welfare was in paris i think
08:24
yeah but the problem was she couldn't
08:26
keep it cool
08:27
so she needs to find a boat with enough
08:29
ice in it yeah so she eventually found
08:31
when it took her ages she got it onto
08:33
this boat got all the butter over
08:35
at like a hundred kilos of butter got
08:37
there and the welfare had already
08:38
finished
08:39
no i thought you said she showed it at
08:42
the world fair
08:44
it was a different one for something did
08:47
it go off yeah
08:48
the fair no the butter that she had once
08:50
she well i don't know what they did with
08:52
it once she got there
08:53
i can't believe it's not bitter um
08:56
anyway you know yak milk should actually
08:59
be called
09:00
neck milk um well the yak is a male
09:03
yeah the neck is the female
09:11
[Laughter]
09:16
[Applause]
09:20
time for fact number two and that is my
09:21
fact my fact this week is that you can
09:23
email
09:24
any one of the 70 000 trees in melbourne
09:27
australia
09:28
okay cool an individual email to any one
09:31
of those 70 000 trees have you done so i
09:34
have not no i'd rather think you should
09:36
have done
09:36
what do people have though so what
09:38
happens is this was a project that was
09:39
set up in 2013
09:41
the idea was that every single tree got
09:43
its own id number
09:44
because they wanted to if you lived near
09:46
this tree and you saw it being
09:47
vandalized or you saw that it was
09:49
um in any way dying you could report
09:51
this tree by sending an email to the
09:53
tree and then someone would pick it up
09:55
report the tree it just sounds like the
09:56
tree's in trouble my tree is in trouble
09:58
wrong
09:59
well yeah do they call it tree male or
10:01
they should do yeah but they
10:02
as far as i know they don't no and this
10:05
was this is a project called the urban
10:07
forest visual project
10:08
and they set this up back in 2013.
10:11
instead of calling it tree mail
10:12
they called it what the urban forest
10:14
visual i think they need some help
10:19
they uh set it up it was set up back in
10:22
i believe 2013 so it's been around for a
10:24
long time and what ends up happening is
10:25
very occasionally
10:27
someone from a big newspaper or a big
10:29
online
10:30
magazine finds out about this and then
10:32
they write an article and then people
10:34
start flooding the trees with emails
10:37
so but how do they deliver the emails to
10:39
the trees yeah they print them out
10:41
that's pretty messed up
10:41
yeah that's pretty weird that's like
10:43
sending into the tree yeah that's like
10:45
sending like getting
10:46
a ransom and sending someone their
10:47
friend's body part and writing the
10:49
ransom notes like getting a flap of skin
10:51
saying hello i think you're great
10:52
written on it yeah
10:53
you're all skin well but then that's
10:55
isn't it like trying to heal a bruise by
10:57
dropping some powdered u on it yeah yeah
11:00
you're right no we don't
11:01
always got three of them um but yeah so
11:05
the idea is they each have this
11:06
individual id number and people do send
11:08
them emails uh there's one
11:09
uh that was that says my dearest olmus
11:12
as i was leaving saint mary's college
11:14
today i was struck not by a branch but
11:15
by your radiant beauty
11:17
you must get these messages all the time
11:19
you're such an attractive that's very
11:20
creepy though
11:21
that's a bit odd yeah like if i got that
11:23
email and they substituted tree for
11:24
human i think i'd be pretty creeped out
11:26
actually and imagine how freaked out
11:27
you'd be if you were literally rooted
11:29
into the ground so you can't even run
11:30
away
11:31
can you get a restraining order as a
11:33
tree because i think they should invest
11:34
in some of those well maybe they do
11:36
maybe or maybe
11:36
maybe uh the restraining order is
11:38
against someone who's graffitied the
11:39
tree
11:40
yeah imagine if someone came up and
11:41
wrote a love letter on your body when
11:43
you've never even met them
11:44
imagine if someone tattooed into you
11:46
that they liked somebody else
11:54
i've got a tattoo on my shoulder saying
11:55
danny fought emma forever
11:58
but then also you could go even further
12:00
and say imagine if someone took your
12:02
body
12:02
pulped it up added water squashed it
12:04
down and then got a pen and wrote a love
12:06
letter on you and then sent it through
12:08
the post
12:09
yeah yeah i'd be happy that
12:12
i'd had a new life as a different form
12:15
it's like being reincarnated isn't it
12:16
every tree is reincarnated
12:19
as a book it's a book yeah that you can
12:21
look at it that's like saying that you
12:22
get reincarnated as a corpse
12:26
i don't get used as a corpse i think you
12:28
need to be used in order for it to be
12:30
reincarnation don't you if you were used
12:32
to that
12:32
i thought that you come back to life i
12:33
thought that's the whole point of real
12:35
connection yeah it is yeah
12:36
not that there
12:40
your skeleton to medical science and
12:42
they use it in classrooms and
12:43
universities yeah i've been reincarnated
12:45
as a teaching assistant
12:48
um but they have been these trees have
12:49
been mainly getting non-helpful
12:51
environmental emails and just love
12:53
letters from people haven't they they
12:54
have yeah all really
12:55
self-involved letters so uh there is one
12:57
that's um
12:58
singing isn't supposed to be about the
12:59
trees but um someone wrote dear green
13:01
leaf elm
13:02
i have exams coming up and i should be
13:04
busy studying you do not have exams
13:06
because you are a tree
13:07
i don't think there's much more to talk
13:08
about as we don't have a lot in common
13:10
you being a tree and such but i'm glad
13:11
we're in this together
13:12
cheers f she signed off and then a few
13:15
days later another email came through oh
13:17
sorry when she did
13:18
f do you think that's what she actually
13:19
got in her exams
13:21
[Laughter]
13:24
um we she hadn't got the exam the
13:25
results yet obviously because she was
13:27
still taking the exams
13:28
but she did then send a follow-up saying
13:30
hello greenlee film
13:31
it's me again bracket f i just got my
13:34
marks for last semester back
13:36
on a definitely completely unrelated
13:37
note how do you deal with the constant
13:39
relentlessly soul-crushing pain of
13:40
disappointment after disappointment
13:42
that characterizes our life on earth you
13:44
must be very old right so i thought you
13:45
might know
13:46
so i think maybe she did get an f yeah
13:48
yeah that sounds like it
13:49
sounds like it but the thing is well i
13:52
just think she's got a very high opinion
13:53
of herself if she thinks she's the only
13:55
person in the world
13:56
with an f as an initial you remember me
14:09
[Music]
14:15
wrote well the well i'll refer you to
14:16
the guardian the guardian wrote to
14:19
uh ginkgo maidenhead tree uh in fitzroy
14:21
gardens
14:22
and it replied saying dear oliver thank
14:25
you for your lovely words
14:26
i am very well enjoy your day you'll
14:28
sincerely three one four four one seven
14:31
two four
14:32
well that is going against council
14:33
regulations actually because
14:35
the guy who called mr woods who's
14:37
running this campaign
14:39
yeah that's true he's called mr woods
14:41
that's great you got a problem with that
14:42
no
14:43
that's astonishing i wrote that down and
14:44
didn't know
14:45
[Laughter]
14:47
whenever you try and visit him in his
14:48
office you can't see him for all the
14:50
trees
14:54
um so mr woods um said
14:58
that while these emails are highly
14:59
amusing the team remains
15:01
vigilant in making sure they only reply
15:03
to authentic requests
15:04
which it sounds like that wasn't because
15:06
as you said the whole point of this
15:08
project was that it would be no cost to
15:09
the council
15:10
so they can't be wasting taxpayers money
15:12
spending their entire time replying to
15:13
these mouths well that's true i've got
15:14
an example here where someone wrote
15:16
a willow leaf peppermint tree id1357982
15:20
said hello mr willow leaf peppermint or
15:22
should i say mrs
15:24
willow leaf peppermint do trees have
15:25
genders regards
15:27
the tree wrote back saying hello i am
15:29
not a mr or mrs as i have what is called
15:31
perfect flowers that include both
15:32
genders in my flower structure
15:34
kind regard mr and mrs willow leaf
15:37
peppermint brackets same tree
15:38
so they do send back stuff about uh
15:41
education
15:41
yeah is that the whole point of this
15:43
then is it an educational tool no i
15:45
think maybe the replies will be but it's
15:46
genuinely for the fact that they want to
15:48
use uh citizen reporters
15:50
for the maintenance of their so actually
15:53
yeah most of the trees in melbourne are
15:54
going to die of old age over the next 20
15:56
years or so about 40 percent and so they
15:58
need to replace them and maintain them
15:59
on the
16:00
ones they've got quite clearly so what
16:01
you do is they have a map and
16:03
it shows all the trees in melbourne so
16:05
if you're walking through melbourne and
16:06
you see a tree that's damaged and you
16:07
click on the icon all it does is it
16:08
sends an email
16:09
to the council and the subject line is
16:11
information about
16:13
tree that's what i said and they're all
16:14
the little icons are either red amber or
16:17
green aren't they and the red ones are
16:18
the ones that are going to die soon oh
16:19
really yeah because the atlantic article
16:22
i read about this story said that this
16:24
is obviously
16:24
um ways for people to sort of get you
16:26
invested in
16:28
things in your in your country or in
16:29
your city that have problems in hawaii
16:31
they have
16:32
uh tsunami sirens and they have an adopt
16:34
a siren
16:36
thing so you go to a map you see where
16:37
you live next to one you get sent a
16:39
photo of it every christmas
16:41
exactly yeah doing so well still
16:43
flashing
16:44
yeah you go you test it and stuff you
16:46
have to sort of be responsible to make
16:47
sure that the maintenance of it is still
16:49
okay
16:50
i thought you didn't have to i looked on
16:52
the website and said if you choose to
16:53
it's called adopt a thing
16:55
right thing and they say if you choose
16:58
to adopt a thing you're under no
16:59
obligation
16:59
and have no responsibility to actually
17:01
report problems with the thing wait so
17:03
what are you doing
17:04
for it i think you just give a bit of
17:05
just give money uh right and you get to
17:07
say
17:07
yeah you get to say in parties i adopted
17:09
a tsunami warning
17:10
yeah it's pretty cool but the thing is
17:13
if not if the place gets hit and you
17:14
didn't
17:16
give a warning that's true yeah then
17:18
you're kind of well it's not that you
17:19
has to give the warning
17:21
i guess you're relying on the sirens
17:22
yeah it's not like a job swap
17:24
where you go and stand on the coast
17:26
looking worried
17:27
the siren goes to the party what's your
17:30
name
17:32
[Laughter]
17:34
so on inanimate objects yeah and sort of
17:37
personifying them and getting into
17:38
contact with them there has been a study
17:39
done recently which shows that if you
17:41
are lonely
17:42
you are more likely to see inanimate
17:44
objects as being human-like
17:47
hello mr cushion or whatever right but
17:50
these microphones really do very closely
17:52
resemble
17:53
a beautiful man i think don't you think
17:55
sure yeah
17:56
beautiful man yeah is it that you're
17:58
lonely so you
18:00
make inanimate objects more human or is
18:03
it that you're the kind of person who
18:04
makes inanimate objects human
18:06
and so you are automatically a loner
18:09
well i was asking my fridge about this
18:11
theory
18:13
uh no is i think it's that if you don't
18:15
have human relationships
18:17
you're more likely to name your mugs but
18:20
what i'm saying is it's possible that
18:21
it's the other way around
18:22
well then it's just
18:23
self-self-perpetuating i guess so once
18:26
you do that you get stuck in a cycle
18:27
don't you
18:28
you've got your mug mates you don't need
18:29
people anymore yeah
18:31
i mean it is obviously a thing isn't it
18:33
i mean castaway with wilson
18:34
the volleyball oh yeah remember yeah yes
18:37
it's exactly like that
18:38
if he had been there with 50 or 60 other
18:40
people he probably wouldn't have done
18:42
the volleyball thing
18:43
that would have been and then he would
18:44
have been a real weirdo in that film if
18:45
he had painted
18:46
players on the rival despite having a
18:48
thriving society but then weirdly he
18:50
probably would have been outcast from
18:51
the society
18:52
and then he would needed to personify
18:54
the volleyball yeah you're right
18:56
i wonder what teddy's for because i'm
18:58
very close to my teddies um
19:00
maybe closer than i am to most people
19:01
but i don't think that counts me as like
19:03
a person well you wouldn't think that
19:05
would you
19:06
but then people like me would think yes
19:08
that is weird well i think you're weird
19:11
well for liking women okay so i guess
19:14
we all have our weird friend elections
19:17
judgmental but my wife is definitely a
19:19
real person
19:20
oh you've thought that for years haven't
19:22
you it's time to break the news to you
19:24
she's just a coat rack
19:25
[Laughter]
19:29
i mean she does wear coats very well
19:34
did you know that in the 1800s then a
19:36
lot of americans lived
19:38
in trees did they yeah
19:42
no inside trees inside trees
19:45
yeah wow i'd say that's technically
19:47
still a tree house
19:48
oh yeah it's true i suppose it is but
19:50
they need to rebrand themselves actually
19:52
well they did and they called themselves
19:54
stump houses well the houses didn't call
19:55
themselves that they didn't call
19:56
themselves anything they're just stumps
19:58
well i actually think they have a bit of
20:00
humanity to them
20:01
actually they had because they turned
20:03
them into houses so you know houses look
20:05
like a face because the window's at the
20:06
top and then
20:07
i've never seen that but then i'm not
20:09
lonely okay
20:11
you've got your clothes right haven't
20:13
you
20:17
very sorry no
20:22
[Laughter]
20:28
so in the 19th century there was a lot
20:30
of vlogging in america
20:32
up in the up in the northwest up in
20:33
oregon and washington and then into
20:34
canada
20:35
and people would leave the stumps of the
20:37
trees they were logging because they're
20:38
not that useful because um the grain's
20:40
really uneven in the stumps i think
20:42
and then a lot of people were
20:43
immigrating to these places at the same
20:44
time
20:45
and they would kind of turn the stumps
20:48
into homes because it was very cheap so
20:49
some people lived inside
20:51
tree stumps or they turned them into
20:52
storage sheds so they became chicken
20:54
houses or pig pens
20:56
sometimes they'd modify them and make
20:57
them into dance floors apparently and
20:59
they'd have
21:01
yeah because if you stomp a big tree
21:02
stump they'd flatten it out they are
21:04
absolutely massive aren't they yeah
21:05
which which trees are these they'll be
21:06
like redwoods yeah yeah right
21:09
they'll be really big yeah yeah um you
21:11
know ants farm in trees
21:13
and have been doing so for many
21:14
thousands of years what do they farm but
21:16
proper farming
21:18
problem for cows tractors and stuff
21:22
um so they plant uh they farm fruit
21:25
crops so they found different kinds of
21:27
fruit and
21:27
they basically they plant the seeds so
21:29
they'll they'll be like a fungus or a
21:31
fruit crop growing out of the
21:33
slits and trees or the slits in bark and
21:36
they'll take that and they'll plant it
21:38
and insert it and up further up the tree
21:40
and then they'll poo on it to fertilize
21:42
it and then it grows and it's like
21:44
farmers like farmers moving on their
21:47
crops
21:48
um and as the plants grow they form
21:50
these big hollow structures that the
21:52
ants live in
21:53
so they're kind of turning their farm
21:54
also into their farm house
21:56
and they can eat it as well and then
21:58
when it creates more seeds then they
21:59
take these seeds and they go and plant
22:01
them further up the tree
22:02
and they have this permanently self
22:04
self-fulfilling farm that they run
22:06
up trees it's very cool i do know a fact
22:08
about farmers
22:10
bottoms yeah go on sure there used to be
22:12
a thing where to test whether the ground
22:14
was ready for you to plant your seeds
22:16
you'd take down your trousers and you
22:18
put your bum on the ground
22:20
and if it was too cold then you wouldn't
22:23
plant the seeds but if it was warm
22:24
enough that the ground was soft enough
22:26
and you could plant seasonally if only
22:27
other bits of the body could sense
22:28
temperature
22:31
it's a bit like kind of forget gauging
22:33
the temperature of a child's bath by
22:35
putting your elbow
22:36
it's exactly right it's not exactly like
22:38
that because you wouldn't
22:39
gaze the temperature of a child's butt
22:41
yeah it's like when i dip my ass in my
22:43
tea to see if it's water
22:49
no yak dung for me
22:52
i brought my um i've just got one thing
22:56
on emails
22:58
so um there were teams of scientists in
23:00
south carolina
23:01
uh who did a test they went through two
23:03
million emails in people's yahoo inboxes
23:06
don't know how they got access to it
23:08
i can imagine yeah but they looked at
23:10
the number of words that people sent
23:12
through their emails per year
23:14
and it equates to basically writing a
23:16
book everyone
23:18
if they use it's not a good way is it
23:21
but yeah roughly 41 368 words is what
23:24
they said that we
23:25
that's a shot it's a short shot but it's
23:27
a short book but it's a mr man book
23:29
that's not a mystery it's a bit longer
23:31
than the mister number
23:32
it's um
23:41
okay it is time for fact number three
23:43
and that is
23:44
james okay my fact this week is that the
23:46
world's hottest chili is not meant to be
23:48
eaten
23:49
it's meant to be used as an anaesthetic
23:52
is it like a one of those fable things
23:54
where it's like oh my arm really hurts
23:55
and then someone stamps on your foot
23:57
and you're like so distracted but it's
23:59
actual um
24:01
numb you basically right incredibly
24:03
incredibly strong
24:05
uh the idea is if you're allergic to
24:07
normal anesthetics then you could may be
24:09
able to use this kind of thing if you
24:11
went to dentist
24:12
it would only anaesthetize the small
24:14
amount around your tooth
24:16
so it wouldn't hit the muscles it would
24:18
only be the pain receptors
24:20
so it means that you wouldn't have that
24:21
kind of thing where you can't talk
24:22
properly yeah
24:23
um do they do they turn it into a gas or
24:25
uh or is that what they're working on
24:27
otherwise they're still working on it
24:28
right
24:28
it would be a chemical so i suppose they
24:30
would inject it yes so how is it because
24:32
obviously usually what chili does is it
24:35
ignites your pain receptors it's not
24:36
even a taste
24:37
capsaicin is something which makes you
24:39
feel pain but yet this is numbing pain
24:41
yes so um explain that james
24:46
um i don't know exactly how that works
24:48
um
24:49
but the way that capsaicin works is um
24:52
there's a channel
24:53
called trpv1 and that normally is a heat
24:57
channel
24:58
oh sorry okay
25:02
it's normally a heat channel and the um
25:04
body is tricked into thinking
25:06
that it's hot when actually it's um
25:10
kind of spicy yeah yeah it's so weird
25:13
yeah it's not
25:14
hot at all it's not hot at all no so
25:16
this
25:17
uh chili pepper yes it's called dragon's
25:19
breath it's called dragon's breath yep
25:21
and on this
25:21
scale that they have called the scoville
25:23
scale yeah it scores
25:25
2.48 million which is extremely high
25:29
yeah so what that means is because
25:31
they've done it but they do the scale by
25:33
how much diluting it needs so
25:36
if it's got 40 on the scove scoville
25:38
scale if you dilute it 40 times you will
25:41
no longer be able to detect it
25:42
if you've got one drop of this stuff and
25:44
40 drops of water you can't taste
25:46
anymore
25:46
so this and you would need 2.48 million
25:48
drops and even then you could still just
25:50
about taste it wow and for the
25:51
further so it works out how much that is
25:53
in actual water that's half a bathtub
25:55
full of water
25:56
wow oh really you put one one drop one
25:59
drop
25:59
into half a bathtub of water you can
26:02
actually you would only just
26:03
stop noticing that that means we're
26:05
effectively we're like sharks
26:07
wow yes it does effectively if if there
26:10
was an animal that had
26:11
chili sauce instead of blood yeah yeah
26:14
and it was bleeding and we were swimming
26:17
we'd be able to detect them yeah and
26:19
then attack them does that mean if you
26:20
drank one cup let's say you put the
26:22
chili into the water yeah is it
26:24
does it go across the body of the water
26:26
as in if i got a cupful away from the
26:28
bath and i drank it
26:29
i think so yeah i mean maybe maybe the
26:32
molecules would have you'd have to stir
26:33
it around
26:34
yeah if you might not if you just put it
26:35
in at that end and then you quickly
26:37
yeah yeah yeah it's a bit like
26:38
homeopathic chili this isn't it
26:40
yeah yeah it's amazing there's a guy
26:43
called wilbur scoville who developed
26:45
that
26:45
yes yeah yeah you developed the scales
26:48
yeah yeah so this is uh now officially
26:52
according to guinness world records the
26:54
hottest chile
26:56
in the world and it's taken it away from
26:58
the previous
26:59
world record holder which was called the
27:01
carolina reaper
27:03
and the carolina reaper held it for
27:04
quite a long time it was developed and
27:06
bred so i think some of these
27:08
hottest chilies are all part of a
27:10
breeding um
27:11
plan and so the yeah carolina reaper was
27:15
made by a guy
27:16
called ed curry no no
27:19
developed it and they they did a thing
27:20
he did an anniversary eating of one
27:23
for like they threw a celebration for it
27:24
so he just ate one raw
27:26
and his quote as he was eating it
27:30
sort of started normal and then he
27:32
started uh going bright red uh his face
27:34
they say was blood red
27:36
his eyes were watering he he was his
27:38
quote has a lot of dot
27:39
dots because he goes i'm
27:42
losing the ability to talk
27:45
wow that's his official quote from uh
27:47
his anniversary of the carolina reaper
27:49
it can um
27:50
make you losing it can't it yeah well it
27:52
did there was a guy called ian rothwell
27:54
who in 2013
27:55
became the first person to eat a whole
27:57
plate of the world's hottest curry
27:59
it's called the widower
28:03
the reason he did it he's a doctor um so
28:05
maybe he should have known better but
28:06
the reason he did it was that his
28:08
because
28:08
he hated all of his underpants
28:11
he didn't wear all of his underpants in
28:13
one go i think i would
28:18
do you know take your underpants down
28:19
when you go to the toilet then
28:21
yeah absolutely not don't be disgusting
28:26
don't want to ruin that toilet
28:30
um so this guy now his motivation was
28:33
that his daughter alice brought a
28:34
boyfriend home and the boyfriend told
28:36
was saying was relating the story about
28:38
him and his friends had tried this curry
28:39
and they couldn't get through more than
28:40
a couple of bites
28:41
and the dad was obviously trying to
28:42
impress this boyfriend so it's like
28:44
i bet i can do that and he did it and he
28:47
actually said it was okay
28:49
um so he said he had to take a short
28:51
break halfway through cause he felt
28:52
really sweaty and he did start
28:53
hallucinating
28:54
and people told him he started
28:55
hallucinating because he obviously can't
28:57
remember it
28:58
um but aside from a few tears in his
29:00
eyes and a short period of hallucinating
29:02
he was cool and collected and seemed to
29:03
cope very well i thought
29:04
was this not the guy who went for a walk
29:06
halfway through and started weeping and
29:08
stuff like that is that him he went for
29:09
a walk halfway through because his eyes
29:10
were watering but i don't think he was
29:12
crying with sadness he was just crying
29:13
he was probably crying with joy about
29:15
how impressed his daughter's
29:16
friend i can kind of understand that
29:19
because when i first met my
29:20
father-in-law
29:22
uh who's russians right we basically
29:25
we ended up drinking a lot of vodka
29:27
which was almost like competitive
29:30
right what did you say i bet i could
29:32
drink those three bottles of vodka
29:34
just wait sonny there was an implication
29:36
there i think which was
29:38
because in like russia and probably
29:40
everywhere if you have a shot of vodka
29:41
and you're doing it in a social way it's
29:43
basically i'm down in mind you're down
29:45
in yours kind of thing
29:46
and then it's another one and then it's
29:47
another one and then it's on the door
29:49
and then next thing i knew i was
29:50
invading ukraine
29:51
[Laughter]
29:53
you get so drunk you stuck pelina for a
29:55
hat stand
29:57
[Music]
29:59
um so the weird thing right yeah
30:02
is that birds don't have any problems
30:04
eating chilies right they have loads of
30:06
chillies often
30:07
really hot ones they're fine they don't
30:09
panic they don't lose their hands they
30:10
don't lose me
30:12
must be really impressed but
30:17
it's probably a bird
30:22
so birds hate it and that's fine but
30:24
mammals hate them
30:25
right yeah including and obviously
30:27
humans have developed the ability to
30:29
think oh actually i do quite like this
30:30
but the theory is that the plants are
30:33
using birds because the birds the
30:35
seeds go through them really fast and
30:37
the birds poo them out and they spread
30:38
the seed and it surprises the plant
30:39
whereas mammals have digestive
30:42
juices which destroy the seeds so the
30:44
plant has developed
30:46
seeds and you know little fibers and
30:48
things
30:49
which animals are heating but birds
30:51
don't yeah
30:52
okay all right maybe humans
30:56
they do it so humans like it so that
30:58
humans cultivate them
30:59
yeah um i found a couple of um spiciest
31:02
foods and drinks that use chili
31:04
in them yeah i found a bowl of vodka so
31:08
they use a chili which is the naga
31:11
yoloqia chilies have you heard of those
31:13
i've heard of the naga ones because
31:15
that's from nagar in india isn't it
31:16
right i think are they the ones that yes
31:18
i think they're from assam and they were
31:19
the hottest chili until
31:20
2007. yeah and they're a genuine hottest
31:23
chili like they've been using cooking
31:24
for hundreds
31:24
yes exactly yeah so they use that in a
31:27
vodka and they on the scoville scale
31:29
are 250 000 so they're quite far down
31:32
from
31:32
your hottest hottest ones these days
31:34
which were in the millions i believe
31:35
earlier it's quite interesting actually
31:37
because it's been really good for indian
31:38
farmers because it got that boost from
31:40
the guinness world records
31:41
and so um suddenly lots of people were
31:43
ordering in it's quite expensive
31:45
and also now they're using it in crowd
31:47
control so they've started making the
31:48
chili into a spray
31:50
um and they also farmers use it to repel
31:52
elephants because elephants aren't birds
31:54
they're mammals so they don't like it
31:55
right and so actually a lot of assam's
31:58
sorry
31:58
not
32:02
oh yeah i wonder if he he might like
32:04
chili god who knows he's really on the
32:06
cusp
32:06
because if you think about it he could
32:08
probably pollinate quite a lot
32:10
yeah or he could spread seeds couldn't
32:12
he very
32:23
great anyway that's very cool so yep
32:26
being used being used by the police
32:28
wow um yeah because pepper stray is
32:30
effectively chilly isn't it yeah
32:32
that bloke that dogs are trying to
32:34
impress his
32:35
daughter's boyfriend just wait till lucy
32:38
flies to india gets involved in a riot
32:42
simon are you watching
32:43
[Laughter]
32:45
maybe if he got shot by an arrow by the
32:47
aztecs because they used to put chili on
32:49
the end of their arrows
32:51
i read that the aztecs used to throw
32:53
chilis at their enemies and i thought
32:54
that can't possibly be right apparently
32:56
japanese ninjas did
32:58
not chillies but chili powder yes okay
33:01
that's killing powder if you're close up
33:04
because i thought it would be impossible
33:06
to get the chili into someone's mouth
33:07
from a distance yeah it's possible to
33:09
throw a malteser into someone's mouth
33:11
from a distance but don't they have to
33:12
be compliant so you have to say to your
33:15
enemy
33:15
it's just a malteser
33:19
before the battle can we take part in a
33:20
traditional ritual and see if you can
33:22
get the voltage into the enemy's mouth
33:26
[Applause]
33:28
[Music]
33:30
okay it is time for our final fact of
33:32
the show and that
33:33
is andrew hunter murray my fact is that
33:36
one of napoleon's admirals
33:38
lost three legs in battle was he um
33:41
was he an animal was like
33:45
a dog because like sometimes people give
33:47
naval ranks to animals
33:49
he was a spider uh yeah so he was still
33:52
able to lead a fulfilling career barely
33:53
noticed yeah
33:55
what uh uh his story his name was george
33:58
rene lepele
34:00
and he was a french admiral and he lost
34:02
his right leg in a battle
34:04
and then he lost his wooden leg in
34:06
another battle
34:07
and then he lost his replacement wooden
34:09
leg in another battle so
34:11
did you lose anything else no i think he
34:13
was very lucky imagine your luck
34:15
yeah that's like that's like bowling
34:17
well it's not lucky to lose your first
34:19
leg no the first
34:20
the next tool yes um and
34:23
for a while he spent his time sailing
34:25
around in a ship called the brilliant
34:28
that was so cool that's awesome that's
34:31
good that's very good
34:32
i should say this fact was uh was
34:34
originally tweeted by a guy called peter
34:35
campbell and it was sent in by ryan
34:37
goodman so thank you to both
34:38
yeah those guys another person to lose
34:41
their leg in the very same battle
34:42
was lord uxbridge um quite famously
34:46
lost i think there's it's in britain so
34:48
as i'm not i didn't grow up here i don't
34:50
know if this is a famous encounter but
34:52
when he was talking
34:53
to the duke of wellington as soon as um
34:55
and he lost it by cannonball as well
34:57
there's a line where he says by go
34:58
by godzilla i've lost my leg and then
35:00
the duke of wellington says my god
35:02
so you have and apparently that's a
35:04
thing that's taught in schools here did
35:05
you guys have you heard that before uh
35:06
i've heard it before but not at school
35:08
it's not a school thing it's like a it's
35:10
just an example of great british british
35:13
yeah uh restraint and stiff upper lip
35:15
yeah that blatantly
35:16
didn't happen in history um and he he
35:19
actually did something that seemed to be
35:20
quite common he buried his leg or his
35:22
leg was buried yeah in the garden where
35:24
it was cut off and a little tombstone
35:26
was erected
35:26
wasn't it yeah and that seemed to be
35:28
quite a common thing so a few people did
35:30
this
35:30
um it's said that that's where the
35:32
original inspiration for
35:34
one foot in the grave came from yep
35:35
that's obviously not true
35:38
pretty sure that would be when you're in
35:40
the grave both your feet are in there so
35:42
it's
35:42
you're almost in there yes but why no
35:45
but you'd say
35:46
both feet and all my body and stuff in
35:48
the grave right when you are there
35:50
so it doesn't make sense to say one foot
35:51
in the grave if it's if you buried your
35:54
leg yeah
35:54
yeah but then why not one leg in the
35:56
grave that's a very good point yeah
35:58
i'll i'll have a chat with myself about
36:01
the origins of that
36:02
later but they did there was a thing so
36:03
he they got in a big row basically
36:05
over the leg because the family who
36:07
owned the house where the leg had been
36:08
left and buried
36:09
made a little living from displaying it
36:12
to people and showing it around
36:13
and then six years later his son visited
36:16
the house he thought i'd
36:17
visit my father's leg and uh he was
36:19
horrified to discover supposedly that it
36:21
was sticking out of the ground because
36:22
it had been unearthed by a stall
36:24
a really bad
36:32
yeah like the foot at least would be
36:33
yeah that's true it's
36:35
closed and that's where the phrase one
36:36
foot out of the grave
36:38
originated my father's leg back because
36:42
you've really
36:43
made a hash of looking after it so i'm
36:45
gonna and they said no we want
36:46
compensation
36:47
and they didn't let him have it and uh
36:49
there was a
36:51
you know there was a pass between them
36:53
and then eventually they just kept hold
36:54
of it and then in 1932 supposedly they
36:57
burned it
36:57
they burned it just so that he could
36:59
never get hold of it out of spite
37:01
i don't know i don't think so because
37:03
that was even like 60 years after
37:05
even the initial row which was six years
37:07
after but you're just burning bone right
37:09
can you burn bone
37:10
i don't know i don't know that's the
37:12
story do we know why they
37:14
did that like like as in obviously they
37:16
were i can see what we're saying they're
37:17
doing grand gestures towards the
37:19
to the legs but why did people bury
37:21
their it was i think it was partly
37:23
because
37:24
um it was to show how important they are
37:26
and this thing is so vital and also
37:28
because it was quite a mark of
37:29
pride in the 19th century i think during
37:32
the civil war and the revolutionary wars
37:33
if you lost a leg that showed you
37:35
already ma'am so it was more for
37:36
um veterans of war as opposed to
37:39
it was never it would have been this was
37:41
never a big thing oh okay it's just a
37:42
handle
37:43
okay yeah because you were celebrating
37:45
the end of your leg it's where the word
37:47
legend comes from legend
37:49
yeah that is true yeah is it
37:52
yeah well we'll leave you to work that
37:54
out let's have a little bit of googling
37:56
after this show why don't we
37:59
oh i so believe it
38:02
do you know what so this is this is
38:04
something that's very cool do you know
38:05
why flamingos are so stable on one leg
38:07
because you always see flamingos
38:08
standing on one leg
38:09
always yeah you do yeah you do yeah so
38:12
scientists
38:13
is it because they're used to it no oh
38:15
cause you would think because they do it
38:16
all the time
38:17
yeah i'm sure they are used to it but
38:19
that's not the reason that
38:20
they're because they are they welded
38:22
onto a platform
38:23
yeah they're all laurel elements yeah
38:26
yeah
38:26
um no it's not that what is it okay i'll
38:30
tell you
38:30
so a couple of biologists uh they're
38:32
called young hui chang and lina ting
38:34
they've studied this just now right and
38:35
they were trying to work out why
38:37
flamingos are so stable or rather how
38:38
they're so stable yeah and
38:40
um they discovered this by writing to
38:43
some zoos
38:44
and doing experiments on flamingos
38:47
and they would put them on a little
38:49
plate right and they'd measure the
38:50
forces that the flamethrowers
38:51
would put down on the plate to see how
38:53
it's adjusting and then they wrote to
38:55
another zoo which just had a couple of
38:56
flamingos which had died
38:58
and they said can we have your flamingos
38:59
please and then they
39:01
propped the flamingo up on one leg this
39:04
dead flamingo
39:04
and they found that its leg locks
39:06
perfectly right
39:08
just on one leg and they're more stable
39:09
on one leg than they are on two
39:11
when the flamingo stands on one leg
39:13
somehow all of its tendons
39:14
slot right into place and it can just
39:16
stay like that for ages
39:18
why couldn't they lock both legs
39:20
directly in place
39:21
and then stand exactly absolutely so
39:23
what's the advantage
39:24
in only standing on one leg sometimes
39:26
they're standing in cold water
39:28
and they may not want to lose heat he
39:29
eats through both legs
39:31
isn't that right isn't it also that they
39:33
don't want both feet to be
39:35
frozen in ice sometimes i've read that
39:38
i've also read once that
39:39
they said that they have it so that
39:41
there's fewer legs for fish to bash into
39:45
yeah there's just no one telling which
39:47
of these is more or less plausible
39:48
they're all very plausible
39:49
like say if you're in a battle and there
39:51
are cannonballs flying everywhere and
39:53
you're
39:53
standing on one leg the whole time then
39:55
you're less likely to get your leg
39:57
got it so it's not to stop the fish from
39:58
hurting themselves it's to stop their
40:00
legs
40:00
yeah i think that's it yeah okay okay i
40:02
believe that one
40:03
okay well all right i've got one last
40:05
thing cannonball
40:07
war and so this is not about legs it's
40:09
about uh hands
40:10
there's a guy who was a knight in
40:12
germany in the 1500s called
40:14
gots and we know him as guts of the iron
40:17
hand have i told you about this guy
40:18
before
40:19
gods of the iron hand was this badass
40:22
knight he was amazing and during battle
40:24
when he had originally both of his hands
40:27
um
40:28
there's two theories one that a
40:29
cannonball sound freaked
40:31
him out shocked him slightly and he lost
40:33
control of his massive sword and the
40:34
sword went back and he chopped off his
40:36
own hand
40:37
the second theory unlikely unlikely the
40:39
second theory is that a cannonball took
40:40
it off
40:41
more likely yes so um what happened is
40:43
that they replaced his hand
40:45
with um a prosthetic hand which was made
40:47
out of iron so he became guts of the
40:49
iron hand
40:50
and it had uh sort of joints in it so
40:52
that the knuckles could hold the stirrup
40:54
of the horse that he was riding that
40:55
could hold around the sword
40:57
and he was so famous that he published
40:59
an autobiography and it was
41:00
translated into a play by goethe who
41:04
wrote
41:04
this whole play about gods of the iron
41:07
hand which is still published in germany
41:09
very famous
41:10
and there's a line in it which is
41:11
thought to be either real or just goethe
41:14
was inspired by this sort of badass
41:16
nature
41:16
which is the most famous line in the
41:18
whole play which in english is
41:19
translated as
41:20
tell him he can kiss my ass and that is
41:23
still a slang
41:24
uh put down in germany today especially
41:28
as a direct uh derivative of gods of the
41:31
iron hands
41:42
end the show
41:50

you

=168
00:14
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:21
covent garden
00:22
also coming to you from the morning
00:24
after the 2017 british general election
00:27
my name is dan shriver i'm sitting here
00:29
with anna chazinski james harkin and
00:31
andrew hunter murray
00:33
andrew hunter murray so i'm tired andrew
00:37
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:38
here with anna chazinski james harkin
00:41
and andrew hunter murray and once again
00:43
we have gathered around the microphones
00:44
with our four
00:45
favorite facts from the last night
00:48
the evening of the election uh and in no
00:51
particular order here we go
00:53
hey dan you sound a bit tired i'm very
00:56
tired try and spot which one of us
00:58
stayed up the latest in the longest well
01:00
the problem was is that i didn't watch
01:02
it on tv
01:02
i think all of us stayed up watching it
01:05
on tv you made the mistake of watching
01:06
it on plus one so you got even less
01:08
sleep than the rest of us i watched it
01:09
on my iphone in bed
01:11
with the lights off my my left eye which
01:13
did all the watching because my right
01:15
eye was in a pillow
01:16
is really twitching right now but
01:18
because it's on the left it'll be very
01:19
happy with the result
01:23
okay starting with fact number one and
01:25
that is anna yeah my fact
01:27
is the really relevant to this result
01:29
fact um
01:30
all forfeited election deposits go
01:33
straight to the queen
01:34
and this is just a thing i found out i
01:36
was reading the electoral commission
01:38
guide for returning offices
01:41
um you do in an exciting time like this
01:42
you got to do exciting things
01:44
and um yeah there was just a rule in it
01:46
so it's like for returning officers so
01:48
for anyone internationally listening
01:50
returning officers are the people who
01:51
are responsible in every constituency
01:53
for like organizing
01:54
and announcing the election and this is
01:56
the long
01:57
guide as to exactly how they go about
01:59
doing that the what it says in the guide
02:01
is
02:01
if a candidate does not poll more than
02:03
five percent of the total number of
02:05
valid votes cast that deposit will be
02:07
forfeited
02:08
you must send any forfeited deposits to
02:10
her majesty
02:11
uh so the deposits are 500 pounds the um
02:13
mp
02:14
that people put up if they want to be an
02:15
mp again for international listeners
02:17
um and then if you get under five
02:19
percent you fall for the deposit but i
02:20
didn't realize it went her majesty i
02:21
can't find anything else about this
02:23
online it's amazing though so in 2010
02:25
ukip alone lost 229 000 pounds in
02:29
deposits
02:30
no way the green party lost 163
02:34
500 pounds no wonder the queen's so rich
02:36
yeah no
02:37
in 2010 there was about a million pounds
02:39
in lost deposits that is a lot
02:41
it is a lot the idea of this deposit is
02:43
to stop frivolous
02:45
campaigns isn't it yeah and it does a
02:46
very good job i think
02:48
the monster raving looney party would
02:49
agree in 1983
02:51
they had a look at this the home of
02:52
first committee to see um if it was
02:54
you know if it was too much and if it
02:56
was stopping poorer people from running
02:58
and they kind of thought well maybe it
02:59
is but actually it's worth it because
03:01
for your 500 quid even if you lose you
03:04
get free postage for your campaign
03:06
address
03:07
and you get free use of buildings for
03:09
public meetings and you get a great deal
03:11
of publicity they said
03:12
so almost the 500 quid is worth it and
03:14
they actually recommended it should be
03:16
upped to a thousand pounds
03:18
oh really i thought it never was i might
03:20
just enter not even campaign just for
03:21
the sake of getting some publicity for
03:23
myself and some free buildings we were
03:24
gonna enter you weren't we
03:26
because you live in the same
03:26
constituency as jeremy corbyn but he did
03:29
quite well in this one didn't he so
03:30
you could have swung it i could have
03:33
aren't they saying that he did the best
03:35
that any politician has ever done well
03:38
no he didn't he didn't win
03:39
the election but in his constituency
03:42
yeah he got the highest ever vote in
03:45
islington north
03:46
wow which is the smallest constituency i
03:48
didn't know it's also mine so i had a
03:49
personal interest in that really
03:51
yeah it's the smallest place it's just
03:52
you and jesus yeah
03:54
do you know what the largest one is no
03:56
what it's ross
03:58
sky and loch arbor in scotland which is
04:00
1
04:01
632 times larger than islington north
04:04
really
04:04
yeah oh my gosh so i worked that out and
04:06
i've worked out that if jeremy corbyn's
04:09
allotment was increased by that amount
04:11
then it would be the size of the vatican
04:13
city wow
04:15
maybe it will be now i'm just on the
04:19
queen very quickly
04:20
uh so overseas uh listeners might not
04:22
know this but the queen's not allowed to
04:24
vote
04:24
in these elections she is allowed to
04:27
vote oh she just doesn't
04:28
sorry she chooses not to and and every
04:30
everyone doesn't care apathy is a real
04:32
problem in this country it goes right up
04:33
to the top
04:34
strange because she's old you know you
04:35
think she would care more yeah of course
04:37
she doesn't want the votes to go higher
04:38
because she wants those delicious money
04:53
she spends most of her time in these
04:54
periods and for the referendum and so on
04:57
just denying that she has an opinion
04:59
which i love every single royal member
05:01
just seems to spend their
05:02
whole period anytime they're mentioned
05:04
in the press in these periods
05:05
denying that what they've said is in
05:07
some way alluding to an opinion
05:08
about what way people should vote they
05:11
can have opinions on things like
05:12
ketchup or mayonnaise or you know do you
05:14
prefer a buzz cut or long hair they're
05:16
just not supposed to have political
05:17
yes no exactly not any opinion no no
05:20
obviously
05:21
you've heard of prince he charles
05:24
writes to everyone who will but these
05:26
were leaked weren't they he hasn't
05:27
openly
05:28
done that he doesn't that reminds me of
05:30
the emperor of
05:31
japan um akihito who's not allowed to
05:35
give
05:35
any opinions on politics at all not even
05:38
just in elections just never ever and
05:40
it's in the constitution that comes from
05:41
the end of the second world war
05:43
and so he wasn't allowed to abdicate he
05:44
wasn't allowed to say i want to abdicate
05:46
he had to kind of do an announcement
05:48
alluding to the fact that he might want
05:50
to
05:50
and people had to kind of infer from
05:52
what he said that he wanted to abdicate
05:54
so
05:54
wink wink stuff wow i'm pretty tired
05:58
you didn't maybe not seen that in the
05:59
news last night but they passed that he
06:01
is now
06:01
allowed to abdicate oh really yeah yeah
06:04
that was in the news last night oh i
06:05
didn't see that yeah did you see the um
06:07
just on like process weird election
06:10
electoral process
06:11
if it's a tie it comes down to a coin
06:13
toss which obviously never happens
06:15
but there was that guy in anne's
06:17
constituency so one of our colleagues
06:19
anne
06:20
um used to live up north and it's in
06:21
north east fife and
06:23
i think the person who won was an snp
06:25
candidate who won by two votes this
06:27
morning right yeah
06:28
wow two votes yeah my god
06:31
so that's just one person isn't it yeah
06:33
putting the x in the wrong box
06:35
did you guys see the green party
06:36
candidate from uh
06:38
ashfield no okay so his name's aaron
06:41
rangi
06:41
um he had to leave the count as it was
06:45
going on
06:46
because he had to get home uh to get
06:48
some sleep because he has an
06:49
a-level history exam at nine o'clock
06:51
this morning so he's 18 years old he's
06:53
the green party candidate
06:55
and it just got too late for him so he's
06:56
like i can't i can't stay for the uh the
06:58
final count
06:59
got my exam it should let you off having
07:01
a history exam if you're making history
07:03
yeah yeah as he definitely did in the
07:06
green party
07:08
yeah i think he won the seat presumably
07:10
right i have no idea no i mean we didn't
07:12
win
07:14
you know the deposit thing that we're
07:16
starting off with did you know it used
07:17
to be a lot harder
07:19
so until i think 1918
07:22
or definitely in in 1918 it was 150
07:25
pounds that you had to put up but
07:26
obviously that was a lot more money then
07:28
yeah it was about i think they've worked
07:30
it out as being about six thousand six
07:31
hundred quid
07:32
wow and you had to win twelve point five
07:34
percent of the vote otherwise you would
07:35
forfeit
07:36
your deposit so it was a much higher
07:38
barrier another place you need to get
07:40
twelve point five percent is in japan
07:42
uh and do you know how much the japanese
07:44
uh deposit is that you have to pay
07:46
no it's three million yen which is the
07:49
equivalent of twenty one thousand and
07:51
sixty four pounds
07:53
and you need twelve point five percent
07:55
but then they don't get all those
07:56
hilarious fringe candidates that can
07:57
entertain them during a tedious campaign
07:59
right
08:00
i suppose not or unless they're
08:02
extremely rich very well
08:04
yeah just another thing on on process
08:10
i really think i think process was the
08:11
big winner in this election
08:14
it was certainly what i voted for i just
08:17
wrote it in my box i love that i'm doing
08:19
this and the way i'm doing it
08:21
um so i didn't realize that actually as
08:23
long as you make your intention clear on
08:25
the ballot
08:26
paper then your vote counts so i thought
08:27
you had to do a cross or maybe a tick
08:29
um but if you draw a penis as long as
08:32
it's within the lines of the candidate
08:34
in whose box you've drawn a penis
08:36
it does count as a vote and so there was
08:38
for instance there was a tory mp
08:40
glyn davis in 2015 who uh held on to the
08:44
montgomery share constituency in wales
08:46
and he personally thanked the person who
08:48
voted for him by drawing a penis in his
08:49
box
08:51
but it sort of depends how you feel
08:52
about penises doesn't it
08:54
you're right so do you think if when
08:56
people call you a dick andy do you look
08:58
at them and think yeah but he probably
08:59
likes pieces
09:04
actually on that spoiling votes thing in
09:07
the last british election 2015
09:10
there were 97 870 spoiled votes right
09:13
the last time the gambia had an election
09:16
there were two
09:17
really two countries in the whole
09:19
country what
09:20
because the gambian voting system is
09:23
really cool it's you basically if you've
09:24
got three candidates you have three
09:26
um buckets next to each other no you've
09:28
got three barrels next to each other
09:29
and they've got a little shoot at the
09:31
top and you push you get given a marble
09:33
and you push the marble through the
09:34
little chute at the top and it rings a
09:36
bell
09:37
so everyone can hear so how do you spell
09:38
your vote though do you put your penis
09:40
in there
09:42
to spoil your vote you have to balance a
09:44
marble on top
09:46
of the barrel and only two people did it
09:48
in the whole country
09:50
yeah you're kidding that's incredible
09:53
it's a great system they've had the
09:54
system since the 60s it really works for
09:56
them but can you imagine
09:57
if you spoiled your ballot by putting
09:58
your penis in the tube
10:00
and then the electoral guy comes along
10:02
and goes do you like system
10:06
the bell keeps going
10:09
that's actually uh more akin to the word
10:11
ballot isn't it because ballot comes
10:13
from i think
10:14
a word that means little ball because it
10:15
used to be that you actually put a ball
10:18
into a box is that right i think so um
10:20
we can start
10:21
thinking about moving on yeah should we
10:22
what should we move on we probably got
10:24
anyone got more stuff to say
10:25
uh one process anna so much process
10:30
i do like that the first ballot box
10:32
she's got my own process
10:35
i know you said it in just desperately
10:36
hoping to move on look
10:38
this is a great fact guys it's not all
10:40
about this election
10:42
the first ever secret ballot when it was
10:44
introduced in the uk was in 1872
10:46
and the seal of the first ballot box was
10:49
made with a licorice stamp so there are
10:50
famous licorices in the uk that are
10:52
called pontefrack licorices
10:54
and they're like black sweets and they
10:55
have a stamp on them which says
10:56
pontefract licorice and has a picture of
10:58
pontefact castle and um when they had to
11:00
close the first ballot box in 1872 they
11:02
had to whip one over it was in
11:04
pontefract
11:05
so they got one of those stamps over
11:06
from pontefract and they stamped it with
11:08
a licorice stamp so that's really cool
11:10
that's very cool licorice logo on it
11:13
it's a good process great process guys
11:22
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:24
that is my fact
11:25
my fact this week is that only one
11:28
political party
11:29
in this 2017 election offered to do
11:31
anything
11:32
about yeti's did they get your vote
11:36
i didn't i've only found out about it
11:37
too late yeah what's the party
11:39
the party is uh goes by a number of
11:42
names
11:42
actually yeah it's uh it's sort of
11:45
formally as its main headline name known
11:47
as church of the militant elvis party
11:49
it's also known as the bus pass elvis
11:51
party
11:52
oh yeah um this year they ran under the
11:54
title elvis and the yeti himalayan
11:57
preservation party
11:58
so there is a common theme that runs
11:59
through their names yes party
12:04
yep yeah so um the guy who was running
12:07
is a guy called david bishop
12:08
um aka lord byro
12:12
and uh he was promising this year that
12:14
if they were voted in that he would do
12:16
stuff about the potential threats from
12:18
north korea
12:19
and launching missiles because if they
12:21
mislaunched a
12:22
missile in the wrong direction it might
12:24
hit tibet and harm yetis so that was uh
12:26
his protection policy that he wants to
12:29
get in on
12:30
um and he actually was stepping down he
12:32
said he was going to step down
12:33
completely and then did his own
12:35
personal u-turn on it because theresa
12:38
may called a general election when he
12:40
wasn't
12:40
he thought i'm not going to be in fit
12:43
state in a few years to come
12:45
um but then he said when he heard that
12:46
mick jagger was going on tour again this
12:48
autumn he thought okay i can run two
12:50
and so actually this um snap election
12:52
has been bad news for um these kind of
12:55
slightly unusual candidates they've not
12:57
been really able to organize things very
12:59
quickly there was a guy who had
13:01
um the rebooting democracy party he's
13:04
standing in cambridge and he's got this
13:06
idea that he wants to change democracy
13:08
make it more direct
13:09
uh he wanted to fight all 650 seats in
13:12
the election but due to the snap
13:13
election
13:14
he was only able to get into one
13:18
but his idea is um to go into sortition
13:21
which is basically that
13:22
everyone randomly gets chosen as um
13:25
an mp so rather than people becoming
13:28
career mps and deciding they want to
13:30
work their way up into parliament you
13:32
basically it's like jury duty you get
13:33
just
13:34
chosen and they did that in ancient
13:36
greece it's called their sortition
13:38
right it's quite an old type of
13:39
democracy so they put all our names in a
13:41
hat
13:42
and then they just pick it out just pick
13:44
it out and they go you're an mp
13:45
great and did that go well for ancient
13:47
greece are they still doing that today
13:49
the reason is called ancient greece
13:53
um this guy lord byro um uh
13:56
he actually 2014 in a by-election
13:59
in nottingham he got 67 votes
14:03
um part of his campaign promises were
14:06
that
14:06
he was going to try and get oaps a 30
14:09
discount at brothels um
14:12
he got more votes in that by-election
14:15
than the lib dems
14:16
is it possible that they misheard and
14:18
thought he was talking about brussels
14:21
this brothel's bureaucracy is what we
14:23
need to stand out
14:27
well here's the other thing you might
14:28
have liked him actually andy because
14:30
one of his others i'm getting on
14:34
one of his other policies was that he
14:36
wanted to protect
14:37
um public toilets from being
14:41
so why does that be like public titles i
14:42
just remember ages ago we were talking
14:44
about public toilets and you had a big
14:45
thing about your fury of the
14:47
high street public toilet being wiped
14:49
out a lot of them have been
14:50
uh cut and yeah and it is a substantial
14:53
problem for people if you're trying to
14:54
get around
14:55
you need to access to a public toilet as
14:56
loads of people do and you don't want to
14:58
go into a restaurant or a cafe or
14:59
something because often they're snippy
15:00
about letting you use their lose
15:02
and it's a massive problem that's
15:03
actually a problem exactly and the fact
15:04
that you have to pay for it a lot as
15:06
well
15:06
exactly so in some american cities they
15:08
have laws i think now that you're not
15:10
allowed to
15:11
charge for going to the toilet or at
15:12
least they're trying to get them in yeah
15:14
so it is a big big it is
15:17
on the case no one has been talking
15:18
about it in this whole campaign brexit
15:20
brexit brexit process process process
15:23
brothels brussels brothers and these
15:25
weird
15:26
candidates yeah are fantastic so
15:30
um lord buckethead has been a big
15:32
character in the election
15:33
he's incredible he or someone dressed
15:35
like him has been standing on and off
15:37
since
15:39
he 1987. stood against thatcher yeah um
15:42
and
15:42
he stood in against thatcher in 1987
15:44
with a promise to destroy birmingham
15:46
and replace it with the star base and he
15:48
studied this election
15:50
saying we should defer the decision on
15:51
whether to destroy birmingham and
15:53
replace with the star base
15:54
until 2022 at least
15:57
so you you were implying there i think
16:00
that perhaps it's not the same mr
16:01
buckethead every is it like doctor who
16:03
he kind of regenerates
16:04
i think it might be yeah there's a
16:06
chance it makes sense they should have
16:08
had more than one darth vader
16:10
you know like send you know what what
16:13
just like
16:13
you know there was only ever one darth
16:14
vader but you could just put another guy
16:16
in there
16:16
for like mine yeah i guess so yeah why
16:19
was there no like
16:21
duplicate expendable darth vader yeah
16:24
that's true he's just like the
16:25
stormtroopers yeah uh tweet from lord
16:27
buckethead
16:28
this morning 249 a new buckethead record
16:33
something to celebrate eh it's so funny
16:36
watching him
16:37
i mean it was already a horrible moment
16:38
for theresa may i think by that point
16:41
when she was standing there and what and
16:43
he was directly behind her
16:44
was it or he was oh no actually he
16:46
wasn't quite on the edge yeah he was
16:48
it wasn't as bad as tim ferran because
16:49
he had mr fish fingers stood behind him
16:51
tim
16:52
ferrand that was it okay let's explain
16:54
this for overseas listeners who wrote
16:55
this okay so like dan says we do have
16:57
these very odd fringe candidates and
16:59
some of them like to dress up
17:01
and tim ferran who's the head of the
17:02
liberal democrats who's the third
17:03
biggest party in england
17:05
knows he's ahead of like the fourth or
17:07
fifth biggest party
17:08
um he was going up which actually you
17:10
might need to explain to people in
17:11
britain as well given the state of tim
17:12
ferran's campaign
17:17
he ran against a guy called mr
17:19
fishfinger who dressed like a fish
17:20
finger
17:21
and he uh there was a man called mr
17:23
fishfinger running because
17:25
wasn't there a there was a twitter poll
17:27
so there was a twitter user called
17:28
skiplica
17:29
who just asked the question
17:32
just a normal guy first name skip second
17:36
name liquor
17:37
and he asked
17:40
we're all completely losing the do you
17:42
think that's his real name of course
17:43
it's his real name
17:44
why would it be his twitter name if it
17:46
wasn't his real name it would be a weird
17:47
thing to make up wouldn't it be
17:49
why would you anyway he asked the
17:51
question to twitter
17:52
who would you trust more mp tim farron
17:54
or fish finger and the fish fingers got
17:56
95 percent of the vote and so this guy
17:59
ran on tim ferran almost lost his
18:01
deposit in the am i more trustworthy
18:03
than a fish finger competition
18:06
but mr fish finger is amazing so if you
18:08
go on his website i wanted to count the
18:10
puns on it for this but it was going to
18:11
take me too much
18:12
time um but he ran on the pledge to hake
18:15
britain great again
18:17
um he had a manifesto in which
18:20
there was a policy document um he talks
18:23
about his own constituency
18:25
he has a list of endorsements which is
18:28
quite labor but i guess fish have a
18:29
dorsal
18:30
dorsal fin that's a big deal okay i was
18:32
just wondering we've explained all about
18:34
the
18:34
election but do we need to explain for
18:36
foreign listeners what a fish finger is
18:38
oh yeah so a fish finger
18:42
is a piece of fish with bread crumbs on
18:45
it and deep fried
18:46
and it is delicious oh that's wonderful
18:47
it's better than tim ferran
18:50
yeah and so the point is that he was
18:52
standing behind tim farren as tim farren
18:54
uh made his speech his acceptance speech
18:57
but theresa may had also had to stand
18:58
next to
18:59
head buckethead and someone
19:01
dressed as elmo yes a massive elmo
19:03
which i think only got three votes
19:05
although
19:07
absolutely buckethead wiped the floor
19:09
with him then
19:11
bucket had absolutely destroyed elmo at
19:12
the selection well with a bucket for a
19:14
head he can do a lot of wiping i suppose
19:16
he mopped the floor with him
19:21
um so i think we did a fact before on
19:23
this podcast about people who got no
19:24
votes in a general election
19:26
but it was before the rules were changed
19:28
and then you were allowed to vote for
19:29
yourself
19:29
but i think someone has got just one
19:32
vote a guy called um
19:33
rainbow george weiss who stood
19:36
in 13 different constituencies at one
19:39
election before they changed the rules
19:40
you can really only stand in one
19:41
election uh one constituency and
19:44
he stands for the vote for yourself
19:45
rainbow dream ticket party
19:47
and he won in 2005 in cardiff north he
19:49
got one vote and it wasn't from him
19:51
either because he wasn't registered in
19:52
that constituency
19:54
like paul nuttall paul russell didn't
19:56
vote for himself did he not because he's
19:58
not registered in the constituency where
20:00
he was standing
20:00
really paul not all you mean ex ukip
20:03
leader because
20:04
as we came in here he resigned didn't he
20:06
that's true yeah the caretaker
20:08
between farage leader of the um
20:11
yeah did you know um i think winston
20:13
churchill couldn't vote for himself in
20:14
the 1945 election
20:15
really yeah so um there was uh
20:25
it was a bureaucratic cock-up so there
20:27
was a lot of disorganization because it
20:29
was the end of the war people had bigger
20:30
fish to fry and they didn't have enough
20:31
ballot papers
20:35
um so you had to use your ration card as
20:37
your ballot paper to prove who you were
20:39
and he just wasn't registered
20:41
and so he rocked up and didn't have a
20:43
legal vote that's pretty bad after
20:44
you've defeated fascism
20:46
it's also there's
20:49
you've got to respect it um did you know
20:51
that the uh joint leader of the green
20:53
party so the green party
20:55
has to dual leadership and one of the
20:57
leaders is this guy called jonathan
20:58
bartley
20:59
and he's also a drummer for a blues band
21:01
called the mustangs
21:02
who've reached number five in the itunes
21:04
blues chart wow
21:05
and they were nominated in 2010 for best
21:08
band of the british blues awards
21:10
and i've listened to them and they're
21:11
genuinely really good really
21:13
yeah really fun to listen to so well
21:15
done jonathan uh just speaking of green
21:17
but in the drug sense
21:18
uh green uh mr biro lord biro
21:22
as well um he once uh wanted to
21:24
nationalize uh marijuana cannabis
21:27
and he wanted to call it british grass
21:29
very
21:30
good yeah i'm just on process anna
21:34
if you are high on drugs or indeed drunk
21:37
they can't stop you from voting
21:38
oh yeah the queen
21:43
and um also if you're wearing a bucket
21:45
on your head or something like that they
21:46
can't stop you from voting you don't
21:47
have to show your face you're kidding oh
21:49
wow well otherwise you wouldn't be able
21:51
to vote in a burka yeah i guess not and
21:53
we'd find out who lord buckethead is
21:54
when he goes
21:56
there was a party that lost all of their
21:58
deposits okay
21:59
this is and they lost between 1992 and
22:01
2001 they contested 500 seats in that
22:04
time they lost every single deposit
22:06
you'll probably remember them the
22:07
natural law party oh yeah i remember
22:09
that well they're the levitating ones
22:11
they yes they weren't they were the ones
22:13
who thought they could levitate
22:15
they believed so a lot of listeners
22:18
might remember that a lot of listeners
22:19
might not they believed you could do
22:20
this thing called yogic flying
22:22
which is basically bouncing around with
22:23
your legs crossed on your bottom with
22:25
big hot water bottles underneath you oh
22:27
wow and
22:28
um they believed that the first policy
22:32
right if they had won in 1997 was that
22:34
they would
22:35
um make a special air service from the
22:38
armed forces of seven thousand yogic
22:40
flyers to hover in and fix everything in
22:42
the country
22:43
wow i remember i'm sure you told me this
22:45
sandy that the
22:47
the trick to yogurt flying has three
22:49
steps oh this is mine that i remember
22:51
one of the series you could say it then
22:53
what was it because i can't remember oh
22:54
it was just the um yogic flying
22:56
yeah the way you get there is a
22:57
three-stage process so i think stage one
22:59
is
22:59
standing on one foot and stage two is
23:02
being able to hop
23:03
on one foot and stage three is full
23:04
levitation and i
23:06
remember a proud statement by the yogic
23:08
flying institute saying we have
23:10
successfully completed two of the three
23:12
crucial
23:20
okay it is time for fact number three
23:22
and that is
23:23
james okay my fact this week is
23:26
that kenya have an election later this
23:28
year and they're running
23:30
out of symbols for the for their
23:32
candidates
23:33
which means that candidates are now
23:35
using symbols such as a milk packet
23:38
a termite and a robot
23:42
okay the conservatives ran with the
23:43
robot as their main thing this
23:45
time around didn't they yeah yeah what
23:48
was a good piece of satire
23:49
no that was the joke about theresa may
23:51
oh it doesn't matter guys you two are
23:53
tired
23:55
that's a very strong very strong joke
23:57
unstable
23:59
um so yeah this is this actually happens
24:02
in quite a lot of places in the world
24:04
and it's that how
24:05
important it is to have a symbol next to
24:07
your name that so so we know
24:08
in britain we have symbols for the
24:10
conservatives and labour like the rose
24:12
and the
24:12
and the torch and in america they would
24:14
have the elephant and the
24:15
donkey and whatever they have over there
24:18
but in lots of places in the world you
24:19
have a lot of low literacy
24:21
and so if you can't read the name of
24:23
your preferred um
24:24
candidate you need to have the symbol
24:26
and so they need a symbol which is
24:28
really memorable
24:29
termite was just they thought a term
24:31
like would be there yeah i want to vote
24:32
for that
24:33
i i might i would would you think that's
24:36
ants are very industrious and the you
24:38
know they're hard working they get the
24:39
job done and they
24:40
i think that's the idea they club
24:41
together and they achieve things yeah
24:43
yeah was the milk carton half full or
24:46
half empty
24:47
or was it full of milk that's how you
24:49
look at it
24:50
that's what kind of person you are um no
24:53
it was just
24:54
you couldn't look inside the milk carton
24:56
because it was just a depiction of one
24:58
and actually this happens like i said
25:00
quite a lot around the world in
25:01
india the election commission a lot
25:04
symbols to you
25:05
and so there's a big long list of 164
25:08
available symbols
25:09
and you provide them three of them that
25:11
you would like and then they choose one
25:13
of the three
25:14
if it's available yeah it's so cool and
25:16
they have bizarre ones don't they
25:18
like they have um i was really natural
25:20
they were saying i think they've
25:21
modernized their symbols lately because
25:23
they've recently added a sewing machine
25:25
so i don't know how modern they've got
25:26
but they have scissors as one of the
25:28
symbols you can choose a stethoscope
25:30
they have rock and paper
25:33
it's a three-way marginal
25:38
an ice cream going for the youth vote oh
25:40
yeah um
25:41
they have they do it in egypt as well i
25:43
saw the actual symbols i've got the
25:45
picture here um
25:46
they use everything from a tractor to a
25:48
ballistic missile to
25:50
a tap to this is my favorite one a
25:53
mobile phone
25:54
um but the mobile phone symbol has a
25:56
picture in the mobile phone like a
25:58
background and i'm pretty sure it's the
25:59
politician who was
26:01
running that's cool yeah but you know
26:03
the thing with egypt is
26:04
it's not just that you choose three and
26:06
they choose for you it's actually
26:07
completely random that they choose
26:09
the symbol for you so you say i'm gonna
26:11
run in egypt
26:12
and they just randomly pick you a symbol
26:15
and so you'll have some politicians who
26:17
think they're really
26:18
kind of serious and you'll see their
26:19
poster and then it's got all of their
26:21
picture and all of their stuff on there
26:23
and then there's like a picture of a
26:24
banana next to the head it just looks
26:27
ridiculous
26:29
and like for instance it can be quite
26:30
bad because there was a female mp who
26:32
had a rocket as her symbol just
26:34
allocated randomly
26:36
but rocket means hottie in um
26:39
egyptian slang apparently so she was
26:42
like well i can't do this i'm a serious
26:44
mp you can't call me a hottie but
26:46
that wasn't random i bet it was an
26:48
all-male panel that randomly selected
26:50
those symbols at some point
26:52
is one of the symbols a penis
26:55
no i think bananas as close as you get
26:59
one of the ones i'm looking at here is a
27:00
canon camera like it's actually got the
27:02
canon logo on it
27:05
that's cool that well i look through the
27:06
kenyan list um
27:08
and they're really random so there's an
27:10
electrical socket
27:11
there's some broken handcuffs there's a
27:14
steering wheel
27:15
broken handcuffs does not say to me
27:17
tough on crime
27:19
says major cuts in pride
27:23
so the kenyan election is between uhuru
27:25
and nasa
27:26
um what the american space agency no
27:29
the national super alliance party so
27:32
it's president uhuru kenyatta
27:34
and everyone else has kind of ganged
27:36
together with a coalition to go against
27:38
him
27:38
and they've called themselves the
27:39
national super alliance party known as
27:41
the abbreviation nasa
27:43
and they're hoping that their coalition
27:44
will unseat him i think the election's
27:46
in august
27:47
wow i'm glad i don't live in a place as
27:48
unstable as kenya where there's one
27:50
party which has got just about half the
27:51
season one which is
27:53
definitely trying to club together this
27:55
is going to go out of date so quickly
27:59
we're going to date before tonight will
28:00
it might do actually no
28:02
yeah so just you mentioned brands in
28:05
logos yeah
28:06
there are some places where companies
28:08
get a vote
28:10
um so i was looking at how hong kong
28:12
elections work actually you might know
28:13
this
28:14
so the way hong kong constituencies are
28:15
divided up is that
28:17
um five of their seats are geographical
28:21
seats
28:21
and then all the rest are and then all
28:24
the rest are um
28:25
like for companies and so they get like
28:28
an industry
28:29
seat and they get um an agricultural
28:31
seat and they get a tourism seat and
28:33
it's really weird because that means
28:34
that people like
28:35
canada air get a vote in the hong kong
28:37
election yeah
28:39
yeah they do so all these airlines from
28:41
all around the world get votes in the
28:42
hong kong election
28:44
does the company vote equal the same as
28:45
a single person's vote
28:47
i think it does yeah or it might be more
28:49
in fact
28:50
wow yeah it's really weird that's
28:52
amazing
28:53
sit as mps because corporations by law
28:56
are
28:56
individuals aren't they right i mean
28:59
that's just a technical
29:00
legal thing but i think they are yeah so
29:02
they should be able to vote in this
29:03
country
29:04
but they're all standing up for
29:05
themselves they used to have um i think
29:07
we've said this before that universities
29:09
used to get a vote did they so as well
29:10
as the city of oxford
29:12
having an mp or maybe it was two mps
29:14
actually at the time it was each
29:15
constituency had two mps
29:17
oxford and cambridge each got to send an
29:19
mp or two to
29:20
commons and that meant that students
29:22
used to get two votes it was until 1950
29:24
i think or 1948 and so it was oxford got
29:26
uh mp came to an mp all the london ones
29:29
got an mp and then just all the other
29:30
uni's got an mp
29:31
and then yeah it sounds like university
29:33
challenges
29:36
it morphed into that wow that's amazing
29:38
and then students didn't
29:40
vote again until last night
29:44
um so did you hear the thing recently
29:46
about uh donald trump's logo
29:47
speaking of logos no no it's his logo he
29:50
it's a crest
29:51
um and it has the word trump on it but
29:53
it turns out that he just nicked it from
29:55
somebody else
29:55
and it was an old english um crest and
29:58
he took off the word
29:59
integrity and put on the word trump
30:02
which is the most amazing
30:03
metaphor but so
30:06
funny yeah um it was the husband of the
30:09
woman who built mar-a-lago got given
30:10
this
30:12
crest in 1939. mar-a-lago his you know
30:15
the second white house golf club um and
30:17
the trump organization just took that
30:18
coat of arms changed the word never
30:20
asked permission from anyone and then
30:22
when he came back to the uk to open his
30:24
horrible golf course he um i'm sure it's
30:27
a very nice golf course if anyone wants
30:29
to give me free round of golf
30:32
sorry when his fantastic golf course
30:34
opened um
30:35
he got in trouble because he hadn't
30:37
registered the emblem according to the
30:39
1672
30:40
lion king of arms act in scotland and
30:42
then he tried to trademark and they said
30:43
no there's already a thing here you
30:45
can't do that
30:46
wow so he had to invent a new crest
30:47
solely to use in his scottish golf
30:49
courses
30:49
but in america he's still using the one
30:50
he's nick
30:52
i think a lot of it is americans
30:54
listening to this would probably be
30:56
quite amused by how uptight we are about
30:58
our crests
30:59
i should think yes well the new york
31:01
times wrote in its coverage they said
31:02
the british are known for taking
31:03
heraldry very seriously
31:12
okay it is time for our final fact of
31:14
the show
31:15
and that is andy my fact is that in the
31:18
19th century one of england's
31:19
constituencies had no people living in
31:22
it
31:23
and another one was underwater
31:27
wow these are so good they're called
31:29
rotten burrows which uh
31:31
constituencies where there used to be a
31:33
load of people living there and it made
31:34
sense for them to have two mps
31:36
and then over time the population
31:37
changes or the place goes derelict
31:39
but the rules haven't been updated so
31:41
they still get mps
31:43
and then it's really easy for someone
31:44
normally the landowner who owns the land
31:47
to just take over the place pick his own
31:49
mps
31:50
and send them to the health company
31:52
that's amazing yeah there's a blackout
31:53
episode
31:54
which is all about this basically really
31:56
and one of the the constituency that was
31:57
underwater
31:58
dunich is the inspiration for the thing
32:00
in the episode which is called dunny on
32:01
the world
32:02
oh really yeah do you know that dunich
32:05
was the capital of the kingdom of the
32:06
east angles
32:08
wasn't it yeah it was so it used to be a
32:10
really important place
32:11
and um it was a port similar in size to
32:14
14th century london
32:15
according to wikipedia so it was a
32:17
massive massive place and that's why
32:18
they had this vote i think yeah
32:20
it supposedly yeah exactly rivaled the
32:23
capital
32:24
i mean it was and it's called daniel
32:25
like this the british atlantis
32:28
oh yeah what do you mean it it is called
32:30
that
32:31
i'm calling it that now who calls it
32:33
that this guy but it's not but atlantis
32:35
isn't the thing about atlanta though we
32:36
don't know where it is
32:37
we know where donald j is it just
32:38
doesn't it's just not there anymore it
32:40
fell into the sea like atlantis might
32:42
have done that but this is the british
32:43
into the sea yeah i forgot it fell into
32:45
the sea i thought it was just a place we
32:46
couldn't find yeah
32:48
no it fell yeah and it's the british
32:49
atlantis it's not claiming to be the
32:51
atlantis
32:52
anyway guys yeah i got that but oh
32:54
you've got that it's still there
32:56
okay and it's under water and supposedly
32:58
at midnight or at night you can hear
33:00
church bells dangling around in the
33:03
water and that's just someone voting
33:04
with their penis
33:08
and it had eight churches that had two
33:09
hospitals and there's there's one man
33:11
and this was a piece in the india about
33:12
10 years ago he's called stuart bacon
33:15
and he's done about a thousand dives
33:17
down there
33:18
and he has a map which was printed 500
33:20
years ago and he can make his way around
33:22
by touch
33:22
wow the city underwater that is
33:24
extremely cool
33:25
it's so cool yeah that's amazing so
33:27
what's left of it is are there
33:29
like buildings there was almost nothing
33:31
left most of it was swept away
33:33
there's like a church a few houses a
33:36
pratt
33:38
soggy sandwiches so it did that actually
33:41
had about 200 people living there which
33:43
is much larger than a load of other
33:44
constituencies
33:45
but before they were reformed there were
33:47
50 seats in the country which each had
33:48
fewer than 50 voters living in them so
33:50
funny
33:51
it was the 1832 reform act a bit of
33:54
process for you
33:56
and it was that act which got rid of
33:58
these boroughs but it was also the act
33:59
that excluded women from voting
34:01
because until then it wasn't explicitly
34:04
against the rules for women to vote if
34:05
they were landowners they could in
34:07
theory
34:08
and one did actually i think the first
34:09
woman to vote was in the late 1500s
34:11
because
34:12
she was a widow of a big landowner who'd
34:15
been the person who would nominate the
34:16
person to go to parliament so she got to
34:17
nominate
34:18
so women got the vote in the 16th
34:20
century but um did you know that charles
34:21
james fox who's a famous um
34:23
british prime minister when he became
34:24
leader he was too young to vote
34:26
so he was 19 when he became leader yeah
34:28
in 1768 and the voting age was 21. how
34:31
does that work then
34:32
um i guess just other people voted for
34:35
i know his father bought the um
34:37
constituency for him there we go
34:40
it was wow so aaron from the green
34:42
party doing his a level history exam
34:44
back then might not have been able to
34:46
vote either uh yeah
34:48
18 would have been too young yeah yeah
34:51
so
34:52
one of the features of rotten boroughs
34:54
which were a massive problem obviously
34:56
in the country was this thing called um
34:59
pot walloping and i had never heard of
35:02
this yeah yeah it's so
35:03
cool so before the reform act then you
35:06
could vote in certain areas if you were
35:08
a pot walloper
35:10
and what it meant was is that you had a
35:12
pot or a cauldron
35:14
and if you had a pot that was big enough
35:16
if you had a pot
35:17
a proper big cooking pot it showed that
35:19
you had a hearth that was big enough to
35:21
put the pot in
35:22
and if you had a half that was big
35:23
enough to put the pot in then you
35:24
obviously had the freehold of a
35:26
house and therefore you were considered
35:28
responsible enough to vote but could you
35:29
not just get a knock-off part off ebay
35:33
did you have to bring your pot with you
35:34
to the to the voting boat that's why
35:36
nobody voted because people dragging
35:38
these enormous heavy cauldrons around
35:39
the streets
35:40
they actually had one guy called lord
35:42
cauldron head
35:46
um isn't it the case that you they had
35:48
to um if you were
35:49
voting it was done in public one by one
35:51
yes yes
35:52
and it took ages right so um
35:55
but did you have to declare it sort of
35:56
to everyone or was it a secret ballot no
35:58
no you did the secret ballot wasn't
35:59
introduced until
36:00
1870. wow yeah that meant that you could
36:03
obviously
36:03
people could sort of bribe you it was
36:06
called treating
36:06
your constituents you gave them free
36:08
food and drink basically and sometimes
36:10
that would cost so much money that only
36:12
one person could afford to stand in the
36:13
seat anyway
36:15
um people used to sign their ballot
36:16
papers actually because that was a good
36:18
because the person had been elected
36:19
would go through the ballot papers
36:20
afterwards and look at who'd voted for
36:21
them and be like oh
36:22
johnny i'll give him a little present mr
36:24
penis has voted for me
36:27
and if you were super rich presumably
36:28
you could um
36:30
gift people pots to allow them
36:34
to vote for you to give them the
36:35
franchise yeah yeah to gain votes
36:37
yeah okay get this the 1784 election
36:41
voting opened in the westminster
36:42
constituency on the first of april
36:44
and it closed on the 17th of may
36:48
took nearly two months just to gather
36:50
the votes because they didn't have this
36:51
thing because obviously they didn't have
36:52
mass communication and they didn't need
36:54
to do the election all on the same day
36:55
basically
36:56
did sunderland still turn in all their
36:58
votes by 10 p.m that day
37:01
sunderland's like the swatty kid in the
37:02
class isn't it hey not this year though
37:05
i know they've got biggest
37:06
tunnels so quickly explain that for
37:08
overseas people sunderland
37:09
usually so the polls close at 10 o'clock
37:12
and
37:12
sunderland for the last 20 years has
37:14
always been the first constituency to
37:16
give their result and they usually do it
37:18
by about 11 or something like that
37:20
really really quick but this was the
37:22
first year in ages in my lifetime i
37:24
think that newcastle has beaten them
37:25
yeah
37:26
and as a newcastle fan i was thrilled
37:27
with the result of that derby
37:29
it's between them finally it's been a
37:31
bad year for sunderland all together
37:32
isn't it because they got relegated from
37:34
the premier league and now this and
37:36
newcastle got promoted from the
37:37
championship
37:38
so in your face sunderland wow
37:42
we're not doing a tar date in sunderland
37:44
not anymore
37:47
um should we wrap up sure yeah let's go
37:50
to bed
37:50
yeah oh wait can i tell you oh no
37:52
actually no no no no no go and go on
37:54
better process
37:55
but just a bit more process to finish
37:57
off um
37:58
this is i was just really surprised
37:59
about this um supermarkets
38:02
uh people who shop in certain
38:03
supermarkets vote for certain people
38:06
and where would you guess aldi and lidl
38:09
have their um loyalties these days
38:11
they're budget shops so i would imagine
38:13
it's people on a tighter budget so i'd
38:14
say labor you would have thought so
38:16
wouldn't you it's the tories the story
38:18
voters
38:18
so actually the tories have all
38:20
supermarket shoppers i don't know where
38:21
labour voters are shopping
38:22
people who shop in tesco's waitrose
38:24
sainsbury's
38:26
audi and lidl are now all conservative
38:28
and it's just morrisons and aster that
38:29
they've got the label you do hear about
38:31
little britain don't you
38:35
true labour voters grow all their own
38:36
produce on their allotment
38:45
okay that's it that's all we can do we
38:48
need to go to sleep now
38:49
we are knackered i need to close my
38:51
working eye
38:52
and uh we will be back again next week

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:18
coming to you this week from the qi
00:20
offices in covent
00:22
garden my name is anna tashinsky i'm
00:24
sitting here with andrew hunter murray
00:26
alex bell and james harkin and once
00:28
again we've gathered around the
00:30
microphones
00:30
with our four favorite facts from the
00:32
last seven days and in no
00:34
particular order here we go
00:38
starting with alex my fact this week is
00:41
that baby elephants suck their trunks
00:43
for comfort
00:46
it's very sweet is that the response
00:47
you're going for that's what i've got
00:50
in fact adults do all sorts of things
00:51
with their trunks as well when they're
00:52
nervous or they don't know what they're
00:54
doing
00:54
they will pick at their ears or kind of
00:56
wipe their eyes and you know they do it
00:57
like like humans do with hands
00:59
so what it's just a social thing that
01:01
it's they don't know what to do with
01:03
their trunk
01:03
yeah well actually when baby elephants
01:05
are born they can't really control their
01:07
trunks the first few days so they just
01:08
wave around a bit wildly
01:10
and also it's really sad they kind of
01:12
tread on it and then they kind of scream
01:13
because it really hurts but they can't
01:15
work out where the pain is coming from
01:16
or how to make it stop
01:17
yeah trunks are amazing did you know
01:19
that elephants can be left or right
01:21
trunked even though they've only got one
01:23
what does that mean
01:24
they will have a preference for picking
01:26
up objects to their left or right from a
01:27
really early age
01:28
but surely if the if there is food on
01:31
the left
01:32
and their right trunk they won't starve
01:33
to death that's true i don't know but
01:35
they they move they move over
01:36
like a tennis player who doesn't have a
01:38
backhand exactly what they'll do is
01:40
they will turn 340 degrees and pick it
01:43
up with their tail oh right no
01:44
no that would be a hundred meters on the
01:46
other side like a fedex driver
01:48
yeah has the fedex driver thing been in
01:51
the podcast before or is that just gonna
01:52
sound like nonsense to anyone
01:54
listening yeah you should explain that
01:55
i'll explain it quickly that in america
01:57
fedex drivers
01:58
um aren't supposed to turn left instead
02:00
they just do three right turns to get in
02:02
the right direction
02:03
and it works because america's on a grid
02:04
system what and that's is it that it
02:06
saves petrol saves petrol
02:08
because otherwise you're kind of sat
02:09
there waiting for the traffic to go and
02:11
go and go
02:11
so if there's a clear road right not
02:14
allowed andy not allowed
02:15
that's like saying oh the traffic light
02:17
was red but i didn't see anyone coming
02:18
so i went through it anyway
02:20
but the other thing is in america
02:22
sometimes you're allowed to turn right
02:23
on
02:24
traffic lights even if the traffic
02:26
lights are red you're allowed to turn
02:27
because
02:28
it's just the rules same in australia
02:29
it's very bewildering when you're a
02:30
foreigner and you try to cross a road
02:32
hang on i don't see how turning
02:36
right three times helps you if you're
02:38
driving along the road and you need to
02:39
turn left because there's a thing right
02:40
there on the left
02:41
so you're going north and then you turn
02:43
right now you're going east yeah
02:45
and then you turn right and now you're
02:46
going south and now you turn right and
02:48
now you're going west
02:49
and you needed to go west in the first
02:50
place it does seem like it would be a
02:53
massive detail but
02:54
they've done the stats um i can't
02:56
believe that there are no circumstances
02:58
do they disable the steering wheel so
02:59
they can't turn left
03:02
um so i think we're talking about
03:04
elephants oh yeah and
03:06
adults do the trunk sucking sometimes as
03:08
well there's a behavioral ecologist
03:10
who's called joshua plotnick who
03:12
uh has been observing elephants and he
03:14
says that when they get stressed out
03:15
then they put their trunks in each
03:17
other's mouths
03:18
there's comfort yeah so that sounds a
03:19
bit kinky to me
03:21
it sounded a bit kinky it doesn't work
03:23
for a human to put your thumb in someone
03:25
else's mouth and say it's because i'm
03:26
stressed
03:26
but are we saying that your thumb is
03:28
your equivalent of your nose in someone
03:30
else's mouth i would say it's more like
03:32
that
03:32
um it's the obviously the inserter who's
03:34
doing the comforting not the receiver
03:36
so it's that you put your trunk in the
03:38
mouth of an elephant who looks upset
03:40
obviously stupid error to make yeah
03:44
but when you start your thumb you're not
03:45
doing it to comfort the thumb are you
03:46
you're doing it to comfort the mouth
03:48
i don't know but that doesn't mean that
03:51
whatever you put your thumb in will feel
03:52
better about it
03:53
yeah it does that's the rule in life go
03:56
around inserting your thumbs into stuff
03:57
and the world will be a happier place
03:58
okay
03:59
so that's not the only thing that
04:01
elephants do with their trunks they also
04:02
use their trunks for mating
04:04
the male will put his trunk to the tip
04:06
of the female's
04:08
private parts and then he'll put it back
04:10
in his mouth and he has a thing called a
04:11
vomero nasal organ and he can smell
04:13
whether she's receptive
04:15
and in the mood and on heat and so on
04:17
and uh giraffes do the same thing i
04:19
think
04:19
lots of animals they don't have trunks
04:21
though they don't have trunks so i think
04:22
they
04:22
giraffes i think urinate on each other
04:24
oh do they yeah yeah they do don't they
04:26
and then smell if they're on heat or
04:28
whatever yeah which is amazing
04:29
considering the
04:30
neck thing yeah because you're gonna
04:32
have to spray it quite high aren't you
04:35
yeah um that's weird i would have
04:37
thought a good way for an elephant to
04:38
tell
04:38
if she's not up for it is by the fact
04:40
that it will get kicked in the face
04:41
presumably when it sticks his trunk up
04:43
her ass
04:45
we've got two black eyes but i'll give
04:47
it a smell just in case
04:49
do you know elephants have a specific
04:51
call to warn each other about bees
04:53
and they don't make this sound in any
04:55
other scenario
04:57
this was a study that was done i think
04:58
it was last year um and it's this
05:00
certain rumbling sound they play uh when
05:03
they so if they're played audio of bees
05:05
buzzing they make this rumbling sound
05:07
and then if they're played audio of that
05:10
specific rumbling sound they also make
05:12
the rumbling sound
05:12
because they recognize that it's a sound
05:14
that says bees because bees are one of
05:16
the few things that can actually hurt
05:17
them they fly up their trunks and sting
05:19
them
05:19
it is a bit like us because we have a
05:21
thing that we say whenever bees are
05:22
around which is please
05:25
so on the trunk do you know what
05:28
happened
05:28
when margaret thatcher met an elephant
05:31
she and her husband dennis went to the
05:33
sri lankan president's
05:35
garden party in sri lanka and um the
05:38
triangle president's elephant was there
05:40
and um dennis thatcher didn't know much
05:42
about elephant anatomy and he was given
05:43
some bananas to feed to catch his
05:45
elephant
05:46
and instead of um just offering them out
05:48
to the elephant he picked them up and he
05:49
started shoving them up the elephant
05:51
trunk
05:54
according to vinnie supposedly he got
05:57
through nearly half a dozen and then it
05:59
it snorted uh yellow gunk over everybody
06:02
present
06:03
and that just started telling him off
06:04
and he said well i don't know
06:07
i think that's a fairly reasonable
06:08
mistake to make
06:10
pretty recently i've worked out that
06:12
elephants don't eat but i think if
06:13
you're not sure
06:14
just don't or ask you know you know to
06:17
be fair it sounds like it was six of one
06:19
half a dozen of the other on the blame
06:21
game because elephants aren't supposed
06:22
to pick stuff up with their trunks like
06:24
food and then insert it and you can
06:25
blame the elephants
06:28
unreasonably polite i think waiting
06:30
until like six but he was like no this
06:31
is not
06:32
you're constantly taking thatcher's side
06:34
this is another time
06:36
i've always been an anti-elephant but
06:38
elephants don't know that they can't
06:40
eat and drink using their trunks either
06:42
when they're babies they don't know
06:43
how to suck water up with their trunks
06:45
and hold it there and then put it in
06:46
their mouths they have to
06:47
be taught it and copy their the other
06:49
adults and their parents oh crap aren't
06:50
they babies
06:52
to begin with they literally just drink
06:53
straight out of the pond
06:56
yeah because they um no no no no they
06:57
don't drink from their trunks they drink
06:59
straight from their mouths and then they
07:00
eventually realized that they can suck
07:01
it up with their trunk and it's a more
07:02
dignified way of
07:04
taking that yeah sucking up through your
07:06
nose and squirting into your mouth yeah
07:07
i mean if a human did that they'd be
07:09
kicked out of a restaurant but
07:10
apparently it's dignified an elephant
07:11
so the traditional indian way of
07:13
sobering up a drunk elephant was to feed
07:15
it three pounds of melted butter
07:17
no yeah it's just a fat three pounds
07:20
three pounds of melted butter and feed
07:22
it or shove it up the trunk
07:24
that is such a coming home drunk like
07:26
meal to have
07:28
nothing else
07:32
immediately um no they used to and this
07:36
isn't fun but they used to um
07:38
make them drunk so they would fight each
07:39
other they give them branding so they'd
07:40
fight each other in the olden days yeah
07:43
and then to soap them up they'd give
07:44
them butter oh that is bad
07:48
so they have they're the only other
07:50
animals
07:51
other than humans that have anything
07:53
that resembles a chin which still isn't
07:55
quite a chin
07:56
um but they do have a bony protrusion
07:59
underneath their um bottom jaw unlike a
08:01
lot of conservatives
08:10
all right on to fact number two and that
08:12
is james
08:14
um my fact this week is that moviegoers
08:17
blink
08:17
in sync very good
08:21
is it true or is it just poetic uh it's
08:24
it's true because it rhymes
08:26
is that how it works yeah um it is true
08:30
uh this was a study done by the
08:31
university of tokyo and they gave a load
08:34
of people
08:34
um movies to watch and also movies with
08:37
no narrative
08:38
like just an aquarium and also an audio
08:41
book
08:41
and they showed that people watching the
08:43
movie were blinking in sync about 30
08:45
of the time and the others just not in
08:48
sync at all
08:48
and the reason that they think it is is
08:50
because when you're watching a film
08:52
you kind of keep your eyes open when
08:53
it's really exciting but then when
08:55
there's a kind of down bit
08:56
everyone kind of blinks at the same time
08:58
is that why if you're watching die hard
08:59
do you only blink twice throughout the
09:01
whole thing
09:02
i've never seen die hard but is it
09:03
really exciting it's so exciting is it
09:05
it's a constant thrill
09:07
and this is basically what they thought
09:08
was they worked out how often people
09:10
spend blinking in a certain amount of
09:12
time and if you're watching like a 100
09:13
minute film then you're going to spend
09:15
10 or 15 minutes blinking
09:16
and they're like how can you still keep
09:18
up with the story if you're not watching
09:19
it
09:20
but that's because you don't bunch up
09:22
all your blinks into one
09:24
section you should do that right at the
09:26
beginning when they're showing like the
09:27
production credits
09:28
then well that's true but then how do we
09:30
know that that's the case
09:32
until we do a study about it i know but
09:33
it just seemed like the most
09:34
self-evident question to us
09:36
in all of scientific history but if
09:39
we're blinking in sync then everyone is
09:40
missing the same parts of the movie so
09:42
there might be some really crucial bits
09:43
in movies that everyone thinks is
09:45
but they're actually great movies
09:46
because those seconds is why nobody gets
09:49
uh mulholland drive yeah yeah because
09:51
he's lulled you into the blinking and
09:53
then he really quickly throws in the uh
09:55
crucial explanation
09:58
the whole process were written up there
10:01
and that we do this though with other
10:03
things don't we so
10:04
when you're reading apparently humans
10:06
tend to blink when you finish reading a
10:08
sentence
10:08
or if you're listening to a speech then
10:10
we'll tend to blink when the person
10:11
speaking finishes a sentence
10:13
so we seem to blink kind of rest moments
10:16
and there's been a thing that scientists
10:17
have looked into is why do we blink so
10:19
often because we don't need to
10:20
blink as much as we do for lubrication
10:22
purposes just quickly does that explain
10:24
why when i'm giving a speech and i look
10:25
at the audience after i finish the
10:26
sentence they've all got their eyes shut
10:28
yeah oh good okay only look when you
10:30
finish sentences andy
10:32
uh babies blink um way less than adults
10:34
do yeah this is insane
10:36
are we talking about baby humans now
10:38
baby humans yeah humans
10:40
because well the scientists think it's
10:41
for several reasons they think it's
10:42
because
10:43
a they sleep more and eyes blink more
10:46
when they're tired
10:47
and what babies just aren't tired yet
10:50
well they've got they sleep more so they
10:51
they just they
10:52
as in they they spend more time with
10:54
their eyes closed and resting in a kind
10:55
of eyes resting state
10:56
i thought it was because they i thought
10:57
it was because babies were so tired
10:59
that's what you always hear oh he's just
11:00
tired
11:01
but it turns out he's not tired at all
11:03
he's not blinking is he
11:04
[Laughter]
11:05
maybe he's just an ass
11:06
[Laughter]
11:09
and also because babies don't cry for
11:11
like the first like few weeks of that
11:12
like they don't yeah they use tears they
11:14
cry they produce tears
11:15
and so and that apparently changes the
11:17
amount by which you need to blink to
11:19
keep your eyes moistened yeah
11:20
but the blinking thing is unbelievable
11:22
and it's a really massive difference so
11:23
the average person blinks 15 to 20 times
11:25
a minute
11:26
and babies blink one or two times a
11:28
minute
11:29
so it's actually about 15 times more and
11:32
i cannot believe i haven't noticed this
11:33
and i want everyone with a baby to
11:35
verify this please i almost texted my
11:36
friend who's got a baby this morning
11:38
being like
11:38
can you stare at your child for a minute
11:40
please isn't that mad
11:41
that is mad once a minute if you had a
11:43
load of babies
11:44
in a movie theater watching a movie but
11:47
they only blink twice a minute
11:48
it must be weird because there'd be no
11:50
blinking at all in the whole theater and
11:52
then suddenly they'll all just blink
11:55
and then go back to normal again but it
11:57
must be the case then that we just need
11:59
to ask babies what mulholland drive is
12:00
about
12:03
the great tragedy is they can't tell us
12:07
so on um winking as opposed to blinking
12:10
if i can take the conversation in that
12:12
direction there was a study in uh a
12:14
journal called communication research
12:15
reports this is in 2009 they surveyed
12:17
people in a shopping mall and a campus
12:19
and it was just to see
12:20
is the intent of winking clear basically
12:23
and the experiment was as follows
12:24
someone would approach a passerby ask
12:26
for the time
12:27
get them to tell them the time then
12:29
they'd thank them then they'd wink
12:31
then they'd walk off right and then
12:33
immediately a researcher will pop up
12:35
next to the pacifier as if they weren't
12:37
creeped out enough already
12:39
yeah and he started saying did you
12:40
notice that wink what did you think
12:43
another rhyming trust him because he
12:45
writes yeah and then
12:46
and so just to work out what the
12:48
recipient of the wing had thought was
12:50
the intent
12:50
and this is the interesting thing most
12:52
people thought it was saying thank you
12:53
or being friendly all being flirtatious
12:55
but that's already you know three
12:57
separate so i can't think of any other
12:59
reasons
12:59
well other theories lower down the list
13:02
included the possibility that the winker
13:03
had an eye problem was trying to seem
13:06
cool or was expressing some strange
13:09
ulterior motive
13:10
one person suggested they didn't really
13:12
want to know the time
13:15
i know there's only an option for was
13:17
trying to be cool not was being
13:20
um on winking actually i found have you
13:22
ever heard of so you would have heard of
13:23
3d glasses have you heard of 3d no
13:25
glasses
13:25
it's this really weird thing i found
13:27
online that's been developed by a
13:28
brazilian production company called
13:30
jonathan post
13:30
and two neurons attached to the side of
13:33
your head
13:34
on either side and they send little
13:36
electronic signals that make one of the
13:37
eyes
13:38
blink and it makes the left eye wink and
13:41
then the right eye wink and then the
13:42
left eye wink and then the right hand
13:43
and it goes faster and faster and faster
13:45
until it's basically doing it like 25
13:47
times a second and your eyes are set
13:48
you're essentially blinking but out of
13:50
sync
13:50
so it's like left or right or left or
13:51
right and if you look at an object and
13:53
you close one eye and then you close
13:54
your eye and you close one eye the image
13:56
kind of moves slightly
13:57
and that principle has been used so you
13:59
can be able to watch 3d films without
14:00
having to wear glasses and apparently
14:02
it's really convincing 3d
14:03
so really weird andy you and i have just
14:05
been doing that yeah alex has been
14:07
talking
14:07
and my eyes are quite sore i think about
14:10
yours as well i don't mind yeah so i
14:11
don't think this is going to be
14:13
i don't think so there's no way this
14:14
could be good for you anna's doing it
14:15
with her fingers yeah the reason i'm
14:17
doing that james is because i'm a
14:18
natural scientist and i know the reason
14:19
your eyes are saw is that you're using
14:21
your muscles which presumably this
14:22
doesn't
14:23
so just dragging her eyelids up and down
14:26
manually
14:27
incredibly slowly her eye muscles are
14:29
fine but our fingers are really soft
14:32
you know when you wing you do it left
14:33
eyed or right most people wink with a
14:35
dominant eye
14:36
yeah yeah for me it's left i didn't know
14:38
that me too you didn't know that
14:40
well i get my left eye naturally closes
14:42
when i i get drunk or when i'm tired
14:45
of your right eye as well we spend five
14:49
years of our lives with our eyes shut
14:51
from blinking that's not including the
14:52
time you spend sleeping
14:53
that's assuming like a what a 70-year
14:56
lifespan yeah
14:56
if you spend a third of your life asleep
14:58
and you live 75 years
15:00
then that's 25 years of sleep five years
15:04
50 years awake and 10 of that you're
15:06
blinking yeah
15:07
so europe spend a third of your life
15:09
asleep um
15:10
which third would it be if you had to
15:12
choose one third
15:13
i mean it's got to be the last third
15:14
right yeah but when you're retired and
15:17
you can play golf every day
15:19
especially if i have to play golf every
15:20
day
15:23
surely it'd be your work time or the
15:25
middle third when you're meant to be
15:27
building up capital and hopefully
15:28
getting on the property ladder he's
15:30
asleep i'm afraid
15:32
hopefully you go straight from poor as a
15:33
young person to poor as an old person
15:36
it would be a very good way of having a
15:38
very long marriage if you got married
15:39
immediately before you fell asleep
15:42
it's the opposite of sleeping beauty
15:44
isn't it
15:46
constantly awake beauty
15:49
until the prince came along and then she
15:51
fell asleep
15:54
okay anyone got anything else uh cinema
15:57
advertising is less effective when
15:58
audiences eat popcorn
16:01
really into a study this according to a
16:03
study from cologne university
16:05
and the reason is quite fun uh it's
16:08
because according to them
16:09
researchers remember new brands by
16:11
simulating the pronunciation of a new
16:13
name with their mouths
16:15
so when you see an adverb for like daz
16:18
and you've never heard of daz you kind
16:20
of just mouth the word daz
16:23
and that's how you remember it and if
16:24
you're eating popcorn you can't do that
16:26
so if you go into a cinema and you face
16:28
the audience they're all
16:29
blinking in synchrony and repeating the
16:31
words on the adverts we must look like a
16:33
bunch of robots
16:34
do we mouth words in the films
16:37
do you mouth important lines of dialogue
16:40
uh i
16:40
i'm not aware that i do it but then i've
16:42
never watched myself
16:44
at the cinema but also you don't know it
16:46
in advance usually you know what product
16:48
is
16:48
when you've watched
17:01
did you read about that guy this week
17:02
who sued his date because um
17:05
she was texting in the cinema quite
17:07
right too he's a bit of a hero
17:09
he's this guy called brandon vesma and
17:11
he was going on a date with someone
17:12
called crystal
17:12
they went to see the 3d version of
17:14
guardians of the galaxy the new
17:15
guardians of the galaxy which is an
17:16
extremely bad sign
17:21
she apparently texted 10 to 20 times in
17:23
the first 15 minutes of the film
17:25
after which she leaned over and said
17:26
would you mind not doing that and she
17:27
refused so he said i'm really sorry
17:29
would you mind going outside you're
17:30
distracting me at which point she walked
17:32
out and drove home and her car was his
17:34
lift home so abandoning him at the
17:36
cinema
17:36
and so he sent her a text saying can you
17:38
pay me back please and she said no so he
17:39
took it to the small claims court
17:41
do we have a result yet or is it still
17:43
waking making its way through the course
17:45
of
17:45
the supreme i think he's
17:49
gonna withdraw his claim because some
17:51
newspaper set up a meeting between them
17:52
where she begrudgingly
17:54
gave him the cinema money but i noticed
17:56
not the pizza money he'd also ask for
17:57
four dollars for a pizza which she
17:59
didn't return i think if they'd already
18:00
enjoyed the pizza
18:01
that's fair enough that's that's but i
18:04
also think he's taken her to a
18:06
movie
18:07
and she's having to sit there texting so
18:09
he should pay for the price of the text
18:12
oh yeah i mean i don't want to get old
18:15
judd studios
18:17
james they've already generated enough
18:19
press that no one is going to go out
18:21
with either of them from now on
18:22
the job's been done right now yeah
18:24
because people you've heard about people
18:25
sort of
18:26
they google each other before going on
18:27
dates now before yeah people apparently
18:29
do this
18:30
thank god i'm married he's actually had
18:33
lots of propositions it's been extremely
18:35
good for his love life
18:36
lots of girls who got in touch like i
18:38
totally agree with you will you get with
18:39
me instead i promise i won't text at all
18:41
he doesn't come out of it that well
18:43
because of the small claims caught part
18:44
of it
18:46
yeah really good point maybe you could
18:48
take me to the small games
18:50
where are we going on our first stage
18:52
have you ever heard of the small claims
18:55
okay
18:56
the first 10 minutes of the guardians of
18:57
the galaxy is pretty much the only
18:58
watchable 10 minutes in the whole film
19:00
there's quite a good song and there's a
19:01
bit yeah
19:01
i can't believe it was such a good
19:03
moment to end that section i can't
19:04
believe you thought we just needed to
19:05
have a quick review of the guardians of
19:06
the galaxy before we did it
19:08
any bits you'd recommend blinking in the
19:11
rest of the film
19:16
such a damning review to save up your
19:18
[Laughter]
19:22
blinks
19:26
okay let's move on to fact number three
19:29
and that
19:30
is andy's facts my fact is that if you
19:33
buy an apple today
19:34
it might have been taken off the tree in
19:36
may 2014.
19:38
really yeah that is incredible
19:42
these are really brown and moldy ones at
19:44
the back because i sometimes buy for no
19:46
good reason organic ones
19:48
no they're not these are perfectly good
19:50
looking uh healthy looking apples
19:52
so um this is from a book called the
19:54
apple orchard by a food writer called
19:55
pete brown it's all about the history of
19:57
apples
19:57
it sounds to be p green oh very nice
20:01
i think he's always been called pete
20:02
brown
20:05
um so the book is called the apple
20:07
orchard and basically apples get picked
20:09
in about
20:10
may but then to ensure you have apples
20:12
all year round you need to keep them in
20:14
a warehouse
20:14
and so the average time that they stay
20:16
there is six months to a year
20:18
um and they're kept in warehouses which
20:20
have had all the oxygen
20:21
sucked out of them wow and they've just
20:23
got nitrogen in them
20:25
like bags of crisps um and library books
20:28
and library books as we've covered
20:29
before on this podcast yeah
20:30
and so i just i think it's amazing and
20:32
they basically they go into
20:34
kind of hibernation they kind of breathe
20:35
more slowly these apples
20:37
but if you were in there with them you'd
20:38
be surrounded by healthy apples but you
20:40
would suffocate it works out that um
20:42
iphones and imacs go through about three
20:44
model changes a year and they all
20:46
supersede each other so actually if you
20:47
walk into the apple store your apple
20:48
products and the apple store are going
20:49
to be fresher than the apples you buy
20:51
[Laughter]
20:54
very strong yeah that's really funny
20:56
pete brown do you want a fact about pete
20:57
brown yeah
20:58
he is britain's leading apple researcher
21:00
pete brown he's got really into
21:02
apples he used to be a beer insider
21:03
writer and then you realize the thing he
21:04
really loved was apples
21:05
and he discovered during the course of
21:07
his research that he has a severe
21:08
allergy to them
21:10
um so he's allergic to the one thing he
21:12
loves
21:13
he sounds during the course sounds like
21:15
he went a couple of years without even
21:16
touching them
21:17
he wasn't really researching them
21:18
properly right had he never had an apple
21:20
before this does confuse me because it's
21:21
quite a severe reaction his whole throat
21:22
expands his mouth blows up so i don't
21:24
maybe he'd never tries
21:26
his mouth blows up explosion on his face
21:30
you know what i mean but yeah poor guy
21:33
yeah
21:33
that's terrible is that why he's so
21:35
obsessed with them because it's one
21:36
thing he can never have
21:37
yes that's true um so in the 19th
21:40
century we had tens of thousands of
21:41
apple varieties and they used to be
21:43
like all shapes and sizes so they'd be
21:45
lumpy and some had really rough
21:46
sandpapery skin and others would be
21:48
really misshapen
21:49
and look like potatoes and they'd range
21:51
from cherry size to
21:52
grapefruit sized sized apples you get
21:55
grapefruit sizes except they would be
21:56
apple-sized apples
21:58
yes there was no apple size back then um
22:00
but then
22:01
when we got into like larger scale
22:03
farming and we realized it was cheaper
22:04
to um just take graftings of apples and
22:07
spread the same apple the clones then we
22:09
massively reduced the number of apples
22:10
we have
22:10
and now i think in america there used to
22:12
be uh 17 000 somewhere between 14 000
22:15
and 17 000 varieties
22:17
and now it has 90. whoa so we've lost a
22:20
lot of apples that is amazing
22:21
yeah so yeah every single granny smith
22:26
come is genetically identical to one
22:27
that was in a house in sydney
22:29
centuries ago every single bramley apple
22:32
grew from a tree in a garden in
22:33
nottinghamshire the brownlee apple tree
22:35
uh has one fan club and its fan club is
22:38
based in japan
22:40
um and it's the one bramley apple fan
22:42
club in the world it's in
22:43
obuse in japan and because they imported
22:46
bramley apples a brahmana apple
22:48
graft 30 years ago and they just fell in
22:49
love with it there
22:51
and the mayor of the town and a bunch of
22:53
all the members of the apple fan club
22:55
flew
22:55
all the way to nottingham from japan in
22:57
2012 to visit the tree
22:59
and one said he nearly cried when he set
23:01
eyes on it
23:03
the sad thing about that fan club is
23:05
they're all allergic to apples
23:09
actually in that part of the world uh
23:10
i've just given it away now but where do
23:12
most of
23:13
the world's apples get produced is it
23:15
somewhere near japan it's somewhere near
23:16
japan yeah yeah is it japan no oh china
23:20
it's china by an insanely large amount
23:21
like 40 million
23:23
tons a year i produced that and then the
23:25
next biggest fish is the us which is
23:26
four million do you know what is the
23:28
biggest brand of beer in the world
23:30
budweiser
23:31
no um is it that australian one that
23:34
everyone drinks
23:35
fosters no one drinks castle
23:38
no it is snow lager and it's the main
23:42
lager in china
23:43
and it's completely unknown almost in
23:45
the rest of the world but because
23:46
china's so big it means that they have
23:48
something like four percent of all beers
23:50
uh from snow do you know
23:52
some apples are non-vegan
23:56
this is true is it because they have a
23:57
worm inside them no
23:59
nice try nice guess it must be some kind
24:02
of thing they spray on it
24:03
pretty much yeah so a lot of apples they
24:05
have a natural wax on them right
24:07
which it preserves all the water inside
24:09
the apple but when they're picked then
24:11
they get washed
24:12
to get rid of all the dirt and that
24:13
waters off the wax too so supermarkets
24:15
spray them with wax
24:16
and it's not an unhealthy amount it's
24:18
about two drops per apple that you eat
24:19
like a really shiny apple
24:21
um but some of it is brazilian palm
24:23
leaves the wax i mean
24:25
some of the wax is beeswax and some of
24:26
it is shellac which is derived from the
24:28
secretions
24:30
of an insect a lack bug do you know
24:32
robots can count apples but only at
24:34
night
24:35
shut up get out of here dan you're on
24:38
holiday
24:38
[Laughter]
24:40
so this is the idea that if you are an
24:43
orchard owner
24:44
you want to know how many apples are on
24:46
your tree and humans can do it but
24:48
robots are cheaper but the problem is
24:50
how does a robot know what an apple is
24:53
compared to a leaf or compared to
24:54
whatever is really hard especially in
24:56
daytime
24:57
so what you can do
25:00
no what you can do is at night time you
25:03
can get a tree and you can have a robot
25:04
looking at it and then you put a light
25:06
on it and the light will reflect off the
25:08
fruit
25:08
and the leaves but the reflections from
25:11
the fruit will be round and it can tell
25:12
those round shapes better
25:14
than in the daytime when actually all
25:15
the branches and leaves all get in the
25:17
way
25:19
that sounds so terrifying to get stuck
25:21
in an orchard at night when all the
25:23
robots come
25:24
out actually on robots i did a bit of
25:28
reading about warehouses for this fact
25:29
and
25:30
amazon warehouses and other distribution
25:32
warehouses for huge shipping companies
25:34
that used to be that you'd have you know
25:36
rows and rows and rows of shelves and
25:37
then some people would be employed to
25:38
pack and some people will be ployed to
25:39
go up and down the shelves you know
25:40
moving some around
25:42
now what happens is all the humans that
25:43
work in there they work around the edges
25:45
at these packing stations
25:46
and and there's no one in the middle
25:48
there's just loads and loads of tall
25:49
narrow shelves and all those shelves can
25:51
drive around by themselves
25:53
and it's brilliant so everyone stays
25:54
around the edge and they either load the
25:55
shelves or they just stand there and
25:56
they wait for the shelves to come to
25:58
them and they just take off what's
25:58
needed is it like the staircases at
26:00
hogwarts
26:01
it's yeah it's like that one like crazy
26:02
scales they're amazing videos to watch
26:04
for this
26:04
and um what the best this isn't even the
26:07
best bit because
26:08
so obviously you've got hundreds and
26:09
hundreds of shelves moving around and
26:10
there's no order to what needs to be on
26:11
the shelves you can just put anything on
26:13
the shelves in any order in any
26:14
combination and as long as the computer
26:15
knows what's on each shelf it doesn't
26:16
really matter where it's being stored
26:17
because it could just drive anywhere
26:18
it's needed
26:19
um when you close the warehouse at night
26:22
all the shelves like rearrange
26:24
themselves every night based on what's
26:26
going to be needed for the next day so
26:27
for example when it's coming up to
26:28
valentine's day and you know people are
26:29
buying more like chocolates and roses
26:31
and stuff
26:32
then all the tissues off and tickets to
26:35
guardians of the galaxy too
26:40
all of those shelves move to the close
26:42
to the front of the warehouse because
26:43
they're going to be needed more often
26:44
wow that's so cool well done amazon
26:50
well i just think they're going to be a
26:51
big thing
26:53
um if you plant i everyone will know
26:56
this who has a vague interest in
26:57
horticulture but if you plant the seeds
26:59
of
26:59
uh a certain type of apple tree like a
27:01
braeburn apple tree
27:02
then of course it doesn't grow into the
27:04
brave and does it that's why people do
27:06
grafting i just don't understand that i
27:08
think that's mad
27:09
yeah it's it's yeah it is mad isn't it
27:11
it is mad because
27:13
yeah it is mad it is bad it's like
27:15
saying
27:16
if you if two people sleep together they
27:18
might have any animal
27:21
it could be a cow it could be an otter
27:22
god how fun would life be
27:24
it would be amazing no i am not giving
27:26
birth to a cow thanks very much
27:29
section in clinton's like it's a boy
27:30
it's a girl
27:35
[Applause]
27:39
okay let's move on to our final fact and
27:42
that is my fact and my fact this week is
27:44
that the first
27:45
western eyewitness account of india
27:48
described it as having ants the size of
27:50
foxes
27:50
this is so cool um yeah so this is a
27:54
first-hand report by magastones who was
27:56
the third century bc
27:57
greek ambassador to the royal court in
27:59
northern india
28:01
in what is now northern india and yeah
28:03
he described these ants that the size of
28:04
foxes and they mined for gold
28:07
and so they they mined gold and then
28:09
they used to leave piles of gold
28:11
up on the top of the ground while they
28:12
went down and mined for more and he said
28:14
that humans
28:15
from india would go and try and steal
28:17
the gold from the ants and if the ants
28:18
caught them
28:19
the giant ants they'd be engaged in a
28:21
combat to the death
28:23
and he's known as an eyewitness he
28:26
reported this first hand but the amazing
28:29
thing is that they are real right
28:32
this is the amazing kind of real world
28:34
there are mammoths
28:36
who live in this area who dig burrows
28:38
and then when they dig burrows little
28:40
bits of dust come out which does have
28:41
sand in and apparently people do collect
28:43
the bits of gold
28:44
yeah so the only problem with that is
28:47
how at some point someone decided that a
28:49
marmot
28:50
looks exactly like a giant amp well no
28:53
because
28:53
in persian supposedly
28:57
the word for marmot is equivalent to
28:59
mountain and
29:00
yes i was just thinking when you said
29:02
that um
29:03
in english murmur ecology is the study
29:06
of ants which isn't a million miles from
29:08
mars that must be from the same origin
29:11
it might be that is just incredible
29:14
there are
29:14
giant ants the size of foxes which dig
29:17
up goals
29:19
but it's a great fact that's incredible
29:23
they're a mountain ants yeah brackets
29:25
marmot's closed brackets
29:27
the size of foxes brackets not quite
29:30
herodotus wrote about these as well and
29:32
he said they were bigger than foxes but
29:35
smaller than dogs
29:36
yes dogs are such different sizes yeah
29:38
did we first like
29:39
apples when did we first get this
29:43
tiny dog i think it was quite late on i
29:45
imagine they were more they've gone the
29:47
opposite way
29:48
i'm trying to think of dinosaurs i think
29:50
the aztecs had like chihuahuas didn't
29:53
is that a they didn't of word it's a
29:55
mexican word yeah
29:56
so maybe um just to be clear yeah
29:58
herodotus did mention them you're right
30:00
and now there are going to be people
30:01
thinking but he was before mcgaston ease
30:03
i know everyone's now thinking that
30:05
herodotus is
30:09
herodotus did say it but he'd heard it
30:11
from other people and magazines was the
30:13
first western person to go to india
30:15
but yes it was this rumor they'd been
30:16
going for hundreds of years that they
30:17
were ants the size of foxes in india
30:19
if they were the size of foxes i worked
30:20
out they'd be able to lift a cow that's
30:22
cool
30:23
i would i would be inclined to bring
30:24
back fox hunting if they were constantly
30:26
carrying off cows
30:28
how many times larger would you say the
30:31
smallest foxes than the biggest ant
30:35
so the biggest ant is like four
30:37
centimeters i think four inches
30:39
that's quite a big um is this is a big
30:42
end i think it's an order of several
30:44
i think it's several orders of magnitude
30:45
bigger do you i think it's several i
30:47
think the smallest fox is several
30:48
thousand times bigger than the bigger
30:50
stand i'm going for twice as big
30:52
no it's one order of magnitude it's 10
30:54
times bigger oh
30:55
so alex is the size of foxes yeah alex
30:58
is right that the biggest ant
31:00
is a bulletin which is about four
31:02
centimeters and the smallest fox is
31:04
about 41 centimeters um which is the
31:06
fennick fox
31:08
oh my goodness oh sweet that's not
31:10
actually as small as i would have
31:10
thought
31:11
no so i wonder if that ants would be
31:14
able to carry that fox
31:16
easily
31:18
but a baby fennec fox presumably would
31:21
have a hard time taking on an ant in a
31:23
fight
31:25
such an embarrassing way to go in the
31:27
fox community
31:29
um some plants employ ants to scare away
31:32
giraffes
31:33
so these are ants that live in the
31:35
tropics and
31:36
they acacia plants attract ants to them
31:40
so ants live on the acacia plant and
31:41
they drink their nectar and they
31:43
the plants provide shelter for them but
31:45
the plants actually make
31:47
a chemical which causes the ants to go
31:49
into uh what was described by i think
31:51
national geographic as a defensive
31:53
frenzy
31:54
which and they do this whether it's like
31:55
me after i've i've mansplained something
32:06
um so yeah these ants go into this
32:08
frenzy and they scare away the giraffes
32:10
because they can
32:10
sting them um they've got quite bad
32:12
bites and so a giraffe comes to eat the
32:14
plant and the plant
32:15
releases these chemicals into the ants
32:17
that live on it to say get rid of that
32:18
giraffe and the giraffe starts trying to
32:20
eat it and then it gets all these stings
32:21
in its mouth and it goes away
32:23
weirdly there's a fact about i think
32:25
it's ethylene
32:26
which is a chemical that plants release
32:28
and is related to the previous one about
32:30
apples
32:31
um so when plants release ethylene uh if
32:34
they're being eaten by let's say an
32:35
antelope
32:36
they release ethylene and all the nearby
32:38
plants will immediately
32:39
put up their defenses they'll put up
32:40
their defenses and they'll release large
32:42
quantities of a chemical which makes
32:43
them inedible
32:44
in fact poisonously inedible to the
32:46
antelope or whatever's eating them
32:47
so the the antelope has to kind of sneak
32:50
up and eat as much as it can at the
32:51
first plant
32:52
before all the nearby plants are
32:53
completely radioactive and
32:55
and poisonous to it it's ethylene is the
32:58
stuff which makes
32:59
fruit go off isn't it it's like when you
33:01
have bananas and apples in the same
33:03
bit of your fridge exactly but the
33:05
reason it's doing it is to make itself
33:07
attractive to you
33:08
is it it's like an advertising sign but
33:10
if i get a rotten banana i'm not
33:11
attracted to that
33:12
i know but animals are less fussy than
33:14
you james so basically
33:16
once it releases the ethylene all the
33:18
fruit gets softer and sweeter and it
33:19
changes color
33:20
meaning that the animals know ah that's
33:22
ready to eat and it'll be delicious and
33:23
sugary
33:24
uh and so the fruit is basically saying
33:26
in your fruit bowl
33:28
humans are coming make yourself look
33:30
good
33:31
so you'll be eating yeah it's so it's
33:33
like taking someone on a date to
33:34
guardians of the galaxy it's a complete
33:36
misjudgment of what that human might
33:39
want
33:40
we've just got a little plum texting in
33:42
the corner
33:45
we also just speaking of employing ants
33:47
there are farmers in either employ ants
33:48
to help them farm
33:49
they use coca-cola and pepsi watered
33:51
down as a pesticide they spray it
33:53
on the crops not because they contain
33:55
any pesticide chemicals but because they
33:56
contain loads of sugar
33:58
and the sugar attracts the ants and then
33:59
the ants will enjoy the sugar but
34:01
they'll also eat all the larvae of the
34:02
bugs
34:03
that apparently it's almost as effective
34:05
as other pesticides but way way cheaper
34:08
really it's not the cheapest way of
34:09
getting sugar on your land then is that
34:11
the cheapest sugar you can get
34:12
it's a pretty cheap and easy way to do
34:14
it because you then just dialytics
34:15
already comes the liquid is very strong
34:16
they're not far off yeah and
34:17
these on because i thought brand would
34:19
be actually cheaper i wouldn't go for
34:21
coca-cola
34:22
for rollercola
34:25
yeah that's true why go for the coke um
34:27
they did a study recently into and
34:29
personalities they the scientists and
34:32
they all like what they found james is
34:34
they're all a real range of characters
34:37
yeah sarah has been a bit ant racist
34:39
there
34:40
you were so they found that some ants
34:42
are really fussy
34:44
about where they live and so they'll
34:45
move into what could be a nest and then
34:47
be really choosy about it and dislike it
34:49
and abandon it
34:49
and then some ants are just really
34:51
chilled out and liberal and relaxed and
34:52
they'll go into any old
34:53
you know hell hole piece of and
34:56
just
34:56
agree to live there and it actually
34:58
turns out this is what makes their
34:59
colonies work because
35:01
when you're looking for the ideal home
35:03
you need that really fussy guy
35:05
who you know selects it very carefully
35:07
and then when actually you're just in a
35:08
rush to find somewhere
35:09
then the other guy takes over and
35:11
becomes the dominant ant and he helps
35:13
them make a fast decision and move into
35:14
the the nearest available nest what
35:16
you're describing is the odd couple but
35:17
without
35:19
the old colony that's so cool so did
35:22
they move into different places and
35:24
i didn't even know that it seems like
35:25
they do yeah do you think ant landlords
35:28
sometimes get confused because they say
35:32
oh you've got
35:32
tenants and they're like
35:36
oh well i was hoping to have more than
35:37
that he's like no no i just mean you've
35:39
got tenants
35:40
no yeah no maybe yeah
35:44
do they is the ants pronounce tenants
35:46
tenants is that the one difference
35:47
between humans and ants is that they
35:49
pronounce it with that emphasis on the
35:50
second syllable
35:51
i'm just thinking for alex's sitcom of
35:53
the ant
35:54
of couple this might be one possible
35:56
storyline
35:57
is like an ant version of friends where
35:58
you've got kind of the moniker
36:00
fastidious one
36:01
yes yeah chilled out phoebe yeah just
36:04
quickly on on flying ant day
36:06
yeah which always moves around there is
36:08
no day obviously
36:09
like easter just like easter it happens
36:12
in accordance with fourth century
36:13
literature
36:16
no but i did not know this so the male
36:18
will deposit his sperm and the female i
36:19
did know
36:20
that something like something like that
36:21
was probably going on somewhere
36:25
the um i didn't know that the female
36:28
and the queen can keep male and sperm
36:31
for
36:31
20 years wow imagine that
36:35
is her vagina full of nitrogen i think
36:40
that's a great basis for an ant rom-com
36:42
right in which an ant finds out 20 years
36:44
later
36:45
you might have a you might have a kid i
36:47
don't know the bloke and finds out
36:49
oh we just had one thing it was on
36:50
flying ant day it was great yeah well
36:52
bad news you've got 250
36:54
000 children now can i pitch you my
36:56
tenant's joke for that one
36:58
you can pitch it yeah that's bridget
37:00
jones's baby
37:02
that wasn't a good idea that's true well
37:03
actually this will never happen because
37:04
as soon as the male has inserted his
37:06
genitalia into the female and
37:08
deposited his sperm uh his genitalia
37:09
explode inside her and he dies
37:12
no that is bridget jones baby
37:15
i must have blinked in that bit
37:20
um i've got one more thing but it's just
37:22
about this guy mcgaston he's just one
37:24
other thing that he reported that i
37:25
quite liked
37:26
when he went to india um he first of all
37:29
he described the people
37:30
this is how he i guess know that the ant
37:33
thing might have been a bit
37:34
uh he might have exaggerated the truth
37:36
he said that in india lived men with no
37:38
noses
37:39
how do they smell
37:43
that joke would have been original back
37:45
then
37:48
there were other men with no mouths who
37:50
fed by inhalation but could be killed by
37:52
too strong a smell
37:54
so i guess when they hang out with the
37:55
men with no noses then they all drop
37:56
dead
37:57
um and then there were men with dogs
37:58
heads but then he also described he was
38:01
an
38:01
ambassador so he was in the kings to the
38:03
king's court
38:04
well just it's funny like we've got some
38:06
pretty wacky ambassadors today but no
38:08
one's sending this kind of back
38:09
[Laughter]
38:11
um so he lived in the king's court and
38:13
he'd said the king of india
38:15
like to he judged legal cases that was
38:17
one of his responsibilities but he only
38:18
did it while being continually massaged
38:20
and he had a swarm of parrots that flew
38:23
above his head at all times
38:25
and he was considered the embodiment of
38:27
the city which was a city called
38:28
pataliputra
38:29
and so every time the king washed his
38:31
hair a celebratory festival was held
38:34
to celebrate his hair washing i wonder
38:36
how often he did it
38:38
yeah it would be such a hassle i think
38:40
so maybe you'd not do it that often
38:42
presumably he would never attend because
38:43
he was like sorry i'm washing my hands
38:46
[Music]

00:13
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:15
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:17
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:19
covent garden
00:20
my name is lightning and i'm sitting
00:22
here with james harkin anna tsujinski
00:24
and alex bell and once again we've
00:27
gathered around the microphones and
00:28
we've got
00:29
our four favorite facts from the last
00:30
seven days so in no particular order
00:32
here we go
00:34
starting this week with my fact uh and
00:35
that is that early ice skating rink's
00:38
stank of pig fat
00:41
rink rank ring
00:43
[Laughter]
00:45
so this is the fact that the very first
00:47
artificial skating rinks
00:48
uh used as kind of ice substitute
00:50
because they didn't have the technology
00:52
to
00:52
make uh proper fake ice so instead
00:56
they used a substitute which consisted
00:58
of various salts
00:59
and hoglard and people would just skate
01:02
around on it
01:04
and they also had mounds of hoglar just
01:06
at the side to look like fake snow
01:07
yeah and it didn't last very long it
01:09
would not lasted six or seven months
01:11
um when did you say that was that was in
01:13
1844.
01:14
okay so that was and the first one of
01:16
those was made in 1841 i think wasn't it
01:18
yes sorry that so this was the first one
01:20
that was sort of properly opened to the
01:21
public
01:22
yeah the one that was made in 1841 was
01:24
only six foot by 12
01:25
so i don't think you're not going to
01:28
play much hockey on that
01:29
that was like his investment lure one so
01:32
he made that first one and it was
01:33
basically like the thing you'd take on
01:34
dragon's den
01:35
to say if you give me 10 000 pounds for
01:39
ten percent of the company
01:40
well i'm afraid it smells like pig fats
01:43
i'm out
01:44
it's weird when you see pictures of the
01:46
olden days uh so for instance there's
01:48
this beautiful picture of one of these
01:50
early ice rinks from the 1840s
01:52
and everyone always looks very uh kind
01:55
of they're all dressed very beautifully
01:56
and it always looks lovely like jane
01:57
austen era and you can never
01:59
see the picture of the smell which was
02:01
so pervasive everywhere
02:02
everything's not of horse manure or pig
02:04
fat did you expect that they'd be
02:06
skating around with like clothes pegs on
02:08
their noses
02:10
green smoke lingering above them yeah
02:13
you can't see the trotters poking up
02:14
through the ice
02:17
jumper last year when um in japan i
02:19
think we might have mentioned this on
02:20
our news show in japan they
02:22
filled their ice rink with dead fish
02:24
didn't they they got like
02:25
hundreds of dead fish so i looked this
02:27
up again but i didn't realize at the
02:29
time when you did this on the show that
02:30
it's
02:31
the japanese theme park is called space
02:32
world and it's like a space themed theme
02:34
park there's no reason
02:35
to put fish inside your ice rink they
02:38
froze them fast so that you get kind of
02:39
whole
02:40
shoal of fish mid swim so it did look
02:42
quite cool but then they also spelt out
02:43
the word hello
02:44
facebook when you take a step back from
02:46
that that's like what are you doing like
02:48
who thought that was a good idea like
02:49
how far down the meeting did you lose
02:51
sight that that was
02:52
mad when you're like spell out the word
02:54
hello of all words in
02:55
the ice at the very least you could put
02:57
hello in japanese oh was it in english i
02:59
think it wasn't english wasn't it it was
03:01
yeah but they got a massive trouble over
03:02
there and then they said don't worry the
03:03
fish were already dead before we put
03:05
them in the ice
03:06
as though that sort of makes it better
03:09
well it kind of makes it better because
03:10
then it's just like if
03:11
they were just buying it up as if to eat
03:13
yeah but people explained at the time
03:15
that the fish looks like they've been
03:16
frozen in time there were people saying
03:18
it looks like you've just put them in
03:19
there alive and they've frozen to death
03:20
because their
03:21
mouths are open and their eyes are big
03:22
and wide but if you've ever been to a
03:24
fishmonger that is just what dead fish
03:26
i see what you mean i don't think it's
03:27
better i do think it's less bad well
03:28
that's what better means
03:31
i think it's still bad do you think it
03:33
because it was spelled out in english
03:34
maybe they thought this is the kind of
03:35
weird stuff that the brits are into
03:37
isn't it
03:38
we'll spell it out in their language
03:39
we'll get loads of tourists well they
03:40
correctly
03:41
surmise that it was going to be in
03:42
british tabloid newspapers didn't they
03:44
they did well done japan yeah maybe they
03:46
were hoping that it was going to be in
03:48
hello magazine
03:50
maybe it was sponsored by hello magazine
03:53
um
03:54
anyway yeah so they didn't have another
03:55
proper artificial live stream until 1876
03:58
and that was when they had actually
03:59
developed the technology but even that
04:01
one
04:01
had a layer of cow hair under the ice
04:04
did it
04:04
yeah was that for some kind of sort of
04:06
cold insulation because they ran
04:08
cold pipes under the ice didn't say you
04:10
had concrete the base layer is concrete
04:12
and then on top of that you have layers
04:13
of earth and wood and
04:14
cow hair obviously and then they on top
04:17
of that as you're saying that they put
04:18
these pipes and they ran a chemical
04:20
solution through the pipes which froze
04:22
the water surrounding the pipes and it
04:24
froze the water how cool is that
04:26
they were called glaciariums weren't
04:28
they yeah glacy area maybe
04:30
but they were incredible i didn't
04:31
realize these things existed and they
04:33
were it sounds
04:34
amazing so they were floating there was
04:36
i think the second or the third one that
04:38
this guy john gamgee who invented them
04:40
made was one a floating one on the
04:43
thames just where the hungerford bridge
04:44
is so it was this big floating ice rink
04:46
and it had a glass ceiling that went all
04:48
over it so it was indoors glass ceilings
04:51
floating why don't we still have this
04:53
that's very cool yeah
04:54
i find it hard enough to skate on an ice
04:56
rink that's on solid ground but one
04:57
that's also like
04:58
you get seasick on as well that's going
05:00
up and down maybe it cancels out and
05:01
it's just like walking around
05:02
i think i'm imagining everybody's
05:04
sliding to one end and then sliding the
05:05
other end
05:06
and always getting bunched up on one
05:07
side yeah um so john gamji then
05:11
after doing this he went into perpetual
05:13
motion
05:14
he um invented a thing called the
05:16
xerometer
05:17
which supposedly would power ships
05:19
through perpetual motion
05:20
um he put the same a similar kind of
05:22
liquid through
05:23
the ship which is really cold that would
05:26
take the heat from the water that would
05:27
propel the sails
05:29
and the rotors which would then put
05:31
energy back into the water
05:33
and that would supposedly be a perpetual
05:35
motion machine
05:36
unfortunately it didn't work
05:38
unfortunately he didn't count on the
05:39
laws of physics
05:40
yeah and he um spent the rest of his
05:42
life and all of his money on that
05:44
okay he was um an extremely accomplished
05:48
vet
05:48
john gamgee and he so he was really good
05:52
at this he founded this vet school
05:54
and a vet journal and there's now the
05:56
john gamgee award
05:57
which is basically the only remnant that
05:59
has his name which is an award that's
06:00
given to those who excel
06:02
in the field of veterinary sciences and
06:04
it says in the oxford dictionary of
06:05
national biography that if he'd have
06:07
carried on being a vet
06:08
instead of going into ice skating rinks
06:11
and perpetual motion
06:12
then he probably would have been the
06:13
best vets like of all time maybe or one
06:15
of the best bets
06:17
but we wouldn't have ice rinks so swings
06:20
and roundabouts isn't it
06:21
but we would have the pig ring still he
06:23
didn't invent that
06:24
we'd still have the pig ring thank god
06:26
that would be probably fine
06:27
can i just because such a cool thing
06:29
about gamji is that
06:30
his brother was a guy called samson
06:33
gamgee
06:34
sam gamji well so samson ganji
06:37
was a doctor but and he invented a kind
06:40
of tissue that was used in
06:41
surgical instruments which people called
06:42
the gamjeed tissue but tolkien wrote a
06:45
letter
06:46
saying that he'd got the name samwise
06:48
gamji from that because they used to
06:49
refer to the gamjee tissue at the end of
06:50
the 19th century
06:51
and it was to go with rosie cotton who's
06:53
samwise gamji's wife in lord of the
06:55
rings
06:56
so this guy invented the ice rink his
06:58
brother was samwise gamgee
07:00
he was lord of the rings and the other
07:02
guy was lord of the rings
07:06
it's not quite true to the text is it
07:07
saying that he's lord of the rings but
07:09
we'll allow it
07:11
so sam gamgee is named after a cloth
07:14
yeah and his wife were both named after
07:16
surgically it's so funny
07:17
surely that that's a bit of a hack move
07:19
isn't it it's like the least lord of the
07:21
ringsy thing to do you think of you
07:22
yeah some god or something yeah it's
07:24
like being called trevor gauze
07:28
so neville
07:29
[Laughter]
07:32
what if all the characters in lord of
07:33
the rings are named after all this stuff
07:35
maybe they are maybe they are so we
07:38
should talk
07:39
about the machines that go up and down
07:42
ice
07:43
fixing the ice it's what the public are
07:45
crying yeah look at this
07:48
uh you mean zambezi's zombies zambonis
07:54
very rarely freezes i assume they were
07:58
named after that yeah sorry you mean
08:00
zamboni's yeah i do yeah
08:01
yeah that's very optimistic that i'm
08:05
going to edit that
08:09
yeah i didn't realize the previous
08:10
procedure which was so laborious
08:12
you had a tractor right on the ice and
08:15
that would pull along a scraper because
08:16
obviously as
08:17
people skate they're all these little
08:18
shavings that get sort of cut out of the
08:20
ice
08:20
so you have a tractor pulling along a
08:22
scraper the scraper scrapes it all up
08:23
and then you have to have someone
08:24
walking behind spraying the ice with
08:26
water
08:27
and then squeegeeing it up to mop it up
08:30
so you don't have too much
08:31
water on the ice i don't know i think
08:33
it's basically is shaving the top layer
08:35
off the ice so you've got the smoothness
08:36
and then putting a new layer on yeah
08:38
that's
08:38
smooth it's basically like repainting
08:40
but with water but then does the person
08:42
walking behind leave a lot of footprints
08:43
in the ice and then another machine has
08:44
to come behind to sweep up
08:46
it's another person actually with
08:47
slightly smaller feet
08:52
yeah they're great so they're these are
08:54
apparently a big deal in the world of
08:55
ice hockey which i'm not very okay with
08:57
um and in america but they're invented
08:59
by this guy called frank zamboni in 1949
09:02
and they were first made out of old
09:04
world war ii parts weren't they so the
09:06
first one was made out of bits of a
09:08
spitfire it was like a tank wasn't it
09:10
yeah it was a douglas bomber
09:11
so it was an airplane but i think other
09:12
bits are made out of tanks maybe i think
09:14
the whole thing was that when he made
09:15
the machinery he then put it on like a
09:16
military buggy
09:17
and drove it around and that was like it
09:18
was like a oh really that's so funny i
09:21
went on the website and
09:22
uh at the official website zamboni and
09:24
the on the biography it says
09:26
um if necessity is the modern invention
09:28
frank zamboni is probably the father
09:29
which i think it is a bit of an overview
09:32
he's one successful quite specific
09:34
invention
09:35
no have you seen the other things they
09:36
invented one of them's called a black
09:39
widow
09:40
it's a machine that's invented to fill
09:42
in the dirt on top of cemetery vaults
09:44
effectively leveling the soil on top of
09:47
a
09:47
vault is very similar to leveling the
09:50
ice on earth yeah he's a bit of a
09:51
one-trick ponies
09:55
because he's also invented the astro
09:56
zamboni
09:58
which removes rainwater from astroturf
10:00
and when when they had the 50th birthday
10:02
of the zamboni proper
10:03
somebody classic um they had a zamboni
10:05
driver of the year competition
10:07
oh yeah yeah which which was won by a
10:10
guy called jim mcneal
10:11
who said it was a thrill right up there
10:13
with getting married and having children
10:15
wow did you see what he did next
10:19
obviously you get divorced
10:23
abandon his children actually it was
10:26
it was a bigger thrill just packing all
10:28
his stuff up and driving away on a
10:30
zamboni
10:31
in 2006 two skating rink workers were
10:34
fired after driving a zamboni
10:35
to a burger king drive-thru
10:39
they got fired immediately and the
10:41
director of parks said
10:43
uh when we interviewed them they didn't
10:44
seem to be too concerned about it
10:47
did they leave the burger king floor
10:48
extremely smooth
10:50
i don't know we should move on guys yeah
10:53
yeah oh can i tell you a really cool
10:54
thing you can do with ice super quickly
10:56
if you get a bit of cheese wire and you
10:58
hang weights on either side of it and
10:59
you get a big block of ice
11:01
so like make a big block of ice bit of
11:02
cheese wire hang two liter bottles of
11:04
water on either side of the cheese wire
11:06
and you put it over the ice so it
11:08
gradually cuts through it yeah
11:10
um and the ice re-freezes behind the
11:13
cheese wire as it cuts through it
11:14
so the cheese wire will cut all the way
11:16
through the ice come out the other end
11:18
and you've got a completely intact block
11:19
of ice that's amazing so you spent all
11:21
that time and all of your objects are
11:23
exactly the same as they were when you
11:26
started
11:29
[Applause]
11:32
[Music]
11:37
okay it's time for fact number two and
11:38
that is anna
11:40
yeah my fact this week is that in 1912
11:42
the toronto government ran a fly
11:44
swatting competition
11:45
it was won by a 15 year old girl who
11:47
killed half a million flies
11:50
uh so this is so weird it's i think i
11:53
read about this on a site called
11:54
knowledge nuts
11:55
which i think is called it's a really
11:58
great site guys i felt like i had to
11:59
mention it because it's not in many
12:00
other places
12:01
so this is this contest that flies were
12:03
a massive problem in 1912 they spread
12:04
lots of disease there was manure
12:06
everywhere
12:06
there were big piles of rubbish
12:08
everywhere in the street um
12:10
the flies aren't causing the manure
12:13
they're going to cause very small
12:14
amounts of manure
12:16
yes i would say well actually
12:19
don't they eat the manure and then they
12:21
just produce a different type of manure
12:22
what's interesting about that is they
12:23
take manure
12:24
and then they replace it with manure
12:26
it's very much like anna's ice cream
12:30
they redistribute manure they were
12:31
redistributing manure on people
12:33
the government didn't like it and so the
12:36
chief medical officer in the toronto
12:38
government got together with the daily
12:40
star launched this contest
12:42
every contestant had to be under 16 and
12:44
they said they give away cash prizes to
12:45
the children who brought in the most fly
12:47
corpses
12:48
and there were people who came and they
12:50
came to the this guy called dr hastings
12:52
who was
12:53
the chief medical officer and they
12:54
brought their flight corpses to him
12:56
every day
12:57
and he counted them up and there were
12:58
lots of quite strict rules so you
13:00
couldn't try and pad out your point with
13:01
other material that was against the
13:03
rules
13:04
you couldn't breed the flies once you
13:05
got them in order to make more because
13:07
that kind of defeats the whole object
13:09
how do they know you're not going to do
13:10
that though exactly they just asked you
13:12
not to
13:12
it was on trust that's like and what
13:14
city was it in china that
13:16
um started offering a bounty for every
13:18
mouse still ratchet
13:20
tails or something yeah and then people
13:21
just made rat farms and then just like
13:24
bread mass bred these rats it's quite
13:25
crafty the idea of padding it out with
13:27
other stuff though
13:28
because that's in a greek myth isn't it
13:30
someone you know that someone is going
13:31
to pay the god some tribute and he puts
13:32
in this sack of rubbish awful but then
13:34
he puts a nice steak on top of it and
13:35
the gods think oh a sack of steak
13:37
and then they work it out because
13:38
they're not complete idiots there was an
13:40
old
13:40
scam that they used to do with vegetable
13:42
oil in that they'd sell you
13:44
a massive tank of vegetable oil but
13:47
actually it would be water with oil on
13:49
top of it because of course oil floats
13:50
you'd only see the oil part and that is
13:53
why cooking oil now always comes in
13:54
transparent bottles
13:56
you've got to see all the way down so
13:59
we've established the
14:00
piling rubbish underneath and putting
14:01
the valuable thing on top is a common
14:03
trope and the toronto government
14:04
anticipated this and said please don't
14:06
do it kids
14:07
why was the competition only for 16 and
14:08
younger if this is a genuine problem
14:10
they were trying to solve why would they
14:11
then suddenly
14:12
what do you think people have got jobs
14:13
alex
14:15
well kids have school i bet this girl
14:17
beatrice white skived a lot of school to
14:19
get this good
14:20
so this is the girl who won it and she
14:22
set these proper traps and if you look
14:23
up if you go to old newspaper archives
14:25
you can see pictures
14:26
they're quite elaborate so she put raw
14:28
liver underneath them and she designed a
14:30
one-way
14:31
funnel and then she'd agitate flies so
14:33
they flew towards the raw liver
14:34
went through the one-way funnel and then
14:36
they get stuck in these contraptions she
14:37
built out of like wood and wire and then
14:39
she collect them at the end of every day
14:40
and she delivered 500 000 flies to the
14:44
government
14:44
it's amazing she killed them with poison
14:47
as well didn't she yeah
14:48
i wonder what poison kills flies oh i
14:50
know one
14:51
what arsenic because fly paper
14:54
used to be full of arsenic and people
14:57
would
14:58
soak fly paper in water let the poison
15:00
leech out
15:01
and then you'd have poisonous water and
15:03
people would people murdered each other
15:04
in the 19th century
15:05
with fly paper water did they say have a
15:08
nice glass of water
15:09
there's a woman called florence maybrick
15:10
in 1889 who poisoned her husband and was
15:12
convicted of arsenic poisoning her
15:14
husband using flypaper
15:15
really oh yeah but didn't she claim
15:18
that he liked to self-medicate with
15:20
arsenic for his libido
15:22
and there wasn't enough evidence either
15:23
way so she escaped being executed
15:26
for it but she did stay in prison for a
15:27
long time that's not how crime works
15:30
we think you did it we're not totally
15:32
sure so we're gonna go for a bit of a
15:33
sentence but
15:34
not a full one what they should have
15:36
done is stuck her on some fly paper for
15:38
20 years
15:41
if she was a greek parable that would
15:43
have been what they've done my husband
15:44
in life actually liked shooting himself
15:46
uh it was good for his libido
15:50
well they did used to use arsenic in
15:52
some medicines i think didn't they tiny
15:53
mountains so maybe
15:54
yeah it's plausible i believe that so
15:57
for many
15:58
years in many places um collecting flies
16:01
and giving them to the government has
16:02
gotten you money
16:04
um so in china uh officials in
16:07
luayang offered 125
16:11
per 2 000 dead flies during the campaign
16:14
really um each fly was worth about seven
16:16
cents
16:17
was that a massive amount for a flyer
16:19
this recently sorry that was quite
16:21
recently yeah in pennsylvania in
16:23
mansfield pennsylvania
16:24
in 1914 it was five cents per pint
16:28
of flies okay you would get in 1988 in
16:31
manila it was
16:33
4.75 per 1000 flies
16:36
so all the prices are very different
16:38
yeah and there was a guy called mr
16:40
bellen
16:44
about him james has nothing interesting
16:45
to say he just really wanted to get that
16:48
name
16:51
it would be great because he was
16:52
collecting flies it'd be great if his
16:54
name became
16:55
a verb to collect flies i believed
17:00
now he was delivering an average of two
17:03
hundred thousand dead flies per week
17:05
making about a thousand dollars a week
17:07
wow wow
17:08
how was he doing that well he wouldn't
17:10
give away his tricks
17:12
and what tools was he using well people
17:14
suggested that he was hatching maggots
17:16
himself
17:17
an allegation he denied vehemently well
17:19
you would do wouldn't you with a
17:20
thousand dollars a week
17:22
he said that catching flies a lot like
17:24
hunting or fishing you
17:25
first of all you have to find out where
17:27
they hang out and then you go there
17:29
and he used a giant fly swatter which he
17:32
invented himself
17:33
when he say invented was it just a fly
17:35
spot but much bigger he wouldn't give
17:37
anything more away in the article that i
17:38
read
17:39
um just you said that to catch them you
17:41
have to go to where they are yeah
17:42
so um the second place in this
17:46
competition in toronto in 1912 went to a
17:49
girl who lived quite near a 90-meter
17:51
long heap of manure
17:54
she knows she never thought that would
17:56
be an asset when her parents were buying
17:57
the house
17:59
earned so much with the fly catching
18:00
competition i can actually afford a
18:01
slightly larger heap of manure now
18:04
um but they ran the competition the next
18:07
year they ran it for a second time
18:08
and there weren't any flies to catch
18:11
because beatriz white had scooped them
18:12
all up
18:13
but her sister yeah came second yeah
18:15
following yeah
18:16
and she's still her sister still caught
18:18
200 000 or something no she's got 50
18:19
000.
18:21
nothing there's still a lot of flies
18:23
that's true
18:24
the newspaper the toronto i think it's
18:26
the toronto star or the star in toronto
18:27
they tracked down
18:28
beatrice uh white who would have been
18:30
about 71 i think
18:32
and they ran a headline the queen of fly
18:34
killers found alive
18:35
and they gave her a can of insecticide
18:38
to thank her
18:39
yeah and she said that the fifty dollars
18:42
that she'd won she desperately wanted it
18:43
to pay for her music lessons and her dad
18:45
had kept it for himself
18:47
really wow yeah tough times that is bad
18:50
i think each house flight can carry 6.6
18:54
billion
18:54
back sorry obviously not billion each
18:57
house fly can carry six point six
18:58
million bacteria
18:59
on it many of which are bad i know some
19:02
are good we all know from the yakult
19:03
adverts but some of them wouldn't have
19:04
been
19:05
down a pint of flies in the vague home
19:07
that some of the bacteria might be
19:09
friendly
19:10
i gotta say though the difference
19:12
between a million and a billion it's
19:13
like
19:14
it's hardly as if oh thank god it's only
19:16
a million
19:16
[Laughter]
19:19
i wasn't thinking don't be ridiculous
19:21
anna they couldn't have a billion they
19:23
must have a million
19:24
it seemed silly to me
19:28
[Applause]
19:30
[Music]
19:37
okay it's time for fact number three and
19:39
that is alex
19:41
my fact this week is my fact this week
19:43
is that
19:44
when animating 101 dalmatians disney
19:47
photocopied the dogs
19:49
is that why they're black and white was
19:51
that at the office party after the
19:53
shoot had ended up with our bums what
19:56
else can we do
19:57
do you know who first came up with the
19:58
idea of photographing your
20:00
body parts no a genius of some sort yes
20:04
einstein uh no andy warhol really
20:08
yeah apparently it seems like he was
20:10
possibly the first person to do it in
20:12
1969 he walked into an art supply store
20:14
and he knew the owner who's called
20:16
donald havenick and he convinced him to
20:18
let him do some photocopying of himself
20:21
and there are images of him with his
20:23
face on a photocopier
20:24
he didn't do his bum as far as i know i
20:27
would wager that the first person to do
20:28
that knowing the human condition would
20:29
have been the person who invented the
20:30
photocopier moments after inventing it
20:32
because that's going to be the first
20:33
thing you ever do the first copy
20:34
i don't know what i would be impressed
20:37
by because everyone now has photocopy
20:39
parts of themselves using the flatbed on
20:40
a photocopier i want to see the person
20:42
who photocopies himself using the
20:43
document feeder
20:48
that would be amazing yeah yeah sliding
20:51
yourself through
20:52
anybody photo copied the dogs so this
20:54
was in the late 50s
20:55
uh disney had made sleeping beauty and
20:57
the way that they made that was that
20:58
every single frame of the film has to be
21:00
really painstakingly drawn
21:02
and then transferred onto like painted
21:04
onto glass
21:05
cells and this is a really expensive and
21:07
time-consuming process and it didn't do
21:09
very well at the box office so disney
21:10
was thinking of shutting down their
21:11
animation offices
21:12
and so they had to come up with cheaper
21:14
ways of of making these films
21:16
and so uh one of the creatives at disney
21:19
got some
21:20
equipment from xerox and modified it and
21:22
found a way of
21:23
basically photocopying certain elements
21:25
of the drawings and
21:26
putting them onto the glass cells so
21:28
they then next made 101 dalmatians and
21:30
realized that they could specifically
21:32
photocopy the spots on the dogs because
21:34
they're going to stay the same
21:35
and you need the same a different
21:37
combination of spots
21:38
on each dog and it needs to be the same
21:40
dog and stay the same and then the
21:41
backgrounds need to stay the same
21:43
and they came up with this way of
21:44
identifying the dogs by thinking of the
21:46
spots as constellations
21:48
uh and it cost about half as much the
21:50
film as it would have done and
21:51
kind of save disney and then transform
21:52
the way that they would animate films
21:54
from then on until
21:55
the computer yeah does that mean all the
21:57
spots on the dogs
21:59
are constellations no they're just they
22:01
were thought of like constellations
22:03
okay i can remember them it doesn't mean
22:05
that it would have been like three
22:06
dalmatians
22:07
if they didn't have zero technology
22:10
she just made a tiny tiny little glove
22:15
maybe the um xerox machine only did a
22:17
hundred copies as max
22:18
[Laughter]
22:21
do you know what toner is made of in
22:23
photocopiers
22:24
is it pig fat it's pig fat it's a great
22:27
no
22:29
it's different from ink isn't the
22:30
difference between toner it's not ink
22:32
yeah it's like electrostatically charged
22:35
particles oh you do know what it is
22:37
yeah well it's it it's it is this
22:40
incredibly
22:41
fine powder yeah some a lot of it's rust
22:44
rust iron oxide yeah and the plastic
22:46
just milk and there's lots of plastic
22:48
modern color photocopy toner is 95
22:51
plastic
22:51
milled into a tiny tiny tiny powder
22:54
which then gets
22:55
fused by heat with the paper okay i had
22:58
no idea
22:58
so photography tonight it's not ink
23:00
that's why it's so expensive yeah
23:02
because you always see that it's like 10
23:04
times more expensive than
23:05
champagne or something don't you yeah
23:07
and it is done by electromagnetism isn't
23:09
it so i think it's a really
23:10
complicated process but you make the
23:12
bits that you want to have toner on
23:14
be kind of magnetic and then it attracts
23:16
the toner to it
23:17
so it needs to be charged so the toner
23:19
has the opposite charge to
23:20
the bits of the paper that's amazing did
23:22
you know this i didn't know this
23:23
did you know that cannon has been
23:25
warning people to
23:27
um take better care of their office
23:28
equipment is how they put it
23:30
this is reported on cnet but especially
23:32
during the festive season
23:34
it says the christmas season leads to a
23:36
25 hike in service calls due to
23:38
incidents such as backside copying
23:40
pranks
23:41
um so there is actually a big increase
23:43
in photocopier accidents
23:45
during the festive seasons they've asked
23:46
us to stop doing it please
23:48
well i won't i don't know all those
23:50
squares that canon have to say
23:52
and he just replies with the lesson with
23:54
20 copies of his art
23:55
[Laughter]
23:57
do you know using a lot of people use
23:58
xerox especially in america as a generic
24:01
word
24:01
for a photocopier and
24:04
according to an advert from 2003 um
24:08
xerox said
24:09
when you use xerox the way you use
24:11
aspirin we get a headache
24:13
and that they really hate the way people
24:15
do this and the reason being is
24:17
something called genericide
24:18
and what it is is it's when you have
24:21
your brand becoming
24:22
so ubiquitous that everyone uses it it
24:24
means that you can't
24:26
really claim intellectual property over
24:27
that word and so it means your trademark
24:30
is basically dead and buried
24:31
yeah and that's why google don't like
24:32
you say i'm going to google it they want
24:33
you to say i'm going to
24:35
search it online using google.com or
24:37
velcro i don't like speaking velcro yeah
24:38
obviously there are advantages to that
24:40
because you become a very famous brand
24:42
but then at the same time it's very
24:43
difficult to protect your trademark i
24:45
mean it hasn't worked for google for
24:47
instance where are they now
24:48
yeah crushed under the ask jeeves
24:50
juggernaut
24:53
there was a bug in 2013 in xerox
24:55
machines which meant that sometimes
24:57
numbers would be randomly replaced in
24:58
photocopies
25:00
of really important documents and then i
25:02
think fours were changed to ones
25:03
and then and then this guy that explains
25:05
404
25:08
a guy did like a ted talk on it and um
25:10
and kind of
25:11
revealed this bug and then xerox took
25:13
him on board and fixed the bug
25:15
wow yeah yeah that's amazing um
25:18
so the guy who invented the photocopier
25:21
or the xerox
25:22
um is so nice it's a really happy
25:26
story uh it's just from start to finish
25:29
this guy's called chester carlson
25:31
and he was brought up really poor um so
25:35
he used to have to sleep in a chicken
25:36
coop sometimes he spent some while
25:38
having to sleep outside
25:39
where did the chicken sleep uh they
25:41
slept in his full poster
25:46
but he came up with uh he came up with
25:48
this amazing technology
25:49
uh which was really complicated and when
25:51
people talk about it combined
25:52
loads of different techniques that no
25:54
one had ever thought of combining before
25:56
and was rejected by more than 20
25:57
companies and it's since been called
25:59
like the most important thing to happen
26:00
in printing since the printing press
26:02
because
26:03
his technology also was what laser
26:05
printers do so he basically came up with
26:06
modern printing and photocopying
26:08
but he eventually you know when you
26:10
expect to get to the end of these
26:11
stories it'd be like oh you sold the
26:13
rights to someone and got a tenner
26:14
he went into perpetual motion
26:18
didn't stop spinning for the rest of his
26:20
life um
26:21
he got a sixteenth of a cent for every
26:24
single xerox copy made
26:26
throughout 1965 which was a lot yeah and
26:29
that's why it's so expensive
26:30
no it's longer that was about 10 years
26:31
the period through to 1965 yes from when
26:34
he made it
26:35
but he lived really humbly and he never
26:37
uh
26:38
bought much stuff he gave all of his
26:40
money away he would never ever wanted
26:41
his name to be on stuff so when he gave
26:43
his money to universities and stuff
26:44
he asked them to put it in honor of the
26:46
teacher who'd inspired him and
26:48
things like that is it possible that
26:49
that was just cover story and that what
26:50
he did was he invented a photocopier and
26:52
then just photocopied money
26:54
no one really caught up with him
26:55
effectively he is printing he's
26:57
basically printing money yeah a
26:58
sixteenth of a cent for every
27:00
xerox copy made is unbelievable yeah
27:03
that's the same
27:04
yeah but yeah i know he you're right he
27:05
gave it all away but he had a business
27:07
partner at the start
27:08
he was a guy called otto kornai i think
27:11
he might have been an austrian i'm not
27:12
sure
27:13
but he walked away about a year into the
27:15
process he said i don't see this going
27:17
anywhere
27:18
and he could have been a
27:19
multi-millionaire but um yeah
27:21
i know but chester carlson the reason he
27:24
tried to invent photocopy in the first
27:25
place was because he
27:26
worked for years as a law student and a
27:28
patent attorney and he spent
27:30
like all his time copying legal
27:32
documents by hand and develop chronic
27:34
arthritis because of it and he was just
27:35
so pissed off that he had to do this
27:37
that he was like i need a machine for
27:38
this oh he did other he had other
27:46
inventions
27:48
raincoat with gutters to channel water
27:49
away from trousers
27:52
now actually that is a good idea he
27:54
invented a toothbrush with replaceable
27:56
bristles he invented a transparent
27:58
toothpaste tube which
28:00
seems really unnecessary no that's i
28:02
would love that because how do they get
28:03
the stripes
28:04
in it yeah and if it's transparent it
28:06
means that people can't hide awful
28:08
inside your toothpaste
28:11
the top millimeter is toothpaste and the
28:12
rest is just big fat the number of times
28:14
the aquafresh have got me with that
28:16
trick
28:18
um do you know where photocopying has
28:21
been banned
28:22
oh um in the um
28:26
in the bank of england oh that's a good
28:28
idea um
28:30
it's well it may well have been i don't
28:32
know how many photocopies there are in
28:33
north korea
28:33
but in 2010 in tibet it was banned
28:38
um people in the capital would have to
28:40
register their name
28:41
if they wanted to make photocopies
28:43
basically the chinese authorities
28:45
um were worried about people spreading
28:48
literature saying
28:49
hey maybe the chinese should leave to
28:51
bed and so they said well no more
28:54
photocopying for you
28:55
fuji has developed a new robotic printer
28:58
that moves around the lounge or office
29:00
bringing documents to the person who
29:01
printed them
29:02
that's a great that's awesome yeah i
29:04
mean our office is quite small i'm not
29:06
sure how much use we get and it's got a
29:07
step in the middle of it
29:08
yeah so if you're in a public space and
29:11
you have some documents which are quite
29:13
um secure or sensitive and you want to
29:16
print them out you don't want anyone
29:17
else to see them you don't want to print
29:18
them and then have to go over because
29:19
there might be someone stood there and
29:20
they might read your yeah your
29:22
anti-chinese propaganda
29:24
and so sorry i've said sorry about
29:26
printing that with using the office
29:27
printer
29:28
all right and so if they come to you
29:30
then it means that you'll always get the
29:31
right
29:32
ones i guess but doesn't isn't there a
29:34
risk that someone intercepted on the way
29:36
yeah you know if people look at my
29:38
screen and constantly see i'm on
29:39
freetibet.com
29:42
the sensitive document robot keeps on
29:44
shuffling back and forth to me
29:48
yeah actually photocopiers and holding
29:50
sensitive documents is a major issue
29:52
that there's someone uh this guy is
29:54
trying to highlight so i didn't realize
29:56
this but um every time you photocopy
29:58
something
29:58
then it stores exactly what you
30:00
photocopied on a hard drive so since
30:02
2002
30:03
uh they photocopies have got a record of
30:05
every single thing that's been through
30:07
them
30:07
so there's this guy called juntunen who
30:09
has a digital security company and
30:12
he tried to prove how risky this is by
30:14
buying by randomly buying up some
30:15
second-hand photocopiers
30:17
so we bought up four of them um to show
30:19
that they hold all this digital
30:20
information
30:21
he actually said we didn't even have to
30:22
wait for the first one to warm up
30:24
one of the copiers had documents still
30:26
on the copier glass from the
30:28
new york police sex crimes division oh
30:31
my god
30:32
what they hadn't even taken it out of
30:34
the thing they hadn't even take the
30:36
sex offenders list off the flatbed in
30:39
the photocopier so we opened it up and
30:41
got that
30:42
um but he hacked into the hard drives
30:43
and he got for instance 300 pages of
30:45
people's individual medical records
30:47
um so all details and medical records um
30:49
like blood blood prescriptions blood
30:51
test results diagnoses
30:53
he got lots more lists of sex offenders
30:55
he got lists of pay stubs and people's
30:57
um bank details that they'd photocopied
30:59
so yeah
31:00
this is this is a thing old photocopiers
31:02
are holding was one of
31:04
was one of the photocopiers he bought
31:06
from the new york police sex crimes
31:07
department or something like that it
31:08
must have been right it must have been i
31:10
think it must have been
31:11
he probably was waiting hovering on the
31:12
ebay button for ages and ages
31:19
[Applause]
31:21
[Music]
31:23
[Applause]
31:23
[Music]
31:26
[Applause]
31:26
[Music]
31:28
okay it's time for a final fact and that
31:31
is james
31:32
okay my fact this week is that seeds
31:33
have brains
31:36
and james doesn't how similar to our
31:38
brains are they are they the same
31:40
well they're smaller if i was talking to
31:43
another party how long would it take me
31:44
to notice that i was talking to a seed
31:47
to a person i think that you don't you
31:50
tend to make that decision not just
31:52
based on people's brains
31:53
okay let's say it's got a face painted
31:54
on it if you start talking to people if
31:56
you notice their brain waves aren't
31:57
working i think that guy over there
31:59
is an acorn in case i was being rude
32:03
so what this is is they've taken some
32:06
seeds
32:07
and they've worked out how they make the
32:09
decision of when they need to germinate
32:11
and they've looked at all the different
32:12
cells and they found that it's just a
32:14
few cells that make this decision
32:16
and it's very complicated but the way
32:18
they make the decision
32:19
is quite analogous to the way that
32:22
animals make decisions with their brains
32:24
and so the people who have done this
32:26
study are saying that basically it's
32:28
very similar to a brain
32:29
but much smaller much simpler but it's
32:31
similar now that doesn't mean that they
32:34
have brains like us because they don't
32:36
um but it's basically quite interesting
32:38
because
32:39
the last time um plants and animals had
32:41
a common ancestor was like
32:43
1.6 milli ah sorry stupid 4.6 billion
32:46
years ago
32:48
and even though it was that much time
32:50
they've kind of come up with same
32:51
solution to the problem which is by
32:53
using these
32:54
cells to communicate with each other and
32:56
then saying okay now that we've
32:58
communicated we're going to release
32:59
these hormones et cetera
33:01
so it's about the cells communicating
33:02
with each other within the siege exactly
33:04
and that's i mean what is a brain apart
33:06
from a few cells communicating with one
33:08
another yeah it's all miners
33:11
but it kind of sounded like a slightly
33:13
well in the article it brought it down a
33:14
bit too
33:15
half of the cells are saying like grow
33:17
grow grow the other officers saying like
33:19
don't stay stay here because stay a seat
33:21
and
33:21
it's just up to like then and then
33:22
deciding which one to follow yeah it's
33:24
like when you're in bed and you're like
33:25
stay in bed all day or
33:26
get up and do stuff yeah yeah and it's
33:28
pretty analogous to that because
33:30
for for a plant it can't uh
33:34
sprout too early in case the temperature
33:36
gets cold again uh but it can't wait too
33:38
late it can't stay in bed too late
33:40
because then
33:41
uh all the other seeds will have
33:43
sprouted and they'll crowd out
33:46
so it is like that you can't get out of
33:48
bed too early because it'll be dark and
33:50
you'll get bump into things but you
33:51
can't get out too late otherwise the
33:52
tube will be very busy
33:53
[Laughter]
33:55
there was a good headline in new
33:57
scientists which was quite misleading
33:58
that said
33:59
[Laughter]
34:02
it just said plant parents tell their
34:04
seeds when to sprout by passing down
34:06
their memories
34:07
and i thought this is going to blow this
34:09
podcast wide open plants have
34:11
memories and they transmit their
34:13
memories to their children
34:16
memories to each other actually what it
34:18
is but it is still quite
34:20
interesting so as you say it's important
34:22
when seeds sprout
34:24
and actually sometimes they might want
34:25
to sprout earlier or later depending on
34:26
the weather
34:27
and the plant parent can work out so if
34:30
it's warm weather
34:31
it knows that it'll make a slightly
34:33
thinner casing for its seeds so it
34:35
sprouts quickly to take advantage of the
34:36
weather whereas if it's cold weather the
34:38
plant senses that
34:39
and automatically makes a thick casing
34:41
for the seed and that means when it's
34:43
dispersed
34:44
it takes longer to hatch out and the
34:45
weather will have got warmer by then so
34:46
in a way that is clever
34:48
that is it is very clever but that's
34:50
like me saying like if i put
34:51
my baby in a hat that i'm passing my
34:54
memory to it
34:57
so on plant seeds you know argan oil no
35:00
uh i went to morocco at the end of last
35:03
year and they were banging on and on
35:05
about argan oil in every single market
35:06
they're like you love argan oil don't
35:08
worry
35:09
trees yeah organ or argon so it's a
35:11
thing that's really popular apparently
35:13
for girls to use in their hair
35:15
it's a big deal see why you thought we
35:16
would though
35:17
[Laughter]
35:18
look at andy's hair that's it's riddled
35:21
with argentine ripping without
35:22
it i'm hoping it's actually water that i
35:26
was sold as argan oil
35:28
as a trainer in morocco but anyway this
35:30
is kind of this is a massive boon how
35:32
popular it is for
35:33
places like morocco where it's not trees
35:35
were the ones where the goats live
35:36
they are so 60 of argan nuts which is
35:39
where you get argan
35:40
oil are distributed by goats so you're
35:42
right argan trees are the ones that
35:43
goats climb up and they can get like up
35:45
to eight meters up a tree
35:46
and then they eat the argan leaves and
35:48
the fruits and stuff and the seeds they
35:50
then regurgitate within about a day and
35:51
they spit them out somewhere else and
35:53
that's how they're distributed
35:54
so this argan oil that you ladies and
35:57
gentlemen
35:58
are putting on your skinnier hair or
36:00
whatever it's for
36:01
has been dispersed by a tree-climbing
36:03
ghost it's very cool regurgitation i
36:04
have a fact about those goats go on
36:06
um it's that the domestic ones don't
36:08
know how to climb trees
36:10
and they have to be taught by keepers
36:11
human keepers how to climb up
36:14
yeah do they how do they teach them that
36:15
i don't know i haven't found any footage
36:18
beyond just that fact it's well worth
36:20
googling um argan tree goats isn't it
36:22
yeah if you haven't seen that picture
36:24
before it's yeah or you can watch the uh
36:27
special feature of how to do qra
36:28
research on volume two of the qi dvd box
36:31
set
36:31
which is all about argan trees and goats
36:33
oh that's how i must have known yeah
36:35
me too so elephants transport seeds as
36:38
well
36:39
they can transport seeds up to 65
36:42
kilometers
36:43
away from the tree that they've eaten
36:45
the fruit or whatever
36:46
and that's by far the biggest mover of
36:48
seas out for any animal
36:49
wow you know like three times more than
36:52
any birds
36:53
really do anything like that yeah that's
36:55
incredible and it comes out in their
36:56
feces presumably it does
36:57
okay so they could they travel 65
37:00
kilometers between
37:01
pools that's what it sounds like doesn't
37:03
it i've done that on a motorway before
37:08
you transported the seeds from south
37:10
mems to carby services
37:14
um does where do you think 75 of mexico
37:17
sesame seeds go
37:18
uh do they go into andy's car to travel
37:20
up the m6
37:22
is it they get turned into halva paste
37:24
nope they're good
37:25
they go to mcdonald's they do they all
37:27
end up on mcdonald's burgers
37:28
ah three quarters of all the sesame
37:30
seeds in mexico i think that's amazing
37:32
that is amazing
37:33
wow wow what else do you use them for
37:36
it's hell of a paste
37:40
no what else is that another hair
37:42
product it's made no it's a use of food
37:44
it's a mouth product
37:45
if you put it in your mouth it's
37:47
delicious is it okay great i'll look it
37:49
up so it's a food then
37:50
it's a food okay yeah or as i call it a
37:53
mouthful
37:56
i read an article about mexican farming
37:58
the other day it was about the avocado
37:59
farmers in various cities they've now
38:01
formed their own militias
38:03
because they were being um you know
38:06
ripped off and blackmailed and extorted
38:07
by gangsters
38:09
and they have proper you know assault
38:11
weapon militias concrete bunkers all
38:13
this stuff
38:13
just to protect the avocado crops
38:15
because it's so valuable to them isn't
38:17
it avocados though that
38:18
um they would be extinct if it weren't
38:20
for humans uh
38:22
eating them because they lost the
38:23
mechanism to distribute their seeds
38:26
it's because avocado seeds are too large
38:28
to pass for any animals that are
38:29
currently
38:29
extant so the thing that avocados
38:32
evolved to be distributed by has been
38:34
extinct for 12 000 years with a very
38:36
large anus
38:38
to be distributed by piers morgan
38:42
it was a ground sloth guys it was a
38:44
three meter long ground sloth called the
38:46
megalonics jeffersoni
38:47
and um it ate the avocados and then it
38:50
was able to distribute the seeds
38:51
but they haven't existed for 12 000
38:53
years and we don't know why avocados
38:55
have managed to exist without them
38:56
because
38:57
humans surely haven't been distributing
38:58
avocado seeds in a systematic way for 12
39:00
000 years it seems unlikely
39:02
and yet they've stuck around i'm really
39:05
good can i just say something about
39:06
brains
39:07
so your br when you sleep your brain
39:08
cells shrink to half their normal size
39:11
as you sleep your brain cells literally
39:13
get half as big does your head shrink
39:15
yeah
39:16
yeah do you understand is your brain
39:17
literally 50 to the size yes
39:19
it is have you ever seen a sleeping
39:20
person it's like a normal sized body
39:22
like a doll's head um
39:25
no it's incredible it's unbelievable is
39:28
that why you yawn when you wake up
39:29
because you're like reinflating yourself
39:33
no this is so they found this out
39:34
recently they can shrink by up to 60
39:37
while you sleep and they think this is
39:39
because i think we've mentioned
39:40
that they've recently discovered that
39:42
the purpose of sleep they believe is to
39:44
flush out all the waste from your brain
39:46
so it allows fluid to travel around your
39:47
brain cells and in between them and kind
39:49
of flush out all the useless stuff
39:51
and that's why your brain uses the same
39:52
amount of energy when you sleep that's
39:54
when you're awake because it's doing all
39:55
this stuff
39:55
and it's thought that by shrinking it
39:57
creates more space around the cells
39:59
so that the fluid can flush through them
40:01
more easily and get rid of all the
40:02
wastes that is amazing
40:03
it's so cool isn't it so cool yeah
40:06
there's some brains
40:07
if you get a vole and
40:10
you put it in a female vowel this is and
40:12
you put it in a cage with a male bowl
40:14
and then you stimulate certain parts of
40:16
its brain then the female vowel will
40:19
fall in love with the male vowel
40:20
sorry which brain are you stimulating
40:22
the females really
40:24
yeah why would you do that is it is
40:27
there some kind of shakespearean comedy
40:29
uh where they have a love potion of the
40:32
vault
40:34
um no it's this is just a study that was
40:37
done in atlanta
40:38
and they got this bowl and they
40:39
stimulated it and put it in with the
40:41
mail
40:42
and then they put the female vowel in to
40:44
another cage with both that male and
40:46
another one and she always went to the
40:48
one that she was hanging out with while
40:49
she was being stimulated in her brain
40:51
and then they did it with another bull
40:53
who hadn't had her brain stimulated
40:55
and she would more often go for the new
40:58
guy
40:58
oh really she's got anything to do
41:00
because vole is an anagram for love and
41:02
if you're scrambling someone's brain up
41:03
they're just saying like i'm evolving
41:04
i'm in love
41:08
i didn't know we knew that foles felt
41:10
love i'm excited
41:11
i think we might be extrapolating in the
41:13
same way that i extrapolated that this
41:15
was
41:15
a brain in a seed
41:16
[Laughter]
41:18
don't believe anything you've heard of
41:20
last time
41:22
[Applause]
41:25
[Music]
41:26
okay that's it that's all of our facts
41:28
thank you so much for listening
41:29
if you want to get in contact with any
41:31
of us about the things that we've said
41:32
you can find us on twitter
41:34
i am an andrew hunter m james at egg
41:36
shaped alex
41:38
at alex bell underscore and anna you can
41:40
email podcast
41:41
qi.com you can also go to our website
41:44
which is no such thing as a fish.com
41:46
and you can hear all our previous
41:48
episodes on there and
41:49
what about our andy we're going on tour
41:52
we're going on tour all over the uk
41:53
in october and november of this year so
41:56
go to
41:57
qi.com fish events to get tickets for
41:59
that anyway i'm going to go back
42:01
and carry on writing our new book oh we
42:04
got a book coming out
42:04
we have ah that sounds great what's it
42:07
gonna be about
42:08
it's gonna be about the news of the year
42:10
and you can get that by going to qi.com
42:13
fishbuck okay we'll be back again next
42:15
week with another podcast thank you so
42:17
much for listening this time and goodbye
42:30
you

=171
00:00
hi everyone james here uh before we
00:02
start today's show i just want to remind
00:04
you
00:04
that we are going on tour at the end of
00:06
the year and also tell the good people
00:08
of newcastle
00:09
that we have added an extra date we sure
00:12
have so that is on the 22nd of october
00:15
and you were so good at booking tickets
00:17
for the first one
00:18
that we've got an extra show on that day
00:19
now so if you go to qi.com
00:22
fish tour you can get tickets for that
00:24
and if you live
00:25
in a certain other places in the uk like
00:27
manchester
00:28
like leicester like nottingham like
00:32
like dunstable especially leicester
00:34
actually people of leicester
00:36
come on people of leicester get your act
00:38
together but if you live in any of those
00:40
places and you like to listen to us talk
00:42
and you want to see us on tour then come
00:43
and see us we'll be going to all your
00:45
places in october and november
00:47
and people in the rest of the uk and
00:49
maybe certain other places you might
00:51
want to keep your eye
00:52
on our twitter at qi podcast because
00:55
we'll be announcing some more dates
00:56
quite soon woo
00:58
thanks andy strong contribution there
01:01
why did you ask me in today
01:04
also just to add next friday as our
01:07
podcast goes up
01:08
we will also be on facebook live if you
01:11
go to no such thing as a fish page
01:14
between 5 p.m and 6 p.m gmt british time
01:17
we will be on there chatting away want
01:19
to know what our heads look like
01:20
this is the perfect opportunity to find
01:22
out uh
01:24
and the upper half of our bodies
01:25
actually you often get to see as well
01:27
yes which we rarely show so that's
01:29
that's a very good incentive they will
01:31
be clothed
01:32
they will be closed but we can't promise
01:34
they will be by the end of the facebook
01:35
live
01:36

hello and welcome to another episode of
02:11
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
02:14
coming to you from the qi offices in
02:15
covent garden
02:17
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
02:18
here with anna chazinski
02:20
james harkin and andrew hunter murray
02:22
and once again we have gathered around
02:24
the microphones with our four
02:25
favorite facts from the last seven days
02:27
and in no particular order
02:29
here we go starting with fact number one
02:32
and that is my fact
02:33
my fact this week is that the icelandic
02:35
version of agatha christie's lord
02:38
edgware dies
02:39
took over 10 years to complete because
02:41
the translator couldn't work out
02:42
how to translate two words firstly
02:45
spoiler alert in lord edgware dies yes
02:51
you know i don't think you understand
02:52
crime fiction andy it's not like you
02:53
have to wait till the end for the big
02:54
reveal about who dies
02:57
uh what were the two words stan do you
02:59
know um i don't know so the reason i
03:01
don't know is i read this
03:02
in an article on the guardian by the
03:04
author the translator of these books
03:06
called ragnar
03:07
jonasson and i think for the reasons of
03:10
not wanting to do the ultimate spoiler
03:12
alert he's not included
03:13
the two words because they're like the
03:15
ultimate words in the whole story yeah
03:17
so this is the thing
03:18
these two words are it's a bit of word
03:20
play that agatha christie used in the
03:22
book
03:22
it's the clue basically to the to
03:24
solving the murder
03:25
and in icelandic he just couldn't work
03:27
out how to do it and he's been
03:29
translating agatha christie book since
03:30
he was 17 years old
03:32
and he started with endless knight the
03:34
reason he picked it was because it was
03:35
the slimmest volume but he convinced the
03:37
publishing house that that was a really
03:38
good one to start with but it was
03:39
actually it was just really short
03:41
he's um quite a famous author in iceland
03:43
i think he is yeah
03:44
ragnar jonason was it yes uh and his
03:47
books have been translated into english
03:50
by a guy called quentin bates uh who's
03:53
also a writer but i couldn't see if any
03:55
of his books have been translated into
03:56
other
03:57
languages um according to him the
03:59
hardest thing about translating from
04:01
icelandic into english
04:03
is punctuation uh because a full stop in
04:06
icelandic
04:06
isn't necessarily the same as a full
04:08
stop in english
04:10
and i think that's really interesting
04:11
because you think it's all about the
04:12
words that you have to translate
04:14
but if you have to translate the
04:14
punctuation as well that's pretty hard
04:16
right yeah
04:17
do you know what a full stop is i think
04:19
sometimes it can be a comma
04:21
or even a semicolon my pet peeve is
04:24
people who put commas instead of full
04:25
stops and the icelandics are just doing
04:27
it all over the shop
04:28
well i think it's part of their actual
04:30
language i'll allow it
04:32
i can't believe we're not finding out
04:33
these two words is the reason you didn't
04:35
look into what they were that you didn't
04:36
want the spoiler
04:38
i thought i thought we couldn't actually
04:39
mention it on the podcast i thought uh
04:42
other words would be edward's dead is
04:44
that it
04:45
no i think that's translatable okay
04:47
maybe it's edgeware road
04:49
and the pun is that he's on a horse but
04:52
it also sounds like a tube stop
04:54
because that'd be quite hard to
04:55
translate into icelandic it would be
04:57
really hard to translate
04:59
well this is the interesting thing about
05:00
translating though or simultaneous
05:01
interpreters
05:02
sometimes if they have a speaker who
05:04
makes loads of jokes they find it really
05:06
hard to do
05:07
because uh puns obviously are a
05:10
nightmare for them and they hate it
05:11
and one one interpreter wrote in an
05:13
academic art article about interpreting
05:15
puns based on a single word with
05:17
multiple meanings in the source language
05:19
should generally not be attempted by
05:20
interpreters as the result will probably
05:22
not be funny
05:24
i think often puns in your own language
05:27
you should not attempt them because the
05:28
result won't be funny i'm not
05:30
targeting anyone specifically but well
05:32
in that case i'm not going to say
05:33
anything for the rest of the contest
05:36
one of my favorite translations is um
05:39
the asterix books and they're full of
05:40
puns aren't they
05:41
yes yeah um so they were full of puns in
05:44
the original french and then they were
05:46
translated into english and all the puns
05:48
kind of still work they
05:49
they all have names that are puns
05:50
basically like get a fix get a fix is
05:52
the druid
05:53
so it's like getting getting his effects
05:56
from him uh anyway
05:57
what i didn't know is that that was
05:59
translated by two people derek hockridge
06:01
and anthea bell
06:03
and anthea bell is the sister of martin
06:05
bell
06:06
the politician and broadcaster uh and
06:09
also
06:10
the daughter of adrian bell who was the
06:13
first times cryptic crossword setter
06:16
wow and you can see the word play really
06:19
working in that family yeah
06:20
yeah that's amazing so guess what the
06:23
most translated work is
06:24
the bible the bible you're absolutely
06:26
right guess what the next most
06:28
translated work is
06:30
um or who it's by little prince by santa
06:33
super ee oh that's really close okay
06:35
that one is in the top 10.
06:37
okay i read recently that that got
06:39
translated into its 300th language
06:40
that's why i say that you're absolutely
06:42
right yeah it did
06:43
okay the next three books after the
06:45
bible that are most translated in the
06:46
world are
06:47
all by the jehovah's witnesses the
06:49
watchtower society
06:52
seven out of ten of the books are by the
06:55
jehovah's witnesses in the top ten
06:56
the only secular ones are the little
06:58
prince and the un's universal
06:59
declaration of human rights
07:02
which is a zinger i don't count it if
07:05
then are they selling them the jehovah's
07:06
witnesses or do they just thrust them on
07:08
people
07:08
uh they look they're translating them
07:10
into different languages and that's
07:12
what counts i don't think people are
07:13
buying those it's not sales it's just
07:16
physical transfers no no i know but you
07:17
know you could have free bible every
07:19
time you go to church
07:20
yeah that's true the problem should be
07:24
church rooms are all falling down
07:28
on um translators uh i read in
07:31
in an article i was reading that um when
07:33
obama was president
07:34
the u.s state department received a
07:36
message for him
07:38
from the king of bhutan and it was in
07:39
the language jonker
07:41
which i think is how you say it and they
07:44
needed it translated and so they went to
07:45
their zonker translator and said this
07:47
isn't the king of bhutan can you
07:48
translate well this message says to
07:49
obama we need to know what the message
07:51
is
07:51
and the translator says no i can't
07:53
possibly translate that because it's in
07:54
the royal version of the language and my
07:56
eyes are not worthy to see it
07:59
they um had to look far and wide for
08:01
another translator turn out the message
08:03
was to wish him a happy new year
08:05
it could have been a major diplomatic
08:06
incident i think thai has a royal
08:09
language as well don't they but they
08:11
tend to be not that different from the
08:12
actual language i can't remember if it's
08:14
like that in bhutan
08:15
but it would even if it was only one
08:17
tiny bit of difference it's the fact of
08:19
setting your eyes on it
08:20
yeah crying you know sounds like he
08:22
could have read it right yeah he could
08:23
have he totally could have
08:24
his eyeballs weren't worthy enough they
08:26
would have exploded
08:27
do you know happy new year by abba i
08:28
wonder if they have a special version
08:30
for the royal family in bhutan
08:32
but only they're allowed to hear does
08:35
anyone know about the
08:36
icelandic translation of dracula no so
08:38
it was translated into icelandic in 1900
08:41
by
08:41
vladimir asmundsen and it's a completely
08:44
different book
08:45
than the actual dracula and it sounds
08:48
ten times better
08:49
yeah how's it different well they have
08:52
secret half ape vampires
08:54
uh who sacrifice young
08:58
maidens in the basement with lascivious
09:00
glee
09:01
yeah apparently it's much sexier yeah we
09:03
only discovered this really recently in
09:04
2014
09:06
i think but the icelandic people have
09:07
known it for ages
09:09
they've had the books but they haven't
09:11
been reading the original no
09:12
yeah yeah so this is only when someone
09:14
went back to check something in 2014
09:16
this dutch historian
09:17
and he was like this is completely
09:19
different he said i want to check
09:20
something in the original text
09:22
so i was saying that no one icelandic
09:24
and english had ever had a conversation
09:26
in the last 115 years where they both
09:27
said i i've read dracula what do you
09:29
think well i like the
09:30
half ape vampires sacrificing made in
09:32
the basement
09:35
you know when you're a bit ashamed that
09:36
you've forgotten most of the book that
09:37
your friend you're gonna look like an
09:38
idiot when you go
09:39
oh no yeah yeah i love those yeah that
09:42
is my best bet
09:43
[Laughter]
09:46
but yeah apparently sexier and much less
09:48
tedious and punchier no dracula is quite
09:50
sexy already
09:51
this is sexier yeah yeah i mean i had to
09:53
read the original with a cushion in my
09:55
lap
09:55
[Laughter]
10:00
but what's so what's interesting about
10:01
it is that um
10:03
they're trying to work out how much
10:04
involvement bram stoker had in the
10:07
translation of the book and i think the
10:09
implication is this translated i
10:10
couldn't have written something this
10:11
good it must have been an early brown
10:13
stoker version
10:14
it's the alternative that the translator
10:16
made it up and yeah inserted these
10:17
yes yeah pretty much that he took the
10:19
original story and thought
10:21
i could make this better wow but this
10:23
guy's like no no one except bram so he
10:25
could have the imagination to come up
10:26
with a
10:26
half ape vampire it must have been him
10:32
i think you should read it andy i will
10:34
just think of all the cushions you'll
10:35
need
10:36
[Laughter]
10:39
so iceland books generally um
10:42
really interesting they supposedly
10:46
read more books and more books are
10:47
published there per head than any
10:49
country in the world
10:50
so one in ten icelanders are going to
10:53
write a book in their lifetime yeah i've
10:54
read that
10:55
loads of times and everyone says it's
10:57
true and lots of really proper places
10:59
say it's true and it almost certainly is
11:01
true but i still don't believe i know
11:02
it's hard to believe isn't it
11:04
well there are only 300 000 of them yeah
11:06
i think it's quite plausible and you can
11:08
get some real crap published these days
11:09
don't if you checked out the sunday
11:10
times bestseller list
11:12
well the bbc they did a feature about
11:14
iceland iceland's book world
11:16
and they interviewed one novelist called
11:17
kristen a ricks gadotti
11:20
and she said it is difficult especially
11:22
as i live with my mother and partner who
11:24
are
11:24
also full-time writers but we try to
11:27
publish in alternate years so we do not
11:29
compete too much
11:30
but they're in a constantly stressful
11:32
household with people
11:33
up against publishing deadlines i guess
11:35
so so i guess they hate each other
11:36
anyway
11:37
yeah that's where we're going to be when
11:38
we publish our book yes two months time
11:40
at the meeting each other stage so it
11:42
makes sense slightly of this um
11:44
icelandic publisher which i'm sure we
11:45
all know about tunglio oh yeah so
11:47
tunglio these are the ones that they
11:50
publish their books
11:51
only on a full moon the night of a full
11:53
moon they publish in batches of 69
11:56
and if there are copies that are left
11:58
over at the end of the night they burn
12:00
the copies
12:00
so it's this odd publisher where it
12:02
allows for people to sort of get their
12:04
book out
12:05
but also not crowd the market they say
12:07
they take a lot of care and respect with
12:09
the burning of the books um they fuel
12:11
the flames with french cognac
12:12
and it's all done very classically or
12:15
wastefully depending on
12:17
your perspective yeah i hate cognac as
12:19
much as they hate books
12:22
um did you know george orwell when
12:24
animal farm was translated into french
12:26
it was called less animal park two which
12:29
is animals everywhere but he wanted it
12:31
to be called
12:32
union republic socialist animal which is
12:35
what it sounds like i guess republic of
12:37
socialist animals
12:38
that's because it would be shortened to
12:40
u r s
12:41
a which is french for bear and of course
12:43
that would be a nice
12:44
another reference to the russians
12:48
but they didn't go with it they went
12:50
with animals everywhere exclamation
12:52
marks which sounds like a fun romper
12:54
it does it sounds like a kid's book
12:55
where there's a mistake at the zoo and
12:57
animals get everywhere
12:59
yeah is there a bear in animal farm no
13:01
it's mostly farm animals
13:03
is there a half ape vampire lots of
13:05
those yeah
13:06
icelandic version you can't you can't
13:08
move forward
13:11
one final final thing about translation
13:12
is really tangential though
13:14
but there is a thing called the crew and
13:16
equipment translation aids which is on
13:19
the
13:19
international space station it's a
13:22
miniature train
13:23
there's a miniature train on the outside
13:24
of the international space station right
13:26
yeah i know and it's also called the
13:29
mobile transporter and nasa say that it
13:31
is simultaneously the fastest and
13:33
slowest train in the universe
13:36
is because it's spinning around the
13:37
earth exactly and slowest because it
13:39
takes
13:40
ten days to get to the next person yeah
13:42
it moves at one inch per second top
13:44
speed
13:46
well have they not heard of southern
13:47
rail
13:47
[Laughter]
13:55
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:57
that is james
13:58
okay my fact this week is out of the 360
14:02
million
14:03
camemberts made every year less than one
14:06
percent
14:07
are actually coming there um that's not
14:10
the fact i've got down here
14:11
no for what you said what have you got
14:14
out of the 360 million wheels of
14:16
camembert produced every year
14:18
only four are actually camembert uh well
14:20
that would be less than one percent
14:22
um but it would be a lot less than one
14:24
percent so this that was my original
14:26
fact admittedly
14:28
and i read it in the independent and i
14:30
think when they said
14:31
just for our true camembert i think they
14:34
meant four million
14:36
yes the disappointing discovery we all
14:38
made this morning we started researching
14:40
i would have fought unbelievably
14:41
expensive cheeses on the market
14:43
every year yeah if you just have four
14:45
small wheels of camembert produced
14:48
so what it is is the french have a
14:49
protected designation of origin label
14:51
which they put on real camembert
14:54
and in order to be a real camembert you
14:56
have to have used unfiltered raw milk
14:58
your cows can only be fed grass and hay
15:01
from local pastures
15:02
you're not allowed to move the milk more
15:04
than a couple of fields before you make
15:05
the cheese
15:07
you need to ladle it by hand and the
15:09
milk has to have a fat content of at
15:10
least 38 and
15:12
if you don't follow any of those rules
15:14
you can still
15:15
sell camembert like cheese but it's not
15:17
the official camber stuff
15:19
and i thought when i first read it that
15:21
only four cheeses
15:23
managed to do that but actually it seems
15:25
about four million which is still only
15:26
one percent which means
15:28
more often than not if you're buying a
15:30
random camembert cheese
15:31
it's likely to not be the real deal so
15:33
is it would it's somewhere on the
15:35
package
15:35
subtly say that or so the the stuff
15:37
which doesn't have that label is usually
15:39
labeled camembert fabrique on normandy
15:42
but it is camp it is like a lot of
15:44
places you know you can't use the actual
15:45
name of something unless it's made in
15:46
the place it was made or in a certain
15:47
way but it is camembert all this other
15:49
stuff it's just not made the normandy
15:51
way that camembert makers in france yes
15:53
i think camber should be
15:54
the proper way it's not the real deal
15:56
it's not the real deal yeah
15:58
i can't believe cheese generally in
16:00
shops isn't the real deal
16:01
i had no idea until i started looking
16:03
into this what do you mean well
16:04
it's all ham it's it's the sort of
16:08
regulations of what can be labeled as
16:10
cheese
16:12
means that only 51 of the product needs
16:14
to be cheese
16:16
the rest of it can be something else but
16:18
if 51
16:19
of it is cheese then you can call it a
16:21
cheese so why don't people just sell
16:22
smaller blocks of cheese just next to
16:24
some wood
16:25
because people wouldn't buy that would
16:26
they guess they wouldn't
16:28
that's why my little shop closed down
16:32
there was a um it was a kind of cheese
16:35
war over the camembert thing in 2007.
16:37
when i say a war
16:38
i mean a minor legal dispute but all the
16:41
big producers wanted to say
16:43
proper camembert is the stuff we're
16:45
making even though the milk is
16:47
pasteurized and the cows actually have
16:48
come from elsewhere and they're eating
16:50
grass from somewhere else still and you
16:52
know all of this stuff and there's not
16:53
38
16:54
fat uh it was a big legal dispute and
16:56
they the calls came down on the side of
16:58
the little guy
16:59
who's only making one percent of the
17:00
cheese yeah good for the courts they're
17:03
always the good guy the courts yep
17:04
[Laughter]
17:06
do you know there was only one family
17:07
making camembert until around the 1870s
17:12
and they were the direct descendants of
17:14
the lady who invented it
17:16
supposedly marie harrell they were good
17:19
pr people so i think her
17:21
grandson or maybe grandson-in-law met
17:23
napoleon in the third and brought a big
17:25
wheel of cheese
17:26
um to show him so then he became the
17:29
imperial supplier so then camembert was
17:30
a big deal there and um they also made
17:33
it in 1813 they made an honorary citizen
17:36
of the city of cayenne the cheese yeah
17:38
so camber became an honorary citizen the
17:40
pepper must have been pretty pissed off
17:42
if that hadn't been made
17:44
give it the cheese to the city very good
17:47
yeah
17:48
yeah strong guys have you heard
17:51
of the mondial du fromage no okay strap
17:54
in
17:54
this is the world's greatest cheese
17:57
mongering competition
17:59
oh yeah this is to be the best cheese
18:01
manga okay
18:02
uh it happens in france and this year
18:04
the first ever american got a medal i
18:06
think an american came third in the
18:07
competition
18:08
but it's held every other year and it is
18:11
so hard
18:12
it starts with a 20-question written
18:13
exam then there's a blind taste test
18:15
you have to get the name how it was made
18:17
the region the milk you used
18:19
and how long it was aged wow then you
18:22
have to cut four identical
18:23
25 gram pieces of cheese by hand with no
18:26
measuring tools you have to cut four
18:27
identical size pieces of cheese
18:29
then there's a five minute speech where
18:31
you have to present a cheese to the
18:32
judges and say why it's good then
18:33
there's a swimsuit round
18:35
that's the first morning then there's
18:37
more in the afternoon
18:38
and one 2015 competitor said the
18:40
afternoon is the four hardest hours of
18:42
cheese you can imagine
18:46
you have to make a cheese plate for the
18:47
judges and then do a carving out of
18:49
cheese and then do a large cheese board
18:51
and you have to justify all your
18:52
decisions
18:53
and what do you get at the end when
18:54
you've done all this i
18:56
don't think yeah there's probably a
18:58
small medal or a cash prize or not a big
19:00
cash prize but you just get the honor of
19:01
being the greatest cheese monkeys in the
19:03
world
19:03
that's right great yeah sounds really
19:05
fun they do take they take it very
19:07
seriously don't they they've got a
19:08
brotherhood of the knights of camembert
19:10
tasting which is like a mason society
19:13
for camembert tasters
19:14
um and they all have this huge fancy
19:16
dress festival once a year where they
19:17
dress up like masons and they have this
19:19
like really solemn come on yeah
19:26
it's a serious festival fantasy dress
19:28
it's fancy
19:29
fancy like mason's dress fancy dress
19:32
brackets
19:32
but be amazing i'm not inviting you to
19:34
our fancy dress party
19:36
oh she's coming to mason again which
19:39
cheese would you go as james
19:40
i think i'd go as a baby bell that's a
19:43
good one but with the wrapper on or off
19:45
um actually in hot wax i would i paint
19:48
my
19:48
face red half of it and then i'd shave
19:52
my hair
19:53
and the top of it would like be the open
19:54
bit of the baby bell and the bottom bit
19:56
would be the
19:57
close bit so it's just your head that's
19:58
the baby belt yeah yeah the rest of my
20:00
body all
20:00
shaped like a plate
20:06
is one of the rounds in the mondial de
20:07
formation
20:09
i think i'd go as a swiss cheese would
20:11
you yeah how would you make the holes
20:13
i'd fill a sheet with holes and i wear
20:15
the sheet
20:16
a yellow sheet obviously would you wear
20:18
anything under the sheets
20:19
no you better be careful where you put
20:22
the holes
20:23
what would you go as anna um i don't
20:26
know i can't think of any
20:27
cheese string maybe yeah peel bits off
20:30
myself as the evening went on
20:33
you could put all your hair up straight
20:34
and then slowly like take the strength
20:36
and take it down yes because i was
20:38
actually thinking of having to peel off
20:39
my entire skin which would have been
20:41
a real hassle of sacrifice dan's going
20:43
to get a lump of cheese which is
20:45
51 bigger than him just stand next to
20:48
you
20:50
i was going to go as a leg of ham just
20:52
really
20:54
charles once said how do you govern a
20:56
country which has 246 varieties of
20:58
cheese
21:00
what was the answer it was a rhetorical
21:03
question
21:04
but the answer is you sought out a
21:05
massive competition to work out who's
21:07
the best
21:08
cheese monger and actually um you just
21:11
reduced the numbers of cheese so they've
21:12
got far fewer cheeses than when he would
21:14
have said that
21:15
i think they've uh they've lost 50
21:16
cheeses in the last 30 years
21:18
no and there's something called the slow
21:20
food organization which is trying to
21:21
save endangered cheese
21:23
and other endangered food stuffs
21:24
actually but yeah it's like lots of
21:26
artisan cheeses have
21:27
disappeared britain has more cheeses
21:29
than france now don't we yes
21:32
and they're better well no they're not i
21:34
don't like any of them
21:35
got so are they actually extinct cheeses
21:38
or can we
21:39
reproduce them as in have the recipes
21:41
been lost i know the recipes will be
21:43
there it's just like how everything when
21:44
it starts being done on a large scale
21:46
you know the little artisan producers
21:47
get lost but the other thing is a lot of
21:49
these rely on certain
21:50
um strains of bacteria so it could be
21:53
that those strains have gone
21:54
oh yeah they might have gone extinct
21:56
you're right and even if you get it back
21:57
you don't know whether you've got
21:58
exactly the right
21:59
one anymore unless there's like a super
22:02
old guy in the village who remembers the
22:05
taste
22:06
of the extinct cheese and you bring it
22:08
to him and you let him
22:10
yeah i think there is one of those in
22:11
every french village actually they just
22:13
keep one old guy
22:14
yeah the cheese taster do you guys know
22:17
about the world's most dangerous cheese
22:19
oh no is it the cheese rolling people
22:22
because they're always injuring
22:23
themselves aren't they in
22:23
gloucestershire they always run down a
22:25
hill after some cheese
22:26
oh yeah and you're saying that cheese is
22:28
the world's most dangerous one chasing
22:29
after yeah it's not the cheese's fault
22:31
admittedly
22:31
that's like saying foxes are really
22:33
dangerous because a lot of people get
22:34
injured on fox hunts
22:36
you know it's not actually the fox's
22:37
fault is it no anyway it's not that
22:39
is this something that's not pasteurized
22:41
and might make you sick
22:44
that's full of maggots yeah
22:47
have we talked about that before i think
22:49
so it's great so it's from sardinia it's
22:51
actually illegal i think the eu banned
22:52
it a few years ago but that you can
22:54
still get it on the black market
22:56
um and yeah the way you make it is you
22:58
infest pecorino cheese with maggots with
23:00
these cheese fly maggots
23:01
and they eat the cheese and then they
23:03
excrete it while they're inside and
23:04
that's what adds the flavor so
23:05
apparently it's really kind of creamy
23:07
because their excretion of the cheese
23:09
and the way they processed it is tangy
23:10
and aromatic
23:12
do you have to eat the maggots you do
23:13
eat the maggots yeah because they're
23:14
inside
23:15
but it's quite a hassle picking them out
23:17
i think they jump out at you if i
23:19
remember rightly that's what people say
23:20
how lively are these maggots
23:22
i don't know you've got to be careful of
23:24
not getting hit in the face so why is it
23:25
dangerous to people die
23:27
on the eu decided on hygiene grounds i
23:30
don't think there have been any deaths
23:31
related to it so it's probably just
23:33
um health and safety gone i would be the
23:35
fussbot sitting there picking out every
23:37
single maggot you could just eat around
23:39
the maggots
23:40
yeah actually i just want to eat the
23:41
maggot excrement thank you very much
23:44
i think i'd go for a slightly less
23:46
flavoursome cheese
23:47
but without the maggots in it yeah i'm
23:49
willing to put up with a slightly less
23:51
flavor
23:52
that's a good idea yeah like i like
23:53
cheddar
23:55
i'll just have chatter
23:57
[Applause]
24:02
okay it is time for fact number three
24:04
and that is andy
24:05
my fact is that norway's coastline is so
24:07
long that if you took a piece of string
24:09
along it and then stretched it out it
24:10
would run around the whole planet
24:12
two and a half times okay so it needs to
24:15
be quite a long piece of string
24:16
yeah you don't get balls of string that
24:18
big i don't think in your local hardware
24:20
store
24:20
a few and then tie them together yeah i
24:22
was dreaming about this last night
24:24
actually
24:25
weirdly it was genuinely in my dream i
24:27
thought what if you had a long enough
24:28
string
24:28
that could go around the world which
24:30
would be shorter than the string you
24:31
need for norway
24:32
right because you need uh yeah you need
24:35
two and a half two and a half of those
24:36
if you managed to get that kind of
24:38
string and you tied it to the coast of
24:40
um let's say england and you just set
24:42
off could you wrap the world
24:44
in that string if you went completely
24:46
around i suppose in theory you could
24:48
yeah but here's something for you
24:50
imagine you added three feet of string
24:53
to that one that's going all the way
24:54
around the world
24:55
and then you made it tight how much
24:58
above the
24:59
surface of the earth would it be oh do
25:02
you know what i mean by that yeah yeah
25:03
hold on so you so so that you could lift
25:05
it a bit looser if you have
25:06
three feet dan's holding a piece of
25:08
string yeah i carry it all the way
25:10
around the world
25:11
yeah and then give him the other end
25:13
yeah and then we add
25:14
an extra three feet of string to it
25:17
yeah how much higher would it go i would
25:19
say it will basically not be higher at
25:21
all yeah like a fraction of a millimeter
25:23
that's what you think the actual answer
25:24
is 5.7
25:26
inches about 6 inches and it's basically
25:29
maths and the circumference of a circle
25:32
and this six
25:33
inch difference is the same whether it's
25:35
the size of the earth
25:36
or whether you just put it around your
25:38
stomach for instance no
25:40
if you add the three feet it would just
25:42
move out by that amount
25:44
wow that is amazing that is really cool
25:47
that is an old
25:48
paradox which was originally the
25:50
earliest i found of it was 1702.
25:53
oh cool book by william whitston i don't
25:56
really understand that but i'm very
25:57
impressed
25:58
yeah super cool so just on norway
26:00
quickly yeah
26:01
um this was sent to me actually by a guy
26:03
on twitter called at yplac
26:05
he used to work for a ferry company in
26:07
norway for a string company
26:13
and he said that he learned if you took
26:14
a piece of string and ran it along
26:15
norway's coastline you could run it from
26:17
london to bangkok and back again
26:18
but that might have been before there
26:21
was a recalculation of the coast of
26:22
norway by some geographers in 2011
26:25
uh and the basic point is that norway
26:28
is one of the most complicated
26:29
coastlines on the planet because it has
26:31
all these fjords
26:32
where instead of going straight north to
26:34
south it goes in for 100 miles and then
26:37
out for 100 miles again yeah so you've
26:38
added 200 miles to the coast even though
26:40
you're only 50 meters further along it
26:42
yeah um so norway is unbelievably
26:44
crinkly yeah i think they added
26:46
uh if you leave out the fjords it's
26:48
1573. and if you include them it's 18
26:51
000
26:51
miles of coastline wow it is
26:53
unbelievable but that's i was looking
26:55
into the
26:55
the biggest coastlines um in the world
26:58
by numbers and
27:00
canada is number one yeah but what
27:02
canada you'll be able to go around the
27:03
earth five times
27:05
yes yeah um and what what kind of
27:07
shocked me was that
27:08
japan is ahead of australia which
27:11
doesn't make sense when you think about
27:12
it because
27:13
if you look at the sizes of the two
27:14
places australia's got way more coast
27:16
but what japan has is all these tiny
27:18
islands
27:19
which constitute being japan so when you
27:21
add all of them up
27:22
they're ahead of australia it's nuts
27:24
yeah this is why this fact is
27:25
strange right because actually every
27:27
list could be different right in terms
27:28
the longest coastline depending on the
27:30
way that you're measuring it
27:32
so a coastline can be infinitely long so
27:34
imagine you've got a
27:35
meter long ruler then you're only
27:38
measuring uh
27:38
contour every metre and so it's going to
27:40
be much much shorter than if you go
27:42
around with a one centimeter measure
27:44
and you'll measure much more lumps and
27:46
bumps it's like if you got a 30
27:47
centimeter ruler with some lumps and
27:49
bumps in it and then you actually ran a
27:51
string all the way in and out of the
27:52
lumps and bumps that piece of string
27:53
would be much longer than 30 centimeters
27:55
so actually norway's coastline could
27:57
theoretically go
27:58
to the end of the universe and back it's
28:00
not quite infinite because
28:01
there's a minimum length that you can
28:03
have which is the planck length
28:04
you can't measure anything smaller than
28:06
the plank length but that is really
28:07
really really really
28:08
really really really really really
28:10
really really really really small it's
28:12
mini
28:12
so if we measured the coastline of me
28:14
for example just around my body if we
28:16
went
28:17
super close if we worked our way around
28:19
all of your
28:20
individual hairs yeah and then all of
28:22
your cells and all of your paws
28:24
yeah you could you could wrap around the
28:25
world that's awesome but you know that
28:27
that's you know that's just
28:28
logic if you think about it isn't it so
28:30
i'm trying to talk it down this is an
28:31
amazing fact that everything everything
28:33
is nearly infinite but no one really
28:35
knew this until the 20th century the
28:36
mid-20th century
28:37
when and the first person to really work
28:39
it out was a guy called louis frey
28:41
richardson
28:42
who wanted to work out whether the
28:44
likelihood of two countries going to war
28:46
depended on the length of their border
28:49
okay
28:50
so he looked at a load of different
28:51
borders and for instance when he looked
28:53
at the spain portugal border
28:54
he found that spain thought it was
28:57
kilometers
28:58
but portugal thought it was 1214
29:01
kilometers
29:02
and then they immediately went to war
29:03
over the why they've stolen 300
29:05
kilometers of our border
29:06
bastards and then it was picked up
29:10
by mandelbrot and all the mathematicians
29:12
who did all this fractal stuff
29:13
yeah he was amazing mandelbrot so i
29:15
hadn't really heard of him before this
29:16
but he was a mathematician and he wrote
29:18
an academic paper which was called how
29:20
long is the coast of britain
29:21
and he said it's impossible uh for the
29:24
same reason that the closer you look the
29:25
more crinkly something gets
29:27
um but norway is special
29:30
so norway has a larger what they call a
29:32
fractal dimension
29:34
than other countries really just it's
29:36
more crinkly yeah
29:37
yeah okay so on the fjords the fjords
29:41
the deepest fjord this one was actually
29:43
also said to be by
29:44
white black the deepest field is so deep
29:47
that if you got to the deepest point of
29:50
the deepest one
29:51
right you know the burj khalifa the
29:53
tallest building in the world yeah
29:54
you could strap the empire state
29:57
building to the top of the burj khalifa
30:00
and drop the whole thing into the
30:01
deepest fjord and it would still
30:03
be more than a hundred meters from the
30:05
surface it's a lot of effort just to
30:06
prove that point isn't it yeah and also
30:08
you won't be able to see it because it's
30:09
underwater yeah
30:10
i don't know i think i just believe it
30:12
yeah and also the birch leaf is very
30:14
pointy at the top and actually
30:15
probably you should probably put the
30:16
empire state building at the bottom and
30:17
then the bird khalifa on top no because
30:19
you've got a very
30:20
pointy bit at the top of the empire
30:21
state building as well they're both
30:22
pointy at the top
30:23
it's not gonna work are you counting are
30:25
you counting the pointy bit at the top
30:26
of the empire state building you know
30:27
the bit that they used to
30:29
attach blimps to all right it's probably
30:30
96 meters from the top if you don't
30:32
count the bit these attach blimps too
30:34
but you could if you put the empire
30:36
state building at the bottom then you
30:37
could use the
30:38
spike to impale the other one on top of
30:40
and that would be how you welded them
30:41
together
30:42
you could do the same the other way
30:43
around though you could impale the
30:44
bottom of the bus
30:45
yeah you're right no you're right it's a
30:47
thank you for coming up with a solution
30:48
yeah
30:48
i think it's a good idea really i think
30:50
we should do it i reckon just like
30:52
normal measuring equipment
30:54
like sonar might be better yeah i'm so
30:57
sorry for
30:58
reading out a fact that someone sent me
31:00
which is a very i think visually
31:01
creative
31:02
means
31:05
imagine if we did measure stuff using
31:07
skyscrapers every time we had to measure
31:08
something new we had to take down the
31:10
skyscraper and drop it in an ocean
31:13
if we measured the coastline of norway
31:15
with the burj al khalifa it would be a
31:17
lot shorter
31:18
yeah that's a very good point so we
31:21
should do it
31:23
just one more thing on norway's amazing
31:26
engineering
31:27
feats um there's a little town called
31:37
yeah there's a little town called ryuken
31:40
and um it's got 3400 people there
31:43
and the problem that this town has had
31:44
um forever really
31:46
is that it's in amongst the mountain
31:48
range and it's constantly in shade
31:50
so for a lot of the year they just don't
31:53
see sun they can see sun at the top of
31:54
the mountain hitting the mountain but
31:56
they're just covered in shade it's been
31:57
a massive problem
31:58
and there's been tiny things to sort of
32:00
try and fix it like um a service a cable
32:02
car service was
32:04
started so you could pay a small amount
32:06
go up the cable car and just experience
32:08
some sun
32:09
and then come back down again as a
32:10
little ride so they've recently
32:12
fixed it this is a few years ago now an
32:15
engineer came up with an
32:16
idea of creating three massive
32:18
solar-powered
32:19
mirrors that now reflect the sun into
32:23
the valley
32:24
and now they live in sunlight again and
32:26
it tracks where the sun is going
32:27
throughout
32:28
the day so the mirror moves towards it
32:29
to make sure the sunlight is always
32:31
pushing down so this town that was in
32:33
permanent shade is now
32:35
sunny all the time it's now being
32:37
constantly fried by
32:38
incredibly concentrated beams of heat if
32:40
you want to kill an
32:41
ant go to ryuk
32:44
that is amazing it's cool eh i mean what
32:46
a solution but then
32:48
you also think why build a town there in
32:50
the first place yes
32:51
exactly i guess it's easier than moving
32:53
the town to the top of the mountain
32:55
yeah but it's not like 50 years ago that
32:57
town would have been in sunshine
32:58
no you're right maybe the mountain's
33:00
grown you know how everest has grown a
33:01
bit i'll shrunk a bit perhaps the
33:02
mountain's growing by 100 meters or so
33:04
everest just shrunk by
33:06
one inch yeah i think so perhaps the
33:08
exact same thing has happened except in
33:10
reverse and to a much greater faster
33:11
extent
33:13
also my lawn is growing at the moment
33:16
and the bit of it isn't growing very
33:17
well because it's in the shade a lot
33:18
because it's next to the
33:20
vents so where can i get these mirrors
33:23
a mirror store i'm guessing oh you want
33:25
the solar powered ones yeah
33:26
really i mean that's going to be better
33:28
as you need to go to ryukan
33:30
yeah and steal one the village has been
33:32
left in darkness due to one englishman's
33:36
whim
33:37
[Applause]
33:42
okay it is time for our final
33:45
we say fact
33:46
[Laughter]
33:49
and that is attitude my facts
33:52
this week is that now prepare yourselves
33:55
for this you've got to focus
33:57
beef stroganoff is named after the great
33:59
grandson
34:00
of the person who brought human chess to
34:03
russia
34:05
that's a great fact uh is it it's a
34:08
strong enough part of beef stroganoff
34:09
we're talking about
34:10
or was it not mr b he was constantly
34:14
getting into fights with people
34:17
his crest was a big cow in the world
34:19
what's your beef
34:20
[Laughter]
34:24
it wasn't beef it was a stroganoff
34:25
family so this was a
34:27
big um noble family in russia from i
34:30
think about the 16th century but
34:31
certainly well into the 19th and early
34:33
20th century
34:34
and so there was count alexander
34:36
stroganoff who
34:37
um in the very early 19th century
34:39
decided to turn his townhouse lawn into
34:42
a chessboard a giant chessboard
34:43
for fun and he had his servants beat all
34:45
the pieces and he dressed them all up as
34:47
a different pieces
34:48
and then he had the game be orchestrated
34:50
by chess players so there was one that
34:52
was
34:52
there were two grand masters at the time
34:54
or i don't know if they had grandmasters
34:55
but players of the time
34:56
called count ivan ostermann and lev
34:58
narishkin
35:00
and they told the servants where to move
35:02
and they moved and that was introducing
35:04
chest to russia yeah
35:05
human gestures and then
35:09
fast forward a hundred years um his
35:12
great-grandson is called pavel
35:15
sergeyevich stroganov
35:16
and he apparently had a chef
35:20
who came up with stroganoff the dish and
35:22
named after this family and now there
35:24
are some
35:25
stories that say that it was his
35:27
grandfather pavel
35:28
who initially inspired it and it's been
35:30
the family for years
35:31
so maybe it was named after the chess
35:33
guy's son um but our first mention of
35:35
stroganoff that we have is from the
35:37
1880s 1890s
35:39
and named after pavel i think we think
35:41
that probably isn't named after him
35:43
right
35:43
it's it's one of these it could be an
35:45
apocalypse yeah it'll be named after the
35:47
family yeah
35:47
um i just love this connection also i
35:50
just spent a long time reading about the
35:51
stroganoff family it is a connection
35:53
between
35:53
two things that you wouldn't say are
35:55
household items
35:56
really would you it's not like the guy
35:59
who invented the fork is the grandson of
36:01
the guy who invented dogs
36:03
i play human journey the fork came
36:05
before the dog
36:06
yeah i'm saying it's not that it's the
36:08
other way around
36:10
the ground the guy who invented the dog
36:11
invented the fork yeah wow
36:13
i have um a couple of human chest pieces
36:16
in my house
36:17
um do you mean humans yeah i do so
36:20
actually
36:20
you know i just call that a household
36:22
item yeah that's good for you
36:26
i didn't really think much about it
36:28
until starting researching this fact
36:29
i didn't realize that it was a big thing
36:31
in for example
36:32
russia and there's a there's a there's a
36:34
festival in italy every two it's not big
36:36
it's not a big thing no and actually i
36:38
don't think you'll continue thinking
36:39
about it after we've researched this
36:41
fact
36:42
yeah but it is a thing that happens
36:44
sometimes so there is a place in italy
36:45
which has one massive match every two
36:47
years and they dress up in historical
36:48
costumes
36:49
and i think they actually act out a
36:51
particular chess game
36:52
oh yeah yes they do it's one that was
36:54
written about in a novel this is in
36:55
maristica isn't it
36:57
yes it is isn't it the story of a famous
37:00
match played between
37:01
two knights who were both wanting to
37:04
court
37:05
a princess and the winner was allowed to
37:08
court the princess what yeah i think
37:09
that's the
37:09
story behind either of them could get to
37:11
her because they could only move two
37:12
steps forward
37:15
wait hang on that's the story of how we
37:17
got a human chest no the story of
37:19
the game that's played every two years
37:21
the exact game
37:22
and that's what they're celebrating
37:24
supposedly the original game
37:25
that they are following the moves of
37:27
were played by two knights who played a
37:29
game of
37:30
normal chess normal chess it's in a
37:32
story it's written about in a fictional
37:33
story in the early 20th century yeah
37:35
none of it's real
37:36
have you heard of chess city it's in
37:37
russia no okay it's in a it's in one of
37:40
the southern uh provinces
37:41
uh it's southwest russia and it's in a
37:44
town called elista
37:45
and it there's an enclave in that town
37:47
which is a mini
37:49
chess city and it was built by our old
37:51
friend
37:52
uh kirsan ilyunjinov who
37:55
and yeah who until 2010 was uh the
37:58
leader of this province
38:00
and he is also the head of the
38:01
international chess federation he's the
38:03
one who claims
38:04
to have been abducted by aliens anything
38:06
so sweet corn and chess are from outer
38:08
space or something
38:08
exactly and in 1998 to host the 33rd
38:11
chess olympiad
38:12
he built chess city which has a chess
38:15
museum
38:16
a large open-air chessboard and a museum
38:18
of buddhist art
38:19
wow because there are a lot of buddhists
38:21
living in illinois
38:23
mars incorporated are one of the biggest
38:25
pet food companies
38:26
in america they might be the biggest
38:28
actually and
38:30
they make beef stroganoff for pets for
38:33
dogs
38:33
specifically why didn't they call it
38:35
beef dog
38:37
because that would be like cannibalism
38:39
yeah that's confusing
38:43
you don't want to eat like an andy
38:45
lasagna do you
38:46
[Laughter]
38:50
um but these thai green murray
38:55
anyway these kind of things they they
38:57
make a hundred million dollars in annual
38:59
sales these kind of human-like
39:01
pets wow that's so weird i really want
39:04
to verify this there are books on chess
39:06
history that say that
39:08
charles martel who is charlemagne's
39:10
grandfather
39:11
is the person who invented human chess
39:13
originally in the world
39:15
and they claimed that he played a game
39:17
of living chess i think in the eighth
39:19
century um when he was at war with arab
39:21
forces and they introduced chess to them
39:23
um and he had his servants play it if
39:25
anyone has any
39:27
first-hand evidence that happened i'd
39:28
really enjoy everything first-hand
39:30
evidence charles
39:33
tells exact words there's actually one
39:35
really old guy in every french village
39:37
who was part of that game
39:41
my grandfather was a pawn
39:45

01:40
[Music]
01:44
[Applause]
01:47
[Music]
01:48
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:52
no such thing as a fish
01:53
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:55
qi offices in covent garden
01:57
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:59
here with anna chazinski
02:00
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
02:03
and once again we have gathered around
02:04
the microphones with our four
02:06
favorite facts from the last seven days
02:08
and in no particular order
02:09
here we go starting with you chozinski
02:13
my fact this week is that in china you
02:15
can hire mistress dispellers
02:17
to lure away your husband's mistress
02:20
incredible
02:21
yeah what if your husband doesn't have a
02:22
mistress do you have to hire a mistress
02:24
yeah and then hire a mistress dispeller
02:26
costs twice as much
02:27
and it's almost futile this was a piece
02:30
of the new yorker
02:31
which they did on this new thing which
02:33
is becoming bigger and bigger which are
02:35
these companies that call themselves
02:37
mistress dispellers
02:38
and if your husband has a mistress that
02:40
you know about and i think people
02:41
a lot of men in china are quite unsubtle
02:44
about it
02:45
then you go to one of these mysterious
02:46
dispelling services and you say can you
02:48
sort this out and they charge
02:50
tens of thousands of dollars but they do
02:52
a really
02:53
comprehensive service they have like a
02:55
psychotherapist they have lawyers
02:57
um and it's a two-pronged attack so one
03:00
psychotherapist goes to the mistress
03:02
and lures her away so for instance there
03:05
was one case where a mistress was
03:06
convinced by the therapist to get a job
03:08
in a different city
03:09
yeah they they're banned from getting
03:11
emotionally uh involved although there
03:13
are stories of some male mistress
03:14
dispellers who will start having an
03:16
affair with the mistress yeah
03:18
and there because there are lots of
03:19
different companies so lots of them do
03:20
different things so there are some
03:21
companies that say
03:22
don't get involved but then there are
03:24
other companies that openly say our
03:25
mistress dispellers are attractive men
03:27
they're there to seduce the mistresses
03:29
what's uh you guys probably know this
03:30
i'm surprised i don't what is the
03:32
male mistress master justin
03:36
well mistress is a feminine version of
03:38
the word master that's etymologically
03:40
but
03:40
i wouldn't say i think my wife's got a
03:42
master you'd say
03:44
she's got a fancy man right sorry i
03:46
thank you man
03:47
that's what i'd say so that obviously
03:49
there's no equivalent because we've
03:50
lived in a very
03:51
sexist society for the last four
03:53
thousand years but mr fancy man
03:56
i know we may not have the wording but
03:57
are there fancy man dispellers in china
04:00
as well as i don't think there are
04:01
because it's just not such a commonplace
04:03
thing
04:03
isn't it true i read somewhere that like
04:05
actual family counsellors and
04:07
people like that really don't think this
04:08
is a particularly good idea at all
04:10
that sounds very plausible i read that
04:13
it was
04:14
um the director of the guangdong
04:16
province marriage and family counselors
04:18
association
04:19
who says really these problems need to
04:20
be solved between the husband and the
04:22
wife
04:22
rather than spending tens of thousands
04:24
of pounds
04:26
no absolutely not you need to spend
04:27
forty five thousand dollars
04:29
it's hiring someone to trick your
04:30
mistress into leaving you
04:33
it's funny because in if it's a
04:35
traditional family where the husband is
04:36
earning
04:37
the money and and sharing it with the
04:39
wife the wife then goes and spends the
04:41
money on getting rid of the mistress
04:43
so it'll it's it's money's circling
04:45
around do you see what i mean
04:46
yeah yeah the man is the breadwinner
04:48
it's in the husband's own money that's
04:49
being spent on getting rid of his
04:50
mistress
04:51
yes which is quite pleasing do you think
04:53
he notices and says what's happened to
04:55
all of our money and then the wife says
04:57
well i've
04:57
i spent it on disposing of that woman
05:00
but i think that's probably the problem
05:01
is that
05:02
um some of the case studies where they
05:04
produce um
05:05
accounts from the wives and the reason
05:07
they've done it in some cases they've
05:09
said too much money is disappearing from
05:11
the family account
05:12
because these guys with the mistresses
05:14
have gone too far in they're spending
05:16
way too much money on them
05:18
by throwing thousands of dollars more
05:20
yeah i guess yeah
05:21
you'll have lots of very happy marriages
05:24
of extremely poor people
05:26
yeah um i found another curious job
05:30
this is a website tester so basically a
05:34
lot of people release
05:34
new websites they've created and they're
05:36
way too complicated in some cases
05:38
unusable not very friendly so
05:40
this is called this user is my mom and
05:42
it's this guy's
05:43
mum who is very bad at the internet
05:46
tests out your website and says out loud
05:48
i
05:48
don't understand what is this doing how
05:50
does this lead and he writes you a
05:51
report
05:52
and his mom just tests what's
05:53
interesting about this is it's a job
05:55
where the more you do it the worse you
05:56
get at it yeah
05:58
because yeah you'd get more proficient
06:00
on the internet so you wouldn't be
06:01
as stupid yes yeah it's still going to
06:03
be replaced because she must be secretly
06:05
ripped
06:06
she must be replaced you can't secretly
06:08
replace someone's mother like you might
06:10
do a hamster
06:11
i don't know if you'd notice um there is
06:14
this isn't really a job this is one
06:15
bloke but the um james you and i were
06:17
talking about uh china's doing this
06:19
massive face recognition drive at the
06:20
moment oh yeah
06:21
and they're installing facial
06:23
recognition technology everywhere
06:25
uh and you need it now to get into your
06:27
taxi app on your phone or you need to
06:29
get into your
06:29
your you know digital wallet or all this
06:31
stuff yeah but
06:33
there is a guy called i think he's
06:34
called wang heng and last year he beat
06:37
um a facial recognition software machine
06:40
he's one of these super recognizers
06:42
right
06:42
and he played three rounds against a
06:44
machine and it was a draw for the first
06:45
two rounds and then he won the third one
06:46
but on the tv show he was on last year
06:49
he successfully identified a single
06:51
glass of water
06:52
from more than 520 identical glasses of
06:55
water
06:57
what yep
07:00
well the one thing here is they can't
07:02
have been identical yeah
07:04
they were identical to you and i but
07:07
really
07:07
wang saw what did he see in it what are
07:09
you seeing in the dancing water i don't
07:11
know whether that was the only one which
07:13
was
07:14
that one was half
07:17
i went to a club the other week and um
07:20
they had facial recognition
07:21
stuff so you went with your id and they
07:24
scanned your id and then they scanned
07:25
your face
07:26
and it had to look the same otherwise
07:27
they wouldn't let you in really
07:29
but mine didn't look the same because my
07:30
ideas from when i was about 18
07:34
when i had short hair um but they just
07:35
let me go anyway
07:37
they must look at the age it was taken
07:39
out in there yeah i thought
07:40
that guy is obviously this guy needs a
07:42
drink
07:49
that was the same club i tried to get
07:50
into at the weekend to meet you and they
07:52
didn't let me in no
07:53
but then i didn't bring any id so that's
07:55
probably they couldn't scan it just
07:56
brought a glass of water
07:59
wait are you guys hanging out on the
08:00
weekend yeah what the hell we went to a
08:02
party
08:03
oh dude you guys were invited i think
08:04
weren't you i don't know i just
08:06
just not mentioned it yeah well i've
08:08
been doing a bit of extra research
08:09
because i've been
08:10
free at the weekend i was reading about
08:13
sort of the
08:14
king's mistress which in france was an
08:16
official position for centuries you know
08:17
you'd get your own flats and you get an
08:19
official title
08:20
um so madame de pompadour was an
08:22
extremely famous uh mistress to louis xv
08:25
uh for 20 years despite the fact that
08:27
they didn't really sleep together
08:28
she found other women for him to go to
08:30
bed with and then she would just talk to
08:32
him
08:32
but she's a pimp well no she's more of a
08:35
madam
08:36
madam madam yeah well she's madame de
08:39
[Laughter]
08:42
but she used to be called miss fish she
08:44
was called mamzel
08:45
before she was uh elevated was that her
08:47
surname you mean
08:48
yeah yeah yeah but when she met louis
08:50
xiv it was at a ball in 1745 where she
08:53
was dressed as a shepherdess and he was
08:55
dressed as a tree
08:56
[Laughter]
08:59
so did she bring her sheep underneath
09:01
him to shelter from the rain or
09:02
something yeah i think that was it yeah
09:03
yeah
09:04
so romantic very cool until 2006 in
09:07
america
09:08
if you wanted to get divorced you could
09:09
get divorced in guam
09:11
by mail so um both of the people could
09:14
write to guam and say we want to get
09:16
divorced and they would just do it
09:18
you need never have ever been to guam
09:20
you could just do that and that was a
09:22
legal thing
09:23
wow and then they changed the law so now
09:26
you can still get
09:27
divorced in guam but you need to have
09:29
stayed there for eight days
09:30
uh and no one does it anymore yeah cause
09:32
guam is really far from everyone
09:36
imagine how suspicious you'd be as the
09:37
partner when they say hey i've booked us
09:39
a holiday
09:39
to guam work for eight days off
09:44
so benjamin franklin wrote a letter
09:47
which was advice
09:48
to a friend on choosing a mistress have
09:51
any of you read this
09:52
yeah bedside reading it's not going well
09:55
as andy
09:56
so this is
10:00
that is harsh i've just been dispelled
10:04
they didn't dispel the mistress they
10:05
dispelled their husband it was the only
10:08
case they decided to change policy
10:11
she's way better off with that other guy
10:15
a fancy man
10:18
he still uses phrases like fantasy man
10:20
i've got it
10:21
what is the phrase what's the word well
10:23
master according to james
10:25
that's i was talking etymological right
10:28
bit on the side
10:28
that's it squeeze squeeze squeeze
10:41
speaking of centuries so ben franklin in
10:43
the 18th century
10:44
wrote this letter to a friend of his
10:46
called cadwalla colton
10:48
who had had written a letter to ben
10:50
franklin saying i really want a mistress
10:52
and a mistress in those days wasn't
10:53
someone who you were cheating on your
10:54
wife with it was just if you didn't have
10:56
a wife
10:56
anyone you wanted to have sex with was
10:58
your mistress um so
11:00
then the way you got this was you wrote
11:01
to benjamin franklin and he would he
11:03
would get his mum
11:04
to look through a list of people
11:08
maybe his mum was involved because his
11:10
first piece of advice was choose an
11:11
older woman
11:12
yeah when
11:16
anyway he wrote this letter in 1745 and
11:19
it was actually genuinely quite good
11:20
advice
11:21
um and first of all it said actually i
11:22
advise you get married but if you will
11:24
insist on not getting married for a
11:25
while
11:26
first of all get married to an older
11:27
woman because they're smarter they've
11:29
lived longer they've got better chat
11:30
um and also he said there's no hazard of
11:33
children
11:34
which irregularly produced may be
11:35
attended with much inconvenience
11:38
um so he's talking about quite an older
11:40
woman well indeed postmenopausal
11:42
um and he also says when they stop being
11:44
beautiful they study to be good in other
11:46
ways
11:47
you say good advice but it sounds a
11:48
little misogynistic
11:50
i don't know what you're talking about
11:51
james i'm the woman here and i think
11:52
he's right
11:54
the feminist money
11:57
but this is interesting he says don't
12:00
worry about the appearance issue because
12:02
even though in old age uh some bits get
12:04
wrinkly it starts from the top
12:06
down so he says the face first gets
12:08
wrinkled then the neck
12:09
and then the breasts and arms but the
12:11
lower parts continue to last as plump as
12:13
ever
12:14
so that if you cover all above with a
12:16
basket and regard only what is below the
12:18
girdle
12:19
it is impossible to know an old woman
12:21
from a young woman absolutely right this
12:22
is feminist
12:23
happy birthday darling get the uh get
12:25
the basket ready
12:28
i've had to upgrade you to a deeper
12:29
basket
12:32
basket franklin signed off with you
12:35
should see my mum she's got a basket on
12:36
them
12:36
she's all right um a teacher actually
12:40
got in trouble
12:41
for using a quote from this letter in
12:43
his classroom but
12:44
this is his teacher in oklahoma and he
12:46
had a picture in his classroom of a cat
12:48
and he had the quote in the dark all
12:50
cats are grey
12:52
which maybe is saying something about
12:53
don't judge my appearance and um
12:55
actually franklin said in this letter
12:57
also you don't need to worry about the
12:58
appearance because
12:59
in the dark all cats are grey um as in
13:01
doesn't know you turn the lights out not
13:03
an issue
13:03
um and this teacher got suspended right
13:06
it's quite an old gag as well i mean
13:07
that was used by
13:08
one of the russians catherine the great
13:10
or peter the great or somebody
13:12
was about the same kind of era it would
13:14
have been a lot darker then as well
13:15
right because
13:16
this is pre-electricity so yeah just
13:19
when it gets dark you've
13:20
either got your candles or you're so are
13:22
you saying people even
13:23
more were even more familiar with
13:25
darkness
13:26
like might as well not have even
13:27
bothered yeah i mean
13:30
what's the point of having color if
13:32
you're a cat in the olden days cat's
13:33
colorblind anyway
13:35
no no no i think i'm talking of dogs
13:38
yeah
13:39
all dogs are grey to all other dogs all
13:42
the time
13:44
do you know that the first ever divorce
13:45
in america
13:47
was due to bigamy i was a guy called
13:49
james luxford
13:50
and he was fined 100 pounds and
13:53
sentenced to an hour in the stocks
13:54
but they gave him an even worse
13:56
punishment which is the worst they could
13:58
come up with they banished him to
13:59
england
14:01
wow that is rough i guess if you're an
14:04
american being sent back to england is
14:05
embarrassing because it's like being
14:06
sent back to your mom's house yeah yeah
14:07
it is that's exactly what it is because
14:09
they were all english they'd all come
14:11
over for their new life
14:12
yeah okay like okay we don't need you
14:14
here anymore yeah head off back to
14:16
england
14:16
do you think he went back to england and
14:17
went didn't even like it there anyway it
14:18
was rubbish
14:20
too many wives
14:29
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:31
that is
14:32
james my fact this week is that richard
14:34
nixon's chair was 2.5 inches higher than
14:36
everyone else's in the cabinet room
14:40
it was amazing so i read this in an
14:42
article in international business times
14:44
and it's about how much money donald
14:46
trump has spent on furnishings for the
14:48
white house
14:49
so in four months he spent 133 thousand
14:52
dollars
14:53
which is triple what obama spent but one
14:55
of the things he bought was a conference
14:57
table from a company
14:58
called kittenger and on kittinger's
15:00
website it says that they
15:02
got this stuff for richard nixon
15:04
including a
15:05
24 chairs around the table one of which
15:07
was 2.5 inches higher than the rest
15:10
and that was for him it's just the back
15:11
i think yeah the back of the chair isn't
15:13
it
15:14
wait the the back of the chair so it
15:15
means just the just the horizontal but
15:17
it supports your back but surely if
15:18
that's higher then you will look a bit
15:19
shorter relatively in your chair
15:21
i think the idea being that you have
15:23
such a magnificent chair
15:25
like 2.5 inches that people give you a
15:27
bit more kind of leeway because
15:29
like it's like a throne isn't it yeah
15:30
yeah big throne that the queen sits on
15:32
presumably i don't know does she sit on
15:34
a big throat yeah
15:35
yeah i imagine she sits on one a bit
15:36
like the game of thrones i am thrown
15:38
yeah a bit less bony but okay yeah a bit
15:40
less made of swords
15:41
yeah but she did at the opening of
15:43
parliament yeah oh yeah and
15:45
one of the reasons because obviously
15:46
they were mucking around with when they
15:47
were gonna have a queen speech
15:49
i think part of the reason that she was
15:51
angry they said it was gonna be because
15:52
she was going to miss ascot and she
15:54
loves seeing the horses
15:55
but also i think it's because she
15:58
normally practices wearing the crown for
16:00
a week before
16:02
the ceremony cause it's really heavy
16:03
it's extremely heavy yeah
16:05
and so i think she wasn't she didn't
16:06
know when to start practicing
16:08
it's a little bit like the guy's mum
16:10
with the website though right she's been
16:11
wearing the crown
16:12
so often now that surely she is used to
16:15
it at this point surely her neck muscles
16:16
are permanently
16:17
look at the queen she doesn't look like
16:19
frank bruno with a massive neck does
16:22
she anyway sorry chairs
16:25
yeah can i just ask if because nixon
16:28
ordered the kittens
16:29
table and do you think he actually was
16:32
looking for kissinger
16:33
and he just mispronounced it and it was
16:35
all a big mistake is that the we want
16:37
you
16:37
guy in the poster that's lord kitchener
16:40
from the first world war
16:41
in the other country so kitchener had
16:43
very little to do with richard nixon
16:44
whereas kissinger and nixon were a very
16:46
strong partnership for a very long time
16:47
oh yeah yeah but he did try and buy some
16:50
furniture for his kitchen and
16:51
accidentally got a poster
16:56
but sorry just to say um i read um
16:58
there's a book called believer my 40
17:00
years in politics by david axelrod
17:03
who's the chief strategist for barack
17:05
obama's presidential campaign
17:07
and he says that obama's chair was
17:09
slightly taller right he was president
17:11
so was it not the same check it's the
17:12
same table still i think it i thought it
17:14
was maybe it's not actually yeah i don't
17:16
know
17:17
so the cabinet office in downing street
17:20
the prime minister chair is the only one
17:21
with arms on
17:23
and this has prompted a diplomatic row
17:25
in the past in 1979 the president of
17:28
france
17:28
uh valerie gisca destang was visiting
17:30
the uk and he was going to visit
17:32
thatcher in the cabinet room and his
17:34
aides said yes could he have a chair
17:36
with equal status to the prime minister
17:37
please
17:38
and they said what and they said well
17:40
it's very simple
17:41
either he wants one with arms or you
17:43
have to put that one in the corner
17:45
and thatcher has to have one without
17:46
arms and they had to write to the
17:48
british ambassador in paris and say look
17:50
can you sort this out and he wrote back
17:52
saying
17:52
yeah they're really serious about this
17:54
thing so they were insistent
17:56
we're actually still at war with them
18:00
the ambassador said his first reaction
18:01
uh was to think that the obvious
18:03
solution was to stand the prime
18:04
minister's chair in a corner and have
18:06
her seated on the same sort of chair as
18:07
the president he thought the president
18:08
would be very surprised if it was
18:09
otherwise
18:10
so it is unfortunately it's not recorded
18:13
how they solved it but
18:14
i think the obvious solution is to have
18:15
one sit on the other's lap and then they
18:17
switch around halfway through right
18:19
hey the other difference um of cabinet
18:21
chairs in the british cabinet room
18:24
uh is that the prime minister's chair is
18:25
the only chair that's left on an angle
18:28
so that it's more accessible to the
18:30
prime minister they can just slip into
18:31
it
18:32
whereas the others have to pull the
18:33
chair out so it gives them that chucked
18:35
out of it
18:36
yes that's very interesting yeah it's
18:39
just when they walk in
18:40
all the positions are straight except
18:41
for the prime minister's which is a
18:42
slight angle which allows easier access
18:44
yeah another important person in the
18:46
world who has a high chair
18:48
is prince george
18:51
i was gonna say lord sugar in the
18:54
apprentice yeah he has
18:56
a platform that his chairs on which is
18:58
about three inches higher so that he's
19:01
the
19:01
highest person in the room and um they
19:03
found that out because they had a camera
19:05
shot from behind him in one of the
19:07
episodes wow and everyone kind of
19:09
noticed that there was like a little
19:10
platform that you sat on
19:11
really interesting it's always people
19:13
who are universally loved and respected
19:14
who have these slightly higher chairs
19:15
isn't it
19:17
sugar sarkozy have we talked about when
19:21
sarkozy
19:22
uh went to uh because he was obviously
19:24
quite sure um he went to do a speech in
19:26
a factory
19:27
and he had lots of fact of the factory
19:30
worker standing behind him when he made
19:31
the speech
19:32
and he made sure to select the 20
19:34
shortest factory workers to stand behind
19:36
him and they interviewed them afterwards
19:37
and said
19:38
why were you chosen to be in this
19:39
picture and they said well they checked
19:40
my height and they said i was adequately
19:42
small
19:42
to not make him look too short was he
19:45
working in willy wonka's
19:46
chocolate faction
19:50
so okay i do have one wild fact about
19:54
presidential chairs
19:56
there was a guy in the 19th century and
19:58
his name was
19:59
seth kinnaman right he was a hunter he
20:02
claimed to have shot 800 grizzly bears
20:04
in his life
20:05
yeah i'm sure he did i'm sure he did
20:09
he was californian but he made for a
20:12
spell every single new president of the
20:13
usa got a chair
20:14
made by seth kidman and they were the
20:16
creepiest chairs you've ever seen
20:18
one of them is made just from elk
20:19
antlers strapped together
20:22
he once played for president lincoln
20:23
according to wikipedia on a fiddle made
20:25
from the skull of a mule
20:27
wow okay so this is the kind of guy he
20:28
was anyway the chair he made for andrew
20:30
johnson
20:30
was made from two wild bears right the
20:33
legs of the chair the four legs were all
20:35
bare legs
20:36
and um when you touched a cord the
20:39
head of a grizzly bear would snap out
20:41
from under the seat
20:42
and gnash its teeth and then go back
20:44
that's amazing who was that for
20:47
that one was for andrew johnson that's
20:48
incredible yeah
20:50
well nobody see photos of it and it is
20:52
terrifying if you wanted to make a
20:54
really
20:54
creepy chair you should have a chair
20:57
that then has
20:58
an arm built into it where if you sit in
21:00
it the hand is resting
21:02
on your thigh
21:05
i just think that would be a good creepy
21:06
chair that's a good creepy chair you're
21:08
in the market for a while that's a good
21:09
idea yeah yeah
21:09
because it's always creepy when someone
21:11
rests their hand on your thigh it's not
21:12
always creepy
21:13
[Laughter]
21:19
when you become prime minister anna you
21:21
can have one of those chairs in the
21:22
british cabinet room
21:23
apparently they won't let me because it
21:24
has to be this you know slightly
21:27
arm chair as long as you have the same
21:31
creepy chair for the president of france
21:35
um can i make a quick uh presidential
21:38
chair correction
21:40
uh many many many podcasts ago probably
21:42
about 10 in
21:43
i uh made a mistake i said that
21:45
underneath the chair
21:47
of uh barack obama's um oval office
21:50
table
21:51
was a trap door that should the
21:53
president in an emergency need to get
21:55
out of the room he could open the trap
21:56
door and slide down
21:58
the slide um it turns out that that's
22:00
not true
22:01
i was fooled by a website the white
22:03
house website which turned out to be
22:05
a website called not the white house
22:07
website a parody of the white house
22:09
website
22:10
and i i failed to read the strap line
22:12
and the knot i think
22:13
if this guy needs to replace his mum he
22:15
could quite easily hire you down
22:20
apologies to anyone who's used that fact
22:21
because i didn't edit it out of the show
22:24
despite having learned that so richard
22:26
nixon's inauguration one thing he didn't
22:28
want was
22:29
a pigeon poo all the way down the road
22:31
where he was being inaugurated
22:33
who does no every other president has
22:36
requested it
22:39
but he was weird he just didn't like it
22:41
and so he decided that what he would do
22:44
is try and get rid of all the pigeons
22:46
and so they sprayed something called
22:47
roost no more which is a bird repellent
22:50
on all the trees nearby
22:51
and the idea was it would make the
22:53
pigeon's feet burn and they would fly
22:55
off
22:56
um but unfortunately it contained a
22:57
chemical that killed them
22:59
and so um as he was being inaugurated
23:02
they went down the road there were just
23:03
dead pigeons
23:07
that's everywhere incredible it's not a
23:09
good start is it
23:11
it's the first omen or is it like when
23:15
you get pooed on by a bird it's like
23:16
that's actually a really good sign
23:17
lots of dead birds falling all over you
23:21
sure that's what his advisors said but
23:23
that's the thing i guess
23:24
being pooed on by birds is supposed to
23:26
be good luck isn't it
23:27
so he's got rid of all the good luck and
23:30
got pigeon corpses
23:32
that's a double double no wonder things
23:34
played out as they did
23:37
so nixon was very very clumsy
23:40
um i hadn't quite realized the plethora
23:42
of hilarious stories about him
23:44
so he used to always drop medals awards
23:47
ceremonies so any military award
23:48
ceremony was trying to put a medal on
23:49
somebody
23:50
drop it to the extent that um the dead
23:52
veterans scattered all over the thing
23:55
um so uh one of his military aides said
23:58
that he had to take the pins off the
24:00
back of medals and replace them with
24:01
clip-on devices
24:02
because if he didn't drop the medal he'd
24:03
then stab the military person in the
24:05
chest with it
24:06
um he once picked up a lobster as part
24:09
of like a pr thing he was visiting a
24:10
fish farm and he
24:11
picked up a lobster and it clawed onto
24:13
his suit lapel and wouldn't let go it
24:14
was hanging from him
24:17
he spilled the inkwell at downing street
24:19
he always spilled soup on himself and so
24:21
he said that soup courses had to be
24:23
eliminated from
24:24
the state menus that is so funny it's
24:26
really good
24:27
um in middle kingdom egypt um
24:31
it was a symbol of status to have a
24:33
folding stool
24:35
wow yeah stools were popular
24:38
but folding stools were very difficult
24:40
to get hold of and they were expensive
24:42
so if you weren't quite as posh as a
24:43
pharaoh but you were pretty posh you
24:45
would have a folding
24:46
stool i didn't even know they were
24:47
invented as far back as that no
24:49
it's not to prove you were rich enough
24:50
to go on beach holidays
24:52
i think every holiday is a beach holiday
24:54
nature oh yeah
24:56
yeah it's a constant
25:00
[Applause]
25:04
okay it is time for fact number three
25:06
and that is andy
25:08
my fact is that there is a special
25:09
police unit in france whose job is to
25:11
monitor six million dead people
25:15
and they are called the catacops
25:18
so these are the guys who look after the
25:20
catacombs in paris
25:22
and the catacombs are this massive um
25:25
thing i'd heard of them before i didn't
25:26
realize how big they were they
25:28
are 200 miles of tunnels over
25:31
32 square kilometers in area so they
25:34
still haven't all been explored it's 10
25:36
times the area of central park
25:38
in new york it's absolutely massive and
25:40
um the catacops are the people who walk
25:43
around underground trying to
25:45
find people who are trespassing and you
25:48
know people who are
25:49
mistreating the catacombs so they're not
25:52
actually policing the dead themselves
25:54
and checking they don't cause trouble no
25:56
but they're although if they do cause
25:57
trouble i'm sure they'll be first on the
25:59
scene exactly
25:59
yeah although there are only five people
26:01
in the catacombs these days
26:03
i read they're called cataflicks in
26:05
french yeah
26:06
what the people who go down there the
26:08
cops are the cops oh that's good because
26:10
everyone is called cat or something
26:11
there are cataclysts these are people
26:13
who mistreat the catacombs they're
26:15
people who leave rubbish and they spray
26:16
paint over older works of art and
26:18
they're very bad people but there are
26:19
catephiles as well people who love the
26:21
catacombs and who treat them well
26:23
and then if you if you're a cat a
26:24
cataphile and you bump into a catacop
26:27
he might well let you go surely if
26:28
you're a counter class then you claim
26:30
you're a catephile if a catacop comes
26:31
along yeah but if you're if you there's
26:33
litter behind you
26:34
or your door being stuff on a wall
26:36
carrying
26:39
no no because i actually took them off a
26:41
cataclass because i saw they were doing
26:43
something wrong so i've got the cans but
26:44
they're not mine i haven't been using
26:46
them oh well on your way thank you
26:48
and then you point and you say he went
26:49
that way he went
26:51
200 miles that way and also there's
26:54
qatar chicks
26:55
apparently who are a subculture who walk
26:57
around the tunnels in bikinis
26:59
no apparently is there a pool down there
27:03
there's a lot of flooded catacomb area
27:06
uh in fact in that case yes yeah i think
27:09
it was
27:10
last year maybe the year before um a
27:12
surfer called allison teal
27:14
went surfing inside a catacomb you can
27:16
watch the video
27:17
it's pretty extraordinary she says
27:19
surfing and all the media said surfing
27:21
she's laying on the surfboard
27:22
uh in a in her bikini she's in a bikini
27:25
and um
27:26
she goes through it but it's it's an
27:27
amazing video because she goes into
27:29
these tunnels which are
27:30
super tight like it's just her and the
27:31
surfboard can fit through
27:33
and there's moments where people who've
27:35
been down there obviously having fun
27:36
with all the bones down there and
27:38
arranging them into a chair
27:40
so you can see her sit in a bone chair
27:42
it's extraordinary
27:44
like incredible is that a chair made by
27:46
seth kinman the 19th century grizzly
27:48
bear hunter
27:51
wow they are incredible though these
27:53
categories they're so cool and when the
27:55
first ever catacop
27:56
chief retired his name was jean-claude
27:58
suret he did
27:59
20 years in the tunnels the catophiles
28:01
organized a massive feast for him
28:03
and he turned up and he said i tried for
28:05
years to catch you but now i'm retiring
28:07
if you want you can take pictures with
28:08
me and they all had their picture taken
28:09
with him
28:10
oh wow they threw him a party i gotta
28:12
say catacops
28:13
sounds like quite a cool 80s cartoon
28:16
it does really does are they cats yeah
28:19
but they're in the catacombs
28:21
are they also cops oh yeah and there
28:22
were policemen's outfits
28:24
andy it's in the title every element of
28:27
this
28:27
consciousness is great about the 80s
28:29
yeah you've never had to think about
28:31
titles of cartoons
28:33
they're thundercats yeah they're cats
28:35
and they like thunder danger mouse
28:37
yeah yeah didn't even have to watch the
28:39
cartoon
28:40
look at the title you know what you got
28:42
whereas peppa pig what's that about
28:44
no one there anyway
28:48
so the cutter files are incredible
28:50
aren't they um i really would recommend
28:52
looking them up this is one of those
28:53
facts i was so glad you chose it because
28:55
i had no idea they existed
28:57
and um they sort of invented themselves
28:59
in about 1980
29:01
and the idea is they're kind of urban
29:03
explorers but they go around um
29:05
restoring uh parts of paris that are
29:08
going without being restored or the
29:10
government hasn't got the funds to
29:10
restore them all i think need restoring
29:12
and the cataphiles are the people who do
29:14
so in the catacombs
29:16
and so for instance a few years ago the
29:18
catacops just came across
29:20
underground in some of the catacombs
29:21
that you're not allowed to access
29:23
a cinema complete with like a bar and a
29:26
restaurant
29:26
this was all underneath the trocadero an
29:29
area of paris
29:30
um it had it had seats to watch films in
29:32
it it had this whole collection of films
29:34
they'd wired in at least three phone
29:36
lines they had their own electricity
29:38
system
29:39
and there were just people hanging out
29:40
down there watching films on a big
29:42
cinema screen and so
29:43
they found this and they were like wow
29:45
this is amazing we found this whole
29:46
cinema system who the hell's is this
29:48
and the police came back three days
29:50
later and all the electrics had been cut
29:52
off and there was just a note that read
29:54
do not try to find us wow
29:57
can you find what films they watch
29:58
because i have been trying to find out
29:59
oh yeah i
30:00
i actually saw um the name of one of the
30:03
films um
30:04
it's very art house sort of because i
30:06
was hoping they were watching you know
30:07
terminator or um
30:09
yes oh you mean like lovely bones
30:11
awesome oh that'd be good
30:13
like bone related oh yeah yeah oh you
30:15
could have a great time watching zombie
30:17
films down there
30:18
yeah yeah surely yes
30:21
they've all got their own catacomb name
30:22
as well everyone has a nom de plume or a
30:25
nom de catacomb
30:26
down there and you're not meant to
30:29
you're not meant to ask about anyone's
30:30
above surface life you don't say so what
30:33
do you do
30:34
because the answer is i walk around the
30:35
catacombs yeah i see yeah
30:37
right do you know what they also found
30:39
in the cinema by the way um
30:40
they discovered that there was a cctv
30:43
monitor
30:44
in order to see who was coming so they
30:45
can review the tapes i guess if they
30:47
could see if it was cops or anything
30:48
and along with the cctv they had a bit
30:51
of sound equipment so that if anyone
30:52
passed a certain point
30:54
it triggered a dog barking to scare them
30:56
off from going further down the tunnel
30:58
wow yeah so it was like that was their
30:59
security system to stop the cinema from
31:01
that would work for the cutter cop
31:04
cartoon cats
31:05
yes but they're very dangerous these
31:08
catacombs if you are not a cataphile
31:10
and if you decide to go exploring off
31:12
the beaten path as it were because these
31:14
are ginormous and there are counts of
31:16
people who've heard of stashes of wine
31:18
and they've said i'm just going to go
31:19
down and look for a stash of wine and
31:21
never seen again i mean you're in france
31:23
there's wine everywhere
31:24
[Laughter]
31:27
finally i can get some of this
31:28
mysterious wine that they speak
31:32
so very recently um two boys disappeared
31:35
um for three days
31:36
they were found they got put into
31:37
hospital they had hypothermia um
31:39
and they were only found because they'd
31:41
been leaving clues along the way but
31:43
they
31:43
the catacops i guess sent in search dogs
31:46
in order to find them
31:47
and they managed to to find them but i
31:49
kept thinking that
31:51
that's you can you imagine being a dog
31:52
and going down into a place with all
31:54
those bones
31:58
well this is the thing do you know why
31:59
the bones are down there in the first
32:00
place because they weren't originally
32:02
there
32:03
so the bones were put underground
32:05
because all the cemeteries were running
32:06
out of space
32:07
in the city above ground and it was
32:08
horrible so there's a very famous
32:10
cemetery in paris called
32:12
innocent the innocents and it was giving
32:14
off a strong smell of decomposing flesh
32:16
in the late 18th century
32:18
and supposedly even perfume shops were
32:21
claiming they couldn't do business
32:22
because of the off-putting smell
32:24
surely they're the one people who should
32:26
be cashing in
32:30
it's amazing isn't it yeah if they can't
32:32
spot that business opportunity
32:36
anyway in 1780 a wall collapsed at les
32:40
innocent
32:40
and rotting corpses fell into a nearby
32:43
house
32:44
at that point people said oh maybe we
32:46
should move these millions and millions
32:48
of cops
32:48
so they over a period of years and years
32:50
they moved all these six million bodies
32:52
from the city's cemeteries into the
32:53
catacombs
32:54
and what it was is they'd had all these
32:56
tunnels because it was where they mined
32:58
for limestone
32:59
originally they would get limestone from
33:02
near the ground level
33:03
but actually that was kind of spoiling
33:06
the topsoil so you couldn't make any
33:07
agriculture there or anything like that
33:09
so they had to go deep deep down to get
33:10
their rocks
33:12
and this is amazing um once they'd made
33:15
uh they'd got rid of all the rock and
33:17
the catacombs existed
33:19
um but completely abandoned because they
33:21
weren't being used for anything
33:22
people started farming there so
33:25
mushrooms were grown
33:26
in these catacombs and all the farmers
33:28
got kicked out because they wanted to
33:29
throw all the bones in there
33:30
no yeah and still today in bits of
33:33
catacomb that are not
33:34
occupied by bones are uh
33:37
growing mushrooms still i gotta say as
33:39
someone who's scared of mushrooms like i
33:41
am i have a real phobia
33:42
i think i could live with the bones and
33:44
the skulls and stuff like that
33:46
you'd you'd freeze i don't know i really
33:47
would that's a horror moment
33:50
here's the other thing about the
33:51
catacombs is um they are
33:54
the reason that paris has maintained not
33:57
having high rises
33:58
in the city because they collapsed they
34:01
would collapse there's
34:02
the ground underneath them are not
34:03
stable enough in order to
34:05
allow for high-rise buildings um it was
34:07
louis xv
34:08
he founded the organization uh the igc
34:11
the inspection general to carrier which
34:13
does all the maintenance of mapping and
34:14
he was forced to found it because
34:16
in 1774 300 meters of street
34:20
just collapsed into a 20 meter deep hole
34:23
imagine wow because obviously the
34:25
limestone um is
34:27
eroded or it's eaten away by rain or
34:28
whatever it might be and suddenly boom
34:30
300 meters of the street it sounds
34:32
almost fun to be on a street that then
34:34
kind of turns into a
34:36
tunnel are you talking about what is it
34:38
it wouldn't
34:39
be i'm not saying it would be it sounds
34:40
like it could be my sister is terrified
34:42
of sinkholes
34:43
really me too absolutely has a massive
34:46
phobia doesn't she live in a cemetery
34:48
i know the other sister all right okay
34:49
[Laughter]
34:53
surely it's more logical if you do live
34:54
in a cemetery to be afraid of falling
34:56
into the ground
34:57
because you've seen all these other
34:58
people who've done it my sister
35:04
my sister who lives in a cemetery grows
35:06
her own vegetables
35:08
and my other sister who doesn't live in
35:09
the cemetery refuses to eat them because
35:11
she thinks they've got dead bodies i
35:12
don't blame her that's yeah there's
35:14
something about that connection
35:16
but you eat you eat crops grown with
35:18
excrement as fertilizer
35:20
that doesn't bother you doesn't it yeah
35:22
but it's not bizarre that we're
35:23
constantly eating food that's grown
35:25
using
35:25
cow poo or human poo or poo it's just
35:28
poo
35:29
any kind of poo it works but does the
35:32
trick
35:32
that is weird isn't it we're all over it
35:35
not enough gets made of that you're
35:36
right i i
35:37
agree with you people always say they
35:38
look at like the way the animals are
35:40
killed and say maybe if you knew how
35:42
your animals were killed you would all
35:43
go vegetarian yeah but maybe if you knew
35:46
that there was poo smeared all over your
35:47
vegetables
35:48
you'd only eat meat
35:52
[Applause]
35:56
okay it is time for our final fact of
35:58
the show and that is my fact
36:00
my fact this week is that the number one
36:02
place to buy cds in indonesia now
36:05
is kfc kfc
36:08
the fast food restaurant they should
36:10
call it kfcd
36:12
yes this is amazing this is such an
36:15
amazing fact
36:16
this is extraordinary kfc d would be
36:19
either kentucky fried chicken dish
36:21
itaku fried compact disc gmccd is what
36:25
you're suggesting
36:26
yeah so in indonesia now in kfc
36:29
when you go to buy your chicken you are
36:32
offered a bundle deal
36:34
in which you can also purchase a cd and
36:37
they sell over 500 000 albums a month
36:41
in the kfc's all over indonesia
36:44
and this was set up by a very well
36:47
respected well-known producer
36:49
of bands like the killers predominantly
36:51
u2
36:52
he's done the majority of their biggest
36:54
albums um outside of brian eno
36:56
and he realized over there credit cards
36:59
and streaming isn't such a massive thing
37:01
so people are still buying
37:02
the physical objects cds get sold for
37:04
four dollars and there's a lot of black
37:06
market cds that go on he thought
37:08
no one goes out to buy things anymore
37:10
physically but they do go out to buy
37:12
chicken
37:12
so what if i combined chicken and cds
37:16
together
37:16
and started selling them there and it
37:18
absolutely worked so
37:19
he releases at the moment predominantly
37:21
indonesian artists
37:23
but they're looking into bringing in
37:25
yeah the western you you too have got
37:26
that new album coming out haven't they
37:28
family bucket
37:31
his name's steve lillywhite by the way
37:32
the producer of all these albums he's
37:34
done the rolling stones as well i mean
37:35
he's
37:36
ginormous they interviewed him the new
37:37
york times interviewed him and he said
37:39
my job is basically like running a
37:40
record label except this record label
37:42
also happens to sell chicken
37:44
so i think it's about he's not fully
37:45
adjusted to the new reality
37:48
very much sounds like a man who used to
37:50
be a record label
37:51
guy then fell on hard times got a job at
37:54
kfc
37:56
and then someone from the new york times
37:58
came along and said aren't you that guy
37:59
who used to produce you too and he's
38:00
like
38:01
oh yeah i still do that kind of stuff
38:03
but
38:04
incredibly that's not the case while he
38:07
gave this interview to the new york
38:08
times he was busy mixing or playing
38:10
the latest u2 single that he just made
38:13
in the background
38:14
like this is a guy who's like jumping
38:16
between producing pop hits
38:18
and selling and he the music that he
38:20
sells in kfc and indonesia is not
38:22
um english language is it so it's all
38:24
indonesian music at the moment
38:25
and he says that he thinks 98 of the
38:28
music sales come
38:29
from people who just went to buy chicken
38:31
and turn up there and go oh we'll have a
38:33
cd too
38:34
impulse buy it definitely makes sense
38:36
but also piracy is not necessarily bad
38:37
for cd sales
38:38
so japan is somewhere where cds are
38:41
still a huge
38:42
thing so i think uh globally 39 of music
38:45
sales
38:45
come from cds or this is true last year
38:47
the year before whereas in japan
38:49
it's 75 percent and piracy isn't
38:52
necessarily a bad thing because
38:54
apparently when people pirate cds they
38:56
copy them onto other cds
38:58
and that gets people used to just
38:59
physically having cds i
39:01
think people are all used to physically
39:03
having cds now i think that's the
39:05
argument of a pirate in the dock
39:06
[Laughter]
39:09
quite possibly actually i was happy to
39:10
spread the sale of cds just happened to
39:12
be blank ones that i was buying and then
39:15
ripping off i don't know the japan thing
39:18
is bizarre though
39:19
the cd thing so cds in japan cost about
39:21
25 pounds on average
39:23
each one so it's not like they're
39:25
cheaper well it's because of all the
39:26
bonus tracks
39:27
japan famously there's a great comedian
39:29
who once said
39:30
where all the bonus tracks live every
39:33
japanese cd which is why they're often
39:34
imported to other countries around the
39:36
world is there maybe four
39:37
songs that don't appear on a cd released
39:40
in the west
39:41
wow so if coldplay releases an album
39:42
there most likely there will be four
39:44
bonus tracks which are the b
39:46
sides or something that they would use
39:47
later on four more completely
39:49
indistinguishable tracks
39:51
imagine how disappointed you'd be if you
39:52
got to the end of what you thought was a
39:54
cold play album but it
39:58
um the first massive selling cd
40:01
was dire straits it was an album called
40:03
brothers in arms and it was the first
40:05
one to sell a million cds was absolutely
40:07
huge
40:08
and since then i think it's all about
40:09
something like crazy like 15 or 30
40:11
million
40:12
copies but they were the band who were
40:14
chosen for the big push of the cd
40:17
because the guys who made it for
40:18
phillips said
40:20
they're mainstream enough like we can't
40:22
push
40:23
punk we can't push something as nisha
40:26
but also maybe they didn't want
40:27
something really poppy is that right
40:29
they wanted something i guess so
40:30
yeah so it was but they were the ones
40:32
who were almost chosen
40:33
for that massive promotional push which
40:36
is interesting okay
40:37
yeah the first person to have a cd
40:39
released in america was bruce
40:40
springsteen born in the usa wasn't he
40:42
but abba was the first band to be
40:44
imprinted onto a cd so it's always the
40:47
big ones
40:48
yeah when you say that kind of thing it
40:50
almost feels like there probably was
40:51
someone else
40:52
doesn't it yeah yeah it kind of depends
40:55
though because
40:55
it's launching a new medium so i guess
40:58
like jay-z doing tidal
40:59
you know he he's signed up so tidal is
41:02
its own spotify effectively dan is
41:04
looking at my completely blank
41:06
face about the words jay-z and tidal
41:09
so tidal is like its own itunes its own
41:11
spotify it's an exclusive
41:13
streaming and downloading place you can
41:15
only listen to jay-z
41:17
you can only listen a joke it's like a
41:18
betamax but all the tapes are jay-z
41:20
exactly okay i understand when you put
41:23
it like that so beyonce released her
41:24
lemonade album on there
41:25
and as a result it didn't make it to the
41:28
top of the charts the first time that's
41:30
ever happened to beyonce in a solo
41:31
career because
41:32
it was a new medium and not enough
41:34
people were signed up right time but
41:35
yeah so you need a biggie in order to
41:37
push the medium
41:38
yeah just in japan on japan cds yeah you
41:41
were saying they come with extras
41:43
so as well as bonus tracks they come
41:45
with other extra things
41:46
as well so now they're keeping the cd
41:48
market alive in japan by giving away
41:50
prizes with cds so you get
41:52
raffle tickets with cds you get these
41:54
prizes you get um
41:55
family bucket a raffle ticket is a
41:58
terrible prize
41:59
because it's basically not a prize is it
42:01
it's a piece of paper which is almost
42:03
always
42:04
it's almost always not a very nice
42:05
bottle of wine though
42:08
or a box of matchmakers yeah exactly you
42:11
can get sometimes you
42:12
if you are the first you know thousand
42:13
people to buy a cd you get the handshake
42:15
thing which is where you get to meet the
42:16
band of the cd you've bought and shake
42:18
that hand
42:18
it's incredible yeah exactly get to
42:20
japan andy um but this is a cool thing
42:23
so there's a band in japan i think we
42:25
might have talked about before called
42:26
akb48
42:28
which is a fan with loads of members um
42:30
and
42:31
they hold banned elections via cd
42:33
purchases so the way they get people to
42:35
buy their cds is
42:36
if you buy a cd by these guys then it
42:38
has a ballot paper inside
42:40
and you can write on that ballot paper
42:41
which member of the band is your
42:43
favorite and then it's announced who's
42:44
the favorite wow
42:46
um so that gets people to buy it that's
42:48
pretty harsh so if you're in that band
42:50
yeah but at least there are 50 members
42:51
as opposed to a band like either the
42:53
rolling stones or there are five of them
42:54
you get to kill a rolling stone every
42:57
time chasing dave
43:01
and every year dave's like sorry chaz
43:03
[Laughter]
43:06
well there was it's not the end of the
43:07
world if you lose because the girl that
43:09
came 48th
43:10
or the girl that came bottom in the vote
43:11
one year the following year i think this
43:13
was last year or the year before
43:15
one fan spent 240 000 pounds
43:18
buying up as many cds as they possibly
43:20
could in order to send all the votes
43:22
there's no limit to how many times you
43:23
can vote
43:24
whoa so what i would say is if you want
43:26
to buy 250
43:28
000 copies of our new book that comes
43:30
out this november
43:32
should we put a little ballot paper
43:33
inside saying who's your favorite member
43:35
of the podcast i really don't think we
43:36
should
43:36
be absolutely sure i think for you and
43:38
me we should
43:41
why didn't she just photocopy the bit of
43:42
paper
43:44
that's a lot of money there's gonna be a
43:46
barcode on there isn't it some listener
43:48
in japan is going
43:49
right now with a massive category
43:53
full of unsold cds eating their dinner
43:56
often
43:57
yeah placemats people keep releasing cds
44:00
in sims language
44:01
by the way what what does that mean um
44:04
you never played on the sims
44:06
it sounds like you haven't the way you
44:08
said that
44:09
no we don't like to play on the sims
44:14
i think i'm the only one who has played
44:15
the six i've never played on the system
44:17
i've
44:17
played on the sims sorry yeah i have
44:19
played on the sims i just didn't ever
44:21
talk about it until now apparently
44:23
um so i was actually looking at weird
44:25
music brand partnerships for this
44:27
and simlish is the language they speak
44:29
in the sims and katy perry has recorded
44:32
a song on an album called teenage dream
44:35
and what no no
44:40
i'm with anna on this what is that a
44:41
massive outfit or something
44:44
i would say one of the best-selling
44:47
albums of this decade
44:49
well i bet i'm the only one i'm the only
44:51
one i've asked for that's her the
44:52
simlish
44:53
version so who's the bigger katy perry
44:55
fan
44:56
anyway all these bands keep releasing
44:58
albums in simulation so ok
44:59
go depeche mode rita aura lily allen
45:03
cool they've all released simulish songs
45:05
very cool and so they just redo the
45:06
language yeah that's awesome is there an
45:08
album where you can buy all the similar
45:09
songs
45:10
with you know like a now that's what i
45:12
call simlish
45:12
[Laughter]
45:14
one of the guys who developed the cd for
45:17
phillips
45:18
when it was first introduced he was so
45:20
excited about the new technology he said
45:22
i decided to get rid of all my final
45:24
albums
45:25
and get my old rolling stones and
45:26
beatles records on cd
45:28
it still hurts because he just feels
45:31
like a complete idiot that he did that
45:33
he got all these fantastic original
45:34
rolling stones and beatles records
45:37
and he just has him on cd now he was
45:38
married to the cause though you've got
45:40
to throw yourself in with both people
45:42
all five of the calls he was married to
45:44
even even jim yeah
45:46
that is bigger meat you should go in the
45:48
stocks for like five hours for that
45:53
um i have a joke that dates us doesn't
45:55
it really i mean i did is chasing dave
45:56
joe coming
46:00
all revealing our deepest secrets about
46:02
you know jay-z
46:03
or playing on the sims in indonesia
46:07
there's a big trend um for
46:10
um music related to bus horns
46:15
okay and this is like a little meme that
46:17
started on the internet and it's
46:19
um they videoed these kids holding signs
46:22
up reading on the tele-let om
46:24
okay which means honk driver honk or
46:28
driver honk driver i'm not sure which
46:30
one uh
46:31
and the thing is indonesian buses have
46:32
got really cool horns so they make like
46:34
little melodic
46:35
noises uh and the kids just wanted to
46:38
hear these
46:39
horns and it became a bit of an internet
46:41
meme and now there's a load of djs in
46:42
indonesia who are making songs related
46:45
to bus ons cool really very cool
46:48
so popular djs such as zed and fire
46:51
beats
46:51
and dj marshmallow you say that in the
46:55
same kind of voice
46:56
yeah that anna talks about katy perry
46:59
so we've all got blind spots it's all
47:01
i'm saying yeah yeah because andy's
47:02
downloaded their albums already
47:04
joe marshmallow and the other one he
47:06
said
47:08
um i've got some kfc stuff yeah
47:11
finally we're getting to the nub of this
47:13
fact
47:15
so in japan they have a kfc with a
47:17
high-end whiskey bar
47:19
cool which is pretty good in russia they
47:22
had an
47:22
advert because people weren't really
47:24
eating kfc they had an advert
47:26
and what it was is there was a little
47:28
kid in a school and he was eating kfc or
47:30
something and the teacher got annoyed
47:32
and so the teacher got the bucket and
47:34
put it on this kid's head and he had to
47:36
walk around school with a bucket on his
47:37
head
47:38
and it started it hasn't been aging
47:40
quite prematurely
47:43
uh yeah and it was just a meme in russia
47:45
like the buckethead meme
47:46
i don't think we've mentioned this
47:47
before this year kfc have released a
47:49
novel for the first time
47:52
that's a novel starring the colonel and
47:54
it's a mils and boone style romance and
47:56
it's called tender wings of desire
47:58
he is a sexy man well we ascertained
48:01
before we started
48:02
recording this podcast that you quite
48:04
fancy richard nixon oh yeah so your how
48:06
did we miss that when we got to that
48:07
you didn't ascertain that that's a
48:09
warping of the truth
48:10
oh i'm sorry i find him not unattractive
48:14
given that there was another andy that's
48:16
pretty much someone saying you're
48:17
attractive
48:18
that's the best i can hope for these
48:20
days i'm not physically repulsed by him
48:22
great date um he said in an interview
48:26
that um something like i know how i look
48:29
i'm under no illusions about my
48:30
appearance so i'll have to be good in
48:32
other ways and i read that interview and
48:33
i thought
48:34
well he's good in other ways isn't he
48:36
lots of ways that richard nixon is a
48:38
very good man
48:39
what would you say what are your top
48:42
five ways in which he's a great guy
48:43
hannah
48:45
got a bird problem he's your man
48:49
colonel sanders was kind of divorced
48:51
from kfc from quite early on as and he
48:52
sold the company so he did loads of
48:54
marketing for it throughout his life he
48:55
traveled
48:56
250 000 miles i think visiting kfc
48:59
restaurants around the world until he
49:01
died in 1980
49:02
but he used to turn up unexpected at
49:04
various kfc outlets constantly
49:06
to test their chicken because he was
49:08
really pissed off that they weren't
49:09
using the
49:10
recipes picture of him on the wall on
49:13
every bucket there's a picture of his
49:14
face people behind the desk would be
49:17
like
49:18
you look a bit familiar i guess if he
49:20
takes the suit off and the glasses
49:22
he never did okay there we go they sewed
49:25
him into it
49:27
he's completely recognizable he never
49:29
took what even in the shower even when
49:31
he was swimming
49:33
imagine if ronald mcdonald was going to
49:35
every mcdonald's as a secret
49:37
customer it's just not going to work
49:41
or gave it away was it my height yeah
49:45
so first of all he he literally didn't
49:47
go out in public without wearing his
49:48
white suit and he bleached his facial
49:49
hair to match his
49:50
head hair and stuff so he never didn't
49:52
wear his white suit and he turned up
49:53
unannounced
49:54
and then they would surf he'd say give
49:56
me a chicken and gravy
49:57
and please
50:01
um and then he would be really angry if
50:03
they got it wrong which they often did
50:04
so kfc sued him once
50:08
he did they sued him for referring to
50:10
their gravy as sludge and wallpaper like
50:13
what because he turned up and said so he
50:15
must had he sold the company
50:17
he sold the company he was still doing
50:18
their marketing and stuff but um he
50:20
turned up
50:20
was that a proposed slogan
50:23
trying new wallpapery sludge
50:28
there was one employee who complained so
50:30
he he did there was a piece on him in
50:32
the new york times in the 70s when they
50:34
interviewed him saying the colonel is
50:35
vexed almost beyond endurance by the
50:37
subject of gravy
50:38
and one of the uh executives at kfc said
50:41
look the colonel's gravy was fantastic
50:43
but you had to be a rhodes scholar to
50:44
cook it
50:45
um it was really really complicated
50:47
recipe that was way too labor intensive
50:48
i think everyone really likes kfc gravy
50:51
don't they isn't that of the thing that
50:52
everyone loves about i think it is a
50:54
thing because he did make this massive
50:55
deal about the course
50:56
did he win the case uh he had to pay one
50:59
million dollars
51:00
damages yeah well he called that gravy
51:02
sludgy wallpaper pace what'd you expect
51:04
i guess so
51:05
they suit him for about 30 million i
51:07
think and he got it down to it he could
51:08
have said it's all gravy in the dark
51:10
[Laughter]

[Music]
00:15
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:21
covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
00:24
here with anna chazinski
00:26
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four favorite
00:32
facts from the last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order here we go
00:37
starting with you
00:38
andy my fact is that to be a tennis
00:40
empire you have to learn a 230 page book
00:44
this is a rule book specifically a
00:46
tennis it's not a novel
00:47
[Laughter]
00:49
and this is specifically the the u.s
00:51
tennis association so over in britain
00:53
we've got the lawn tennis association
00:54
which is a slightly different thing
00:56
it's the more of your rules do you think
00:58
for the lord one i
00:59
don't know it's gonna be similar isn't
01:01
it probably a similar language
01:02
yeah um but i have been reading the
01:04
rules of wimbledon
01:06
and so is wimbledon the same guidebook
01:09
wimbledon is lawn tennis so this is
01:14
i think the rules are generally going to
01:16
be the same aren't they it's not like in
01:17
wimbledon you're allowed to kick the
01:19
ball over
01:20
in american tennis you have to hit it
01:22
outside the lights
01:24
when they have to learn it do they get
01:26
tested on it do they have to memorize
01:27
the whole thing
01:28
can they not keep it as a reference kind
01:29
of in their pockets well as they go
01:31
through
01:32
i used to be a football referee i was
01:34
qualified as a football referee and
01:36
you have to do an exam so you really
01:38
only have to learn what comes up on the
01:40
exam
01:40
really it's not it's kind of like a
01:42
saying for a driving test you have to
01:43
learn a
01:44
500 page book on the rules of driving
01:46
but actually you can't recite that from
01:47
start to finish can you
01:49
can't you go on that's why you're
01:51
constantly crashing your car around the
01:52
place
01:54
whereas i who i'm constantly referring
01:55
to a 500 page book
01:58
come on give us some rules all right um
02:00
so
02:01
i think it's quite well known that at
02:02
wimbledon you can get fined for swearing
02:04
yes
02:04
can you yeah you can find 20 000 if you
02:07
swear does it depend on the word
02:09
no oh so you might as well use the
02:12
strongest one you might as well yeah
02:14
but that's if you're a player if you're
02:16
a player okay he's
02:17
just walking around the grounds oh
02:19
overcharge me for my beer
02:20
and they take you away 20 000. thank you
02:23
that could have bought you one planet of
02:25
strawberries um
02:27
no if you go out in the first round
02:29
though that is
02:30
nearly half your winnings you would have
02:32
spent on swearing once
02:33
ah wow and the umpires
02:36
uh and the staff they have to learn
02:38
swear words in other languages
02:40
in case a latvian tennis player swears
02:43
in latvian
02:44
ah that makes so much sense yeah it's
02:46
interesting about the people
02:48
being paid if you lose in the first
02:50
round because that was in the news last
02:51
week
02:51
because people were losing in the first
02:53
round injured and they knew they were
02:55
injured going into it but they've turned
02:57
up and played anyway and then just given
02:59
up halfway through to get the money
03:01
and the thing is they've worked to get
03:03
there you know what i mean over the
03:04
whole year they've got their rankings
03:06
high enough that they get to where they
03:07
are so they kind of it's fair enough i
03:09
think i i think it's totally fair enough
03:11
i'd be like one of us turning up with no
03:12
facts
03:13
that's me every week right yeah every
03:16
we find you 20 000 pounds but dan over
03:19
the last
03:20
three years has done enough to earn his
03:22
place and done enough to just turn up
03:24
with no facts
03:25
yeah yeah i'll tell you what's bad
03:26
though is the fact that tickets to
03:28
wimbledon
03:29
cost a fortune to get center court as
03:31
well you're paying huge amounts of money
03:32
yeah well in advance
03:34
so on this particular day we're talking
03:36
about in this current wimbledon
03:37
competition
03:38
federer was playing so you're thinking i
03:40
get to see federer center court
03:41
of wimbledon this guy pulls out 25
03:43
minutes into the match or so
03:45
next match djokovic comes on same thing
03:48
happens guy pulls out so you've you've
03:50
got center court tickets for two of the
03:51
great tennis players of our time
03:54
and you do expect that in the first
03:55
round don't get center court tickets in
03:56
the first round
03:58
this yeah only gets them for the final
04:00
and the seminar the box
04:01
i don't know obviously it's ridiculous
04:02
but there should be rules it's stupid to
04:04
imagine that an individual should make
04:06
that decision
04:06
there just needs to be a health check so
04:08
in normal tennis
04:10
that's not the grand slams they do have
04:11
the rules so if you're injured
04:13
but you've already qualified you get
04:15
your money and then
04:16
like a substitute comes in and they play
04:19
and they only get money if they win so
04:20
if they lose they don't get anything but
04:22
if they go through to the second round
04:23
they do get money
04:25
they don't play under your name you've
04:26
been there don't have to put on a
04:28
mustache if you've got a mustache
04:30
learn these swear words in my language
04:33
but i think it was
04:34
it might have been the other randy
04:35
murray's idea to do that and they
04:37
brought it in this year as a trial
04:38
and it seems to be working quite well
04:40
that's cool like that the other andy
04:42
murray
04:42
yeah as someone who's been the other
04:44
andy murray until
04:45
now literally now when you just said
04:47
that um but just on the swearing thing
04:48
quickly yeah
04:49
there is another rule which is about
04:51
visible obscenity
04:52
which i had i'd never read before and so
04:55
uh
04:56
it's this for the purposes of this rule
04:58
visible obscenity stop doing that james
05:00
with your hands
05:02
is visible obscenity is defined as the
05:04
making of signs by a player with his
05:06
hands and or racket or balls that
05:08
commonly have an obscene meaning
05:11
and does it define what they mean by
05:13
balls in that situation
05:16
there's even a rule on abusive balls
05:18
abuse of balls
05:20
yeah players shall not violently
05:21
dangerously or with anger hit kick
05:24
or throw a tennis ball because that
05:25
happened was that tim henman did that
05:27
once
05:27
yes he's the first player ever to be
05:29
kicked out of wimbledon for
05:31
what no yeah because you um so another
05:33
thing that swearing does for you is if
05:35
you don't get a fine you get a penalty
05:36
point
05:37
and you can be penalized out of a match
05:39
so
05:40
there's a there's a famous example of a
05:42
guy um called
05:43
bryden klein he was facing a guy called
05:45
sam groth and during the match he served
05:48
and this was in the final game
05:49
he was losing served into the net and
05:52
just yelled out
05:53
stupid stupid person talking about
05:55
himself he claims
05:56
but the umpire said i don't know who you
05:58
directed that at but that's rude you've
06:00
been given a penalty point and because
06:02
he got one earlier in the match the
06:04
match was over they didn't even get to
06:05
finish the match
06:06
stupid stupid person yeah stupid it's
06:08
very rude in latvian
06:10
yeah the funniest bit about it though is
06:12
that he looked to the other player to
06:13
say
06:14
hey come on like bail me out here like
06:16
that was
06:17
it the guy said i'd like to help you but
06:18
it's too tough to call from here
06:20
and he pointed to the lines woman and so
06:22
the guy who said stupid stupid person
06:24
said
06:24
she's a 60 year old lady wearing like a
06:27
and then he stopped himself because he's
06:28
like oh i'm about to get another penalty
06:31
i read some of the rules um this is for
06:34
normal tennis which is not wimbledon
06:36
um one of them is quite good the event
06:38
organizer has to announce how many balls
06:40
they'll have
06:41
um before the event in play at any time
06:44
okay and the number of balls for play is
06:47
either two
06:48
three four or six
06:51
oh i want to know what happened with
06:53
five why why not five oh yeah why not
06:56
fight very weird
06:57
you understand that it's to do with how
06:59
many are in a can
07:00
you wouldn't open a new can for just one
07:01
ball i guess but you were right
07:05
but you wouldn't have seven either
07:07
there's just something that feels a bit
07:08
wrong about it
07:09
so you're allowed two or three but no
07:10
other prime numbers is that what you're
07:12
saying
07:12
yes that's exactly right yes exactly i
07:15
think it might be dan's explanation
07:17
because you do get cans in three or four
07:20
portions but then you wouldn't be able
07:22
to get one and two
07:24
either that doesn't make any sense one
07:26
tennis ball can be a very sorry sight
07:28
indeed it looks like a tiny pringles
07:32
just on balls um i didn't know this but
07:35
uh
07:35
men and women tennis play with different
07:38
balls
07:39
no the only reason that i read about
07:41
this was that in march 27th at the miami
07:43
open
07:44
andy murray mid-game complained to the
07:46
umpire that he was playing with
07:48
women balls and the
07:51
idea is that the female ball is much
07:53
quicker much speedier
07:54
you have so many dominant male servers
07:57
in the game that
07:58
it means that they're almost
07:59
unreturnable so the male tennis ball
08:01
is a bit more fluffy which means a bit
08:04
more drag in the air
08:05
which means that it slows the game down
08:07
and uh with the female balls
08:09
it just has way more speed on it that is
08:11
amazing that's when i learned it as well
08:13
when andy murray complained um about
08:15
that and i think the whole country went
08:16
when he did that what the hell
08:17
there are women's balls yeah and i felt
08:19
like annie murray had leaked something
08:21
that maybe no one was supposed to know
08:22
yeah because i have read an article
08:24
about the behind the scenes at wimbledon
08:26
basically and it
08:27
refers to the um the guy who is
08:29
basically the ball master
08:30
um who's a man called brian and
08:32
wimbledon uses two
08:34
lorries of balls every year he uses 57
08:36
000 balls
08:37
and they're all kept at the same
08:39
temperature in rooms
08:40
under center court and um apparently
08:44
they're now divided into men's and
08:45
ladies balls and no one mentions that
08:47
but this is why i think the can argument
08:49
for them being no
08:50
five ball games can't be right because
08:52
they've got a lorry load of them right
08:54
it doesn't really matter about having
08:56
five or six or seven
08:58
do you think they're just balls free
08:59
balls stuffed into a lorry and they open
09:01
the lorry and they all cascade out
09:03
i'm thinking of it as the world's
09:04
greatest ball pit yeah the thing is
09:08
though
09:08
the lorry uh carrying the ladies balls
09:11
actually drives a lot faster to get to
09:12
wimbledon because it's
09:14
got less fluff on the outside of it so
09:17
one thing that they're really strict on
09:18
at wimbledon
09:19
is clothing and i didn't realize how
09:22
many players have objected to this in
09:23
the past
09:24
so andre agus so obviously at wimbledon
09:26
you have to wear all whites which isn't
09:27
the same other grand slams
09:29
and andre agassi refused to play at
09:31
wimbledon until he was 21 which i know
09:33
doesn't sound real but you know he
09:34
didn't play
09:44
yeah but yeah he refused and then
09:46
eventually he succumbed and said oh i'm
09:47
obviously going to win this a bunch of
09:48
times so i'll play but he used to wear
09:50
denim
09:50
shorts to play his grand slams which is
09:53
an insane thing to wear
09:55
um there was a woman in eugenie bouchard
09:57
who i think still plays
09:58
um but but eugenie bouchard in 2015 got
10:01
a dress code violation
10:03
for there was a black bra strap showing
10:06
so there's only one
10:07
centimeter of any other color allowed at
10:09
wimbledon
10:10
and she was wearing a white sports bra
10:12
underneath because the rules
10:13
say as you will know if you've read this
10:15
document that
10:17
any undergarments that either are or can
10:19
be visible during play
10:21
brackets including due to perspiration
10:23
close brackets must be completely white
10:25
as in
10:26
make sure when you wet your white shirt
10:28
you can't see a black bra underneath
10:29
what if your perspiration gives you
10:31
miscolored stains
10:33
oh yeah what if you piss yourself
10:41
20 grand for pissing yourself on center
10:44
core yeah
10:45
especially as you go to the umpire i've
10:46
pissed myself and they go that's another
10:48
20 grand
10:49
[Laughter]
10:51
actually last year there was controversy
10:53
there was a uruguayan player
10:55
called pablo cuevas and he was accused
10:57
of urinating into a ball can
10:59
during a match under his towel he was
11:02
issued with a code violation although
11:04
wimbledon chiefs
11:05
did say and i'm quoting here no
11:06
urination was involved
11:09
so he just got his willy out and put it
11:11
in a balkan
11:12
you might want to cool it down during a
11:14
match that's true yeah
11:15
i was playing tennis the other day and
11:17
we lost a crucial point
11:19
because uh what ended up happening was
11:21
my doubles partner
11:22
hit the ball didn't quite capture it and
11:24
hit it again in the same swing
11:26
you're allowed to do that you're allowed
11:27
to do that it turns out reading this
11:29
rule book it says you are allowed to do
11:30
that we lost that crucial point
11:32
in the same it has to be in the same
11:34
follow-through the same swing so if
11:36
it if you hit it and the ball bounces
11:37
obviously that's you can't do that if
11:38
you hit it away and you chase after it
11:40
and you get it but if it's in literally
11:41
the same motion and you just
11:43
almost scoop it slightly unlike golf for
11:46
instance where if you do a double hit
11:47
that counts as
11:48
a penalty but isaac because surely once
11:50
you hit it it's moving away from you
11:51
faster than the depends how good you are
11:54
because sometimes your first hit is only
11:57
uh almost a um a stopping point for it
12:00
so let's say it hits the rim of the
12:03
racket yeah and then it kind of slows
12:04
down and then you kind of
12:05
hit it with the strings i think that's
12:08
why
12:08
it probably exist is because that does
12:10
often happen you you rim it and then it
12:12
hits the other bit of your racket and
12:13
it's a double hit
12:14
so i've seen you play tennessee
12:18
you struggle with single hits i do i do
12:21
um in wimbledon not only do they have
12:23
230-page rulebook for
12:25
the games they have a rulebook for the
12:27
queue
12:29
yeah yeah they do well there's rules
12:31
anyway you get given it in the queue as
12:32
soon as you join them
12:34
yeah because it's a main big thing isn't
12:36
it the queue
12:37
yeah we'll stay there for days uh the
12:39
rules are no barbecues no gazebos no
12:41
music after 10 p.m
12:43
and any tent can only hold a maximum of
12:45
two people
12:46
why is that is it or three or four or
12:50
six but
12:52
no it's to stop having massive tents
12:54
because there's only a certain amount of
12:55
space they want
12:56
you know but couldn't you have a massive
12:58
tent but only two of you in it
12:59
well again that's the kind of thing
13:01
that's trying to stop i think oh i see
13:03
yeah yeah i've done the queue and they
13:05
try to make it fun it is so you know you
13:07
start cueing it i think we started at
13:08
four in the morning and we managed to
13:10
get onto one of the very outer courts
13:12
so i don't think i've ever done anything
13:13
fun that began at 4am
13:15
except for if you've been up until four
13:16
right oh yeah there you go
13:18
i've never done that
13:21
um the thing about the uh grass at
13:23
wimbledon i found out
13:24
is that so obviously they're very very i
13:26
was about to say precious they're just
13:27
very precise about the grasses and it's
13:29
treated it's shaved by exactly a
13:31
millimeter
13:32
each week for 12 weeks but the guy who
13:35
does it the head groundsman is called
13:37
neil stubbly
13:38
[Laughter]
13:42
so you would have to kneel down to make
13:45
it
13:45
doubly yeah did you see that that study
13:47
just came out that says you can predict
13:49
who's going to win a tennis match based
13:51
on the noises they make
13:52
uh-huh and they're grunting if the
13:54
noises are making up oh
13:59
it's kind of similar it's uh so they
14:01
analyzed a bunch of top tennis players
14:03
and the
14:04
pitch of the grunts they make and the
14:05
higher pitch the grunts go the more
14:07
likely it is you'll lose
14:08
and in every case you get higher and
14:10
higher um you're getting less and less
14:12
good at tennis funny you don't grunt at
14:13
all when playing tennis neither do i uh
14:16
no neither of you are elite sports
14:18
people i do
14:19
i mean i do sometimes say things like
14:20
that's another game to you
14:23
but a lot of people think that even
14:25
though it's not against the rules
14:26
grunting is against the spirit of the
14:28
rules yeah yeah because it basically
14:30
gives you an unfair advantage according
14:32
to some people over the opposition
14:34
it does wasn't there a specific coach
14:35
who's like known as the grunt coach
14:37
yeah he's called nick baletieri right
14:40
and he
14:41
looks after celes agassi and sharapova
14:44
and the williams sisters
14:45
and they're all big grunters and he says
14:48
that actually
14:48
he doesn't tell them to do that it just
14:50
so happens to be the case that they do
14:52
um but then other people think that he's
14:54
telling them to do it because it stops
14:55
you from being able to hear the sound
14:57
the ball makes on the racket
14:58
and that might be able to give you some
15:00
clue as to what spin might be on it or
15:02
whatever there was a study that did show
15:03
that grunting makes people respond more
15:05
slowly
15:06
uh in tennis so it is an unfair
15:07
advantage um i saw
15:09
yesterday morning on the bbc there was a
15:12
little piece with david attenborough
15:13
which was really exciting because he's
15:15
very much
15:15
um involved with wimbledon in a large
15:18
way so
15:19
uh attenborough is the one who turned it
15:21
into color television
15:22
and there were interesting things that
15:24
happened with that one is that's when
15:26
they started using yellow tennis balls
15:28
up until then they used white tennis
15:30
balls and the reason they started doing
15:31
that is obviously color television it
15:32
was much more visual for people to see
15:35
as it was going along and there was this
15:36
other thing i haven't been able to find
15:37
it online but it was said in this piece
15:39
which is that the trophy that they
15:40
now use is not the original wimbledon
15:43
trophy it's a different trophy
15:44
because the original one just didn't
15:46
look that good on camera it was actually
15:47
black and white
15:48
it was a black and white trophy yeah no
15:50
they started using this different trophy
15:52
which is gold and so it it's more photos
15:55
yeah exactly we'll get rid of that old
15:56
coal and chalk trophy that we've been
15:58
using
15:59
it looked great live but they also used
16:02
tennis courts used to be hourglass
16:04
shapes didn't they until
16:05
wimbledon came along i mean so really
16:07
really early tennis courts yeah
16:09
no i did i didn't know until so until
16:11
wimbledon was established i think the
16:12
first wimbledon was in 1877.
16:14
um that was when they decided to make
16:16
them rectangular but before that they
16:17
used to go in at the net so they were
16:18
like
16:19
is wimbledon kind of the originator of
16:21
all these grand slams
16:22
is it the original grand slam i think it
16:24
was my space yeah
16:26
because before that it was just croquet
16:28
oh it really beat out croquet
16:29
it's a bit sad we could all so the
16:31
reason croquet disappeared was that they
16:32
thought let's start playing tennis on
16:33
these croquet lawns a bit and then
16:35
everyone went oh this is a better sport
16:37
so the fact that croquet is a pretty
16:39
sport the world
16:41
doesn't have a penalty penalty it's
16:43
language
16:44
one more year out there i think craic is
16:46
a great sport you could be really
16:47
devious
16:48
oh yeah not great i think you see the
16:50
true side of human nature when you play
16:51
croquet where do you guys learn about
16:53
football
16:55
uh the uber ceo as in uber's
16:59
ceo not uh not the chief of the ceo
17:02
not the chief he's been involved in what
17:05
people are calling a tennis scandal
17:07
is he the current one or the one that
17:08
he's just left this is travis
17:10
kalanick he's the one who just left his
17:12
biography on the website
17:13
uh amongst many other things of what
17:15
he's done in the past also claims that
17:17
he managed to rack up the second
17:19
highest wii tennis score in the world
17:21
yeah people are now claiming that they
17:23
think that that's
17:24
not possible i think it's not yeah
17:26
largely because there is no game called
17:27
wii tennis
17:28
you've got wii sports in which it's a
17:30
game within it but that doesn't have a
17:31
leaderboard
17:32
so it can't be that there's another game
17:35
which is called
17:36
wii grand slam uh tennis and
17:39
there's a third one which is called we
17:41
in your tennis ball
17:44
container
17:46
[Applause]
17:50
okay it is time for fact number two and
17:52
that is
17:53
accessing my fact this week is that in
17:55
mexico
17:56
artists can pay their taxes in artwork
18:00
it's amazing it's so weird it's the only
18:02
country where you could do this
18:03
unsurprisingly um and yeah it's this
18:07
rule that's actually existed since i
18:09
think it's 1957 that it was first
18:11
suggested and it's the idea that um
18:14
artists if they can't pay their taxes or
18:16
don't want to
18:17
they instead donate a work of art as a
18:19
portion of their sales
18:20
and so it's not even done on monetary
18:22
value the way it's done is that for
18:24
every five pieces of art you sell
18:27
you pay an additional one to the
18:28
government so if you sell up to five
18:30
pieces of art you pay one
18:31
and then if you sell more it becomes
18:32
like a progressive taxation system
18:34
and the maximum number you have to give
18:35
to the government any year is five works
18:37
of art that's interesting i wonder
18:39
so let's say you sell four incredible
18:42
massive works of art and then you just
18:44
do one doodle on a napkin does that
18:45
count
18:46
yeah that's a great question i don't
18:48
think it does count because apparently
18:49
there is a committee to make sure that
18:51
people don't take the piss
18:52
so it's basically you have to give them
18:54
an average one which means you're paying
18:55
20
18:56
i guess right yeah well they're not
18:58
clear i think it's a little bit more
19:00
um touchy-feely than that so yeah
19:02
there's this jury which is ten other
19:04
artists who
19:05
judge the quality of the painting and
19:07
decide whether it's
19:09
for an artist that's got to be hard
19:10
isn't it
19:12
this one's a bit dodgy what and some
19:15
have been rejected in the last few years
19:17
there are some famous artists who've had
19:18
their paintings rejected as taxes
19:20
which is pretty harsh but yeah and then
19:23
they go okay we'll we'll accept this one
19:25
as tax sure
19:26
so in south carolina you can donate a
19:29
dear carcass and get tax credit for it
19:32
there's a venison for charity tax credit
19:35
and so you don't pay tax on fifty
19:37
dollars if you donate a dead dear to the
19:39
government
19:40
so is there a box when you're doing your
19:43
tax
19:44
form just the numbers the amount of dead
19:46
deals you've got in your garage waiting
19:48
to be submitted
19:49
so hang on so brilliantly hunting is
19:51
allowed
19:52
uh yeah it's not that you find a deer
19:54
that's died
19:55
of natural causes i guess they'd have to
19:57
accept that as well i don't think they
19:58
specify cause of death
20:00
okay but they're not going to have a
20:01
mortician for every single
20:04
carcass that comes in are they that
20:05
would probably cost more than the 50
20:07
you're saving on the tax but you would
20:10
you're right you would hope that they
20:11
test the quality of the venison because
20:12
you don't want some old bit of rotting
20:13
road kill being
20:14
sent to the charity there's a committee
20:16
of 10 chefs
20:20
the world bank and pricewaterhousecooper
20:23
um came up with
20:24
a check for who has the most complicated
20:26
tax code in the world
20:27
uh and the way they did that is they
20:29
imagine a hypothetical
20:31
uh ceramic flower pot manufacturer and
20:34
this manufacturer has one building two
20:36
plots of land
20:36
one truck and sixty employees and they
20:39
work out how
20:40
difficult it would be for that person to
20:42
do their taxes okay
20:44
if you were in the maldives it would
20:46
take you less than an hour to comply
20:48
with the maldives tax code
20:50
and in brazil it would take 2 600
20:54
hours what to do which is 108 days of
20:58
non-stop work
20:59
no yeah that is insane yeah they just
21:02
got an incredibly complicated tax
21:04
code does is there much tax avoidance in
21:07
brazil
21:08
because i imagine that would surely
21:09
encourage people to avoid tax well
21:10
that's the argument isn't it that why
21:12
you should simplify your tax
21:14
code in every country because in america
21:16
in 1913 their tax code was 400 pages
21:19
and now it's 70 000 pages uh which is
21:22
about 280 times
21:24
longer than the tennis law book
21:29
all right but um in india at the moment
21:32
for instance they've massively
21:34
um simplified their tax um a thing
21:37
called
21:37
gst where there's just four basic rates
21:40
now whereas
21:40
in the past all the different areas and
21:43
villages with all of their different tax
21:44
codes and they simplified it that's what
21:46
we have in australia gst
21:47
yeah goods and standards taxes exactly
21:49
and um this is the biggest place that
21:51
has ever done it so in india there's 2
21:53
trillion
21:54
dollar economy with 1.3 billion
21:56
consumers
21:57
but it's so important to them this has
21:59
happened only in the last week or so
22:00
there was a baby named gst
22:05
that's great in australia apparently uh
22:08
there's a queen bee
22:09
tax um
22:13
that's right uh no if you sell a queen b
22:15
for over twenty dollars you have to pay
22:16
ten percent to the government
22:18
who's selling the queen bee for twenty
22:20
dollars that doesn't feel so good
22:21
forever
22:22
it feels like a lot for a bee are you a
22:24
queen
22:28
i still think that's a lot for a bee no
22:30
no don't that's so small
22:31
they produce a whole hive i mean diamond
22:34
rings are quite small aren't they
22:36
well how much do you think i spent on my
22:37
wife's engagement that's why it's a hula
22:39
hoop
22:40
i i think that is a lot are you joking
22:42
they can yield so because they're so
22:44
important they'll yield so much money
22:45
you'd make such a profit out of twenty
22:47
dollars
22:47
i think the normal price would be
22:48
hundreds of dollars for a queen bee yeah
22:50
well that's what i paid for my last q
22:51
b and i just don't want you to be
22:53
insinuating i was
22:54
taken for a fool i don't know is the
22:58
queen bee
22:58
pregnant at the time i think you might
23:00
need a
23:01
a drone or two yeah so then how much do
23:03
you pay for that one i think they're
23:04
cheap they're super cheap remember you
23:06
could rent one
23:06
we did that years ago that was one of
23:08
our first facts on the show yeah
23:10
but that's what i mean because to rent a
23:12
b is like
23:13
one cent per hour per b or something
23:15
stupid like that
23:16
so the queen bee is comparatively a lot
23:18
more than that it is and at the end of
23:20
the day they're all still bees
23:22
but if you
23:25
leave a queen bee somewhere yeah it'll
23:27
attract a load of other bees oh that's
23:28
right they'll just find them that's why
23:30
bees keep on you
23:31
see a car covered in bees somewhere
23:33
that's because there's a queen bee on
23:34
the bottom so really what you're doing
23:36
is you're paying for the queen b but
23:37
actually you're getting hundreds of
23:38
thousands of other bees
23:39
it's like a sky tv deal i imagine where
23:42
you pay for this guy would actually get
23:43
loads of channels
23:44
right except every channel is a b
23:48
and sky one is the queen bee is it yeah
23:50
that's right it seems expensive if you
23:52
think you're just fighting sky one
23:55
but you're actually getting like the sky
23:57
i do understand that now
23:58
i'm glad i put it into terms you can
24:00
understand
24:01
did you finish your story or did we cut
24:03
you off at queen b i think we extended
24:05
it far beyond
24:10
okay uh the irs in america one of the
24:13
things that's tax deductible for them
24:15
is ransom for kidnapped
24:18
loved ones if you pay to have
24:21
uh your loved one returned yeah they
24:24
that's tax-deductible
24:26
that's brilliant oh god that's an
24:27
expense like
24:29
so that's not true in britain because in
24:31
britain it's counted as a bribe
24:32
and bribes are illegal and you're not
24:34
allowed to claim them back anything
24:36
illegal but in america you can
24:37
and was it john paul getty yes um
24:40
who yeah who's um one of his family were
24:43
kidnapped
24:44
and they ransomed him for x amount and
24:46
he said he'd only pay
24:47
y amount and that was the maximum
24:49
expense that he was allowed to claim or
24:51
something like that yeah yeah so john
24:52
paul getty the third was kidnapped and
24:54
it was his father who
24:55
said he would pay the ransom um but only
24:57
up to 2.2 million
24:58
because then uh that's the maximum that
25:02
was allowed for tax deduction
25:03
did his son understand that he couldn't
25:05
go above that otherwise it would be
25:07
taxed i think he would have because i
25:08
think he would have been brought up in
25:09
the way that his dad conducted business
25:11
i read that warren buffett submitted his
25:14
first tax return when he was doing
25:15
newspaper and milk rounds so like you
25:18
know i think this guy would have been in
25:19
a similar like oh that makes sense dad
25:21
yeah
25:21
i like the excuse of um something my dad
25:24
told me
25:25
uh so ken dodd was accused of not paying
25:28
taxes for a while he was accused by the
25:29
inland revenue and
25:31
i feel like you when you made that face
25:33
we're doing an impression of ken dodd
25:34
i'm really sorry if that's not what
25:35
you're trying to do i wasn't
25:36
i once met ken dodd yeah he was a museum
25:38
wasn't it yeah and he said to me do i
25:40
know you and i said i don't think so and
25:41
he said yeah
25:42
i know you were on the same police
25:44
lineup together weren't we
25:45
[Music]
25:48
funny guy yeah he is funny um so
25:50
apparently he the inland revenue said
25:52
you haven't been paying us for years and
25:55
he said i didn't think it applied to me
25:57
i lived by the seaside
25:58
i did it no no doddy oh
26:02
yeah it's a joke
26:06
andy i'm sorry in 2015
26:10
one person living on a street in hull
26:12
complained that they were paying more
26:13
council tax than all of their neighbors
26:15
um they went to the council and the
26:17
council upped all of their neighbors
26:19
council tax
26:20
[Laughter]
26:22
turnout that made their life a lot worse
26:24
i imagine
26:31
okay it is time for fact number three
26:33
and that is
26:34
james okay my fact this week is that the
26:37
size of a rainbow
26:38
can tell you how polluted the air is
26:41
that's so so is the rainbow more of a
26:45
prominent feature in a more polluted
26:46
area it's it's not really easy for us to
26:49
see
26:50
but if you're a scientist you have the
26:51
right equipment you can see very
26:53
small changes um so if there are
26:55
chemicals
26:56
like acid rain it would change the size
26:58
of the droplets
26:59
which would change the size of the bow
27:01
and so they look at that and they can
27:03
tell exactly what
27:04
chemicals are in the air wow do you know
27:07
um like double rainbows
27:09
yeah um actually this isn't double
27:10
rainbows twin rainbows which is a
27:12
slightly different thing
27:13
you can have two rain showers that are
27:15
kind of near each other one with
27:17
small raindrops and one with fat
27:19
raindrops and they will give you two
27:21
different rainbows
27:22
and they'll start in the same bottom
27:23
left hand corner or bottom right hand
27:25
corner and they'll come around and one
27:26
will be
27:27
higher than the other one that's called
27:28
a twin rainbow yeah i've seen
27:30
those before have you yeah they're quite
27:32
rare yeah i mean it was i
27:34
i saw it once and that's it yeah right
27:36
where did you see it
27:37
um i think it was in austria at the time
27:40
really
27:41
yeah i really liked james's tone when he
27:42
went they're quite rare
27:44
like i think you probably just saw a
27:45
double rainbow
27:47
because yeah that's unbelievable so it
27:49
looks like it's sprouting from the same
27:51
origin but then
27:52
it sprouts into two different rainbows
27:54
no i wasn't listening was i
27:57
i've seen a really big rainbow that's
27:58
what i was saying
28:04
so you can get a quadruple rainbow wow
28:07
okay
28:07
there was a photograph online of a
28:09
quadruple rainbow it wasn't really a
28:10
quadruple rainbow
28:11
it was just four rainbows you can see
28:14
why they mistook that yeah you can see
28:16
it but it was it was a rookie error
28:18
a photograph of a quadruple rainbow just
28:21
looks like two rainbows
28:22
and the reason is that you've got two in
28:24
front of you
28:25
say the sun is behind you you've got two
28:28
rainbows in front of you and then they
28:29
reflect backwards
28:30
and so the other two are behind you so
28:32
it's impossible to take a photo
28:34
of them of all four of them at the same
28:36
time unless you do like a panoramic
28:38
picture yeah um and they're extremely
28:40
extremely extremely rare so you've
28:42
probably only seen a few of those i've
28:44
seen six of those
28:45
no more there's i think there's only one
28:47
photograph of them
28:48
ever right and it's only of two of them
28:50
it's not the other two oh okay
28:52
why because the camera couldn't get them
28:54
in because two are in front of you and
28:55
two are always behind you
28:57
done if you've been listening to any of
28:58
this you've literally just explained
29:00
that
29:02
um do you know you can get white
29:03
rainbows so this is
29:05
that's a cloud mate that you saw cloud
29:07
no no no no no no no no
29:09
these are they're big and fluffy and
29:10
they float in the sky
29:14
no they are these are light rainbows
29:15
they get called fog bows
29:17
okay so if you've got fog in the air
29:19
that's where the water droplets hanging
29:20
in the air are incredibly
29:22
microscopically tiny
29:23
so you do get the rainbow effect but
29:25
they're so small that they don't
29:27
actually show
29:28
color yeah they are stunning you can get
29:31
all
29:31
red rainbows as well just a single red
29:35
terrifying i know that's cool and a lot
29:37
shorter song as well
29:41
yeah they're sort of evening time aren't
29:42
they so it depends where the sun is in
29:44
the sky or the kind of color of your
29:45
rainbow they gradually start to lose
29:47
their colors one by one don't they the
29:49
shorter wavelengths
29:50
die first i was a good title for
29:52
something
29:53
yeah like a murder set at a radio
29:56
station a murder mystery
29:57
the shorter wavelengths die first yeah
29:59
in norway where they've just turned off
30:01
their fm
30:02
radio yeah so it's a scandi noir drama
30:06
but it's kind of also about the progress
30:07
of technology and leaving behind it's
30:09
got lots of layers
30:10
like a rainbow um
30:14
just on the red rainbow there's actually
30:16
a physicist
30:17
who in his lab has been creating
30:20
red rainbows as well using lasers
30:23
he's a physicist at the von carmen
30:25
institute for fluid dynamics in belgium
30:28
and he shoots a laser into a droplet
30:32
and so he gets these tiny rainbows that
30:33
are all red and
30:35
he says that the form of the rainbow
30:37
under those kind of controlled
30:39
conditions
30:39
you can precisely determine what shape
30:41
it's going to be what size it's going to
30:43
be what the composition and temperature
30:44
of it is
30:45
purely by looking at the droplet before
30:47
it's sprayed out how cool is that i
30:49
would say that's like a really small
30:51
version of this thing which is the
30:53
the size of the droplets and what
30:55
they're composed of
30:56
depends on what the rainbow looks like
30:58
on a bigger scale as well and that's how
31:00
you can tell all the pollution and stuff
31:01
right okay
31:02
so he says just to put it into super
31:04
cool dorky words
31:06
uh for this particular small one he does
31:08
in the lab
31:09
every single droplet has its own unique
31:12
rainbow fingerprint already in it
31:16
that's so cool do you guys like rainbows
31:19
just quick question yeah okay i'm i'm
31:22
more for them than against them yeah
31:24
that's two yeses i'm a huge yes
31:26
okay sorry well not everyone likes
31:28
rainbows
31:30
so uh this is um something from
31:33
amazonian cultures
31:35
and rainbows there are very bad luck as
31:37
in they're associated
31:38
with skin problems with having
31:40
miscarriages if you're pregnant
31:43
this doesn't make any sense they're so
31:45
clearly such a positive happy
31:47
okay no i think it's one of those glass
31:49
half empty things because it's caused by
31:51
sunshine and rain
31:53
now if it's always sunny and then you
31:54
get some rain then it could be a bad
31:56
thing
31:57
but if it's always rainy like it is in
31:58
britain then the fact that there's a
32:00
rainbow means at least there's some sun
32:01
around
32:02
okay this is from wikipedia i should say
32:04
so but
32:06
there is a saying um rainbows are
32:09
that's right how does that translate
32:14
there are diseases in one peruvian
32:16
language called iona achartan which
32:17
means
32:18
the rainbow hurt my skin what you might
32:20
say to the doctor and
32:21
it's traditional to close your mouth at
32:23
a rainbow otherwise you'll catch a
32:24
disease
32:26
oh wow yeah so i'm just saying they're
32:28
not all good so the skittles adverts
32:30
over there would not have gone down well
32:31
at all would they
32:32
do not taste the rainbow
32:36
um so the rainbow flag
32:39
for pride has all the rainbow colors and
32:41
it used to have a shocking pink
32:43
um bun and the reason they did away with
32:46
that is because they couldn't mass
32:48
produce the pink cloth
32:51
all the others were easy to make but
32:52
this was a cloth that wasn't very easy
32:54
to make because the first guy who did it
32:56
he kind of made it himself just a
32:58
one-off he didn't think of it being a
32:59
mass-produced thing
33:00
and then it became really popular and
33:02
they needed to make loads of them but
33:03
they couldn't get the pink
33:04
it was after the stonewall riots wasn't
33:06
it that suddenly in the late 70s
33:07
suddenly there was this massive demand
33:09
for these flags and they couldn't get it
33:10
but then it had so how many colors do
33:12
you think are in the
33:13
flag now i think seven um
33:17
[Music]
33:20
six did you just sing the rainbow song
33:23
and still come up with
33:24
six i took out i took out one did you
33:26
why any reason
33:27
why i put white in to since i've learned
33:31
about some
33:31
new rainbow you should have come up with
33:33
eight then
33:34
i didn't sing the full song i kind of
33:36
backed out and thought it feels like
33:37
there's only a few left
33:38
hang on dan i think we need to test
33:40
something quickly what are the colors in
33:41
a rainbow oh no
33:44
red and yellow and pink no
33:48
red well actually all the colors are in
33:50
there
33:57
the song is not the actual colors of the
33:59
rainbow that was a fun song you learned
34:00
hang on was i singing the right lyrics
34:02
though okay
34:03
all right now who's the fool but the
34:05
colors in the rainbow are
34:07
red orange yellow green blue indigo
34:08
violet that's the colors that you learn
34:10
although actually you know it's just
34:11
emerging i'd like to jump ship to the
34:13
end
34:14
i too was fooled by the song
34:18
what a lie of a song yeah it takes
34:20
something that things
34:21
people need to remember in day-to-day
34:24
life
34:24
it's like having a song january and
34:27
february and orange and purple
34:29
exactly it is me then i can understand
34:32
why you thought that it went red orange
34:35
whatever the song goes so what is it so
34:37
it's there are
34:38
seven colors in the rainbow red orange
34:40
yellow green blue indigo violet and the
34:41
pride flag used to have as we've said it
34:43
used to have
34:44
eight because it had these and the hot
34:46
pink and then it went down to seven
34:48
but then it only has six colors in it
34:49
now which i'd never noticed do you think
34:51
that maybe
34:52
it wasn't that the material was too
34:53
expensive it's that the creator of the
34:55
flag
34:55
also was basing it off the song and then
34:58
someone said what's pink doing there
35:00
and he thought oh yeah we can't stay
35:02
anyway it's so expensive
35:04
um so no it wasn't because of that he
35:05
knew the colors of the rainbow this guy
35:07
um the reason they lost the next color
35:10
was because when the flag was round
35:11
around poles then one color would get
35:13
lost
35:13
because it would be wound around the
35:14
pole um so they needed an even number
35:17
of colors basically because otherwise
35:20
this whole vertical stripe was it it
35:21
wasn't a vertical
35:23
it must be a horizontal pole what it
35:25
said was one hung
35:26
vertically from the lamppost of san
35:28
francisco's market street
35:30
the center stripe so if it was hung
35:31
vertically the center stripe went around
35:33
the pole
35:34
oh okay and so they decided they needed
35:37
an
35:37
even number so that that middle stripe
35:40
wasn't kind of
35:41
i don't know didn't disappear into the
35:43
poll yeah that was why they did it and
35:44
philadelphia this year has added a
35:46
couple of extra colors to
35:48
their flag that they have been using um
35:50
as a nod to racial diversity
35:52
oh okay cool yeah so they've gone up to
35:54
eight i think again oh really
35:56
yeah so they've added brown and black
35:59
they stand for the other colors stand
36:00
for really fun stuff don't they
36:01
yeah but it's such a shame they lost the
36:03
pink because so the person who designed
36:05
it said that
36:06
the hot pink stood for sex so the others
36:09
stand for life healing sunlight nature
36:11
magic
36:12
serenity and spirit but they've lost the
36:14
sex they should have got rid of the
36:15
magic one
36:16
get rid of why is magic even in there
36:18
i'm glad that stayed oh god
36:19
that's good and the other thing is that
36:21
we were saying about there being seven
36:22
colours in the rainbow
36:24
um i think that was newton who decided
36:26
that wasn't it
36:27
and the reason being we think probably
36:29
just because seven was like a magical
36:31
number it was like the seven
36:32
c's the seven you know it's his favorite
36:34
yeah it's his favorite number it's just
36:35
a good number
36:36
and so he kind of looked and decided
36:38
there were seven
36:39
distinct bands and actually if you look
36:41
at a rainbow you can decide
36:43
really yourself how many bands there are
36:44
there's pretty much an infinite number
36:46
although i always because i think we've
36:48
done that on qi and so i always look at
36:49
rainbows and think okay get beyond the
36:50
seventh thing
36:51
newton just made it up but i still only
36:53
ever see seven colors
36:54
i can't see more or less yeah
36:58
he passed away this year newton yeah
37:00
sorry to break a team
37:02
yeah he had a good innings gilbert baker
37:05
who is
37:05
the creator of the rainbow flag passed
37:08
away this year sadly yeah
37:10
oh newton as well in the same year it's
37:13
been a big 2017.
37:22
okay it is time for our final fact of
37:24
the show and that is my fact
37:25
my fact this week is that a new study
37:28
has revealed
37:29
that the genre of music with the most
37:31
references to drugs
37:32
is country music country music
37:36
has according to the survey 1.6
37:39
mentions per song on average of
37:42
drug usage and they did a list of genres
37:46
which used most drug references so it
37:48
started with
37:49
country music then jazz then pop
37:51
electronic rock folk and then at last
37:53
rap you missed out other yeah i know i
37:56
wasn't uh
37:57
because that's my favorite genre yeah
38:00
others
38:01
just underneath rock but above folk wow
38:04
yeah
38:04
and i thought country was folk so i'm on
38:06
a learning curve today
38:08
yeah um that is unbelievable though i
38:11
think that's really amazing
38:12
that rap has the fewest references yeah
38:15
i think some people have looked at the
38:16
methodology of this and aren't sure
38:18
i might send it up right we were talking
38:20
about this weren't we it just seemed so
38:22
unbelievable that this is the case well
38:24
what they did they took
38:24
didn't they the lyrics of many many
38:26
thousands of songs and they had a list
38:28
of drug-related words
38:29
quite a lot of drug-related words that
38:31
they plugged in and then they went
38:32
through manually
38:33
making sure that you know if someone
38:35
says reefer they're not actually singing
38:36
a song about
38:37
a coral reef man who works on a coral
38:40
reef yeah
38:42
exactly a lot of rap songs are about
38:45
people who work on coral reefs
38:46
yeah so that's probably why so yeah it
38:48
is but um
38:49
i wondered if the methodology went wrong
38:51
in that they're not cool enough to
38:53
understand some of the more modern
38:54
drug references because they came up
38:56
with this list of 65 names for drugs and
38:59
so the examples that were in this
39:00
article were
39:01
things like addie blow molly roxy
39:04
and scissor s-i double zed-u-r-p
39:08
so if they feature in a song that's that
39:10
kind of a drug but maybe raps just using
39:11
way more modern cool
39:13
slang for drugs these guys don't know
39:15
about that as opposed to scissor
39:16
the classic 1920s slang for what
39:19
what is this i've never heard scissor
39:20
before and you're saying it like it's a
39:22
hackneyed old term yeah
39:23
well it's such a good word to rhyme with
39:25
which is
39:26
about burping then you're going to need
39:28
a scissor
39:30
it's the only thing that rhymes yeah
39:31
yeah what is it i don't know what this
39:32
is
39:33
i don't think anyone has ever heard of
39:34
scissor except the person who wrote
39:36
whatever song refers to it
39:37
and then i'm just saying that like
39:39
they've got this list but maybe they've
39:40
missed things out that rap's using
39:42
i think they also used a lot of songs
39:45
perhaps you wouldn't hear on normal
39:47
country music stations yes
39:49
um and actually the more popular ones
39:51
probably aren't about scissors and the
39:53
other drugs
39:56
but they weren't counting because they
39:57
had a list of the drugs that they were
39:58
looking for as well they didn't include
39:59
alcohol
40:00
but i reckon if you throw alcohol and
40:02
you know country music has quite a lot
40:03
of references to that doesn't it
40:05
yeah tons so i've just googled scissor
40:07
yeah yeah it is a
40:09
purple drink a mix of codeine based
40:12
prescription cough syrup
40:13
soda and often jolly ranchers candy it
40:16
sounds quite nice doesn't it
40:17
yeah but don't do it kids
40:20
that sounds so country though jolly
40:22
ranchers candy
40:24
and then some prescription drugs yeah
40:25
classic country music you can't really
40:28
imagine snoop dogg on the scissors could
40:30
you
40:31
that's but really that's a word that's
40:33
closely i would
40:34
associate more with snoop than it is
40:37
exactly
40:38
it's interesting i wonder if in other um
40:40
reggae isn't on this list
40:42
blues is not on this list they've been
40:44
lumped into other
40:45
so blues would be in jazz i guess so
40:48
yeah reggae
40:49
that would be classical where's
40:51
classical in there yeah
40:52
symphony for scissor pin d minor
40:57
um you were saying about the words that
40:59
they use um did you see that america's
41:01
drug enforcement administration have
41:03
made a dictionary of slang drug terms
41:05
this year
41:06
i wonder if any of these are in it uh
41:08
wiffle dust
41:09
bernie's flakes i wonder if any of these
41:12
are in is that named after bernie
41:14
sanders well i don't know it's uh it
41:16
means cocaine
41:17
yeah that's bernie's flakes they're the
41:19
people who were going to show up to vote
41:21
for bernie sanders in the american
41:22
primaries but they didn't
41:25
and they were too off their heads aunt
41:28
hazel
41:28
means heroin i wonder if that's in any
41:30
of those songs smoochy witchy poochy
41:32
means that explains what my uncle ian
41:36
was up to
41:36
[Laughter]
41:39
his eyes called barbara every night he
41:42
was having a night in without hazel
41:47
it feels like it would be a good name of
41:48
a song maybe a eurovision hit
41:50
yeah yeah but what if you're just really
41:52
loved up and you're walking down the
41:54
street with your partner and you say
41:55
i'll give us this smoochy witchy poochie
41:57
and you're immediately arrested by one
41:59
of these guys you deserve to be
42:00
immediately arrested if you'll say to
42:01
your loved one in public give us a
42:03
smoochie
42:06
but i would say that that's probably
42:07
true of lots of slang terms for
42:09
drugs right yeah so if you do a song
42:12
called weed
42:13
into a tennis ball cam they might think
42:17
it's about drugs that's true
42:24

01:17
[Music]
01:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:21
no such thing as a fish
01:23
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:25
qi offices in covent garden
01:27
my name is dan schreiber and i am
01:29
sitting here with james harkin
01:31
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
01:34
and once again we have gathered around
01:35
the microphones with our four
01:37
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:39
and in no particular order
01:41
here we go starting with you james
01:44
harkin
01:45
okay my fact this week is that guinness
01:47
world records have
01:48
entries for most mouse traps released on
01:51
the tongue
01:52
most matchsticks extinguished by the
01:54
tongue are most
01:55
fan blades stopped by the tongue wow
01:58
is all the same guy no different guys
02:01
most
02:01
mouth traps released on the tongue and
02:03
yeah does it mean the mouse trap is
02:05
on the tongue or does the tongue made
02:07
its way into the mouth
02:08
it wouldn't be very impressive if you
02:11
just balanced a mousetrap on your tongue
02:13
and then it snapped against air in your
02:14
mouth
02:15
yeah it's really not that it's literally
02:17
getting a mousetrap sticking your tongue
02:18
in it and it just going snap
02:20
wow what is the record what's the most
02:23
the record is 53 uh and it was done by a
02:27
guy called whose surname is casey i
02:29
can't remember his first name
02:30
and weirdly he did it at the maryland
02:32
renaissance festival
02:34
where they're where they reenact things
02:37
that happened during the renaissance
02:39
yeah yeah that famous
02:42
yeah i think that was under louis xiv
02:44
wasn't it there's a uh
02:45
tongue record that's missing from your
02:47
list there yeah
02:48
yeah this is my favorite one the most
02:51
blow torches
02:52
extinguished with a tongue in one minute
02:55
so i want to compare matches to blow
02:57
torches then yeah how many blow torches
03:00
uh 48 in one minute in one minute
03:03
one minute it's this australian guy from
03:05
byron bay called shane but spelt ch
03:08
shane holtgren he had a blowtorch in
03:11
each hand
03:12
and he was putting them out with his
03:13
tongue uh and he did 48 in one minute
03:16
did you know that
03:17
chain holcron is married to zoe ellis
03:20
who holds a record for most mouse traps
03:22
released on the tongue in one minute
03:24
open brackets female close brackets oh
03:27
yeah so they have a talented tungsten
03:29
they meet at that
03:32
that uh convention or whatever and he
03:33
said
03:36
what just why why why did they marry
03:39
why did they do why do they do this
03:41
stuff because they want to get in the
03:42
guinness book of records fair enough
03:44
so for instance the guy who did the most
03:46
matchsticks extinguished
03:48
uh is a guy called ashrita fuhrman and
03:50
he holds record for the most guinness
03:52
world records
03:53
and basically he just tries to beat as
03:55
many world records as he can wow
03:57
so he also has records like um pogo
04:00
stick
04:00
jumping underwater longest duration
04:03
underwater okay
04:04
much easier underwater i think that
04:06
trivializes the good name of the
04:08
stopping of fan blade with your tongue
04:12
hopscotch most games in one hour how
04:14
many do you think that is
04:16
four 20. uh well how i don't know how
04:19
long a game of hopscotch takes
04:20
really me neither i can't remember how
04:22
it starts or finishes 3600 seconds in an
04:24
hour how long does it take to play a
04:25
game of hopscotch
04:26
well surely you can have unlimited
04:27
people playing hopscotch in which case
04:29
it could take forever but if there's
04:30
just one of you then you could do a game
04:32
every minute well i think if you're
04:33
trying to beat the record you probably
04:34
don't want
04:35
uh infinite number of people playing uh
04:37
he probably did it on his own
04:39
i'm gonna say it takes 20 seconds to
04:41
play a game of hopscotch
04:43
you know the rules of hopscotch i think
04:45
we've ascertained that dome so i think
04:46
what you do if my memory serves
04:48
is you throw a little stone onto the
04:50
number one and then you hop scotch it
04:52
around and then you come and pick it up
04:53
and then you throw it onto the two and
04:54
then you hop scotch around and then you
04:56
do three four five six seven eight
04:58
is that right anna that is correct why
04:59
do you have to throw a stone to get onto
05:01
the
05:02
well that's the game it's just the game
05:03
because if he's like why do i have to
05:04
hit this tennis ball over the net
05:06
what's even the point it just keeps
05:07
coming back but if you missed do you
05:09
have to throw again
05:10
if you missed if you missed the one if
05:12
i'm throwing my yeah
05:14
if you if you're playing against another
05:15
person say you and i were playing and
05:17
you missed the two
05:18
then it would be my turn to aim for the
05:19
one and it would be whoever completes it
05:22
first
05:22
i think i can see why tennis took off in
05:24
a bigger way to be honest
05:26
i think if you're missing the one you're
05:27
not made for that game
05:30
all right it's true it's one of those it
05:31
gets progressively harder because the 10
05:33
is further away from the one
05:35
all right then i'm gonna say it takes
05:36
five minutes to play game of hopscotch
05:37
so i think he did 12 in an hour he did
05:39
33.
05:40
33. i said 40. did i say you said 20.
05:43
great this is pretty good that's pretty
05:45
good um but
05:46
this guy furman is quite good because he
05:48
invents new things to beat records in
05:51
and so he invented a thing called land
05:53
rowing where you basically get a
05:56
indoor rowing machine you put wheels on
05:58
it
05:59
and then you try and go as far as
06:00
possible or as quick as possible
06:02
and he got the record in that because he
06:04
invented it but did guinness accept his
06:07
invented new criteria this biggest
06:09
weirdo in the playground who keeps on
06:11
making up
06:12
new records to break don't they decide
06:15
yeah you would think that i reckon he
06:16
must have friends on the inside right
06:18
yeah yeah i think he's broken so
06:20
many records they kind of like him and
06:21
they accept some of his more unusual
06:23
because they they must see his number
06:25
come up on the guinness
06:26
phone system in the office and go oh no
06:29
what's he thought of this time it's like
06:31
most phone calls
06:34
other rules about what you can do in
06:36
terms of um because they haven't got
06:38
like the record for the fastest anyone's
06:40
chop their own hand off yep
06:42
so where does it stop because you can
06:44
put out a blowtorch on your tongue which
06:46
i presume is quite painful
06:47
yeah so they tend to accept quite a lot
06:50
of things until someone says no this is
06:52
dangerous
06:53
so for instance they stopped um obese
06:55
animals quite recently
06:56
right oh yeah because there was always
06:59
people saying my cat
07:00
is you know the fattest cat ever uh and
07:02
then they said well actually
07:04
it's not very good to feed your cat mars
07:06
bars all the time so maybe we shouldn't
07:07
have this
07:08
record anymore with the uh record for
07:10
stopping
07:11
fan blades are we talking ceiling fan
07:15
or one of those fans where you'd have to
07:16
put your tongue in between the bits of
07:17
caging
07:18
in order to get surely it's a little
07:20
handheld fan i have a feeling it isn't
07:22
my
07:22
i've seen a photo of it but my memory
07:26
my visual memory isn't good enough to
07:27
remember what it looked like but i have
07:28
a feeling it was quite a big
07:30
fan right like a big sort of one that
07:33
you would get in a warehouse
07:36
imagine you're a rave and they have it's
07:38
getting really hot in there and so they
07:39
get some kind of industrial fans to put
07:41
in the corner yeah
07:42
it was implausible from when you said
07:43
imagine you're in a rave unless i'm
07:45
there
07:46
in an administrative capacity
07:51
the only rave i ever went to i got
07:52
kicked out of the sleeping on the floor
07:56
and i was the one who got trouble i woke
07:57
up everyone was doing drugs around me
07:58
and they're like hey you can't do that
08:00
in here
08:01
have you heard about the record for the
08:03
longest tongue this is another guinness
08:05
record
08:06
um okay so the average tongue the
08:09
average person's tongue is 10
08:10
centimeters from the back of the throat
08:11
right the point is called the oropharynx
08:13
it's where it joins the
08:14
back of your mouth okay um the man with
08:17
the world's longest tongue as of 2015
08:18
was a guy called nick sturbill
08:20
and he has a tongue which when his mouth
08:22
is closed extends 10 centimeters
08:25
out of his mouth he's got an entire
08:28
whole normal tongue outside his mouth
08:31
but not when his mouth is closed because
08:32
when his mouth is closed it will be
08:33
inside his mouth you mean when his mouth
08:35
is closed around his tongue can you put
08:36
it on
08:37
there he can put it back in his mouth
08:38
yes you can put it back in his mouth
08:39
does he roll it up like a party no he
08:41
doesn't roll it up like a thing he's
08:43
missing a trick then
08:44
yeah how does he fit in well he says
08:46
it's perfectly comfortable doesn't he
08:47
yeah
08:48
i would have thought that would be
08:48
really uncomfortable he doesn't know any
08:50
different does he
08:51
that's a really good point he do you
08:53
know what he uses his tongue for
08:56
he's a respectable man he
09:00
um he advertises on it
09:03
like little banners yeah that'd be great
09:05
does he pretend to have a party but
09:07
party popper you know those things you
09:08
blow but he doesn't it's just his tongue
09:10
that's not what he does no does he use
09:12
it to point directions to strangers when
09:14
he has both his hands full
09:16
yeah he doesn't you're one letter off
09:18
with pointing though
09:19
um he paints with it so he said that he
09:22
made the good argument that a gift is
09:24
something that you're born with
09:25
you get given but to turn it into a
09:27
talent you have to use it in the best
09:30
way you can
09:30
is his philosophy so he's taken to
09:32
painting with his tongue
09:34
and um he calls it licking so if he did
09:36
in fact
09:38
that's really good how do you say it
09:41
again
09:41
licking yeah so he'll say i licked his
09:43
favorite animal is a beaver he claimed
09:45
to
09:47
i know because he's got a sense of humor
09:49
this guy um
09:50
so he'll say you know i just licked a
09:51
beaver and that'll be he just painted a
09:53
beaver
09:54
but we have a word for painting things
09:56
yeah not with the tongue though this guy
09:57
can call it whatever he likes
09:58
he's the one doing it but licking is
10:01
it's taken
10:02
it's done that's not how it works with
10:03
words
10:05
it does have to he does have to wrap his
10:07
tongue in cling film before he
10:08
dips it in the paint does that make
10:10
sense because the paint is
10:12
acrylic or who knows it might be
10:13
lead-based paint that he uses either way
10:15
he then has to lick the canvas with a
10:17
pink cling film
10:18
covered paint covered tongue because he
10:20
was inspired by someone he saw on
10:21
youtube an indian man who
10:23
painted with his tongue but who also got
10:24
quite bad toxic fumey poisoning so he
10:27
decided
10:28
to avoid that but you know who he says
10:29
his favorite artist is when he was asked
10:30
to his favorite artist was
10:32
his second favorite is picasso lick
10:34
castle oh
10:36
yeah can you give us a clue um it's
10:39
someone like picasso is it one of those
10:40
elephants
10:41
oh you're that's unbelievably close my
10:42
clue is that dan's really close
10:44
uh the the monkey bubbles coco the
10:46
gorilla oh
10:47
yeah yeah very good on tongues
10:50
um there's a job which is a baby food
10:54
taster
10:54
and i was reading i think it was in the
10:56
guardian a woman called beth anderson
10:58
wrote a piece about what it's like being
11:00
a baby food taster so she's a super
11:01
taster
11:02
which we've talked about before which is
11:03
people who have many times more taste
11:05
buds on their tongues than normal people
11:07
and she's just her company has just
11:09
insured her tongue for a million pounds
11:11
wow so valuable is her tasting ability
11:13
so if she accidentally is looking
11:15
near the skirting board and there's a
11:16
mouth trap down there and she dives into
11:19
it
11:19
first but she says she really tries to
11:23
get into the mindset of a baby when she
11:24
tastes it
11:26
wow
11:31
sucking on people's nipples
11:35
she just says she makes a real effort to
11:37
get into the mindset of a baby so each
11:39
time she puts a spoonful of pureed
11:41
shepherd's pie in her mouth she tries to
11:42
remember being six months old again
11:44
um just about like skillful tongues um
11:47
there's a guy called gliniecki i can't
11:50
remember his first name either
11:52
but he is one of the record holders in
11:54
tying a cherry stem with his tongue
11:57
do you know this kind of trick that
11:58
people do yeah yeah um
12:00
so his um the first time he ever tried
12:02
it was in a bar in
12:03
uh florida and it took him 20 minutes to
12:05
do just one of them
12:07
and now his record is 670 stems in an
12:11
hour
12:12
wow in an hour yeah that's about right
12:15
well wait no way wow every six seconds
12:19
that's good isn't it but then apparently
12:20
he says um you
12:22
if you try it you'll get faster with
12:23
practice but if you master the skill
12:25
be prepared for relentless sexual
12:28
subtext that comes with it
12:30
oh poor guy i bet he's really hating
12:32
that yeah did he invent that practice
12:34
no he didn't as a reasonably common
12:37
thing i remember
12:38
hearing about it when i was a kid me too
12:39
yeah apparently you put it in your mouth
12:41
you fold it over by folding your tongue
12:43
over you know like folding it backwards
12:46
and then
12:46
you somehow manipulate the ends so that
12:49
it goes into a loop
12:50
yeah this is what so my brother does it
12:52
and then he's like it's really easy you
12:53
just fold it backwards with your tongue
12:54
and you're like yeah i've got that bit
12:55
and then you go and then you just weave
12:57
one bit through the other
12:58
what am i using to do that yeah my
13:00
epiglottis
13:04
knock it in with that if you are a
13:07
sommelier
13:09
do you know what you should be doing
13:10
with your tongue to keep it match fit
13:12
okay so we're talking wine tasting here
13:15
we are
13:15
um you should dip it in
13:19
olive oil once a day that's nice should
13:21
you hang it
13:22
hang it out of your mouth as often as
13:23
possible so it gets aired
13:27
yeah maybe yeah is it is it that you rub
13:29
it with something or you treat it with
13:31
something
13:31
sort of yeah well i know i know the one
13:35
that i've got on the paper but you might
13:36
have all suggested correct
13:38
answers as well i phrased that really
13:40
badly i'm not informed on what you
13:42
shouldn't do
13:43
um the answer is is that uh you should
13:45
lick rocks
13:46
oh come on yeah what does that mean it
13:49
just
13:50
um it's to train their palate so i guess
13:52
it clears them it wraps it up maybe it
13:53
releases
13:54
sort of things but that's what they
13:55
recommend it's this new book that's come
13:57
out called cork dork and that's what you
13:58
call
13:59
um obsessive sommeliers cork dorks cork
14:02
dogs
14:02
that's great yeah so the cork talks they
14:04
lick rocks um
14:05
they do tasting sessions at 10 a.m which
14:08
they call tongue cardio
14:09
well at 10 a.m time the magic hour for
14:12
the time
14:13
cardio yeah can i just say one thing
14:16
about tongue prints
14:18
uh i read an article this was in a
14:20
scientific journal about how tong prints
14:22
might be a good thing to use instead of
14:23
fingerprints oh wow
14:25
and they said it's good because you can
14:27
stick it out of your mouth for
14:28
inspection uh otherwise it's well
14:30
protected in your mouth
14:32
so you know you keep it protected but
14:34
then you can stick it out
14:36
it's difficult to forge according to
14:38
them um
14:40
according to them the act of physically
14:42
reaching or thrusting it out is a
14:43
convincing proof for liveness
14:46
in a person as well i've always i've
14:48
always said that
14:49
yeah whereas if what you mean if you're
14:51
sort of in a passport queue and you're
14:52
holding your
14:53
person you've just murdered by the art
14:54
you can shove their finger onto the
14:56
print thing yeah and no one will be any
14:58
wiser exactly does it not suffer though
15:01
from
15:01
remember there's that fact about how
15:03
people in pineapple factories
15:05
were uh losing their fingerprints
15:07
because of the
15:08
acidic quality of the pineapple there's
15:10
an enzyme in it
15:11
yeah and so and isn't there another fact
15:13
that pineapples kind of eat our tongues
15:15
as we're eating it
15:16
so wouldn't you be altering your
15:17
fingerprints every time you had a
15:19
pineapple
15:20
yeah but then it's the same problem with
15:21
the fingerprints so it's no more
15:23
problems than you already had
15:24
kinda except all of us don't work in a
15:26
pineapple factory but all of us don't
15:28
eat pineapples constantly either
15:29
presumably you're touching pineapples
15:30
with your fingers as much as you're
15:31
eating them unless people are feeding
15:33
you
15:34
either i just i would hate to like lose
15:36
a case because the guy
15:37
who robbed my house has a big love of
15:40
pineapples
15:42
i would have left his tongue print
15:44
unless unless
15:45
you had a collection of rocks that he
15:47
loved and he was a civilian
15:48
maybe he did some painting at my house
15:52
i thought
15:57
you decide to rob a geologist
16:08
okay it is time for fact number two and
16:11
that is my fact
16:12
my fact this week is that pope john paul
16:14
ii pope mobile
16:16
can be hired out for stag dues and
16:18
hindus
16:19
[Laughter]
16:21
so this is the one that was built when
16:22
he visited ireland in 1979
16:25
and it was built by these two guys who
16:28
were given a brief to build it
16:29
they weren't given too much money to
16:30
build it so some other thing is that
16:33
well it was a problem because some of
16:35
the things that are attached to the
16:36
modern pope mobile that pope francis
16:38
uses i.e bulletproof glass
16:40
uh was not affordable for the one
16:42
because no one was willing to pay for it
16:43
it cost like 200 000 pounds
16:45
they asked the government for the money
16:46
didn't they but it never made it into
16:48
their account yep exactly
16:49
so instead they use shatterproof glass
16:51
and one of the builders said
16:53
so you know if a fellow threw a stone at
16:54
the vehicle the glass wouldn't break
16:58
that was the level of protection that
16:59
the irish pokemobile was giving
17:01
but so yeah so um once he left the pope
17:04
mobile remained in ireland
17:05
and it went to a museum there were two
17:07
of them and they decided that it would
17:09
be fun to rent them out for stag dues
17:11
and hen parties
17:12
and that's what's done and it still
17:14
includes the original chair that the
17:15
pope sat on
17:16
inside the actual look like is it like
17:20
the
17:20
because i think of the mobile as being a
17:21
basically a bubble you're so yeah you're
17:23
thinking of like the golf buggy
17:25
yes version of the pope there's many
17:27
like the batmobile there are many many
17:29
different versions
17:30
there's only one version of the
17:31
batmobile no there's plenty you've got
17:33
the
17:33
the adam west batmobile you have the uh
17:35
they all look the same don't they they
17:37
look nothing like
17:38
each other black no they are they're not
17:40
they're basically they're guys they're
17:41
not look at photos i can't believe we're
17:43
having this chat they are completely
17:44
different
17:45
how do you know it's a batmobile then
17:47
because batman's in it there are two
17:50
does any car become a batmobile yeah for
17:52
the purposes if he's so if i gave him a
17:54
lift in my mini
17:56
if he has to get a train to a crime does
17:58
not become the bad train but it's still
18:00
mobile
18:00
so it would be a mobile oh yeah yeah
18:02
yeah he has a back copter
18:04
the helicopter right yeah so there's you
18:07
just put batman in it and it belongs to
18:08
it so
18:09
same with the pope same deal with the
18:10
pokemon you put pope in any card
18:13
yeah so what do these staggered handies
18:16
because surely it can only fit one
18:17
person in it no it's a pretty boring
18:18
stag too you put the stag in it and then
18:21
everyone else stands
18:22
either side of it kind of throws rocks
18:24
at it
18:27
so what it had was a sort of a
18:29
truck-like area where 15 people could
18:31
sit inside including the pope
18:32
and then it had a balcony of sorts where
18:35
the pope came out to
18:36
on the front to wave to people with a
18:38
hand railing to make sure he didn't fall
18:40
uh that's why it can be lent out the
18:42
stag dudes because up to 15 people or 16
18:45
people can be inside of it
18:46
but it cost it was 300 euros an hour to
18:49
rent wasn't it
18:50
yes and they they kind of suss out what
18:52
kind of stagger you're going to be
18:53
because obviously they want a bit of
18:54
respect
18:55
in the pope's chair uh yeah you would
18:57
have yeah they said we'll be selective
18:59
about who we choose i don't know how
19:01
selective you can be with stag dues
19:03
anything that's marketing itself is a
19:05
stag dude oh i don't know i've been on
19:07
some pretty respectful spaces
19:11
[Laughter]
19:16
oh dear um but pope john paul said he
19:19
didn't even like the
19:20
names pope mobile he asked the media not
19:23
to use the word pokemobile because he
19:25
thought it was undignified
19:26
so imagine if he could have found out
19:27
what would happen to it
19:29
yeah and same with pope francis and the
19:31
modern one they all hate the word pope
19:33
mobile because they think it sounds as
19:34
you say a bit
19:35
sort of i see pope francis doesn't uh
19:37
doesn't like it at all does he
19:38
he's very modest and he thinks that he
19:41
you shouldn't be
19:42
rolling around in this grand thing
19:43
especially for you and he mostly just
19:45
uses the vehicles that
19:46
the vatican has it's got like a bunch of
19:48
vehicles you can rent out
19:49
he drives himself around town on his own
19:52
he prefers to be out in the open so he
19:53
has an open top because there was an
19:55
assassination attempt and so since then
19:57
they were often bulletproof and stuff
19:59
but he's like no i want to feel closer
20:00
to my people
20:01
so he just stands in an open top car he
20:03
told reporters
20:05
it's true anything could happen but
20:06
let's face it at my age i don't have
20:08
much to lose
20:09
yeah it's a very relaxed effort yeah
20:11
yeah and he so the current one that he
20:13
has
20:13
you always see it going at about 10
20:15
miles an hour but if it needs to make a
20:17
sudden escape
20:18
it can go up to 160 miles per hour yeah
20:21
it could just
20:22
get away at 160. i think that was the
20:25
last pose wasn't it the golf buggy type
20:26
one
20:27
oh yeah yeah yeah that's something
20:30
that an aerodynamic could get up to yeah
20:33
160.
20:35
it's impossible i think wings come out
20:37
the side and it just
20:38
balances it but he's not driving it so
20:40
he'll just sit in the box
20:41
no no he doesn't drive the car i thought
20:44
he said no that's you're making a batman
20:47
you said he drives himself around do you
20:48
mean in his little car i said that and
20:50
that's the latest one drives himself
20:51
around
20:52
just in the rental car just rents a car
20:54
it's vatican
20:55
special vatican cars that they have and
20:57
they have their own license plates don't
20:58
they
20:58
yeah they all have a special vatican
21:00
city license plate number
21:02
cv1 which stands for stato de la chita
21:04
del vaticano which just means vatican
21:06
city basically
21:07
but the locals the local joke in rome is
21:10
that it stands for say christo vedesi
21:14
hang on james let me explain
21:18
you don't need to explain the chat
21:19
you're right let's move on
21:21
but can you explain it please it just
21:22
means uh say christopher it just means
21:24
if only christ could see this
21:26
it's a joke about the pope being flash
21:28
no i get it oh god okay
21:30
move on um these two guys who built this
21:33
original
21:34
pope mobile that we were talking about
21:36
yeah they owned this company called obam
21:39
and they were the biggest vehicle
21:40
builders in the country at the time
21:42
and they claimed to be the first people
21:44
to make refrigerated trucks in ireland
21:47
and this is the origin story of the
21:49
company they were in town one day having
21:51
a pint
21:52
when they got a bus home they noticed
21:53
there were trucks going up and down the
21:55
road
21:55
and said we should start doing a
21:57
business making trucks
22:00
and then they became the biggest truck
22:01
makers in ireland wow i made the pokemon
22:03
awesome origin story
22:07
uh and the other thing about this pope
22:09
mobile the original one that we were
22:10
talking about is there is a place
22:12
to keep a gun uh and that was because
22:15
u.s archbishop pal marcinkus
22:19
was with the uh pope at the time and he
22:22
always carried a gun with him wherever
22:23
he went i love the sound
22:25
and this guy a deranged priest attacked
22:28
him once with a bayonet
22:30
wow yeah and so he always kept a gun by
22:32
his side the pope he was
22:33
he was going for the pope a deranged
22:35
priest
22:36
beautiful words ran at the pope with a
22:38
bayonet
22:39
and this guy uh marcinkus
22:43
managed to thwart him
22:46
with his gun no with his bare fists
22:49
from then on when they built the
22:51
pokemobile they built this little pouch
22:52
underneath
22:53
my sink as a seat so that he could have
22:55
his gun in there
22:56
the last time that there was an
22:57
assassination attempt on the pope
22:59
um it was this guy called mehmet ali
23:02
adchay
23:03
and it was in 1981 and he'd actually
23:05
escaped from prison
23:06
in turkey for another murder but he
23:08
tried to kill the pope and he went to
23:10
prison
23:10
and he's been let out now and he's done
23:12
a bunch of things first of all he said
23:14
he wants to meet the current pope
23:16
yeah bring him over maybe he feels
23:19
really bring the other pope who retired
23:21
as well
23:22
can they get that open roof car that he
23:24
loves getting in
23:26
he's he's seen the area of his way so he
23:28
also wants to convert catholicism
23:30
and one of the first things he did was
23:31
he went and laid uh some roses at the
23:33
john paul the second tomb who is the guy
23:35
that he tried to assassinate um but he's
23:37
also said
23:38
in 2010 he said by the way guys i'm up
23:40
for killing osama bin laden if you guys
23:42
want me to
23:43
who made you dress up as the pope
23:48
i think you're all being really cynical
23:50
about this recently reformed man
23:52
he's also approached dan brown because
23:54
he wants to write a book with him
23:56
what um yeah he wants to write a book of
23:58
uh his life and adventures as a
24:00
potential pope assassin but yes i quite
24:02
like that um all these countries around
24:03
the world
24:04
have popemobiles waiting to go so
24:07
occasionally they bring a pokemobile in
24:09
a plane if the pope is visiting a
24:11
country
24:12
so like the beast like how uh the
24:14
american president has the
24:16
the big beast car that gets taken
24:18
overseas in
24:19
in the planes they do that but most
24:21
countries like ireland have one
24:22
well ireland used to have one already i
24:24
don't think they'll be using that one
24:26
hopefully this is his next visit just
24:27
wipe it down
24:30
okay we need to have it returned pope by
24:32
seven because there's a stag do for
24:33
mickey
24:41
okay it's time for fact number three and
24:44
that is
24:45
andy my fact is that there is no such
24:47
thing as a manta ray
24:49
okay so just to clarify what a manta ray
24:51
is before i blow your minds
24:53
it's a type of fish it's a type of fish
24:55
of which there is no such thing
24:57
yes and this is another thing which is
24:59
already part of a no such thing
25:01
thing which is also a no such thing
25:03
exactly yes
25:04
it's become kind of an anti-matter
25:05
podcast hasn't it it's a dark
25:07
matter podcast um so there is a new
25:10
uh paper out about these things manta
25:12
rays and you'll you'll know what i mean
25:14
when i say monterrey the absolutely
25:15
massive
25:16
sail-shaped fish that swim through the
25:18
water they're really huge sometimes
25:20
you'll see it on the sidebar of the
25:21
internet with one behind a lady in a
25:23
bikini
25:24
yes it's a very popular meme it's a
25:26
photo that was taken
25:28
where three people were having the photo
25:29
in the ocean and suddenly behind them
25:31
manta ray rises up and is photobombing
25:33
them oh that's very nice okay well those
25:35
things don't exist basically
25:37
so there's a new study uh in the
25:39
zoological journal of the linnaean
25:41
society and there are two species of
25:42
manta ray
25:43
and there are nine species of mobular
25:45
ray and this paper is arguing that manta
25:47
rays have basically been miscategorized
25:50
and that they actually all fit into
25:52
mobula they're saying basically that
25:53
they're all the same thing
25:54
but because modulars were named first
25:57
that everything has to be called mobular
25:59
because you're always named after the
26:00
first thing that gets named
26:02
yeah and these are not different enough
26:03
basically to be their own
26:05
genus but the problem is mobula is not
26:08
very common
26:09
word whereas manta ray is a relatively
26:12
common
26:12
word so people are just going to carry
26:14
on calling the manta rays even though
26:16
they're not really called that
26:17
yeah i think even i may do despite the
26:19
fact that this is my fact this week
26:20
no i think we should start the campaign
26:23
is a funnier word i think
26:24
yeah yeah yeah mobile is a bit
26:26
onomatopoeia because well i bet they
26:28
make a sound a little bit like
26:29
mobile in the water do you think they do
26:32
you think they name themselves
26:34
yeah i assume isn't that what we'll fish
26:37
you do them what they're called they
26:38
tell you then you kill them and put them
26:39
in a museum yeah
26:41
unless you name them alfred which is
26:43
what the reef
26:44
manta is called what what what it's
26:47
called alfred it's called manta alfredi
26:49
oh that's cool is he named after
26:51
batman's butler
26:52
that's right yes
26:57
um no it's named after queen victoria's
26:58
son alfred who was the first british
27:01
royal to visit australia
27:02
so they were so excited about getting a
27:03
proper royal over that uh
27:05
they named a mantra after him we
27:07
actually got an email about this
27:08
a couple of weeks ago from a guy called
27:10
rich horner who works out in bali at the
27:13
exact spot where they were doing
27:15
all these things i mean he works out in
27:17
bali or he works out
27:18
in bali he worked out in bali and
27:20
between jim sessions
27:22
he wrote us an email uh so
27:25
he wrote us an email saying he's been
27:26
dying to tell us this rages because he
27:28
listens to our podcast and has been
27:30
known for a while um
27:31
so he said news just in there's no such
27:33
thing as a manta ray they've just been
27:35
reclassified as big devil rays
27:37
brackets mobile arrays after dna study
27:39
of them i work in bali
27:41
on nusa lembongan which i believe is an
27:44
area
27:44
that's pronounced differently where
27:48
we work with marine megafauna foundation
27:50
team to id the manta rays here creating
27:52
a database of them all
27:53
we thought we had 30 to 40 of them 10
27:55
years ago but by using their unique spot
27:58
patterns on their chest and belly we
27:59
worked out that there were over 600
28:01
individuals here
28:02
on our island um so the project was set
28:05
up there by andrea marshall andrea
28:06
marshall was the subject of a natural
28:08
history documentary
28:09
called andrea queen of the mantis and
28:11
she was visiting the other day
28:13
giving us an update presentation on her
28:15
current research and then dropped the
28:16
bombshell that her geneticist colleagues
28:18
were writing a paper describing them as
28:20
just
28:20
big devil rays i've been itching to tell
28:23
you guys this for ages there we go oh
28:25
yeah
28:25
and he's offered that if we want to go
28:26
swimming with these new mobile arrays uh
28:28
we're more than welcome to in bali
28:30
yes yes yes please please do you think
28:32
was there a huge
28:33
gasp in the conference where she
28:35
announced that actually manta rays were
28:37
just devil raised i reckon
28:39
some people stormed out i think you're
28:41
right a few fainted maybe
28:44
giraffes you find out that they're
28:46
actually just big deer
28:48
yeah it's huge that's what this is like
28:51
but there must be like people who study
28:53
modulars and people who study
28:55
mantas yeah and now there's only one job
28:57
for those two people
28:58
yeah yeah yeah sackings ahoy
29:02
um do you know they mate in a train in a
29:05
train
29:06
in a train of manta rays so like a conga
29:09
line
29:10
in a conga line yeah god you've been in
29:13
some pretty spicy parties
29:16
if they're mating in a train doesn't
29:17
that mean you're always mating with
29:19
someone who's actually meeting with
29:20
someone else who's actually meeting with
29:22
someone else
29:22
oh yeah and is there always some poor
29:25
mobile array at the front
29:26
who's not getting any action unless they
29:29
do it in a ring
29:30
yes unless it's a ring is it a ring that
29:32
wouldn't be a train that'd be a weird
29:33
train
29:34
it would be like a monorail yeah i've
29:37
got the answer here
29:39
we'll take it so no it's up to 30 males
29:41
follow around
29:42
one female right and she leads them on a
29:45
dance and she tests their endurance
29:47
to see if they're fit enough to uh to
29:49
breed with her and eventually she
29:51
selects one she does a load of cool
29:52
swooshy moves through the water so
29:54
it's a bit like the conga isn't it it's
29:55
a bit like the the person at the front
29:57
sets challenges yeah
29:58
they do a dance don't you yeah you
30:00
follow when they're like
30:02
yeah yeah and if you stay until the end
30:04
you get to have sex with someone
30:06
that's
30:10
eventually the female at the front of
30:12
the congress selects a single male and
30:13
they mate
30:14
that's cool they are very social and
30:16
they hang out sort of in
30:18
in groups together don't they so they
30:19
eat socially like
30:21
like humans a bit um sort of in that
30:24
they do what's called stacking
30:25
so there's one manta ray that will be at
30:27
the front and that's the one who's doing
30:29
most of the feeding
30:31
and then he'll eat a lot or she will eat
30:33
a lot of the plankton
30:34
and then the other plankton will be
30:36
whipped around his body
30:37
and then we'll feed into the gaping
30:38
mouth of the people behind him and they
30:40
switch around who's at the front
30:41
so they just take it in turns who gets
30:43
to be the prime feeder very nice
30:44
it's really sweet yeah not if you're a
30:46
plankton no that's true
30:48
no one ever really reflected absolutely
30:51
if you're a plankton yeah
30:52
if you think you've got past one of them
30:54
you're like thank god for that and then
30:55
another one
30:56
[Laughter]
30:58
there is an article called how do you
31:00
stick a camera on a manta ray that i
31:02
read
31:03
um do you know how you do that no uh
31:06
super glue oh
31:07
um i mean i read that they're naturally
31:09
incredibly mucusy
31:10
so wouldn't it just they're coated in
31:16
mucus
31:18
no is it that you just pop it on them in
31:20
the mucus
31:21
[Laughter]
31:22
that's one of the problems so if you
31:24
they usually put things on
31:26
um fish like with a suction cup but the
31:30
skin of the manta ray doesn't really
31:32
allow for that falls off quite quickly
31:34
and so there were some scientists and
31:35
they had some peanut peanut butter with
31:37
them
31:37
and so they decided to smear peanut
31:39
butter on the camera on the suction pad
31:42
and it worked miles better and they stay
31:43
on for like four or five hours now wow
31:45
that is amazing yeah that's wow why do
31:48
scientists have peanut butter but not
31:50
an adhesive a scientific kind of glue
31:53
crunchy or smoothies well that's the
31:56
real question
31:59
i'll start with adam's question i think
32:02
with proper adhesive it might be
32:04
difficult because it might be toxic i
32:06
suppose or
32:07
you don't want it to stay on forever
32:09
it's quite good that it comes off after
32:10
a few hours yeah
32:11
all right i've forgotten what dan's
32:14
question was i'm so smooth
32:16
i've actually deliberately forgotten
32:18
about it i'm sorry sorry
32:20
i it must be smooth right yeah um there
32:22
is one amazing website called
32:24
elasmo-research
32:25
dot something um and it just has a q a
32:30
section about manta rays it reads like
32:32
it was written
32:33
by a manta ray basically uh it's
32:36
just complete nonsense
32:39
no it says is it true manta rays have
32:41
rescued fishermen
32:43
and the answer is probably not if apart
32:46
from breeding season mantas are not
32:48
terribly interested in one another
32:50
they're probably not interested in
32:51
hapless fishermen
32:55
i either they can recognize themselves
32:56
in a mirror we think we think
32:58
we're not sure but if that is true that
33:00
is massive because no fish has ever been
33:02
shown to recognize itself in a mirror
33:04
how did so when you say we think um it's
33:06
about how they act in front of the
33:08
mirror as opposed to acting in front of
33:09
another
33:10
manta ray so for instance if i was to
33:12
put um a spot
33:13
i've got a marker in my hand if i was to
33:15
put a spot on your forehead
33:16
and then showed you a mirror you would
33:18
likely because you're an intelligent
33:20
human
33:20
kind of try and wipe it off got it and
33:23
so if you did it to
33:24
an animal if you did it to let's say a
33:26
um a shrew
33:27
and put a dot on the head they wouldn't
33:29
recognize that it's their head with the
33:31
dot on it so they wouldn't try and wipe
33:32
it off
33:32
okay if you did it to some primates they
33:34
would if you did it to an elephant they
33:36
would and i think what you're saying is
33:37
manta ray would as well right although
33:39
the way they tested it with the manta
33:40
rays
33:41
this time excuse me you've just got a
33:44
little bit of um
33:46
was nothing as advanced as that they
33:48
said that they put mirror in front of
33:49
the manta rays
33:50
and they noticed that the manta rays
33:52
first of all they didn't seem to try and
33:54
attack or interact with the thing in the
33:56
mirror which implied that they knew it
33:57
wasn't another manta ray right and
33:58
second of all they blew bubbles and made
34:00
odd body movements as if they were
34:02
showing off their own bodies in front of
34:04
the mirror wow
34:04
i believe it i completely dig it and i
34:06
think they do save
34:07
fishermen actually
34:11
i think it's very sweet
34:13
[Music]
34:18
okay it is time for our final fact of
34:20
the show and that
34:22
is chozinski my fact is the former mayor
34:24
of bogota
34:25
once hired 420 mime artists to make fun
34:28
of traffic violators
34:30
because he believed colombians fear
34:32
ridicule more than they fear punishment
34:36
what was he called he's called antanas
34:38
mockus i call him ant anus
34:40
marcus i bet you do yeah that's not his
34:42
name oh my god he's called moccus and he
34:44
hired people to make fun of other people
34:46
yeah
34:46
it's perfect isn't it you think next
34:48
he's going to get antagonises
34:51
it's not his name anyway this guy
34:54
antonus mockus is such an awesome guy
34:57
and so he was mad
34:58
a number of times and he changed bogota
35:00
in so many good ways so this policy
35:02
really worked
35:03
he fired all the traffic police because
35:05
they were known for being very corrupt
35:07
and taking lots of bribes
35:08
and he firstly replaced them with just
35:10
20 mime artists
35:12
and they would do things like they'd if
35:13
a pedestrian crossed the road at the
35:15
wrong time or
35:16
if someone's waiting in traffic and is
35:18
about to skip a red light the mayamatos
35:20
sort of chased them or go up to their
35:21
window and like make mocking gestures at
35:23
them
35:23
and they found that it really worked and
35:25
it reduced reckless driving and reckless
35:27
pedestrianing
35:28
and so he added 400 more but if you
35:30
hired
35:31
mimes to replace your traffic cops i
35:33
think of traffic cops as basically mine
35:35
yeah they are
35:35
they're just sort of doing the gesturing
35:37
like come on or no you stop over here
35:39
yeah when they're doing stop it's like
35:40
they're in a tiny invisible box
35:42
yeah exactly if you fail the
35:45
mime exams do you bump down and become a
35:48
traffic cop
35:49
that's how it goes the other thing about
35:52
that is
35:53
if you like mimes i don't think that
35:55
many people do like mines but if you
35:56
like them maybe you would deliberately
35:58
break the rules so that they came over
36:00
and you know when you're driving yeah
36:02
and there's like a electronic sign and
36:04
if you're going over
36:06
30 miles an hour it does a little sad
36:07
face yeah and i deliberately go at 31
36:10
miles an hour so that i get the sad face
36:12
it might be like that because you like
36:13
sad faces yeah yeah but it does a happy
36:15
face if you go under yeah who wants a
36:17
happy face
36:18
oh dear no wonder my text messages from
36:20
you are so positive
36:26
see you later anna frown
36:30
yeah he is an amazing character isn't he
36:31
he did
36:32
[Laughter]
36:34
he used to go around in uh the streets
36:37
wearing a superman outfit
36:39
uh claiming to be a character called
36:41
super citizen
36:43
he's just one of the it's just one of
36:44
those crazy cool guys he did i mean he
36:46
didn't just do that for no reason he did
36:48
that while cleaning up the streets yeah
36:49
he's cleaning up the streets of crime he
36:50
would like
36:51
well i think it was rubbish
36:54
that is a crime though dropping rubbish
36:57
but that's not what like batman means
36:59
when he says he's cleaning the streets
37:01
that's my mom's day job actually that's
37:03
how he made all those billions
37:05
just recycling like um old bottles
37:08
[Laughter]
37:10
new ones long as you can bring mugs back
37:12
when you've chunked your mulled wine you
37:13
get two pounds back
37:14
that's how he makes his money to the bat
37:16
bottle bin
37:16
[Laughter]
37:20
yeah so he did that he also did a really
37:22
cool thing which is he launched this
37:23
idea which was called a night for women
37:26
and the idea was that all the city's men
37:28
stayed at home in the evening caring for
37:30
the children
37:31
and the city's 700 000 women would go
37:34
out
37:34
um and tim and him dressed as
37:38
supermarket
37:41
wow yeah he's just an interesting
37:42
character isn't he and the idea of being
37:44
that women
37:44
felt uncomfortable sometimes because
37:47
some people thought some parts books are
37:48
dangerous at the time and they feel much
37:50
more comfortable if they go out and they
37:51
don't see any men around which
37:52
i can tell you guys i'm so glad you're
37:54
here to uh
37:55
actually qualify the things i've said
37:58
i've just
37:59
gone for the headline and it really
38:03
worked so
38:04
um he cut homicide rates by 70
38:07
and he cut traffic fatalities by 50 and
38:10
he was actually a mathematician so the
38:11
reason people part of the reason people
38:13
liked him was that he was a math
38:14
professor
38:15
who she was sort of fired from sort of
38:18
had to quit his job in 1993 because
38:20
he was giving a lecture and the students
38:22
in his lecture theatre weren't listening
38:23
very hard
38:24
and so he dropped his trials as a moon
38:26
them all and shortly afterwards resigned
38:28
from the post of mass professor at the
38:29
university
38:30
and instead became mayor but
38:33
he said when they asked him about that
38:35
he said innovative behavior can be
38:37
useful when you run out of words
38:39
there you go and that was his thing he
38:40
was saying no one's listening to me no
38:42
matter what i say so i'm going to show
38:43
them my ass
38:44
and maybe they'll listen and that's like
38:46
anna says that's how he became famous
38:48
and then once he became famous then he
38:49
started going into politics but hiring
38:51
the mime
38:52
sounds like um he's also run out of
38:54
words there
38:55
yeah he's hiring people who aren't using
38:56
words to solve another problem he's a
38:58
man of action
38:59
yeah he sounds amazing yeah he is
39:02
awesome he brought the
39:03
the amount of money that was earned for
39:05
the city uh
39:06
way up didn't he yeah taxation yeah
39:09
people could have a voluntary tax
39:10
that's right volunteered to pay 10 more
39:12
tax and thousands of people did
39:14
yeah so another thing he did is that he
39:16
asked people to call his office if they
39:17
came across
39:18
a uh very honest taxi driver
39:21
because he wanted to 150 people called
39:25
and he organized to meet them all and he
39:28
came up with a group name for them which
39:29
was the knights of the zebra
39:31
and the idea was that they were just
39:34
giving good impressions of
39:36
good taxi drivers who exist on the beat
39:37
and if you were good you might then
39:39
become a knight of the zebra
39:40
wow yeah that's quite good which is a
39:43
seriously cool title which you
39:44
definitely would try to be if i
39:46
was called a knight of the zebra i would
39:48
be better at my job than i am
39:49
um i was reading a bit about mimes for
39:51
this fact oh sure
39:53
um did you know that uh marcel marceau
39:57
but pretty much the only mine anyone can
39:58
ever name
40:00
um he once released an album
40:03
called the best of marcel marceau no he
40:05
didn't no as well
40:06
it's a well i'm getting to that dan oh
40:09
okay there was once an album release
40:10
called the best of marcel marceau which
40:12
was 19 minutes of silence and then one
40:14
minute of applause
40:15
and then the other side was exactly the
40:16
same that's very good but
40:18
it was produced as a joke by mgm
40:21
and his name was slightly misspelt on it
40:22
so we think it wasn't him but
40:25
he wants this is true could not perform
40:27
because the sound system failed
40:32
really yeah he was doing a sketch in a
40:35
show in america in 1980 and um
40:37
it was accompanied by music but then the
40:39
music didn't work so he said this isn't
40:40
going to work at all
40:41
so he just bowed and uh the curtains
40:43
closed all right
40:45
yeah um i just have one more creative
40:47
thing people are doing to stop traffic
40:48
violations
40:49
oh yeah um so in shenzhen in china
40:52
they have a problem with traffic
40:53
violations and they've tried all these
40:55
creative ways of
40:56
stopping them so one of the things is
40:59
that if you're caught jaywalking then
41:01
you're punished by being turned into a
41:02
traffic warden
41:03
and you have to you have to catch the
41:07
next jaywalker
41:08
and they make you wear this like that's
41:11
a brilliant idea it's good it's a great
41:13
game
41:13
and you have to wear a green hat because
41:15
apparently saying you're wearing a green
41:16
hat in china is offensive so you have to
41:17
wear this
41:19
exactly because it means cuckolded so
41:21
it's offensive so
41:22
would this be immediately on the spot
41:24
it's on the spot yeah you just have to
41:26
take over the job of the
41:27
current traffic warden yeah if you're in
41:29
a rush to get to work too bad you've got
41:31
to put on your fluorescent group they
41:32
get your job
41:36
um but another thing they're doing as
41:37
well as that is
41:39
they are stopping people from leaving
41:40
their lights on high beam by
41:42
when the police see someone with the
41:43
lights on high beam they pull the car
41:44
over
41:45
and they make the person get out of the
41:46
car and stand facing their own car with
41:48
their eyes straight into high beam
41:50
lights
41:50
and stare at the bright lights of their
41:52
car for five minutes
41:54
wouldn't that send you blind uh no it's
41:56
just a bit annoying no
41:58
i mean it would in the short term you
42:01
would have lights in front of your eyes
42:02
when you close your eyes but
42:03
you wouldn't go blind it would make you
42:05
an extremely dangerous driver as soon as
42:07
you set off again in your car
42:10
but it's like to punish you for drink
42:11
driving you've got it down this bottom
42:19
okay that's it that is all of our facts

hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qy offices
00:22

00:28
hunter murray
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four
00:32
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:35
and in no particular order
00:37
here we go starting with you
00:40
andy my fact is that it takes 10 years
00:43
to learn how to make
00:44
artificial sushi
00:45
[Laughter]
00:47
which to make it well to make it well
00:50
sorry any
00:51
any mug can just wait anyone could get
00:54
some plasticine and make some fake sushi
00:56
right you're absolutely
00:57
like toy sushi not toy sushi as in
01:00
so in japan there's this amazing
01:02
tradition where basically
01:04
all restaurants have their whole menu
01:06
reproduced
01:07
in plastic outside the restaurant to
01:10
lure you in
01:11
yeah see how good this looks like when
01:12
people there's a place around the corner
01:14
from us that um is a restaurant and they
01:16
cook
01:16
one meal every day and they put it on a
01:17
table outside and it's just a display oh
01:19
yeah so to display me i've always wanted
01:21
to take that
01:22
display meal because they put a whole
01:23
pizza outside yeah and you think
01:25
why doesn't someone just come along and
01:26
have this i don't get it i'm so close
01:28
how has someone not got that they must
01:30
be poisoned right and there's a glass of
01:32
wine
01:32
they must be that's a glass of white
01:34
wine just sitting there
01:35
we're gonna take it guys you know who
01:37
you are have any of you ever eaten in
01:39
that restaurant no
01:40
yes i have i have though that's great
01:42
it's kind of just
01:43
um society isn't it you just don't steal
01:45
things
01:46
yeah i'm not saying it's a bad thing
01:48
that people don't steal things in
01:49
general in general it's a trust exercise
01:51
yeah but it will go to waste won't it is
01:53
it it's like taking something out of a
01:54
bin
01:55
which and we all do that i guess so this
01:58
is kind of like
01:59
um the equivalent of high street shops
02:02
having mannequins in the window
02:03
completely displaying their clothes this
02:05
is just from all the clothes are fake
02:07
yes yes and there's an actual industry
02:10
devoted to making
02:11
fake clothes which no one will ever wear
02:13
yeah but you might make their clothes
02:15
out of say
02:16
toilet paper or something instead
02:18
because it's cheaper
02:19
and it shows them off yeah or is it not
02:21
cheaper it's not cheaper
02:22
but there was an economist article all
02:23
about this and then it turns out this is
02:25
a massive thing and i because i was in
02:26
japan about
02:27
five years ago and it is true it's
02:29
basically every restaurant has this
02:30
stuff outside it
02:32
and the thing is buying these things is
02:34
really
02:35
expensive as in the sale price is about
02:38
20 times the price of the
02:39
actual piece of sushi to buy a plastic
02:41
piece of sushi yeah but then
02:43
it lasts a lot longer is the good thing
02:44
and you're only buying one and you're
02:46
only buying one but lots of train
02:47
restaurants just hire them
02:48
so you can rent a burger for a month for
02:51
a thousand yen
02:52
and have it outside because getting a
02:53
whole menu done is cost thousands of
02:55
pounds yeah the equivalent of i was
02:57
reading that actually a lot of the
02:58
companies that make these things don't
03:00
do very well in business because
03:02
they are so long-lasting these things so
03:04
once you've sold it to someone then that
03:05
bit of sushi lasts 10 years and so they
03:07
keep going out of business and so
03:08
they're trying to sell them to china and
03:10
to europe now because
03:11
everyone's got them in japan they should
03:13
do what apple do and make them break
03:14
after two years
03:15
yes intentional obsolescence or whatever
03:18
they call it yes yeah
03:19
or like football kits they should make
03:20
new ones every year new kind of sushi
03:22
so you always have to have the most
03:24
trendy sushi outside your restaurant
03:25
that's what i was thinking i wonder if
03:27
there's a plastic
03:28
sushi chef who's innovating new meals
03:30
and releasing them and they're going go
03:32
we've got to replicate this
03:34
well they don't they don't really do
03:35
that because the way they make these
03:37
plastic
03:38
imitations is so precise so get this
03:41
they will send
03:42
a designer to the restaurant where the
03:44
food is made who will observe it
03:46
take lots of photos of the food he'll
03:47
make an architect sketch
03:49
and then he goes back to the factory and
03:50
he says we have to make it precisely
03:51
like this
03:52
and that every individual piece is made
03:55
with a mold
03:57
okay so he makes the mold first and then
03:59
he
04:00
no he visits the restaurant he sees the
04:02
food designs the mold builds the mold
04:04
and then
04:04
presses a single amazing piece nice
04:07
so the mold for making a bit of tuna is
04:09
actually made by pushing a bit of tuna
04:11
into the machine yeah they use the fish
04:13
to make the mold i believe so
04:14
wow no surely the fish would get
04:16
squashed yeah that's not going to retain
04:18
its shape this is what i reckon
04:19
i agree i agree i have had sushi once
04:22
and
04:24
one more time than you've had mcdonald's
04:26
right yes but no it's incredibly precise
04:29
and 80
04:29
of the industry is one set of factories
04:32
it's one company basically
04:33
okay and all the rest is little cottage
04:35
industries and workshops and artisans
04:37
around that so why does it take 10 years
04:38
to learn how to be a plastic sushi chef
04:41
it's
04:42
very precise and it's a very artistic
04:44
thing and to make it
04:45
really good you know to be a master
04:47
which is about as long as it takes to
04:48
become a master sushi chef
04:50
there are people out there who have both
04:52
spent 10 years of their life
04:53
i wonder if at a certain time at
04:55
culinary school you have to decide if
04:57
you're going to go into plastics or
04:58
real yeah there must be a towel do you
05:00
reckon it's the best ones who go into
05:01
plastics or the slightly rubbish ones so
05:03
you don't get very good grades
05:05
um the thing is they make these plastic
05:06
vegetables and then they do cut them
05:07
with real knives so it's like it's
05:09
this bizarre proper chefing mixed with
05:11
plastic chefing
05:12
and they've been doing it for ages
05:14
haven't they so i think it started in
05:16
about the 1920s and it was because they
05:18
didn't have menus
05:19
and so instead of a menu you'd have this
05:22
display
05:22
apparently that was easier i would have
05:24
thought drawing something on a menu is
05:25
easy yeah crazy that that came first so
05:27
yeah
05:28
they were getting new foods from the
05:29
west as well so
05:31
to explain what these are to your
05:33
customers
05:34
it's easier to have it on display
05:35
outside because you can see like on a
05:37
menu it could be any size
05:38
for example whereas if you've had it
05:40
molded
05:42
you can put something next to it for
05:44
perspective yeah
05:45
next to every meal you could put like a
05:47
little dog and then you would know how
05:49
big it was but that's the thing james
05:50
dog's very in size
05:51
famously all right i should have chosen
05:53
something more a plastic bit of sushi
05:55
just put that next to it and then that
05:56
will show you next to your
05:58
tuna sashimi how big your steak is i'm
06:00
suggesting putting
06:01
plastic sushi next to real sushi to give
06:03
an impression of this no next real
06:04
western
06:05
like burgers and stuff like that would
06:07
be a good idea yes
06:08
um have we ever said that some about
06:10
salmon sashimi
06:12
no the weird thing about it is that it's
06:13
just not at all japanese and that it was
06:15
brought to japan by norway
06:17
oh really um so people didn't eat salmon
06:20
sashimi in japan
06:21
until the 1980s and then norway had a
06:24
shed load of fish that it couldn't sell
06:25
and it had to offload
06:26
really wanted to sort out its fishing
06:28
industry and they had a meeting with the
06:29
japanese and thought well this is a
06:30
country that loves eating fish
06:32
and so they started offloading all their
06:33
fish and selling it to japan um
06:35
and trying to market it as sushi and
06:37
even then so it was in about 1985 that
06:39
they started eating salmon in japan
06:40
even then it took about 10 years before
06:42
they started eating it without cooking
06:44
it
06:44
wow what yeah do we know what brought
06:46
the uh
06:47
the country to sort of shift the
06:48
attitude uh norway just kept forcing it
06:50
down there
06:52
it's true i think they just had loads of
06:53
it to sell didn't they yeah and they
06:54
just needed a new market for it
06:56
yeah okay that is amazing it's 1995.
06:59
but i guess even if you're used to
07:01
eating raw tuna
07:03
it doesn't follow that you should eat
07:04
raw salmon because so some people eat
07:05
raw beef don't they in the you know
07:07
yeah the steak all chopped up but if you
07:09
were to give someone raw chicken
07:11
or raw or pork all chopped up all
07:14
chopped up
07:14
it's not a natural thing no you're right
07:16
yeah it's a mad idea actually i don't
07:17
know you crack a raw egg on top of that
07:19
i'd probably give it a try
07:20
raw chicken yeah okay yeah probably just
07:23
the ones but
07:26
um actually sushi isn't quite as old as
07:29
you might think modern sushi anyway
07:31
and the first kind of sushi was nare
07:33
sushi which is from the 3rd century bc
07:35
but that was basically just pickled fish
07:38
so you put
07:39
fish in a barrel with some rice and with
07:40
some vinegar and leave it there for like
07:42
a year and then when it came out it was
07:45
pickled and you know it was
07:46
edible um but actually they would also
07:49
scrape all the rice off
07:51
so unlike this kind of sushi that we eat
07:53
today they would deliberately get rid of
07:55
all the rice and only eat the fish part
07:56
that's amazing so did the rice help
07:59
pickle it
08:00
it helps the fermentation yeah because
08:02
if you ferment something you need a
08:04
carbohydrate to do that so we're sort of
08:06
eating the
08:07
packaging when we eat sushi and rice
08:10
did just get tired of scraping off the
08:12
rice and a couple of grains of rice
08:14
stayed on and then there are a few more
08:15
grains of rice and then eventually
08:16
there's a massive lump of rice i think
08:18
what happened was
08:19
the next one that came was han nare
08:21
sushi and
08:22
that was they didn't leave it in the
08:24
barrel for nearly as long i think they
08:26
probably got a bit bored of waiting for
08:28
their sushi
08:29
and so they would open the barrel a bit
08:30
earlier and then they would eat the fish
08:32
with the um
08:33
rice and my guess is and this is just a
08:36
guess maybe it was a bit more sour a bit
08:38
more pickly so
08:39
that kind of took the edge off a bit i
08:40
don't know okay i'm guessing as well
08:42
that they were always eating sashimi
08:44
with a bowl of rice next to them they
08:46
just hadn't combined the two as a single
08:48
meal and eventually someone dropped one
08:51
bit into the other and
08:52
magic happens yeah i think they would
08:54
have combined it as in they would have
08:55
dropped
08:56
uh sushi on top of their bowl of rice
08:58
and eaten the two together
09:00
like we do corn flakes into a bowl and
09:02
then put milk in it but you don't sell
09:05
milk and cornflakes together they should
09:07
yeah exactly why don't they
09:09
because it goes i go soggy oh my god
09:11
it's such a bad idea
09:13
it's don't do that and about faith
09:16
just a second or so quickest switcheroo
09:19
i've ever heard you'd be great on
09:20
dragon's den because
09:22
i'm in i mean i mean no
09:25
okay just while we're on milk and cereal
09:28
so i was reading and asking this is kind
09:29
of related it's about how food is
09:30
represented there's an amazing guardian
09:32
article about
09:32
the secrets of food photographers
09:34
because in the west we basically
09:36
do this we basically make artificial
09:38
food in order to make it look good yeah
09:40
but we're doing it with
09:41
real food in advertising you mean this
09:42
stuff yes exactly like that so
09:45
strawberries get covered in lipstick
09:48
this is all from individual
09:49
photographers it's not like these are
09:50
industry standards but everyone has
09:51
their own secret box of tricks
09:53
um mexican food is sometimes sprayed
09:54
with wd-40
09:56
um the milk is almost never real milk
09:59
when you see a bowl of milk and cereal
10:01
on a cereal packet
10:02
it can be hair cream it can be white
10:04
glue that's a big thing
10:06
and then you just shove the corn flakes
10:07
into the top of it yeah to make it look
10:09
delicious
10:09
that makes sense um sometimes if you
10:12
need steam
10:13
if you've got a pasta dish and steaming
10:15
in a bowl
10:16
one photographer puts incense in there
10:19
and lets it
10:20
smoke away and then just remove the
10:22
incense in post-production
10:23
and one photographer said she her method
10:26
was to microwave
10:27
wet tampons and then put them behind the
10:30
pasta
10:31
so they were steaming wow
10:34
is steam particularly on photogenic on
10:36
its own when it's naturally
10:37
yes yes it is there must be there's
10:39
something photogenic
10:41
well they i mean this is i mean it's
10:43
quite well known that they do use
10:44
different
10:45
things in adverts yeah i didn't know any
10:47
of those examples but i think that is
10:49
quite well known
10:49
john lloyd for people listening he's a
10:51
guy who created qi
10:53
um he used to do a lot of adverts and he
10:55
used to say that whenever he did a food
10:57
product like a cereal or something
10:59
that in between takes there was someone
11:01
who would come and sort of
11:02
move a rice krispie into a better spot
11:04
of the bowl and like you know
11:06
as if you were doing someone's makeup
11:07
between takes you remember when chyna
11:09
hosted the olympics and there was that
11:11
girl who sung
11:12
the solo but they put another more
11:14
attractive girl on the tv for it
11:17
like that but then it's more serious to
11:19
do that than to change a rice krispie i
11:21
think
11:21
i guess the rice krispie doesn't mind as
11:23
much no one is pretending that
11:26
this is a photo of a real bowl of rice
11:28
yeah they are
11:29
they are actually james i can't see any
11:31
difference except that rice krispies
11:34
they don't have feelings they don't have
11:35
feelings they don't have those faces in
11:37
those costumes
11:38
if you think they don't have feelings
11:40
yeah then the advertising hasn't worked
11:42
on you i don't think that's not what
11:43
they're trying to do because if i
11:45
thought that rice krispies had feelings
11:46
i probably wouldn't want to eat them
11:48
i wouldn't i think i would enjoy it more
11:49
as they screamed
11:53
um so on sushi um
11:56
sushi obviously depends on that seaweed
11:58
that wraps around it to be made
12:00
yeah and so do you know basically the
12:01
person who brought sushi to japan who
12:03
made it a viable commercial product in
12:05
japan
12:05
was it mr nori because that's what it's
12:07
called it wasn't mr
12:09
jack o'norri the irish um it wasn't that
12:13
though very good suggestion
12:14
um it was a woman actually who was from
12:17
lancashire
12:18
it was a woman called kathleen mary drew
12:20
baker
12:21
and she was studying the welsh
12:24
equivalent of nori which is the japanese
12:26
seaweed that wraps around sushi
12:27
and in 1949 she discovered that this
12:31
tiny algae was actually the lava
12:33
of nori and before that no one in japan
12:35
had known how to farm it commercially
12:36
because they hadn't been able to work
12:37
out
12:38
how to get it to propagate successfully
12:40
so in japan they loved it they loved
12:41
sushi but they couldn't sell it ever
12:43
because
12:43
they would eat little bits of it but
12:44
they couldn't farm it and this woman
12:46
just figured out this random thing i
12:47
think she was studying at manchester at
12:49
the time
12:50
about welsh seaweed and they picked up
12:52
on it and suddenly it revolutionized
12:53
sushi and it meant they had a sushi
12:55
industry and they now celebrate her
12:57
so she's this woman who no one in this
12:58
country has heard of and who never
13:00
visited japan
13:01
um is celebrated there she's known as
13:03
mother of the sea
13:04
um there's a festival held in her honor
13:06
every year in osaka
13:07
on april the 14th and people go and they
13:09
pray to her and they give offerings and
13:11
they sing these special songs that this
13:13
thing called the drew monument which is
13:14
a
13:15
monument to her sounds like it should be
13:16
a monument to you drew no
13:18
well that's not my name my name is
13:20
lightning so i don't know why everyone's
13:21
here
13:22
um japanese restaurants still don't hire
13:24
women sushi restaurants
13:26
i think most of them don't hire this is
13:27
in we're talking in japan
13:29
in japan at one time when i went to
13:32
that one time because the woman was
13:35
behind the counter
13:36
they did why not why don't they hire
13:37
women do you mean the chefs as the chefs
13:40
yes sorry so i think there's a
13:41
superstition in japan
13:42
that women's body temperature's too high
13:44
or there was a really good
13:48
[Laughter]
13:53
good luck running your raw chicken
13:54
restaurant dinner because
13:56
that chicken is gonna be fried
14:04
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:06
that is
14:07
anna my fact is that when mount vesuvius
14:10
erupted
14:11
it created mini volcanoes in some
14:14
people's
14:14
heads and look this is okay
14:18
so first of all it's not when you say in
14:20
their heads
14:21
you don't mean they're thinking about it
14:22
and it didn't really happen
14:24
no no it was very much real this is i'm
14:26
talking about the famous eruption
14:28
um in oh god 49 79. thank you that's
14:31
good that i wrote
14:32
1979. yeah yeah it was glossed over by
14:36
thatcher's election
14:39
so this is the eruption of vesuvius in
14:41
79.80
14:42
and um it's the fact that i read about
14:45
this in a review of a book called
14:46
caesar's last breath which has just come
14:48
out by someone called sam keane
14:50
and it's about the history and the
14:52
science of air
14:53
yes sorry we i think we all pause
14:55
because i think that's a familiar name
14:57
yeah he's
14:57
written a book that we've got the
14:59
disappearing spoon that's it yeah yeah
15:00
really good
15:01
chemistry yeah he's a great author yeah
15:03
well this sounds incredible
15:04
and i've ordered it and so he was wrote
15:08
about this and he said that when
15:09
vesuvius erupted
15:11
the heat made a hole in people's in some
15:13
people's skulls
15:14
and then because of the pressure and the
15:17
heat the
15:18
water in people's brains started to boil
15:20
and then all the like chemicals and
15:21
substances in their brain started to
15:22
boil and they turn into a gas
15:23
and then they were ejected out of the
15:25
little holes in their skulls so they had
15:27
these holes in their skulls that were
15:28
ejecting steam
15:29
and other chemicals and it's really
15:31
gruesome but it was 2000 years ago guys
15:32
so i think we can laugh
15:33
it's amazing it's really grim it's
15:36
really great i know but it's
15:37
extraordinary right because
15:38
like what did it do with the the heat
15:40
burnt
15:41
through the air just through the skull
15:44
yeah boiled
15:45
and created a mini volcano erupting out
15:48
of the people who were being killed by
15:49
the volcano
15:50
that's insane it sounds like um you know
15:53
in a cartoon when someone gets really
15:54
mad
15:55
yes yes yeah and smoke comes out of
15:57
their
15:58
ears usually but if they got really mad
16:00
maybe it would just burst out
16:01
it sounds like someone's microwaved a
16:04
tampon and put it in their ears
16:08
but yeah that's i've never heard
16:09
anything remotely like that happening
16:11
it's weird and i just love the fact that
16:12
he's obviously made that so it's all sam
16:14
keane saying
16:15
it created many volcanoes it's not a
16:17
real volcano because it's not magma
16:19
it's not magma no and they're not large
16:21
geological formations
16:24
but it didn't make people's heads steam
16:25
yeah it made them explode didn't they
16:27
let's be honest
16:28
okay but sorry because there are lots of
16:30
different stages aren't there of the
16:31
explosion so there was
16:33
you know part of it people were being
16:34
buried in ash and then part of it is
16:36
this when the
16:36
pyroclastic flow hit this would be when
16:39
it was at its hottest so yes
16:41
i think it's a combination of that
16:42
sudden heat and sudden pressure okay
16:44
difference
16:45
yeah yeah crazy and so this year
16:47
interestingly
16:48
um scientists have pieced together bits
16:51
of a skull that was blown up
16:53
in this way and they've got all the bits
16:55
together and they've put it
16:57
um through a computer system and they've
16:58
managed to get a picture of the guy
17:00
what he would have looked like and he
17:02
just looks like a mediterranean
17:04
person who lived around that time but
17:05
it's amazing that they can get all the
17:07
bits of skull that have exploded as a
17:09
volcano in someone's head yeah and then
17:11
see what they look like that's
17:12
incredible because presumably with the
17:14
with the explosion it would have gone
17:15
off into various places so you'd have to
17:18
be
17:18
like um mismatching yeah jigsawing uh
17:22
it's like funny bones that children's
17:23
book it's like the adult version of that
17:24
children's book yeah
17:26
oh yeah do you know how they defended
17:28
themselves in the initial stages
17:30
what do you mean in the initial stages
17:32
of the eruption oh yeah
17:33
um so we're talking about are we talking
17:35
about rocks falling from the sky or what
17:37
are we talking about
17:38
yeah there have been earthquakes for a
17:39
few days and then there was a huge
17:42
uh explosion in the mountain the
17:43
mushroom club went up something like 20
17:45
000 meters
17:46
so there were little stones rattling
17:48
around onto the ground
17:49
and people would people tied pillows
17:51
onto their heads and walked around like
17:52
that
17:53
way yeah that was how they defended
17:55
themselves
17:56
do you know what that big mushroom cloud
17:58
those big plumes
17:59
are called uh volcanologists what
18:02
uh they are called plinians oh really
18:06
after honey
18:06
yeah which pliny though uh the elder no
18:10
so the elder famously died when he was
18:12
so curious he
18:14
got into a boat the younger yeah there
18:16
was only one other
18:17
the older older um clinty the younger so
18:20
he described the eruption when he was
18:22
watching it as well so it wasn't even
18:23
just pliny the elder who
18:25
who was trying to describe it plenty of
18:27
the young girl was back on land going
18:29
i'm going to describe this as well he
18:30
saw
18:30
the giant plumes of uh smoke that were
18:32
erupting around it
18:33
he called them umbrella pines and
18:37
that's been lost but as a tribute to him
18:39
naming it it's been plinian
18:40
no way that's amazing isn't it amazing
18:42
that 2000 years later he's still plenty
18:44
the younger
18:45
but he's not graduated but younger it
18:48
doesn't matter how old you are you're
18:49
still
18:49
younger doesn't mean you're young just
18:51
because you're younger that's true but
18:53
it's like kid rock isn't it
18:56
he's knocking on a bit now he should
18:57
change his name to dad rock now
18:58
shouldn't he
18:59
[Laughter]
19:02
do do you know what the um clouds are
19:04
called that form
19:06
the clouds of kind of pollution that
19:07
form around volcanoes so
19:09
obviously a lot of sulfur dioxide and
19:10
lots of other gases come out of it and
19:11
they react with the moisture in the air
19:13
and with the oxygen and the debris
19:15
and they form this if it's daylight they
19:17
form this big cloud that you can't
19:18
really see through
19:19
and it's called a vog vlog a vlog
19:24
well as wikipedia says it's a
19:26
portmanteau of volcano fog
19:28
and smog so i don't know which one the
19:30
overcast
19:31
the o it's the open fog okay so the g
19:34
is from smog yeah they call it that in
19:37
hawaii i think
19:38
oh okay yeah as in they'll they'll say
19:40
oh there's a lot of bug out there
19:42
because it happens
19:43
relatively regularly really yeah i think
19:45
so it's a bit of a foggy day have you
19:47
got your fog lights on
19:48
[Laughter]
19:50
they think that um pompeii had a one-way
19:53
traffic system
19:54
oh really yeah based on the wheel ruts
19:57
and
19:57
the arrangement i just think it's
19:59
amazing that you can know
20:00
that there was a one-way traffic system
20:02
2000 years ago yeah
20:04
so i've been to pompeii um i went
20:07
last year have you been to pompeii james
20:09
you've okay i went to a sushi restaurant
20:11
once
20:14
if you've not been to pompeii and you're
20:16
listening to this podcast right now um
20:18
definitely go it is genuinely the most
20:21
exciting archaeological thing i've ever
20:22
seen in my life
20:23
it feels like time travel because
20:25
everything is still there including the
20:27
people which is
20:28
mad you just walk around and there's
20:29
this body of a person who
20:31
was there on the day that it happened
20:33
that's you don't see that anywhere else
20:35
so it's pretty amazing the day that we
20:36
went i went with my wife vanella
20:38
and um she was really ill so she took a
20:41
lot of lem sip and she had a lot of
20:42
coffee and it was boiling hot
20:44
and she started hallucinating here's
20:46
another tip if you want to hallucinate
20:47
you want you can't afford lsd
20:49
lem sipping coffee and heat that's what
20:51
you need to do and it was crazy because
20:52
there was all these dead bodies around
20:54
obviously
20:54
and so she was going nuts over it you
20:56
don't see the actual body so do you you
20:58
do yeah they're in
20:59
they're in the pottery section that's
21:01
the casts of the bodies i think
21:03
yeah so what's happened is the but the
21:05
people get buried
21:06
okay and then they rot away and then
21:09
there's a hole where the body used to be
21:11
and then the way that they get them is
21:13
they pour kind of concrete or something
21:14
into it and then they pull it out as a
21:16
cast of a person
21:17
oh i thought that that was them you
21:19
should have really read some of the
21:20
information for that while you're
21:21
involved
21:22
i tell you weren't you i tell you what i
21:25
did read an information plaque i was
21:27
stuck on it for ages and then i realized
21:29
pompe doesn't have information plaques
21:30
and what i was reading was three
21:32
different translations for how to use
21:33
the recycling bin
21:34
[Laughter]
21:37
um so there are really few um household
21:41
objects left behind
21:42
and it's partly because people had 18
21:43
hours between eruption and the arrival
21:46
of the huge hot cloud
21:47
so most people had left uh and taking
21:50
whatever they could carry with them yeah
21:51
but
21:52
also the reason there's nothing there is
21:53
that people returned as soon as it was
21:55
all over
21:56
dug down you know into the ruins and
21:59
nicked what they could
22:00
right and some of them fell in and died
22:03
so some of the bodies are those of
22:04
looters whose tunnels collapsed
22:06
wow there's a german prince who made a
22:11
replica of vesuvius
22:13
in so this is in the 18th century it was
22:16
in 1794 and there was this guy called
22:18
prince leopold the third
22:19
friedrich franz and he sounds german
22:22
it is the most german name you could
22:24
have um
22:26
and prince leopold went traveling around
22:27
around europe and
22:29
he visited vesuvius and thought well
22:31
that's very impressive this map this
22:32
volcano they've got
22:33
um i'm gonna build one when i get back
22:35
home and he got back home and he built
22:38
something that he called the stone
22:39
island of
22:40
verlitz in the countryside near berlin
22:42
and it was a five-story high
22:44
kind of brick and stone building that he
22:46
covered in all these boulders so it
22:48
looked like a volcano
22:49
and then he built a cone at the peak of
22:52
it
22:52
and he put three fireplaces inside this
22:55
like hollowed-out comb
22:57
and then he made this uh crater and he
22:59
filled it with water
23:00
and he erected some red lamps and then
23:04
when he set the fires and tipped out the
23:05
water the red lamps illuminated the
23:07
water so it looked like lava running
23:09
down his fake mountain
23:10
and him and his mates used to get
23:11
together with some booze of an evening
23:14
and then they used to light the fires
23:15
and set off the volcano and watch
23:16
vesuvius erupt
23:17
that's quite cool i got one last thing
23:19
which is from pompeii
23:21
it's uh just to give a bit of insight
23:22
into the type of people that live there
23:24
because it's hard to
23:25
kind of picture their day-to-day
23:27
activities they discovered in the ruins
23:30
uh graffiti that's just remained on
23:31
walls of various places so
23:33
they've translated a bunch of them that
23:35
they could uh still manage to make out
23:36
the full sentences of
23:38
uh one reads if you're gonna fight get
23:40
out and that's written on the side of a
23:41
tavern wall
23:42
that they had another reads i don't care
23:44
about your pregnancy
23:46
silvilla i despise it that's a private
23:48
message
23:49
um i don't know how because it would
23:50
have been on that pm
23:52
[Laughter]
23:55
um wall i am amazed you haven't fallen
23:58
into ruins since you bear the tedious
23:59
scribblings of so many writers
24:01
and that was found at four different
24:03
walls there
24:04
that's funny that's like you get um
24:06
where people write on toilet walls isn't
24:08
it they write stuff like that well
24:09
the final one is a bit of a toilet wall
24:11
it's um
24:15
you suck well and that was found at a
24:17
brothel
24:19
well good you kept yourself busy while
24:21
you were there dan you can't believe
24:22
vanilla let you have a pen
24:23
[Laughter]
24:31
okay it is time for fact number three
24:33
and that
24:34
is james okay my fact this week
24:37
is that the first bendy straws were used
24:40
by people
24:41
in hospital and why
24:44
well i mean there's more convenient way
24:47
to drink a drink i guess but why just
24:49
you've just answered your own question
24:51
it's that isn't it
24:52
it is so i just kind of like this
24:54
because i associate
24:55
bendy straws more with fun times right
24:58
and parties and stuff um but the guy who
25:00
invented them
25:01
um the first place that he managed to
25:02
sell them was to a hospital
25:05
and like you say it's so that people who
25:07
are kind of lying down or
25:08
not quite vertical can drink more easily
25:11
because before that they would always
25:12
drink out of glass straws
25:14
glass oh wow yeah that and that it comes
25:17
with a risk
25:19
yeah but you're in a hospital so that's
25:21
true you can't think of a better place
25:23
he's a straw it doesn't matter it only
25:25
comes with a risk to the extent that
25:27
drinking out of a glass
25:28
glass comes with a wrist i think that
25:30
also comes with a resin
25:32
you ever drink out of beakers don't you
25:33
yeah i have tiffy cups
25:36
i don't know what typically is that one
25:38
of those things that a kid has with two
25:39
handles on either side and they kind of
25:41
yeah it's got two handles and it's got a
25:43
little spout and also it's amazing
25:44
because you can tilt it upside down and
25:46
none of it falls out even through the
25:47
little spout
25:48
it's like suckling on a breast that's
25:50
why my kitchen cabinets follow him james
25:54
um so i've been reading about the the
25:56
plastic straw
25:58
yes apocalypse so that's kind of why i
26:00
wanted to talk about straws because we
26:01
should all stop
26:02
bloody using them right and our
26:04
grandchildren won't have heard of them
26:06
what happened what's happened they made
26:07
a plastic mate so is
26:10
sushi but but
26:13
plastic can damage the environment and
26:15
the thing with straws is usually if
26:17
you're in a bar or whatever you get a
26:19
straw you kind of throw it away it's
26:20
mixed in with all the
26:21
detritus and glass and whatever and it's
26:24
really hard to kind of try and take it
26:25
out so you can recycle it
26:27
so no one recycles it okay so the
26:29
problem is they're not being recycled
26:31
and what do you do you have it for like
26:33
what 30 seconds
26:34
how long does it take to drink a gin and
26:36
tonic but you have it only for
26:39
like 10 minutes or whatever yeah when i
26:41
straw pedo them
26:42
um so 80 of the time it takes about a
26:45
second
26:45
yeah and sometimes they give you two
26:47
straws yeah yeah completely pointless
26:49
yeah do you want a stat dan
26:51
uh yeah i know can i just also just
26:52
quickly say i do know that plastic is
26:54
bad for the planet
26:55
that was more i was trying to work out
26:56
white and that makes sense because we do
26:58
i always throw straws just into
27:00
anywhere pigeons
27:04
you're always buying packets of straws
27:05
and chucking them about yeah
27:07
um stats please andy americans use 500
27:10
million straws a day
27:13
wow they're only about 300 million
27:14
americans so some people are having a
27:15
couple of
27:16
them on each there's more than one each
27:18
and the total number used today
27:20
so there was an article about this which
27:21
gave an amazing you know
27:23
comparison it would fill 125 yellow
27:26
american school buses each day wow full
27:29
of straws that's more than a mile long
27:31
queue of american yellow school buses
27:34
and they're all there's no children in
27:35
them
27:36
they're all full of straws just straws
27:37
and then each day
27:39
it's a complete waste of buses that's
27:41
it's always
27:42
all the effort you have to go through to
27:43
make the buses to keep the straws
27:44
exactly how are those kids getting to
27:46
school yeah exactly
27:48
we can't carry on like this i mean the
27:49
thing is if we recycle them maybe it
27:52
wouldn't be so bad but no one ever does
27:53
and they're just completely pointless
27:55
although i said this to you the other
27:56
day anna and you said you quite like a
27:58
straw with a gin
27:59
i need straws and i always ask for them
28:00
if they don't give them to me and my gin
28:01
and tonic otherwise the ice gets in the
28:03
way of the liquid and so i push it too
28:05
hard towards my mouth and the
28:06
liquid goes all down my front so i do
28:08
actually need straws but i'm not averse
28:10
to like
28:10
glass or messy or something would you be
28:12
happy to have your own personal straw
28:14
which you carry around with you i'd love
28:15
that i could get my initial
28:16
engraved on it or something yeah i think
28:18
that's a good idea i think we'll all
28:19
have our own personal struggles in the
28:20
future i think that's a
28:21
really good call yeah you could kind of
28:23
have it hanging off your belt
28:25
like people used to have with a knife
28:26
yeah no one used to have the knife
28:28
drawer
28:28
you just have a knife which you hung by
28:30
your side and you'd what for dinner or
28:32
like crop dundee style for dinner
28:33
right you know the one that you're
28:34
carrying around would it be metal or
28:36
would it be made of plastic
28:38
it'll be a metal one yeah otherwise you
28:39
can't really engrave in plastic
28:42
and then you can use it for an emergency
28:44
tracheotomy
28:46
because everyone will always have one
28:48
yeah yeah yeah
28:49
perfect um so in other plastic news
28:52
plastic recycling news
28:54
so the bad thing about a lot of plastics
28:55
is they end up in the ocean right we
28:56
should say and they choke various
28:58
animals i think you were saying that
29:00
straws specifically go up turtles and
29:01
noses
29:02
well when dan's around they do yeah you
29:04
can't find any pigeons
29:06
um it was that does happen and a couple
29:09
of years ago there was a video of one
29:11
being extricated from a turtle's nose
29:13
and that was kind of
29:14
the impetus that started this whole kind
29:16
of we need to stop
29:17
having straws yeah if you're in a bar by
29:20
the way
29:21
not if you're in a bar but if you run a
29:22
bar get rid of your straws yeah
29:24
if you're listening to this podcast in a
29:26
bar a
29:27
talk to someone but more importantly
29:30
throw away your straw yeah
29:32
um actually all bar one are banning them
29:34
aren't they yes good for them
29:35
yeah so i think you won't be able to get
29:37
plastic straws in all bar one very
29:38
shortly because of this
29:40
very reason so and are they going to
29:41
have no replacement
29:43
yeah people are just expected to drink
29:45
stuff straight from the glass which i
29:46
agree is a travesty
29:47
yeah what are your feelings on crazy
29:50
straws
29:51
uh oh are they the funny windy ones you
29:53
get for birthday presents yeah
29:54
yeah love that yeah well because you
29:58
don't usually throw those away you those
29:59
are keepers no you'd be mad to throw
30:01
yeah
30:01
they're solid they're hard plastic i was
30:03
reading about crazy stores on
30:05
line um because they they believe deeply
30:07
that it's more than just a straw that
30:09
it's a philosophy
30:10
what um yeah i was read an interview by
30:12
the guy who invented the
30:14
uh crazy straw glasses you know the one
30:16
where you oh yeah yeah
30:18
yeah classic uh he said that
30:21
we say it's a metaphor for life take
30:23
extra time to go on a winding country
30:25
road as opposed to the highway
30:27
that's how he sees the crazy straw
30:29
industry
30:30
it's not only are you buying something
30:33
more long-term but you are experiencing
30:35
the drink in a more philosophical
30:37
fashion
30:38
it's taking the scenic route yeah it's
30:40
the buddha of straws
30:41
it reminds me a bit of you know that
30:43
magazine that you get on the delayed
30:44
gratification
30:45
yes um which you get the news like three
30:48
months later yeah
30:48
it's a bit like that because you're
30:50
drinking your coca-cola or whatever yeah
30:52
and there's a few seconds when it's not
30:54
quite got to your mouth yet
30:55
yeah that's true that you can kind of
30:57
imagine what you're going to
30:58
taste yes it's that uh we did we did it
31:01
as a quote on qi
31:02
in the very early episodes stephen fry
31:04
quotes from james bond
31:06
saying the best martini of the day was
31:08
the one just before the first one
31:10
it's the anticipation yeah yeah it's the
31:13
taste just for
31:13
by the way mentioning delayed
31:15
gratification andy got his latest copy
31:17
the other day can you quickly
31:18
mention this yeah yeah yeah it came with
31:20
a letter saying we're really sorry this
31:22
you probably have noticed this issue of
31:23
like qualification has got you a bit
31:25
late
31:27
none of the news is from before i think
31:29
march
31:32
you think the letter would be
31:33
apologizing if it came early
31:38
um so do you know dan
31:41
how probably not what's the longest
31:44
length of straw that you could drink out
31:46
of if i put
31:48
say a can of beer on the floor yeah and
31:51
i gave you
31:51
as long as straw as you wanted but you
31:53
had to suck from the top of it
31:55
what is the tallest it could be i'm
31:57
gonna say two floors
32:00
that's a lot two floors so how many
32:02
meters are you saying
32:03
um so that door is two meters
32:06
oh okay um i'll say
32:10
16 meters uh the floors i'm talking
32:12
about have very high ceilings
32:14
oh yeah because you live in versailles
32:16
don't you yeah
32:21
um any guys do you think it's less or
32:23
more than 16 meters
32:24
or maybe there's an infinite amount
32:25
maybe i think it's going to be less than
32:27
that so i guess you need to have enough
32:29
to be making a vacuum in the straw that
32:31
the water fills up to fill so it's just
32:33
how long
32:33
can i breathe in i think i can breathe
32:36
in long enough to suck in
32:37
three meters worth of air towards me oh
32:39
no
32:40
yeah but the difference is with a straw
32:42
you can you can pause you can take
32:44
breaks
32:45
as in if i was sucking on a straw i
32:47
could put my thumb over the straw and it
32:49
will hang there
32:49
that's not gonna lose it i can then pre
32:51
and then re-suck yeah but once you've
32:53
got all the air out of the
32:55
straw surely there's no you can't remove
32:58
more if there's a complete vacuum in the
33:00
straw right
33:01
andy is well on the root here okay if
33:03
you had a perfect vacuum
33:05
sucking up that's the best sucking you
33:07
can do you can't do any better than that
33:08
okay
33:08
and to get if you're on earth so
33:12
you have to pull it up against the
33:14
atmospheric pressure
33:15
the highest is about 10 meters if you
33:18
had a vacuum
33:19
a perfect one so obviously humans
33:20
couldn't do any more than that 10 meters
33:22
is cool that's still
33:23
high enough that i could be on the
33:24
second floor of a building and get
33:25
someone to deliver a drink to my door
33:27
and pour my strawberries out if you live
33:29
of course
33:31
but the interest the reason that that's
33:33
kind of interesting or kind of important
33:35
is because if you're trying to
33:36
if you've got mine and you want to suck
33:38
the water out of the mine so people can
33:40
go down and dig for rocks or whatever
33:42
you can only suck it up to 10 meters so
33:44
anything lower than that you need to do
33:46
some pushing as well as sucking
33:47
which means you need an engine which is
33:49
why in the industrial revolution you had
33:52
all these people who were inventing
33:53
engines like what and newcomen and
33:54
people like that because they needed to
33:56
get this stuff up there without wow so
33:59
no matter how wide the straw
34:00
doesn't matter 10 meters is the limit
34:02
yeah that is really wow
34:04
yeah so you think here's the next
34:07
question that you were just about to ask
34:08
dan yeah
34:09
how do trees suck up water from the
34:11
roots to the top
34:12
i was just thinking about i was saying
34:14
asylum in a plant must work like this
34:17
oh can we work it out is it possible to
34:19
be working um
34:20
no well it's in this kind of thing it's
34:22
always the same answer
34:23
the butler did it it's capillary action
34:27
oh okay so if you get a really really
34:30
really really
34:31
thin um straw kind of thing then there's
34:34
another force that kind of sucks it up
34:36
there
34:36
and there's also the cohesion of water
34:38
which means water molecules kind of pull
34:40
on each other because they have surface
34:42
tension oh yes because they're hydro
34:44
that's amazing so if the straw is thin
34:45
enough it can be longer than 10 meters
34:48
is what we're saying if it's super super
34:49
thin so like one of those tiny ones that
34:51
you do get in a bar
34:52
it's already hard to suck liquid out of
34:54
those tiny ones
34:55
which is why they give you two yes i
34:57
always thought they were just for show
34:59
like office staring
35:00
which is why i think they should get
35:02
bloody rid of them
35:03
i'm very excited that we might launch an
35:05
anti-straw revolution
35:06
yeah big straw is going to come after us
35:09
but the big straw can't be more than 10
35:11
meters
35:12
all we need to do is go on to the third
35:13
floor of a building
35:21
okay it is time for our final fact of
35:23
the show and that is my fact
35:25
my fact this week is that bomb detectors
35:27
in america
35:28
work 16 times better when they are
35:31
fitted with a fake
35:32
dog nose on the end this is such a silly
35:36
fact
35:36
but it's real i know it's astonishing
35:39
it's amazing
35:39
yeah so they basically tested this out
35:42
in america they 3d printed
35:44
out the nostril of a dog
35:47
and they stuck it onto the end of a bomb
35:49
detector and they use the methods by
35:51
which
35:51
bomb detecting dogs use when they're
35:54
sniffing for bombs
35:55
so a usual uh bomb detector will sort of
35:57
take in
35:58
a bunch of air and it will analyze it
36:00
dogs do quick sniffs
36:02
so they did that with this fake nose as
36:03
well they did these quick sniffs
36:05
and as a result they found that it
36:07
produced results that were 16 times
36:09
better
36:10
by having the weird nasal uh structure
36:13
of a dog on the end of their bomb
36:14
detectors
36:15
um yeah because dogs i didn't quite
36:17
realize this about how dogs
36:18
sniff and how they take in air that they
36:21
exhale in a completely different place
36:23
to where they inhale don't they so
36:25
what what so they could probably play
36:27
really long
36:28
notes on a trumpet i mean they could do
36:30
that
36:32
yeah they'd be amazing at didgeridoos um
36:34
the way dogs breathe is that they
36:36
um inhale through their nostrils on the
36:38
front of their nose but if you look at
36:40
any dog's nose you would have seen if
36:41
you've got a dog they've got these slits
36:43
down the side of their nose um and
36:45
that's where they exhale
36:46
so if you looked at a picture of a dog
36:47
now what they've got like
36:50
i'm actually just gonna show you no way
36:52
just super quickly
36:53
you would have seen it on every day i've
36:54
never seen a dog oh dogs have different
36:56
noises though like
36:57
they've all got this same though like a
36:59
pug has a different nose to a
37:01
side view they've all got dog noses
37:03
though haven't they
37:04
do they none of them have like a human
37:07
nose i'm going to look for a
37:09
variety of dog noses okay okay right so
37:12
here you go
37:13
yeah yeah look look at that all dog oh
37:15
wow
37:16
and then that slit there yes yeah okay
37:19
anna is not lying
37:20
we can confirm i'm not lying all dogs
37:22
noises have this slit and they've got
37:23
this thing called an ayla
37:24
fold or an alar fold in their nose and
37:27
they inhale air and then they pull the
37:28
fold down
37:29
so the air can't come back out the way
37:31
it went in right and they exhale it out
37:32
of the slit and that makes their sense
37:34
of smell much better because
37:35
it kind of stops the air from being
37:37
exhaled down the same channel that
37:38
they're trying to breathe in more sense
37:39
so it stops it all getting mixed up
37:41
together
37:41
and it means they can smell all the
37:43
incoming air more intensely in a more
37:44
concentrated way that explains why this
37:46
bomb detector kind of stuff works right
37:48
because it means that they're just
37:50
passing loads and loads of air over it
37:51
rather than bringing the same stuff in
37:53
and blowing it out
37:54
exactly never that is the most
37:55
surprising thing i've learned today
37:57
i know i was really surprised i didn't
37:58
ever think about that or even noticed
38:00
that
38:00
a secret slit that we've not noticed
38:02
yeah secrets
38:05
i was reading in australia they have
38:07
dogs that sniff out koalas
38:09
um so there's like for example there's
38:12
one dog who in 2014 i think it was
38:14
called maya
38:15
uh was trained specifically to cover a
38:17
480 hectare bit of land in order to map
38:20
out where all the koalas were
38:21
however she was not trained to smell out
38:24
koalas themselves she was trained to
38:26
smell out their feces
38:28
so she would not disrupt the koalas and
38:31
get into i guess any fights or scare
38:32
them or whatever
38:33
she was just looking for the poo so her
38:35
nostrils were trained specifically just
38:37
for the
38:38
feces as opposed to the koala this year
38:40
there's another dog in australia that's
38:42
been put into the same
38:43
kind of role and he is a dog called bear
38:47
and so bear is also sniffing out koalas
38:49
but i was a dog
38:50
bear yeah i know um that's confusing one
38:53
that's looking for bears as well oh yeah
38:55
and he's looking for that yeah it's very
38:56
confusing
38:57
yeah so i've got a dog called panda do
38:59
you object to that i do
39:00
yeah okay
39:01
[Laughter]
39:04
i mean you're sat right here so it's
39:05
hard to say it to your face but it's a
39:06
stupid name
39:09
wait he went for it no she didn't even
39:11
feel like you found it that hard
39:14
yeah but you can't just say that all
39:16
dogs should be called dog
39:19
because i don't think i was saying that
39:21
but the way of inventing
39:23
that's why we have names is to
39:24
differentiate things james isn't saying
39:26
we call it a dog's dog
39:28
i think there's a bit of a straw man
39:30
argument going on here
39:33
i'm just saying that you should give it
39:34
a name which is not another animal
39:37
but what do you object to then be given
39:38
human names like fred because i do
39:40
object to that i think it's lying about
39:42
the fact that this is this is a dog
39:44
it's not it's not lying i think it is a
39:47
lie
39:47
first of all first of all the secret
39:49
slit and now it sounds like you're not
39:51
even a human
39:53
i think there should be an approved list
39:54
of dog names called
39:56
rover and fido and that's more or less
39:59
it yeah
40:00
yeah that's yeah i think you should be
40:01
able to pick from a list of ten dog
40:03
names
40:03
yeah so you've got them all worked out
40:05
you don't need that many do you no
40:07
so humans need lots of names because you
40:08
go into lots of different social
40:10
situations where you need to know
40:11
someone's name
40:12
yeah most dogs are with their owner the
40:14
whole time i know but if you're in a
40:15
park and you go
40:16
rover and the entire parks were the dogs
40:19
it would only be a maximum of one in ten
40:21
of the dogs in the park
40:24
that's not how probability works it
40:26
wouldn't be a maximum of one thing
40:29
right it'll be a maximum of all of them
40:32
obviously but
40:33
the odds of it being all of them very
40:34
slim there is a chance of it being none
40:37
of them of course
40:38
but that relies on your dog having left
40:40
the park and there being no other dogs
40:41
with a particle rover
40:44
which is also a possibility
40:45
[Laughter]
40:48
so anyway what the hell are we talking
40:51
about
40:52
bear has this ability right so check out
40:55
the slits on there
40:56
he can sniff out not only
40:59
um a koala so he's been trained not to
41:02
sniff out the
41:03
feces he's been trained to sniff out the
41:06
uh hair
41:06
of a koala bear but the malted hair of a
41:09
koala bear
41:10
and fresh malted hair so he's
41:12
specifically going for
41:13
hair that is not attached to a koala
41:16
just so he's still
41:17
is that amazing i'm not i didn't know
41:20
that hair smelled different when it
41:21
wasn't attached to you than when it was
41:22
attached to you
41:23
what this might be is uh another thing
41:25
that dogs are really good at doing is
41:26
separating smells so they've got like a
41:28
smell filing system
41:29
um in their noses so what they might be
41:31
doing is smelling that there's hair but
41:33
without the smell
41:34
of the like flesh of a koala oh yes yeah
41:37
yeah
41:37
because they've got this mucus in their
41:39
nose um and the reason that
41:40
their noses are wet what it helps them
41:42
do is like file away the smells into
41:45
different parts of their nose
41:46
so certain molecules travel through the
41:48
mucus faster than others so it knows
41:49
that the first molecule that gets to it
41:51
the bit that actually smells
41:52
is likely to be poo whereas the second
41:55
molecule that gets
41:56
through is like to be beef and if a
41:57
molecule takes ages you know it might be
41:59
grass or something so if you have pooey
42:01
beef it knows that it's poo beef because
42:02
it's gone through both
42:03
precisely whereas if it only gets the
42:06
first smell that hits it's just poo yeah
42:08
it's like an andor
42:09
decision gate in a kind of a computer
42:12
right
42:12
yeah so you're saying that it can it can
42:14
get the hair
42:15
and then gets a live um koala yeah but
42:18
if it only gets
42:19
one of those two it knows that it's just
42:21
the hair or just exactly
42:23
koala yeah clever did you know that
42:25
bloodhounds
42:26
who have an amazing sense of smell smell
42:28
with their ears no
42:30
stop it yeah
42:33
my dog has no nose how does he smell
42:35
with his ears
42:40
that's how the joke should be told it's
42:41
not a joke but it's the truth um
42:44
this is actually a bit of a stretch but
42:47
this is the old tashinsky special
42:50
says something ridiculous and then
42:51
backtracks immediately
42:53
well what they do is um they've got
42:55
these really long ears blood towns and
42:57
you'll notice that there is a place
42:58
further down their heads than most dogs
43:01
and they also have really really droopy
43:02
jowls and really lots of wrinkles
43:05
and what these all do is they trap
43:06
scents and their ears are supposed to
43:08
drag along the ground
43:09
so their ears scoop up lots of smells
43:12
and then they get flicked and carried in
43:14
the wrinkles of their skin because
43:15
they're so flabby and up to their nose
43:17
so there is there to drag on the ground
43:19
and pick up smells for them i think
43:20
that's not far off is it that's
43:22
so close yes okay right but how long
43:24
does it take for them to smell something
43:25
then
43:26
i guess sometimes it would take a while
43:27
and then you've lost weather you've lost
43:29
where it was
43:29
yeah yeah yeah um one thing about bomb
43:32
disposal
43:33
yeah it's just a headline from a local
43:35
newspaper this isn't the bristol post
43:37
this is within the last month and the
43:38
headline is bomb disposal squad called
43:40
to western superman beach only to find a
43:43
really big plate
43:44
[Laughter]
43:47
there's a bloke who found something
43:48
metal on the beach he started digging it
43:50
up and it was huge and he thought oh god
43:52
okay this might be something really
43:53
serious and so he reburied it
43:55
phoned the bomb disposal squad they
43:57
arrived that was a plate
43:59
who's taking such a huge plate
44:02
it's like a platter for sandwiches maybe
44:05
yeah yeah yeah
44:06
and it would look like the top of a mine
44:07
completely yeah yeah it's not not a
44:09
crazy decision to make
44:10
yeah but with hindsight it turns out to
44:12
have been funny
44:13
[Laughter]
44:20
okay that is it that's all our facts
44:22

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:22
covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:25
sitting here with james harkid
00:27
anna chazinski and andrew hunter murray
00:30
and once again we have gathered around
00:32
the microphones with our four favorite
00:33
facts from the last seven
00:35
days and in no particular order here we
00:38
go
00:38
starting with my fact my fact this week
00:41
is that in america
00:42
you get traffic jams caused by people
00:45
chasing tornadoes
00:47
these are people who actively get in
00:49
cars when they hear a tornado
00:50
is uh out there in the fields and they
00:53
they try and track it and chase after it
00:55
in buses
00:56
in cars and so on and it used to be a
00:58
very niche
00:59
uh thing but then tv shows started
01:00
happening and more and more people got
01:02
into it
01:03
they still quite nice isn't it quite
01:04
niche but but uh big enough that
01:07
it's clogging up the roads because
01:08
thousands of people are doing it now
01:10
and they're rural roads as well right
01:11
yes it's not like you can get there
01:13
always
01:13
sometimes it's just in the middle of a
01:15
field that the tornado is happening i
01:16
don't really know much about tornadoes
01:18
clearly
01:18
i think they don't um adhere to roads
01:21
and fields and
01:22
boundaries in general i think they just
01:23
go where they want it
01:25
yeah it's true i met recently in america
01:28
someone in shelbyville who was talking
01:30
about
01:31
training to become a storm chaser she
01:32
does it uh for a living now and she was
01:34
going to be one of these people who were
01:36
going
01:37
to look for them and it happened her
01:39
interest was sparked after
01:40
her entire house was destroyed wow yes
01:43
so they all have these bunkers in
01:45
america that they go into
01:46
for tornado uh shelter and they don't
01:49
have enough they're very angry because
01:50
the government hasn't done enough about
01:52
it so
01:52
when you say they all do you mean people
01:54
in tornado alley yes
01:56
yeah sorry what's tornado alley oh it's
01:58
just the area of america where most the
01:59
vast majority of tornadoes happen so
02:01
it's
02:02
kansas yeah kind of area isn't it um
02:06
hence the wizard of oz
02:08
indeed but so twister did a lot the film
02:11
twisted it a lot for tornado pr didn't
02:13
it
02:13
yeah that was the big moment really i
02:15
think this is this is where tornado
02:17
chasers first picked up on the idea and
02:19
they did loads of research and they got
02:20
really involved with the you know
02:22
government
02:22
weather systems team whatever they're
02:24
called the noaa i think
02:26
um and they had lots of scientists on
02:28
board the film and bill paxton got
02:30
really into it
02:31
right and he did a documentary after it
02:33
about tornadoes i think
02:34
but there was a really sweet moment
02:35
earlier this year because he died in
02:37
february
02:38
that's right and there's this thing
02:39
called the spotter network which is this
02:41
online network that all tornado chasers
02:43
are on
02:44
and so the spotter network gives a gps
02:46
location for where
02:48
it the phone's owner is and so all these
02:50
tornado chasers
02:51
lined up and spelled out the initials bp
02:54
up tornado alley
02:55
it was petroleum yeah i know it's weird
02:58
because bill paxton had
02:59
shares in british petroleum well exactly
03:02
but it was huge so i was looking i was
03:04
looking at the initials and people were
03:05
tweeting it and they're all these little
03:07
uh green dots for where all the tornado
03:09
chases are spelling out bp
03:10
yeah if i looked at google maps and it
03:12
was a massive amount of space they were
03:14
covering so the
03:15
line of the p was 230 miles high really
03:18
yeah
03:19
wow i thought it was just in a field or
03:21
something but you don't need cars bumper
03:23
to bumper for 230 miles too
03:25
you can just have two cars 200 i'm just
03:27
checking yeah
03:28
what you said about they use gps i think
03:30
that's why this is so popular now isn't
03:32
it because
03:33
in the olden days in order to find a
03:35
tornado you'd have to go to the weather
03:37
forecasters and you'd have to
03:38
you know be quite an expert and these
03:40
days you just need an app and a car
03:42
yeah yeah you can just find it yeah yeah
03:44
because you need to know in advance and
03:45
we just have
03:46
we still have really bad tornado
03:47
forecasting systems don't we i think the
03:49
average amount of time between when
03:51
you're told that there's a tornado
03:52
coming towards you and when you have to
03:53
be out of your house is 13 minutes
03:55
yes still so so this is the big problem
03:57
with the storm chasers
03:59
people now if there is a tornado warning
04:01
in their area have to be prepared to
04:03
leave
04:03
extra early because just trying to flee
04:06
their houses
04:07
they're going to get caught up in the
04:08
traffic of the people actually heading
04:09
towards the tornado
04:11
they'll be heading the other way it just
04:13
uh yeah i guess sober so it'll be fine
04:16
well yeah i don't know if you need to
04:18
turn left or right yeah exactly some
04:20
roads are
04:20
not have you ever seen a disaster movie
04:23
like everyone goes in the same direction
04:25
and if you're going in the opposite
04:26
direction you might get eaten by
04:28
godzilla but at least you can get there
04:29
quickly
04:30
yeah that's true but no you can't
04:31
because everyone's going to film
04:32
godzilla because the godzilla app
04:34
they've got on their phone
04:35
to extend this metaphor too far speaking
04:38
of movies did you say you had a load of
04:40
trivia
04:40
before we started i had a fact about
04:42
twister but anna read it out just now
04:44
so was that it the bill paxton thing got
04:46
one more
04:48
in the film twister do you know what the
04:49
noise of the tornado was
04:52
uh i will give you a thousand pounds if
04:54
you guessed it
04:58
[Laughter]
05:08
yes it was a camel's moan slowed down
05:10
how did they make a camel moan
05:13
that sounds like the start of a joke
05:16
so the other one bit of trivia about
05:18
twister is that it was the first
05:20
hollywood movie released on dvd
05:22
really that is a good bit of trivia
05:25
that's cool because it had been the
05:26
first movie to spin
05:27
as well in order to play it oh yeah
05:30
although the spools of a vhs do spin as
05:32
well oh damn it you're right yes
05:34
sorry yeah they used to have in the
05:36
1980s a mobile observatory so
05:38
these days they have armored cars and
05:40
armored trucks and things
05:41
some of them with radar dishes on the
05:43
back to measure information when the
05:44
professionals do it
05:46
but in the 80s they had one which was a
05:47
massive barrel and they just had to
05:48
leave it in the path of a tornado
05:50
let it gather all the data that way
05:52
right the really cool thing was it was
05:54
called the toronto tornado observatory
05:56
or oh toronto after the dog in the
06:01
wizard of oz wow how nice is that the
06:04
band
06:07
they had the same one in africa and they
06:09
called it that afternoon yes
06:11
um do you know that one way to judge how
06:14
much
06:15
wind speed there is in a tornado used to
06:17
be whether it would
06:18
strip all the feathers off a chicken
06:22
as in you would have a chicken near one
06:24
or you would throw a chicken at it um
06:26
they would fire a chicken out of a gun
06:28
like a cannon kind of thing towards the
06:31
tornado to see if it would get stripped
06:34
while it was happening
06:35
well it was happening yeah and then you
06:36
go oh the all these chickens have lost
06:38
all their feathers so it must have been
06:39
more than 341 miles per hour oh okay
06:42
is that reliable uh it's not reliable
06:45
and the
06:46
unreliability of it um won a 1997 ig
06:49
nobel prize
06:50
and it was worked out by um bernard
06:52
vonnegut
06:53
who's the brother of kurt vonnegut oh
06:55
cool really uh
06:56
and so what happened was they always
06:59
used to use this system and then he
07:01
realized that there are
07:02
reasons why it might not work one
07:04
because he said that maybe the explosion
07:07
from the gun might have got rid of all
07:08
the
07:08
feathers uh and the other thing is that
07:10
sometimes um chickens have
07:12
particularly easy to pluck feathers
07:14
right it's called flight mult and every
07:16
now and then like once a year or
07:18
something you can pluck them quite
07:19
easily
07:20
so if you get them at the wrong time you
07:21
might miscalculate the speed
07:24
i was reading about a different canon um
07:26
just yesterday which was meant to fire
07:28
humans out of so it's a human cannonball
07:31
style cannon but the idea was for uh
07:33
firefighters
07:34
um and people who needed to get some
07:36
meetings in
07:37
water buildings yeah i don't it never
07:40
went through i was reading it in a new
07:41
scientist do surprised me it never went
07:43
through it was a new scientist book and
07:45
it was using so it was an air cannon
07:47
um the human was inside and the idea
07:49
would be for firefighters if they needed
07:51
to get to a top of a building that
07:52
would have taken too long they would
07:54
have been shot out of the air cannon to
07:56
the top of the building would it not
07:57
have been a tube that they went through
07:58
the tube the whole way
08:00
the word was uh cannon right yeah so
08:02
that's interesting so um
08:04
cannons has in human cannonballs they're
08:05
usually springs rather than
08:07
um so the idea was this was air i have
08:10
never thought
08:11
i've never considered what actually is
08:12
the form of propulsion for human
08:13
cannonball
08:14
well now you know now i know i did
08:16
always sort of assume it was gunpowder
08:19
[Laughter]
08:23
um have you guys heard about the
08:25
proposed great wall of kansas
08:28
no this is to stop tornadoes how big is
08:31
it uh
08:31
it's a thousand feet high 150 feet wide
08:35
and it would cost 60 billion dollars per
08:38
100 miles
08:39
this was proposed high yeah that's the
08:41
stall of the eiffel tower all the way
08:43
along this is a physicist
08:44
from uh pennsylvania i believe he
08:46
presented this
08:47
not an engineer then no
08:51
he said if we build three east-west
08:53
great walls in the american midwest now
08:55
you want
08:56
three walls yeah it's very confusing one
08:58
in north dakota one along the border
08:59
between kansas and oklahoma to the east
09:01
and the third one in south texas and
09:03
louisiana we will diminish the tornado
09:06
threats in tornado alley forever
09:08
and he was presenting that research in
09:10
in 2014 to the annual meeting of
09:12
american physical society in denver
09:15
uh everyone said it's nonsense obviously
09:17
um but he believes that it's a similar
09:19
thing with mountain ranges and how they
09:21
can curb tornadoes that's the
09:23
that's the idea behind it tell you what
09:24
if you're a teenager in america and
09:26
you're looking for a new career
09:28
be a massive wall builder because it
09:30
seems like oh yeah
09:31
yeah it's your i think if donald trump
09:33
can't pass a 20-foot high wall
09:36
and i think the odds are passing a
09:37
thousand foot high wall
09:42
hey do you wanna hear about an eclipse
09:43
chaser yeah yeah
09:46
two out of three yes please andy
09:50
yes quorum um no there are these people
09:52
so america is about to have a massive
09:54
eclipse on the 21st of august it's going
09:57
to pass across a huge band of america
09:59
and um i think 88 million americans live
10:02
within 200 miles and a lot of those
10:04
people are
10:05
expected to move towards this band as it
10:06
moves okay but there are certain people
10:08
who spend their whole lives all their
10:10
life savings
10:10
everything seeing eclipses around the
10:12
world and one of them is a guy called
10:14
mike
10:14
kentrianakis and he works for the
10:16
american astronomical society which is
10:18
good
10:19
because before that he was bankrupting
10:21
himself traveling around the world
10:22
seeing eclipses
10:23
one of his marriages i think maybe his
10:25
first marriage broke down partly because
10:27
his wife didn't want him to go to
10:28
argentina to see an eclipse
10:30
would she not let him see his son oh
10:34
hey oh very good that was very good
10:37
um but it's got a it's got a heartening
10:39
end because now he's got this job and he
10:40
gets paid to go to all the eclipses yeah
10:42
that's
10:42
really cool he was spending all his
10:44
money doing it although his marriage is
10:45
still over isn't it
10:47
yeah i guess if you're purely driven by
10:49
money fine but you know if there are
10:51
things more important in life he's lost
10:52
his family
10:53
no no no no no i mean he may have found
10:55
love again we don't know but he said
10:57
he said they had other problems as well
10:58
but this was just an indication that she
11:00
wasn't able to support
11:01
the thing he loves more than any other
11:02
yeah what a weird i mean once you've
11:04
seen an eclipse you've seen them all
11:06
haven't you
11:07
apparently it's an incredible experience
11:08
and some people the first time they
11:10
experience it that's all they ever want
11:11
to do again
11:12
do you all remember when we had one in
11:14
the uk yeah yeah it was fine
11:16
yeah it was okay wasn't it was it total
11:18
yes yeah i missed i missed the title i
11:20
think it was cloudy in a bit of london
11:21
yeah and the bit where i was i was in
11:23
sheffield it wasn't quite total there
11:25
but it was pretty total
11:26
i think you had to go to like the silly
11:27
islands or something yeah i was in
11:28
cornwall where it was total but it was
11:30
quite cloudy so
11:31
i think we've probably said this quote
11:33
on this show before but it's worth
11:35
saying again uh it was ian m banks who
11:38
said that
11:38
if aliens did ever visit us it would be
11:41
to watch
11:42
an eclipse a total solar eclipse because
11:44
the rarity it must be in the universe of
11:46
having a moon and a sun the exact same
11:48
size that that could happen
11:50
it's a tourist attraction that's why
11:51
they would come to earth come for the
11:53
eclipse
11:53
stay for the kardashians
12:02
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:04
that is
12:05
andy my fact is there is a special
12:06
quarantine center for chocolate in the
12:08
english countryside
12:11
yeah this is incredible it is it's
12:13
amazing you know these existed
12:14
it's a place in reading and it's called
12:16
the international coco quarantine center
12:18
or the icqc and it's got about 400
12:22
different varieties of cocoa plants
12:25
all in massive greenhouses and
12:27
scientists observe them
12:29
every week and they more of them come
12:31
around every month and they do special
12:32
checks on them
12:33
and basically it's because if you're
12:36
moving coco from one country to another
12:37
there's a real risk that a disease will
12:39
move
12:40
from one country to another so if a new
12:42
blight made it to west africa
12:44
when loads of the world world's cocoa is
12:45
grown and it's a massive plant for their
12:47
economy
12:48
that could cause massive hardship
12:50
distress and disaster
12:52
so every variety moving around the world
12:55
spends two years in quarantine at the
12:58
icqc
12:59
in reading right yeah and it's quite is
13:02
it quite new
13:02
was it built a few years ago no it's
13:04
been going since 1985 but they've got a
13:06
new home
13:07
since 2015. so yeah yeah so sorry just
13:10
so i can wrap my head around this
13:12
um they're collecting the cocoa plants
13:15
from around the world to sit there to
13:17
put through quarantine it's not
13:18
chocolate bars
13:19
it's not cheap that's why all the
13:22
chocolate you eat is off now
13:25
but what i mean is um if a new plant is
13:27
going to be used or if they're going to
13:29
use it for mass shipment they have to
13:30
then send samples to these guys
13:32
or you have to send you you send
13:35
the budwood which is a little length of
13:37
branch with a bud sprouting
13:38
right and they they put it in an
13:41
insect-proof cage just in case it's got
13:42
any insects which carrying disease on it
13:44
for a couple of months
13:45
then they grow it they grow a clone
13:47
that's called an indicator varietal
13:49
and then if after two years the plant is
13:51
completely free of disease it's allowed
13:53
to go on to
13:54
the place it was going to go to in the
13:56
first place so if you ever want to send
13:58
cocoa from one part of the world to the
13:59
other it has to go through reading
14:00
exactly wow it's like getting a train to
14:03
bristol isn't it
14:06
and also um looking at photos of this
14:08
place it looked a bit like
14:10
i assume they keep elements of the cocoa
14:13
that's been sent to them they don't just
14:14
send out the whole thing
14:15
it looks like it's a um the the life
14:18
raft of
14:19
of endangered cocoa plants yeah it's the
14:21
one true spot that we know we're
14:23
preserving them yeah it makes it nothing
14:25
makes me feel patriotic usually but
14:27
reading about this i thought wow
14:29
this we are so special we in britain are
14:32
saving the world's chocolate
14:33
that's a big deal it is pretty
14:34
impressive and the world's chocolate is
14:36
kind of under threat isn't it
14:37
so the demand is massively uh exceeding
14:40
supply at the moment
14:42
and we're running out of cocoa plants
14:44
they're really hard to farm so i think
14:45
only 30
14:46
of them uh if you have a cocoa farm only
14:49
30
14:50
of your plants will actually flower and
14:52
create the cocoa because there are so
14:53
many pests
14:54
yeah they've got these diseases with
14:56
really cool names like frosty pod
14:58
and witch's broom so there's a list on
15:00
wikipedia of all these
15:01
um diseases and a lot of them have the
15:04
word pod at the end like frosty pod
15:06
and so do a lot of podcasts um so i
15:09
wonder if you can tell me whether these
15:11
are oh my goodness coco disease or
15:14
podcast
15:16
so frosty pod you've said black pod um
15:21
eye disease podcast disease it's a
15:24
disease okay
15:25
um ghost pod uh podcast
15:30
did it be either couldn't they it really
15:32
could disease
15:33
it's a podcast um
15:37
chicken pop pod disease disease
15:41
podcasts podcasts it's a comedy podcast
15:45
uh melee pod means disney
15:48
uh disease a podcast it's a disney
15:52
and i got a million more of those but
15:54
that's the end of the game they're just
15:55
the four that we're sponsored by this
15:57
week
15:58
oh that was a very exciting game we've
15:59
never had a game before we just have a
16:01
game every time
16:02
yeah okay so this place was um this is
16:05
how important this is to the chocolate
16:06
industry
16:07
it was funded mutually by a large
16:10
uh group of the biggest chocolate makers
16:12
in the world from cadbury through to
16:13
mars through to willy wonka
16:14
through to um no not he doesn't exist
16:17
that was there
16:18
was a game candy there's a brand yeah oh
16:21
then it could be
16:22
well then very he very well may be an
16:24
investor in this place
16:25
anna does this still make you feel
16:26
really patriotic that our country is
16:28
doing this when actually it's just a
16:30
load of multinationals
16:31
it's gradually seeping away my nascent
16:34
nationalism
16:35
sure um just quickly do you know why
16:37
this cocoa
16:39
chocolate quarantine center is in
16:41
reading oh no
16:42
well reading was their football team's
16:44
called the biscuit men so there's a
16:46
biscuit company there exactly it's for
16:47
the chocolate biscuits no it's not
16:49
sadly it's not that it's because it's so
16:51
cold in
16:52
britain and particularly reading that
16:56
but none of the diseases which they're
16:58
they're potentially harboring in the
16:59
center could survive
17:00
outside the wilds of the countryside
17:02
around reddish is that right yeah so
17:04
that's why it's in britain basically
17:05
reading is an afterthought
17:08
um so this is really common with other
17:10
crops as well isn't it
17:12
there are various other things that get
17:13
quarantined in countries that are the
17:15
opposite of where they came from going
17:17
on a gap year
17:18
you go somewhere as different as you can
17:20
to your home country so i think
17:21
bananas most bananas spend some time in
17:23
belgium um
17:25
in transit um coffee goes to portugal
17:28
and spend some time being in portugal
17:29
and yeah it has to be places where the
17:31
usual pests of
17:33
those crops won't survive in that
17:34
climate portugal though as well it's
17:36
quite warm isn't it because
17:38
presumably it's come from like brazil or
17:39
somewhere not the opposite of brazil is
17:41
it possible
17:42
it's not very much not the exact
17:44
opposite you're right but i use colonial
17:46
oppressor of brazil if anything
17:47
[Laughter]
17:49
are you sending every banana there
17:54
no not every chocolate bar goes to
17:58
reading
18:00
you can just listen back to andy's
18:01
explanation
18:06
um do you know what the most expensive
18:09
chocolate ever sold for is and this is
18:11
in terms of okay do you want the price
18:13
or
18:14
what's in the chocolate or maybe price
18:16
and what the chocolate was it
18:17
okay i'll say a million pounds and it
18:20
was a bar flecked with gold
18:22
yeah so um this is a hard one because i
18:24
think there probably are
18:25
more expensive chocolates on the market
18:27
so this was sold at christie's auction
18:30
house okay
18:30
um okay so it was um a historical piece
18:33
of chocolate
18:34
it was something that mallory took up
18:37
everest very close
18:38
you're in totally in the territory in
18:39
that it's exploration is it shackleton
18:41
tucked to the side
18:42
so close it's exactly in the yes
18:45
sky i feel like it did all the hard work
18:49
scott's first expedition to the
18:50
antarctic uh in the early 1900s
18:53
and how much did his bar it's one
18:56
little lump of chocolate is it made of
18:58
gold as well no no it was just made of
19:00
chocolate yeah
19:00
um twenty thousand pounds no um
19:04
i'll go for for about chocolate 7984
19:08
okay um i think actually less than i
19:11
think four thousand five hundred pounds
19:13
four hundred and seventy pounds okay
19:15
yeah we overshot it the twenty thousand
19:17
was way off wasn't it yeah but i would
19:19
have thought twenty thousand was more in
19:20
the ballpark of something
19:22
that is attached to an extraordinarily
19:24
historically
19:25
important uh trip um the thing is i bet
19:28
they were
19:28
they did an auction with lots of
19:30
different things from his expedition
19:31
they did and this was probably the
19:32
shittiest one of them yes his diaries
19:34
went
19:35
and they went for 600 quid um
19:38
[Laughter]
19:40
no they were like 90 000 to 100 000
19:42
something like that so this is for the
19:43
one person who couldn't get anything
19:45
else and they're like i'll just get the
19:46
chocolate yeah just yeah bring the
19:47
chocolate
19:48
something to eat on the way home
19:56
okay it is time for fact number three
19:58
and that is chozinski
20:01
yeah my fact is that to celebrate the
20:03
communist revolution the bolsheviks
20:05
planned to build a tower in saint
20:06
petersburg that projected the news
20:09
onto the clouds this was this really
20:12
cool idea it was part of
20:14
so as soon as the bolshevik revolution
20:15
happened lennon launched this thing
20:16
called the monumental propaganda
20:18
campaign
20:19
and the idea was to build all these
20:20
monuments it's quite a clever pun
20:22
when it's translated into english but
20:24
the idea was to build all of these
20:25
monuments which were a
20:27
big piece of soviet propaganda and this
20:29
guy was commissioned this architect
20:31
called
20:32
tatlin vladimir tatlin was commissioned
20:34
to design
20:35
something that was going to be called
20:36
the monument to the third international
20:38
and so in 1919 he designed this insane
20:41
building
20:42
which is uh is often called the most
20:44
influential building that was never
20:45
built wow
20:46
because it's inspired lots of artists
20:48
and designers ever since and it's just
20:50
really fascinating
20:51
and it was going to be 400 meters tall
20:54
uh it was gonna be made of steel and
20:56
glass and iron it was this double helix
20:58
structure so it looks like a spiral on
20:59
the way up
21:00
and it had these amazing features so
21:02
various bits of it rotated
21:04
those huge glass cubes within it rotated
21:06
at different speeds
21:07
and there was a plan on the top bit
21:10
to have this information center which
21:13
would issue
21:14
news bulletins that in the night time or
21:16
on a cloudy day
21:17
shot up into the sky and um broadcast
21:20
and light the news announcements or
21:22
propaganda onto the sky
21:23
onto the clouds very cool it's very cool
21:26
i think people might be
21:27
familiar with this tower because it's
21:28
quite a famous iconic
21:30
thing yeah and they had a replica of it
21:32
in the
21:33
royal academy last year or the year
21:35
before i think
21:37
and it looks a little bit like the tower
21:39
at the olympic park
21:40
that's exactly what i was thinking yeah
21:42
and often if you see any kind of old
21:44
pictures of
21:45
soviet russia from the 1920s this is
21:47
kind of an iconic
21:49
image right and they used it and it kind
21:50
of represented their ambition so it was
21:52
used as a soviet icon in the 50s and 60s
21:54
to
21:55
show how great they were wait so this
21:57
building wasn't built but all the plans
22:00
and the drawings were released
22:01
and we've then sort of subtly built it
22:04
without at the time even they built a
22:06
lot of smaller versions of it
22:08
okay but the problem was that it was so
22:09
massive that there's no
22:11
it was impossible to build basically
22:13
they wouldn't be able to get enough iron
22:14
they won't be able to get enough steel
22:17
and for something yeah that was supposed
22:19
to be like building something which has
22:20
a real social purpose but the fact is
22:22
that it was impossible for them to make
22:24
anyway yeah
22:24
pretty ironic guys
22:28
considering what happened with the
22:30
communism
22:32
uh-huh yeah good right communist
22:34
anti-communist satire nice idea
22:36
but it doesn't work in practice right
22:39
yeah doesn't it really doesn't get off
22:40
the ground no the thing is andrew it's
22:41
never been properly tried
22:43
that's the problem it's just tried in
22:44
the wrong place it was the wrong
22:46
environment if only
22:47
someone had the balls to actually do it
22:48
it worked brilliantly yeah can you tell
22:50
me about the uh
22:51
cubicles inside is that like a revolving
22:53
restaurant or kind of
22:54
yeah yeah yeah but like james said they
22:56
had to have a social purpose so a
22:58
restaurant is a bit too frivolous they
22:59
were just going to be
23:00
like meeting rooms in conference rooms
23:02
but what i mean is with a single cubes
23:04
that were shifting inside the building
23:05
or was the whole of the building so
23:07
there were different layers of the
23:08
building and it would revolve at
23:09
different
23:10
rates so one of them would revolve once
23:12
a day and another one would be once a
23:13
week and another one would be once a
23:15
month and then
23:16
the bottom one would be i think the
23:17
bottom one would be once a year
23:20
and so you'd be able to tell what date
23:22
and time it was by it's just a giant
23:24
calendar
23:24
a little bit yeah and it was in a double
23:26
helix as well even though the structure
23:28
of dna hadn't been
23:29
i think discovered at this time the
23:31
whole around the
23:32
cylinder and the cube and the pyramid
23:34
and everything that was this huge double
23:36
helix yeah there's this one guy who's
23:37
written a big kind of biography of this
23:39
building
23:40
uh who says that it was never intended
23:42
to be built so some people think that it
23:44
was just a
23:45
thing that was meant to represent i
23:46
don't know the ambition or the symbolism
23:48
of
23:48
the new soviet russia that it wasn't
23:50
meant to be built but we don't know the
23:52
news in the clouds
23:53
is that a was scientifically is that a
23:55
practical thing i'm purely thinking it
23:57
is
23:57
out of the fact that the batman logo can
23:59
be put into the sky i know that is a
24:01
good documentary um yeah
24:02
with sequels but i don't think it was
24:05
this is the thing i
24:06
had no idea that they were trying
24:08
experimenting with these wildly
24:09
technologically advanced ideas but i
24:11
don't think that was practical it is
24:13
it's practical now yeah because there
24:15
was um a guy in nottingham called dave
24:17
lynch
24:18
and he fired a ghost rider onto the
24:21
clouds in nottingham a few years ago
24:23
okay a ghost rider yeah so it's like a
24:25
ghostly
24:26
horse rider guy oh cool and it was a bit
24:29
like my bridges
24:30
if you know that old um one of the first
24:33
animations
24:34
yeah for like a galaxy yeah it was it
24:36
literally was that
24:37
it used exactly the same projector as my
24:39
bridge didn't it but it used a laser
24:41
instead of light
24:42
but there's quite a long way to go until
24:44
we can watch liar liar on a cloud
24:46
is it yeah yeah it's right because it's
24:48
it's done with the laser so it's all in
24:49
the green light of the laser but
24:51
what they were originally doing was the
24:52
news so maybe it would be less difficult
24:54
to put
24:55
like k burley on than liar liar because
24:57
she's only in one studio
24:59
that's true yeah did i miss a reference
25:01
why are we
25:02
using a jim carrey movie from it's just
25:05
sorry i just tried to think of a really
25:06
good film yeah
25:09
okay cool sorry i thought i missed a
25:10
reference but that was just absolutely
25:11
did not happen
25:25
the new spider-man or a game of thrones
25:27
episode
25:28
here's the thing about that if you put
25:29
the latest spider-man in then no one's
25:31
going to go to the cinema because they
25:32
can just watch it in the clouds right
25:34
but if you put liar liar on which is
25:36
probably on terrestrial tv
25:37
pretty much once a year or something
25:39
then it's fine you don't lose any money
25:41
once a day in my flight
25:42
so yeah and also dan when people listen
25:46
to this podcast in a few months they'll
25:47
go
25:47
new spider-man what's that yeah whereas
25:49
liar liar
25:51
timeless well yeah that's a movie that
25:53
endures
25:54
um you were talking about the bat signal
25:56
yes i was yeah do you know how they
25:58
summon
25:58
batman on a cloud-less knight
26:02
do they project it onto the moon
26:05
they bridge hill to a star did they just
26:08
call him because he's probably got
26:09
a phone well there is the bat phone no
26:12
it's none of these things
26:13
supposedly i mean this is it's all made
26:14
outside of a building side of a building
26:16
is it yes how come we've never seen that
26:19
is it just very bad weather in gotham
26:20
city most of the time
26:22
yeah i think so and someone but someone
26:23
incredibly um
26:25
geeky on korra pointed out actually
26:27
because gotham is near water
26:28
it's liable to have more clout because
26:30
there'll be you know water
26:31
rising i don't know how true that is
26:32
weather-wise but also smog yeah
26:34
probably for them it's quite good to
26:36
have bad pollution yes
26:38
is it quite polluted gotham city yeah
26:40
the batmobile is diesel i think isn't it
26:46
that was so embarrassing that time you
26:48
accidentally filled it up with a leader
26:52
that was robin that did that that's why
26:54
he's never allowed to take it out
26:55
anymore
26:58
um so there was the tallest building
27:00
ever envisioned was the
27:02
ex-seed 4000 and it was going to be in
27:05
tokyo and it was going to be
27:06
four kilometers high uh pretty much in
27:10
the shape of mount fuji
27:11
and it would be able to accommodate
27:13
between half a million and one million
27:15
people
27:15
wow wow and they did the kind of plans
27:18
for this
27:19
yeah but never built it why not
27:21
unrealistic again
27:23
well according to the managing director
27:26
of buildings and data george binder
27:28
um he says that they never really meant
27:30
to build it the purpose was to earn some
27:32
recognition for the firm
27:34
yeah all these people claiming you never
27:36
really meant to build it they're always
27:38
saying this
27:38
and they reckon it would have cost a
27:40
minimum of about
27:41
500 billion us dollars to make it
27:45
but from the other fact um i saw that
27:48
we eat about a hundred billion dollars a
27:50
year on chocolate
27:52
so we'd only have to give up chocolate
27:53
as a world for five years and we'd be
27:55
able to build this tower
27:56
cool i don't know it's not worth it at
27:59
all
28:00
why not i think the vast majority of
28:02
people in the world would vote to keep
28:03
chocolate and not have a random tower
28:04
build somewhere in japan
28:05
but we would be saving chocolate
28:07
potentially we would we we would
28:08
replenish the stock
28:10
we would perhaps uh allow for the the
28:12
leaves to breathe
28:13
you get a lot less chocolate grown if
28:15
everyone stops eating it so actually the
28:16
stocks would crash dan
28:17
yeah um there was another soviet
28:19
building that was supposed to be built
28:21
was
28:21
the um the thing that was going to
28:24
replace the 19th century cathedral of
28:26
christ the savior which was like sar
28:27
nicholas the first
28:28
huge landmark in saint petersburg what
28:31
became petrograd and then leningrad
28:33
um and so the plan was to build this
28:36
amazing skyscraper that was going to be
28:38
like a huge wedding cake and on top of
28:39
it was going to have an 80 metre high
28:41
statue of lenin
28:43
and in his head was going to be a
28:44
library a soviet library
28:47
and it was again it was kind of a
28:48
ridiculous plan but they flattened the
28:50
zara's cathedral so they said well get
28:52
ready for that and then the ussr ran out
28:54
of money so that just remained flat and
28:56
all it became was the world's largest
28:58
open-air swimming pool ah which is kind
29:00
of cooler than
29:01
a giant lenin the designs were amazing
29:03
for
29:04
i remember seeing the designs for that
29:06
building for lennon head building yeah
29:07
would the linen head building have had a
29:09
massive swimming pool where his bladder
29:10
would have been
29:12
yeah that's not very appealing is it
29:14
because of the associations why not i
29:16
don't know
29:16
it'd be fun a patriotic soviet bladder i
29:20
guess
29:20
i'd probably encourage you to pee in it
29:22
it would the association's the word
29:24
bladder that's true and you can have a
29:26
water shoot coming out
29:27
through the urethra
29:31
i like this plan more and more the more
29:33
i think about it properly
29:35
but if you've got a watershed coming out
29:37
the blood is behind that
29:39
so when you come out of the end of the
29:40
urethra you just fly into mid-air right
29:43
yeah you just launch back into the city
29:46
could be a new design for you know these
29:48
cannons that fire firefighters up to the
29:50
top of buildings
29:52
i don't think we should give up on it
29:53
but let's park it let's
29:55
park it for now
29:57
[Music]
29:58
[Applause]
30:02
okay it is time for a final fact of the
30:04
show and that
30:05
is james okay my fact this week is that
30:08
caterpillars are more likely to vomit
30:10
when they're on their own right we all
30:13
throw up when we're lonely
30:15
come on oh well is that why they do it
30:18
then
30:18
i don't know if they're lonely but the
30:20
reason that they vomit is to get rid of
30:21
predators
30:22
because predators don't like being
30:24
vomited on and
30:26
when they're in a group they don't need
30:28
to do it because they're in a group
30:30
and actually one of their mates can
30:31
vomit instead
30:33
and so what happens is if you vomit it's
30:36
bad for you because you're getting rid
30:37
of your nutrition
30:39
and you need that food but if you're in
30:41
a group and someone else vomits then it
30:43
gets rid of the predator
30:44
and you've still got all of your food
30:46
inside you and so a study was done
30:48
in 2012 that found that this caterpillar
30:50
of the large white butterfly
30:52
um they are more likely when they're in
30:54
a group to try and cheat and let someone
30:56
else do the vomiting
30:57
oh wow but what if they all think that
30:59
this is typical selfish individualistic
31:02
21st century society if you all think
31:04
someone else
31:05
would pick up that rubbish then no one's
31:07
gonna do it that's why caterpillars need
31:09
to go back to a soviet system
31:12
that last facts really infected you it's
31:15
amazing how they're all
31:16
waiting for the other guy to get the
31:17
round in basically yeah
31:19
i'm just sorry i've just been working
31:21
out the caterpillar is very almost an
31:23
anagram of capitalist isn't it
31:24
so it's no wonder they brought down the
31:26
soviet system
31:28
with their self-serving ways there's did
31:31
you see the caterpillar they found i
31:32
think
31:33
last year or the year before uh it was
31:35
in
31:36
peru and it's from the mata camper
31:39
genus it was in the amazon and it
31:41
responds if you shouted it it doesn't
31:43
like being shouted at
31:44
and it's got these tentacles on its back
31:46
and there's a film of it
31:48
and if you just yell at the caterpillar
31:50
like that then its tentacles just flick
31:52
out straight away so it's like you know
31:53
when you're talking to a microphone and
31:54
you watch the sound waves go up and down
31:56
as you do
31:56
it's like that as soon as you yell at it
31:59
it like fires out these long
32:00
tentacles from its back but we don't
32:02
know why is it scared or is it attacking
32:03
you we have no idea why you could use it
32:06
as a way of
32:07
measuring sound couldn't you absolutely
32:10
so you could use it like as a clapometer
32:12
or something yes if you want to know
32:13
who's the most popular
32:15
you get them to applaud and then you
32:16
have loads of these little caterpillars
32:18
and the longer their tentacles go out
32:19
the more popular you are
32:20
wow that would be so cool until the
32:22
rspca got onto you that would be
32:24
unbelievably cool to have a
32:25
massive caterpillar but you could do it
32:27
on like britain's got talent instead of
32:29
having the judges
32:30
just have audience reactions yeah well
32:33
they're in the chairs they're all
32:34
caterpillars
32:35
i do like that actually i would watch
32:38
and the longer the tentacle the more
32:40
they liked it yeah you measure the
32:41
tentacles
32:42
but we don't yet know if they like it or
32:43
not so the worst acts might get through
32:46
yeah it's actually just the loudest acts
32:50
actually it's not the loudest audience
32:51
right yeah sorry sorry so they're not in
32:53
the judge's seat sorry they're much more
32:55
democratic than britain's got talent
32:57
no they are in the judge's seats the
32:58
caterpillars aren't the audience because
32:59
you need an audience to make the noise
33:02
but the caterpillars yeah but booze and
33:03
noises as well oh
33:05
yeah yeah you're so right
33:08
actually there have been many times
33:09
during stand up i've been very grateful
33:11
for the fact that boos are also noise
33:16
how did the show go andy well they were
33:18
very loud
33:22
more vomiting caterpillars yes the
33:24
caterpillars of the small mottled
33:26
willow moth um they vomit not just
33:29
what's in their stomach but also kind of
33:31
a detergent
33:32
and they do this onto ants and the
33:34
reason being
33:36
that they have a lot of kind of water in
33:37
their stomach so when they vomit it onto
33:39
the ants
33:40
this detergent kind of stops the um
33:42
surface tension of the water from being
33:44
a blob on the ant's head
33:46
and instead the water goes all over the
33:48
ants and then he has to kind of clean it
33:50
off
33:50
otherwise he'll drown oh wow and so
33:53
yeah i'm so amazing i thought you meant
33:55
like a detergent like if i
33:57
had a big boozy night out i'd vomit and
33:59
be like i need to clean that up oh no i
34:00
don't
34:01
it's just cleaned itself
34:04
that would be a great bit of evolution
34:06
yeah if you just had to vomit into the
34:07
washing machine before you closed
34:09
it did you know that so reading about
34:13
caterpillar vomit
34:14
the evolutionary biologist in a lot of
34:16
the articles who studies caterpillars
34:17
vomiting is called jane yak
34:23
there is a species of caterpillar that
34:25
lives on coca leaves
34:26
and when they vomit on predators their
34:28
vomit contains cocaine
34:30
wow which presumably the predators
34:34
don't like for whatever reason oh but it
34:36
itself
34:37
is not high all the time on cocaine
34:39
through eating it yeah so
34:40
it doesn't metabolize metabolize the
34:42
cocaine to make it go crazy
34:45
yeah but when it's eaten by the
34:47
predators
34:48
something happens to them but they don't
34:49
like it but is it worse amazing
34:51
if you find where where is this uh i
34:53
don't know but it must be where coca
34:55
leaves grow so south america
34:56
[Laughter]
34:59
that's so cool if you find a caterpillar
35:01
in south america is it worth giving it a
35:02
snort just in case
35:04
no i don't think so because it might be
35:06
one of the other ones so for instance
35:08
the eastern tent caterpillar
35:09
they'll deliberately eat parts of the
35:11
cherry leaves that contain cyanide and
35:13
they'll vomit out cyanide
35:15
wow okay so it's not worth risking it
35:17
for the cocaine high in case you get the
35:19
cyanide poison
35:20
yeah yeah fair enough you know the very
35:21
hungry caterpillar at the book
35:23
i do um a copy of that book has been
35:25
bought
35:26
every minute since it was published in
35:28
1969
35:30
no yes because shops closed yeah you
35:33
mean on average
35:34
yeah but the world turns then well
35:37
turned shops open
35:39
oh yeah just when the book shops in
35:40
japan are opening for the day
35:42
that's true is it a big seller in japan
35:44
yeah it's been translated to every
35:47
what i'm saying is that it sold 30
35:48
million copies all right wise guys
35:50
which if you add up all the minutes
35:52
between 1969 and now but it could have
35:53
sold them all yesterday
35:55
yeah yeah but it didn't because i
35:56
remember reading it as a child
35:58
yeah he might have got a free copy it
36:00
might have been like a preview company
36:02
it was a library copy proof copy
36:04
yeah there you go this whole time
36:08
this is the year it's finally published
36:10
how
36:15
okay it's impressive guys anyway but my
36:17
point is that the plot of the very
36:19
hungry caterpillar is completely
36:21
inaccurate
36:22
for one very simple reason because on
36:23
the first day he has an orange on the
36:24
second day he has two apples and i'm
36:26
getting the fruits a bit wrong but he
36:27
eats a lot of stuff over the course of
36:28
the day eat some cacade
36:31
i don't think you've read this book the
36:34
point is
36:35
that almost all caterpillars have one
36:37
specific plant only that they like to
36:39
feed on so the very hungry caterpillar
36:41
is an absurd fiction it should have just
36:44
been every page
36:45
he ate an apple another bit of apple he
36:47
ate another bit of the same apple
36:49
he didn't have a bit of the same species
36:50
of apples that's what you're
36:52
recommending
36:53
for the sequel yeah i am
36:56
very hungry and factually accurate
36:58
caterpillar
37:01
did you know you know flies vomit so
37:03
you're always told to fly lands on your
37:04
food and then it vomits straight away
37:06
because it can't metabolize food
37:07
internally um so it takes in and vomits
37:10
up its enzymes is that true
37:12
yeah yeah that's true okay um but one
37:15
problem that they have is at crime
37:16
scenes because if there's a lot of blood
37:18
at crime scenes then flies will have
37:20
come along
37:21
and they eat a lot of the blood and then
37:22
they vomit on the walls straight away
37:24
and they create little blood spatters
37:26
and people who are crime scene
37:27
specialists have to know to tell the
37:29
difference when they're looking really
37:30
close up at blood spatters between
37:32
blood vomited by flies and blood this is
37:34
amazing so what you can do
37:36
is if people check your hands for blood
37:38
after um there's been a crime
37:40
you can say oh just a fly landed on it
37:42
and vomited on my hands
37:43
so i was nowhere near it at the time and
37:45
on my shirt and on this bed
37:47
a lot of this one fly man alive
37:52
yeah anyway he'll he's my witness
37:55
[Laughter]
37:57
go on derek tell them how you did it
38:00
everybody
38:01
tell me how many derek
38:06
and all this cocaine on my hands as well
38:09
oh that's colin
38:10
[Laughter]
38:12
[Music]
38:17
okay that's it that is all of our facts
38:19

00:14
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
this week coming to you from the
00:21
wilderness festival
00:28
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:31
here with andrew hunter murray james
00:33
harkin and anna chazinski and once again
00:35
we have gathered around the microphones
00:36
with our four favorite facts from the
00:38
last seven days
00:39
and in no particular order here we go
00:42
we're going to start with my fact this
00:43
week
00:44
my fact is that in 1957 america
00:48
developed a shouting bomb
00:50
that would lecture the enemy for three
00:52
minutes as it dropped from the sky
00:56
when i get down there you are in such
00:58
trouble
00:59
mister um this was a very rogue
01:03
uh one mention in a new scientist
01:05
article i haven't been able to
01:06
prove its existence outside of this one
01:08
article yeah there's no mention online
01:10
at all is there
01:11
it's almost as if i made it up um but
01:14
i read also that apparently it would um
01:17
give instructions to the soldiers on the
01:19
ground as well as the bomb came down
01:21
you'd be able to hear what to do if
01:22
you're not really like run
01:24
how long why does it take three minutes
01:26
to shout that no so i
01:28
what i couldn't ascertain is does this
01:29
bomb go off or is it merely a propaganda
01:32
tool so the idea is that it would be
01:33
dropped from a plane
01:35
uh from about 60 000 feet high and then
01:38
parachutes would deploy
01:39
and then as it was making its ascent or
01:41
descent rather to the ground
01:43
yeah i didn't have to be correct um
01:46
and much of the people in the aeroplane
01:48
oh it's coming back
01:54
this is the worst lecture ever yeah so
01:57
the idea is that it would parachute down
01:59
and then it would just um and this is
02:01
1957
02:02
as it got to a certain height a tape
02:04
recorder on the inside would switch on
02:06
and it would play a tape through the
02:08
speakers in the shouting bomb
02:09
out to the general area and it could be
02:11
heard as far as half a mile apparently
02:13
wow and we don't know what it exactly
02:15
what it said i know we don't know if
02:16
it's real i mean we're
02:19
i but it's in new sciences and i have to
02:21
say uh the reason i think a lot of great
02:23
pop science writers have these
02:25
incredible careers like john ronson
02:27
and uh mary roach and so on they uncover
02:30
these documents because there's so many
02:32
of these
02:32
uh abandoned plans for military weaponry
02:36
where they thought oh this would be an
02:37
amazing thing to do and it gets to the
02:38
stage where it's about to be approved
02:40
and then it doesn't so i
02:41
i believe this is the same they almost
02:43
got this approved and then
02:44
lost it at the last hurricane they
02:46
aren't they i mean the ideas people were
02:47
coming up with were all completely
02:48
insane and there's so
02:50
many of them every time we talk about
02:52
this like i hadn't read about acoustic
02:54
kitty
02:55
which i think was a project that got a
02:56
little bit further but that was the cia
02:59
around the same time in the 1960s and
03:01
this was a cold war
03:03
project and the idea was that they
03:04
wanted to spy on soviet embassies
03:06
and they were going to do it with cats
03:08
and so vet
03:10
implanted a microphone into a cat's ear
03:12
canal
03:13
and it had a radio transmitter at the
03:14
base of its skull and put wire into its
03:16
fur
03:17
and it sounds a bit gruesome they uh
03:18
they sort of cut the cat open and then
03:20
put batteries in its body and stuff
03:21
apparently that does sound a bit
03:23
gruesome
03:24
yeah the cat was fine at this stage the
03:26
cat was fine
03:27
um and then the idea was that the cat
03:29
would be sent to where suspicious
03:31
enemies were hanging out so they sent
03:33
the cat to where they thought a couple
03:34
of soviets were
03:36
in washington and they let the cow the
03:39
van and it got hit by a taxi and killed
03:41
immediately
03:43
but there was a robot dog that they did
03:46
build and develop
03:47
so this is um i'm not sure if your bomb
03:49
was darpa damn have you heard of these
03:50
guys darpa so it's a defense advanced
03:52
research projects agency
03:54
basically they do a lot of the wacky
03:55
stuff for the american military and one
03:57
of the things they developed was a robo
03:59
dog which would carry weapons around the
04:01
battlefield and it's on four legs and
04:03
it's really good you can push it really
04:04
hard and it won't fall over
04:06
so it's stable okay and it trots around
04:08
and it can go up hills and downhills
04:10
but it was recently scrapped because it
04:12
was so noisy it would immediately give
04:14
away anybody's position
04:16
on the battlefield just by its presence
04:18
is it like a whirring noise or is it
04:20
barking or what is it
04:23
they didn't build in a park to give away
04:25
the position
04:27
can't you just take the bark away it
04:29
wouldn't be realistic without that
04:32
have you guys heard of a bird's eye bomb
04:36
no no is that a fish finger related
04:37
thing
04:39
no so this is a uh pigeon pigeon-guided
04:41
missile
04:42
and this was developed in world war ii
04:45
um by a psychologist called bf skinner
04:47
and the idea behind this he was looking
04:49
at pigeons and he was like suddenly i
04:51
saw them as a device
04:52
could they not guide a missile and this
04:54
genuinely was put into test
04:56
he had the pigeon looking at specific
04:59
images that might be the target during
05:01
world war
05:01
ii for example a a huge ship and he
05:04
would have the pigeon peck
05:06
the ship and every time it pecked the
05:07
ship it was like yes that's your that's
05:09
your goal it would get a reward or
05:10
something like that
05:11
the idea behind this missile is that in
05:13
front of the missile there was going to
05:15
be a little nodule
05:16
that contained the pigeon inside and
05:18
when they launched the rocket
05:20
the pigeon would see the ship in the
05:22
distance
05:23
and start pecking the front of the
05:25
missile and wherever it pecked
05:27
is where the missile turned towards and
05:30
that it would bring it to wherever it
05:31
needed to go through the maneuverability
05:33
of the pigeon neck
05:34
and it got past all the physicists and
05:36
the military people but it didn't get
05:38
past the budget
05:39
so it would have worked like we could
05:41
have had pigeon garden
05:43
how much does one pigeon cost
05:48
there's a great military website called
05:49
warontherocks.com and it's just
05:51
fascinating
05:52
articles about military history and
05:53
future and development and everything
05:54
and they're saying that in future
05:56
it's much more effective than having 100
05:58
million pound missile
06:00
to have a swarm of geese which are
06:02
robots
06:03
which each has a small amount of
06:04
explosive on it see what i mean
06:07
yeah i think i haven't explained that as
06:09
i could have done it
06:10
nor as clearly as i can see it in here
06:14
that's better than having one huge goose
06:16
with a
06:17
yes explains in this analogy the cruise
06:20
missile is one massive goose and you're
06:22
saying you want a thousand tiny geese
06:24
because it can scatter it further it can
06:25
scatter even
06:27
advanced uh defense and interceptor
06:29
systems can't get all the geese can they
06:31
no but what if maybe they should be like
06:34
insects and
06:35
like really really really small bumps
06:37
that would be good right
06:38
yes how yes it would how deadly a device
06:42
can you attach to your average house fly
06:44
yeah that's a good point there was a
06:45
thing they did with insects which was
06:47
um it was called the harassing annoying
06:49
and bad guy
06:50
identifying chemical system right now
06:53
and what they would do is they put a
06:54
chemical on a bad guy and it was
06:57
attracting insects and so all the
06:59
insects would fly near him and they'd
07:00
know which one the bad guy
07:02
was right no is that like an official
07:04
government turn
07:05
bad guy is that huge i think in the
07:08
american military they do use that
07:10
yeah but don't if you put a queen bee on
07:12
a bad guy
07:13
yes all the other bees get attracted to
07:15
the queen bee that is the thing that yes
07:17
you could slip a bee in his pocket when
07:19
he's not looking yeah a queen bee a
07:21
queen bee and then all the
07:22
other bees are going to go in the yeah
07:24
do you guys remember that genuinely
07:25
happened in the news last year where
07:27
someone accidentally trapped a queen bee
07:29
into the back of her car
07:31
drove off and was chased for hours by
07:33
this huge hive
07:35
and she had no idea why there's this
07:36
grandmother going what the hell
07:38
is going on there is one more darpa
07:41
thing
07:41
that darwin did okay so after uh
07:44
president kennedy was assassinated they
07:46
had a thing which in private they called
07:48
operation barn door
07:50
i.e we did not manage to save the last
07:52
president but we
07:53
we do want to save the next president
07:54
okay that was how they referred to it
07:56
privately that was not the official name
07:59
but
08:00
one of their ideas for saving the
08:02
president the next president's life
08:04
in the event of an assassination attempt
08:05
this is real was to put a fake
08:07
bulletproof sun shade on his head you
08:10
know the sort of
08:11
sun visor things that you have but they
08:13
said you would also have to spread
08:15
fake weather reports to justify why he
08:17
was wearing it
08:20
so he would be out in the raid and
08:22
they're going a beautiful sunny day here
08:27
right that's amazing that's how they
08:29
think these guys
08:30
that visor is only covering a little bit
08:32
of his body we'll cover about two
08:34
percent
08:34
so what they should really do is give
08:36
him her bulletproof beekeeping suit
08:38
yes and then spread information that
08:41
there's a queen bee around
08:44
yeah did you guys know just one weapon
08:46
that the us is uh
08:47
developing now uh so they're still doing
08:49
some pretty
08:50
weird stuff is a sticky foam gun
08:54
um so this is the idea is that it's a
08:55
non-lethal thing that shoots sticky foam
08:58
at the enemy and it lands on the ground
09:00
and if you're driving something over it
09:01
or even if you're running over it
09:02
then you get stuck to it and you can't
09:04
you can't continue to chase the enemy
09:06
and this was actually tried in somalia
09:08
in 1995 when they were trying to
09:09
evacuate people from there
09:11
and so it's this taffy-like goo that it
09:13
shoots out
09:14
it's shot from a hose it's designed to
09:15
fix a person's feet to the ground
09:17
at the moment it's at a stage where um
09:19
people's feet can move faster than the
09:21
glue actually works
09:22
so the best that could possibly happen
09:24
was if you hit a person's thighs his
09:27
legs sometimes
09:27
stuck together but even then if someone
09:32
manages to run up to them and go under
09:33
their legs they'll be free i believe
09:38
yeah that's the truth all right it is
09:42
time for fact number two and that is
09:44
james okay my fact is that earlier this
09:47
year a book
09:48
called 40 minutes late was returned to a
09:51
library in san francisco
09:53
100 years late it's so cool
09:57
is that the latest ever that are books
09:58
no it's not um
10:00
often people say that george washington
10:02
is the latest ever
10:03
he well he didn't return it it was
10:05
returned 200 years after he borrowed a
10:07
book oh okay
10:08
um obviously for obvious reasons he
10:10
didn't return it himself
10:12
um although what actually happened was
10:13
they found out about this book and they
10:15
couldn't find the original
10:16
and so they bought another copy of the
10:18
same book and returned that to the
10:20
library
10:20
so it was a bit of a cheat oh it's a
10:24
washington one yeah yeah oh that's the
10:26
one that the whole internet says it's
10:27
the oldest
10:28
returned book but actually it was a
10:30
completely different book yeah well do
10:31
you know
10:32
how when he took it out of the library
10:34
he didn't even bother to sign his name
10:36
he just got his assistant to write the
10:37
word president
10:39
and that's how they've assumed that it
10:41
was him let's just imagine the president
10:43
being that egotistical these days
10:48
just an ordinary man it's hard to
10:50
imagine a president visiting a library
10:51
these days
11:00
it was the context of this oh yeah good
11:03
point
11:04
um so yeah this was just a book that was
11:06
borrowed in 1917 by a lady called phoebe
11:09
johnson
11:10
uh and they um they found the book and
11:12
they gave it back and
11:14
there was a fine of three thousand six
11:16
hundred and fifty dollars
11:18
and that she owed or her family owed but
11:20
they um waived that
11:22
they always wave the final they can
11:23
always wave it and i always think
11:24
libraries are in trouble now they need
11:26
that money
11:27
this is what i think if you have a book
11:29
which is like two weeks over and you
11:31
need to pay two quid on it
11:32
keep it for another 100 years they'll
11:34
wave the fight
11:37
what we need is an example where someone
11:39
has taken it out returned it five years
11:41
late and is given a lifetime sentence
11:43
that's what we need just and then we'll
11:44
all we'll all bring books back that's
11:46
not what works best so they have
11:47
amnesties at libraries all the time
11:50
uh and those work better for getting
11:52
people to return the fines because
11:53
people don't return them because they're
11:54
afraid
11:55
of the fine and then the fight gets
11:57
worse and worse and then you're more
11:58
afraid so then you never return it
12:00
but lots of libraries uh so last month
12:02
sydney
12:03
scrapped library fines from now until
12:06
2021
12:07
saying they don't work reminders work
12:09
better please just bring the books back
12:11
and they've had three times as many
12:12
returned
12:12
is that right yeah apparently there are
12:14
25 million books that are officially
12:17
missing from uk libraries
12:19
and that would take at the current rate
12:21
of publishing in this country it takes
12:23
135 years for that many bugs to be
12:25
published
12:26
but this is they think it might be more
12:28
actually so they've uh they've looked at
12:30
their records
12:30
library records and 25 million books are
12:33
missing and they've compared it to
12:34
i think about 40 years ago and we've
12:36
lost half the books but
12:38
they looked at a bunch of suffolk
12:40
libraries and they realized that they
12:41
had ten thousand books missing that
12:43
weren't logged as missing so they just
12:44
haven't logged it into their it's just
12:46
completely empty
12:49
and all libraries have said yeah we have
12:50
the same thing we forget to log returns
12:52
and stuff all the time
12:53
so it's thought that we've just got way
12:55
more than 25 million books that have
12:57
disappeared
12:58
wow this new patent has been thought by
13:00
amazon for where they're going to put
13:02
all of their stuff now including books
13:04
uh so they've got their own sort of news
13:06
warehouse library and it's underwater
13:08
it's at the bottom of a lake
13:10
yeah they're building this little bubble
13:12
all this books will be soggy though
13:14
um no they're like those bath books that
13:16
you get yeah
13:17
every book will be like that
13:21
so they're building this bubble
13:22
warehouse underneath uh a lake
13:25
right at the bottom and any time an
13:26
order comes in all the stock that's down
13:29
their books or
13:30
anything like kindles or tvs whatever
13:32
you buy are going to be in these big
13:33
canisters
13:34
and if you've ordered it they're going
13:36
to send the uh the item
13:38
back up to the surface by releasing a
13:40
balloon that will carry it
13:42
to the top of the uh the lake i i mean i
13:45
think
13:45
we've all got the same question
13:48
which is what advantage does this have
13:51
over a normal land-based warehouse
13:55
i would imagine real estate must be
13:57
cheaper at the bottom of a lake
13:59
yes yeah because no one wants to live
14:01
there do they and it's so weird that i
14:03
did not ask myself that question
14:07
um my favorite bit of just general book
14:09
news from the year great
14:10
uh tory politician gavin barwell who
14:13
wrote a book called how to win a
14:15
marginal seat
14:16
lost his marginal seeds in the 27
14:20
general election he didn't say how to
14:23
win every marginal seat
14:27
that's true do you know you were saying
14:28
that um you get library amnesties
14:30
and one of the ways you can take a book
14:33
back and not be fined is by writing the
14:35
most imaginative excuse you can think of
14:37
and this is in san francisco which is
14:39
this where this was fact was from james
14:41
uh yeah that's right um
14:42
so this is san francisco in 2009 they
14:44
had an amnesty where they said if you
14:45
turned up and you wrote down a really
14:47
imaginative reason why you had brought
14:48
it back late
14:49
then they didn't charge you do you have
14:51
do you have examples well there are some
14:53
so one of the women said
14:54
this book was so nice it looked so posh
14:56
on my shelf i couldn't bear to give it
14:57
back it made me look really well read
15:00
um one a group of people said they were
15:02
too busy rescuing marine mammals
15:05
that's quite good absolutely yeah yeah
15:07
um one woman had brought out a book on
15:10
romantic relationships because she was
15:11
looking for some insight into how to
15:13
solve her relationship problems
15:14
um and she decided she'd keep it because
15:16
she needed more advice than
15:18
the library allowance had time to give
15:20
her but three partners later she decided
15:22
it wasn't helping and then returned it
15:26
in 2013 a belgium professor analyzed a
15:29
copy of 50 shades of grey
15:31
from a library in antwerp it tested
15:34
positive for both cocaine
15:35
and herpes wow
15:41
yeah but have they analyzed pride and
15:43
prejudice for comparison
15:47
it's the worst thing is that's the one
15:48
fact you're all going to remember
15:50
[Laughter]
15:51
can you can you get excuse my ignorance
15:54
can you get herpes from a book
15:57
because i've got a lot of tests to carry
15:59
out when i get home
16:01
do we need to move on sure that shortly
16:03
yeah what have you got something before
16:04
we do
16:05
well there's a library in portugal which
16:06
is partly staffed by bats
16:08
so i thought i'd better yeah no get that
16:11
in um so
16:12
what in what way are they partly quite
16:14
uh
16:15
it's called mafra palace library so it's
16:17
a beautiful ancient library it's about
16:19
three or four hundred years old i think
16:21
and it has a colony of bats living there
16:23
who live behind the shelves and then
16:25
when the library closes down at night
16:27
they come out they fly out and they fly
16:29
all over the line they put all the books
16:30
back
16:34
no but they do eat all the insects that
16:36
get into the library and the library
16:37
apparently is full of insects so
16:39
um the insects would be damaging the
16:41
books but they can't damage the books
16:42
because they've been eaten by the bats
16:44
so every night the bats eat each bat
16:47
eats double
16:48
its own weight in insects yeah the only
16:51
problem
16:51
is that they also leave a thin layer of
16:53
droppings over the whole library
16:57
all right should we move on to our third
16:58
phase okay it is time for fact number
17:01
three and that is
17:02
anna yeah my fact is that the person who
17:06
invented crowd control barriers
17:08
did so because so many people were
17:10
flocking to see his giant balloon
17:14
this is this guy called nadar who i just
17:16
found out about because there's a new
17:17
book about him called the great nada
17:18
it's by a guy called adam begley
17:20
um and he's sort of a multi-talented guy
17:23
but he was the most famous photographer
17:25
in france in the 19th century he was a
17:26
caricaturist
17:27
he was a balloonist and he decided to
17:31
build this giant balloon
17:33
and attracted loads of people to come
17:34
and see it and then so many people came
17:35
to see it all these crowds flocked and
17:37
flocked he couldn't take off so he was
17:39
attracting like 200 000 people
17:41
to one balloon takeoff a thousand people
17:43
it's a lot of people at one point he
17:45
attracted i think a quarter of the
17:46
population of
17:47
paris went to see him launch a balloon
17:50
wow um and so then he designed crowd
17:52
control barriers which is
17:53
exactly the same design that we have
17:54
today so this one was was it called the
17:57
giant
17:58
this one that you're talking about yeah
18:01
um it had enough room for 20 people in
18:04
the gondola at the bottom of the
18:05
balloon it also had a lavatory bunk beds
18:09
a printing press and a wine cellar
18:13
no wine cellar in the hot air balloon
18:15
yeah
18:16
and a billiards table it was incredible
18:18
it had six different rooms
18:20
in the basket and yeah you could play
18:21
billiards in it um
18:23
they had when he launched it on its
18:24
second attempt he took i think 12 people
18:27
up and they all had a really posh dinner
18:29
on the balcony
18:31
yeah are you confusing this with the
18:35
cartoon up the movie up is this yes
18:39
a seller is that one that's on a
18:40
different level isn't it well it was two
18:42
levels it was two it was
18:43
two levels two stories it was like a it
18:46
was not like a bungalow
18:48
[Laughter]
18:52
it was like two bungalows on top of each
18:54
other
18:56
he invented the double bungalow wow
18:59
this guy is good the the thing is the
19:01
first i think it was the first time he
19:02
saw him it's very the maiden voyage of
19:04
the giant
19:05
everyone came to see it and how many
19:06
people did he say it was it was two
19:07
hundred thousand thousand people but
19:10
the inflation took so long because it
19:12
was the largest household that had ever
19:13
been built
19:14
that they were all really really bored
19:16
well before it was full
19:17
and as it took off they just suddenly
19:19
silently watched it
19:21
disappear into the sky they didn't cheer
19:23
at all because they were so angry that
19:25
their time had been wasted
19:27
oh really yeah a similar thing happened
19:29
in leicester
19:30
in 1864 where they had a hot air balloon
19:33
it took so long to go up everyone got a
19:35
bit bored the police tried to sort out a
19:37
little bit of
19:38
a ruckus going on and then someone got
19:41
hit and then a massive riot ensued
19:43
and then the guy who was running the hot
19:45
air balloon decided i'm not doing this
19:46
anymore made the hotter bill and go down
19:49
and everyone ran over burnt it
19:52
ripped it up and then paraded it through
19:54
the streets of leicester
19:56
wow and for a while people from
19:59
leicester were called the lunatics
20:00
so no yeah for most of the end of the
20:03
19th century
20:04
if you were from leicester people would
20:06
call you a lunatic
20:09
why because if there was a riot
20:10
happening on the ground and i had access
20:12
to a hot air balloon my instinct would
20:13
be to
20:14
get out of there to let red quickly he
20:17
just legged at this guy he was called
20:18
henry coxwell
20:20
and he was quite famous balloonist
20:22
before he'd once gone up into the
20:24
stratosphere to see how high he could go
20:26
up in his hot air balloon
20:28
and he went up and up and up and up
20:30
until he went temporarily blind and
20:32
passed out
20:34
he lost all sensation in his hands um
20:36
but luckily there was one
20:37
other guy in there who just before he
20:39
passed out managed to open a
20:40
valve with his teeth which made it come
20:44
back down again what happened to his
20:45
hands
20:46
oh he had no sensation in there maybe
20:47
yeah no sensation i see
20:49
okay unlike your very you know nervous
20:52
teeth
20:53
or he liked a challenge um
20:56
i was reading about more about this
20:58
nadar guy he is an extraordinary
21:00
character the best
21:01
my new favorite guy yeah he's beyond
21:03
ballooning he's um
21:04
a huge pioneer of photography so one of
21:06
the things that he used to do in the hot
21:08
air balloons
21:09
was to effectively invent aerial
21:11
photography so
21:12
facing over paris he used to go over
21:14
fields and he did it
21:15
hundreds of times because he couldn't
21:16
manage to get the exposure on the camera
21:18
right
21:18
um because the balloon kept moving and
21:20
obviously photos took a long time to
21:22
to capture the motion and also what he
21:24
didn't know at the time was the gas that
21:26
was keeping the balloon was getting away
21:27
and putting soot
21:28
all over so he'd come down and there
21:30
would just be black photos completely
21:31
and he'd be like i'm pretty sure it was
21:33
daytime when i did this
21:35
that was that was the reason for that
21:36
and then he also invented underground
21:38
photography
21:40
so he's like he's hit every spectrum
21:42
underground photography
21:43
yeah he actually did it in we talked a
21:45
few weeks ago on the podcast about the
21:46
catacombs of paris and he did it in the
21:48
catacombs didn't he and
21:49
so lighting with candles the area and
21:52
then taking photos
21:53
it's a bit much to say he invented
21:55
underground photography he's just taking
21:56
photos on the ground isn't he
21:58
yeah it's like the wind-up radio it's
22:01
not really an invention it's just two
22:03
inventions stuck together and also i
22:04
think you usually say he invented
22:06
something when it's something we all
22:07
recognize it's not like we've all gone
22:08
god can you imagine the world without
22:10
underground photography yes
22:13
okay he took the invention of the camera
22:15
and he took the person who invented
22:17
underground
22:17
and he smashed them together and that's
22:20
what he did
22:20
but photography wise it is worth saying
22:22
that thanks to him we have
22:24
extraordinary portraits of some of the
22:26
greatest figures of that period jules
22:28
verne
22:28
he did this gigantic caricature of all
22:31
of them
22:32
where he again kind of effectively
22:34
invented that whole uh caricature
22:36
grotesque large head small body thing he
22:39
did a big
22:40
300 person line of all the most
22:42
influential people
22:43
in paris at the time or france generally
22:46
and while he was doing it was taking too
22:47
long because they came the most
22:48
important ones came in to sit for their
22:50
for their drawings
22:51
so when photography was around he was
22:54
looking at that going i could capture
22:55
them
22:56
and start doing them via this so he
22:58
managed to get jules verne
22:59
he managed to get victor hugo he got
23:03
sarah bernhardt uh he didn't get
23:05
ballsack because
23:07
he thought that cameras would steal his
23:08
soul so he said no to the photo
23:11
with some of the most important people
23:12
and they're beautiful photos if you look
23:14
at them online
23:14
yeah they really are um he wasn't very
23:17
successful
23:18
actually his balloons were just crashing
23:20
constantly and he kept going so
23:22
there were first-hand reports of the
23:23
giant balloon that he sent up
23:25
where it uh the aim was that it would
23:27
travel over loads of different countries
23:28
so the first guests that got on
23:30
they brought tour guides to various
23:32
countries in europe
23:33
and they brought their passports but you
23:35
can't control where you're going
23:37
that's why you have six door guys to all
23:38
of them get a visa for everyone
23:41
and this was pre-eu so they would have
23:43
needed a visa wouldn't they yeah for
23:45
every single border
23:46
but they didn't get very far so the
23:47
first time they lasted 15 miles and then
23:50
the balloon plummeted to earth and
23:52
the wicker basket was bumped along the
23:54
earth the second one actually traveled
23:55
400 miles
23:57
so it flew over the netherlands and into
23:59
germany but then
24:00
nadar panicked that the balloon was
24:02
getting too hot from the heat of the sun
24:04
so he started letting the air out and
24:06
the winds took it and it crashed landed
24:08
into the ground and there are these
24:09
descriptions of it bouncing across
24:11
fields on its side everyone in it being
24:13
tossed around
24:14
bouncing through a wood it went towards
24:15
a railway track the
24:17
train driver did an emergency stop nadar
24:19
said a couple of feet before he hit them
24:22
and then it just spilled everyone out
24:23
and people were scattered across the
24:25
ground like fallen apples
24:27
being dragged along the floor for it was
24:29
like for miles wasn't it it was yeah
24:31
that's i mean you can't play billiards
24:33
while that's happening
24:35
it would make it a more interesting game
24:37
possibly so
24:38
you know how every invention is tested
24:40
on animals before it's tested on humans
24:43
is it yeah so space flight they set up
24:45
the dogs
24:47
first yeah same is true of hot
24:48
overloading they send up
24:50
together in what the first hot air
24:52
balloon flight a rooster a duck and a
24:54
sheep
24:54
um and it was thought the sheep would be
24:56
most helpful because it's a land animal
24:58
so the rooster and the duck are
24:59
obviously used to soaring to great
25:01
heights above the earth
25:02
but the sheep is more like the humans so
25:05
we can see if it you know explodes or
25:06
whatever when it gets up there
25:08
and did it no it didn't explode so
25:10
what's the next phase after animal
25:12
trials
25:13
anyone human trials well not just any
25:15
human trials condemned criminal trials
25:19
so the next step was to send out a
25:21
condemned criminal in the basket of the
25:22
balloon to see if he exploded
25:24
the only problem was that the only
25:25
people who knew how to fly them were
25:26
real experts because obviously it was a
25:28
you know it was quite a tricky thing to
25:30
do
25:30
and very few of the qualified experts
25:32
wanted to go up
25:33
with a dangerous criminal in a hot air
25:36
balloon
25:36
it's a wicker basket which is tiny so
25:39
hold on when the
25:40
rooster and the sheep and the duck went
25:41
up they also had a human expert with
25:43
them flying the balloon
25:44
i am not sure because i always pictured
25:47
it as just then
25:48
so did i but i don't understand how that
25:51
i think it was and i think it was
25:52
tethered
25:53
it was tethered so you would wind
25:58
[Laughter]
26:04
why wouldn't it just go well this looks
26:05
a bit of a dodgy way to travel i'm just
26:07
gonna [ __ ] off guys i'm out guys
26:09
probably
26:10
probably the duck was tethered to the
26:12
balloon right
26:13
the most ironic thing you can do is give
26:16
a bird the power of flight
26:17
but deny it the ability to actually fly
26:19
away
26:20
but worst thing if you're the sheep and
26:22
the other two fly away and you're
26:23
thinking well maybe i could do it i'm
26:25
not sure
26:29
i don't think roosters can really i i'm
26:31
trying to remember the plot of chicken
26:32
run and the extent to which chickens can
26:34
or can't fly it's not called chicken fly
26:36
is it
26:40
i read a really nice balloon story
26:42
yesterday which is that in 2007
26:44
nasa had funded this uh project which
26:47
was called blast
26:48
and the idea is that they were going to
26:50
fly it above the clouds in antarctica
26:52
for 40 kilometers high and for 12 days
26:55
they were going to take photos
26:56
by infrared of star formations in the
26:58
sky so it was up there for
27:00
via a balloon 12 days this big satellite
27:03
and then when the 12 days was done they
27:04
were bringing it back down so they
27:05
detached it from the balloon
27:07
and it fell towards the earth and then
27:09
parachutes deployed so they brought the
27:10
parachutes and they landed on antarctica
27:13
and it was all fine
27:14
except just before it landed there was
27:16
meant to be an electronic device
27:18
that snapped away the parachutes but
27:20
that failed
27:21
as a result the parachutes were on the
27:23
side and a huge gust of wind came
27:25
and picked up the parachutes and they
27:27
parasailed away from the researchers
27:30
for 24 hours non-stop
27:33
they eventually found it 2 000
27:35
kilometers away
27:37
but they didn't find it for a year
27:39
because apparently nasa likes to paint
27:40
everything white
27:42
and as a result it was just camouflaged
27:44
2
27:45
000 miles away so awesome wow and so
27:48
were they
27:49
kind of like when you drop a crisp
27:50
packet and it gets taken by the wind and
27:51
you're constantly going after it did
27:53
they chase it for a while
27:54
were they running after this thing when
27:57
does that happen in your life
28:01
you drop a bit of rubbish yeah and if
28:03
you've ever seen american beauty you
28:05
know the wind sometimes takes rubbish
28:07
and you chase after it and you're always
28:08
trying to grab it and it always eludes
28:10
your grasp
28:10
right so was it like that with a
28:12
scientist constantly grabbing at it and
28:14
it just starting away at the last minute
28:15
not at all no
28:16
[Laughter]
28:19
have you oh it's nice that i cleared
28:20
that up have you eaten all the crisps
28:22
in this scenario are you trying to get
28:24
the crisps back or are you trying to get
28:25
the packet back
28:26
trying to get the packet back because
28:27
i'm not a filthy litterer like some
28:28
people andy
28:31
[Applause]
28:37
classic eco-conscious festival crowd
28:40
honestly i if i dropped a packet of
28:42
chris i'd just open another one
28:44
immediately
28:46
i'm joking
28:50
just a full packet you've got a full
28:52
clothesline sometimes i open a
28:54
multi-pack
28:54
drop it this card
28:58
do you know the very first ever
28:59
balloonists to cross the english channel
29:01
landed with no trousers on
29:05
this is true it's 100 true so excited so
29:08
at what stage did the trousers go right
29:11
away
29:11
almost to midnight on entry no no no so
29:13
um i think we may have done we may have
29:15
mentioned this on qi
29:16
i'm not sure but many years ago so the
29:19
they they
29:19
were crossing this english channel it
29:21
was all going great but then
29:22
they started to descend more rapidly
29:24
there wasn't enough air in the balloon
29:26
and they started getting really worried
29:28
so so they immediately took up their
29:30
trousers
29:31
they first at first they threw away the
29:33
anchors on the side of the
29:35
balloon because they basically they
29:37
could see the white cliffs of dover
29:39
they were going oh we're not quite going
29:40
to get over those aren't we so they they
29:42
and so they'll have got rid of all the
29:43
sandbags and stuff
29:45
the sandbags they throw away the awls
29:47
that they hope to steer with
29:50
i don't know um then they throw away a
29:52
propeller that they had with them for
29:54
some reason and then eventually
29:55
they had to throw away pretty much all
29:57
the clothes they were wearing including
29:58
their trousers
30:00
and they made it they made it across and
30:02
they landed with no trousers on
30:04
[Applause]
30:05
did at any point when the panic was
30:07
setting it wanted to go who brought all
30:08
this [ __ ]
30:10
are we doing with oars what's we're
30:13
gonna crash into a mountain you dick
30:17
so when they landed without trousers did
30:19
they all stay in the balloon refusing to
30:21
get
30:22
out for the press conference they said
30:26
it doesn't sound like an excuse though
30:31
what are you suggesting james i'm
30:33
suggesting that they
30:34
took their trousers off for another
30:35
reason right and
30:37
when the press turned up they said why
30:39
have you done that and they said well we
30:41
took our troubles off because of the
30:42
thing and they said well
30:44
did you throw anything else and they're
30:45
like yeah we threw out all the yours
30:50
okay it is time for our final fact of
30:52
the show and that is
30:53
andrew hunter murray my fact is that
30:55
volkswagen sells
30:57
more sausages than cars
31:01
this is 100 true it's unbelievable
31:04
it's unbelievable i can't believe i've
31:06
never heard this before this was sent in
31:08
by the way by a guy called mike holden
31:09
so mike if you're listening
31:10
thank you so much for sending us in in
31:12
2015
31:13
volkswagen sold 5.8 million cars pretty
31:16
good
31:17
but they sold 7.2 million sausages
31:21
but sausages are a lot cheaper the yeah
31:23
it's easier to make a sausage than a car
31:25
that is true so they've made less money
31:28
on the sausages
31:29
is what i'm saying yeah but they'll have
31:30
been fined less for cheating on the
31:32
emissions
31:34
of the sausages too so they also make
31:37
ketchup as well don't they they make
31:38
their own ketchup and it gets sold in
31:40
supermarkets yeah
31:40
buy a pack of volkswagens i read this
31:43
apparently they have their own
31:45
code they are listed these sausages as
31:47
an official volkswagen component
31:49
which is 199 398 500a
31:53
and car dealers will often give you a
31:55
five pack of sausages if you buy a
31:56
volkswagen
31:58
does that tip some people over the edge
32:00
into making that decision
32:02
i think so they're very tasty it's not
32:05
that surprising that they sell more
32:06
sausages than cars and if for every car
32:08
you're giving away five sausages
32:14
they invented them to feed their workers
32:16
didn't they yeah in the 1970s they came
32:18
up with this new kind of sausage that
32:20
they'd um
32:21
give their workers and then suddenly the
32:23
workers said this is really good sausage
32:24
guys
32:25
you should sell it and they started
32:26
selling it right massive and they still
32:28
give it to the workers though every day
32:30
so um
32:31
they have it at about nine in the
32:33
morning it's curried sausage as well so
32:34
it's quite a quiet taste for breakfast
32:36
um so carried sausage big in germany
32:39
basically yeah do you know that berlin
32:41
has an entire museum devoted to curry
32:43
sausage
32:43
does it it has a curry sausage museum
32:45
and i read some of the reviews of it
32:47
i just wanted to share a review or two
32:49
with you one of the reviews on yelp
32:51
11 euros seems a steep price to pay for
32:53
a small exhibit on the history and glory
32:55
of currywurst
32:56
still gave it four stars it's a lot of
32:58
fun
33:00
then he added would i go back no
33:06
but then he said in fairness he said
33:08
because it's an exhibit that i doubt
33:09
changes its content
33:11
why would it so it's a roller coaster
33:17
currywurst was brought to germany by the
33:19
british really wasn't it
33:21
also sort of um
33:24
in the you know we just try to claim
33:26
everything but um so it was just after
33:28
world war ii
33:29
and so some of the allied soldiers there
33:32
introduced curry powder and ketchup
33:34
because
33:35
we had a lot of curry powder we were
33:36
into curry a lot of trade with india
33:38
and then a german woman said oh that
33:40
tastes really nice with a sausage
33:42
and so she created curry first and in
33:45
the museum i believe they say without
33:46
the good old british we wouldn't have
33:48
our staple dish today james is
33:52
inventing the curried sausage no it's
33:54
not an invention
33:55
it's just putting curry and sausage
33:57
together
34:00
is it better than the wind-up radio as
34:02
an invention would you say
34:04
um well i haven't been to the museum
34:07
you should go it sounds amazing they've
34:10
got a spice
34:10
chamber with sniffing stations they've
34:13
got
34:14
um audio stations playing carry worst
34:16
themed songs
34:18
a virtual curry first making game called
34:20
curry up
34:22
uh and a sausage-shaped sofa
34:26
so um i went onto a website
34:32
lovepork.co.uk
34:34
i was disappointed tonight
34:37
four stars won't be going back um
34:40
no it is it's not what you might think
34:43
it's a non-departmental public body
34:45
about the pork industry but they have
34:48
some fun facts about sausages
34:50
um so for instance there are more than
34:53
500 recipes for sausage
34:55
in britain you can have a different
34:57
british sausage
34:58
every day for 10 years
35:02
wait you wouldn't live that long 5 000
35:04
don't you mean
35:05
um that's a number of recipes but this
35:07
is that was two kind of facts
35:08
mushed together oh he invented a new fan
35:14
and did you know that in 320 a.d
35:17
eating sausages was a sin and it was
35:20
made of sin by the catholic church
35:22
because it was associated with pagan
35:24
festivals wow
35:26
and you just know why they were eating
35:28
sausages at those
35:42
you're in a room of like 200 people i
35:44
don't know if you've noticed
35:45
surely one person here there was one
35:48
minute
35:49
yeah i don't need your pity guys
35:53
i'm okay with thing alone on this one
35:54
and the other thing about
35:56
pagans and sausages is i went on the
35:58
internet today and googled pagan
36:00
sausages
36:01
and i found out because i was
36:03
disappointed
36:06
well there's quite a few people online
36:08
who seem to think that the word
36:09
jesus when said backwards is sausage
36:13
oh it's kind of it is susan
36:19
so maybe that's a reason that it's an
36:20
evil pagan thing
36:22
sausage
36:25
that's a huge that's like a da vinci
36:27
code moment isn't it
36:30
jesus was a sausage
36:33
can i tell you a little um story from
36:35
the bbc news website
36:37
all right it's it's news from northern
36:39
ireland from last week
36:41
court reporters were a little taken
36:42
aback when a self-confessed sausage
36:44
thief tried to get on first name terms
36:45
with a judge at belfast magistrates
36:47
court
36:48
belfast man michael mcnally who has
36:50
almost 300 previous convictions
36:52
was jailed after admitting a new spate
36:54
of shoplifting including the theft of 10
36:56
packs of sausages
36:58
his defense lawyer told the district
36:59
judge fiona bagnol that mcnally had
37:01
managed to stay out of jail for six
37:03
weeks
37:03
which he says is a record for him
37:07
as he was led to the cells mcnally
37:08
called out to the judge that's okay
37:10
see you later fiona
37:11
[Laughter]
37:16
obviously crime is wrong but on another
37:18
level what a
37:21
tell guy how many packs of sausages he
37:23
stole 10 packs of sausages
37:25
because you couldn't possibly get
37:27
through those before
37:28
they went off could you you could freeze
37:31
them
37:32
freeze them i i'm more of a hand to
37:34
mouth i never use the freezer
37:38
okay that makes more sense that's why
37:40
you have such a crisp based diet isn't
37:41
it
37:44
do you know how long the longer sausage
37:45
was though
37:51
guys it was 63 kilometers long
37:56
sausage christmas
38:08
was it like a mistake in the factory
38:09
where they meant to put the twist in
38:10
between
38:11
each one like i was off sick that day
38:15
no the longer it was a deliberate thing
38:16
it was to celebrate romania day in
38:18
romania
38:19
um and it was yeah 63 miles long it was
38:22
actually a bit disappointing they never
38:23
spread it out all the way i don't think
38:25
so it was all curled around
38:26
but maybe they just didn't have a space
38:28
long enough wow yeah
38:30
how far would you get outside uh
38:33
60 kilometers from here yeah isn't that
38:36
space
38:37
yes yeah no it would be yeah if you
38:39
stood the sausage up
38:42
you might hit the international space
38:43
station is that right yes it is
38:45
so that could be how they get there in
38:46
future
38:49
let's climb the giant sausage
38:53
wait however did you google the words
38:54
climb the giant sausage
39:00
okay there was a story right you're
39:02
australian dan yeah
39:04
there was a story about the um so in
39:06
australia when you vote you get given a
39:08
democracy sausage this is what they call
39:09
it right so
39:11
when you if you turn up to vote they
39:12
have a load genuinely they have
39:14
barbecues at every polling station in
39:15
australia
39:16
but you know during the last election
39:18
there was a massive faux pas by both
39:20
leaders this was in 2016.
39:21
so malcolm turnbull the prime minister
39:24
skipped the democracy sausage
39:25
photo opportunity presumably because he
39:27
thought it might look silly or something
39:29
but get this i cannot get my head around
39:30
this opposition leader bill
39:32
shorten committed a faux pas when he
39:35
tried to eat his sausage and bun
39:36
combination
39:37
from the side rather than from the end
39:50
it's an exciting decision
39:53
i'm calling it this is an invention
39:58
hey we're gonna have to wrap up very
39:59
shortly yeah so if you guys have
40:01
anything before we go
40:02
i have one last thing which is that
40:03
during the election campaign
40:05
uh in america the presidential campaign
40:07
a hot dog stand in chicago
40:09
sold a hot dog that they called the
40:11
trump footlong
40:12
which was actually a three inch long
40:14
hotdog
40:21
okay that is it that is all of our facts

01:25
[Music]
01:28
[Applause]
01:31
[Music]
01:33
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:36
no such thing as a fish
01:37
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:39
qi offices in covent garden
01:42
my name is dan schreiber and i am
01:44
sitting here with james harkin
01:46
anna chazinski and andrew hunter murray
01:49
and once again we have gathered around
01:50
the microphones with our four
01:52
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:54
and in no particular order
01:56
here we go starting with you jasinski
01:59
my fact this week is that one of the
02:00
costume designers on star wars
02:03
also made a moose suit for scientists to
02:05
help them
02:06
sneak up on moose or
02:09
mooses such or mess is moose notch the
02:12
actual plural yeah
02:14
because it's a native american word and
02:15
that's how this particular tribe
02:16
pluralizes it so what's the advantage of
02:18
sneaking up on a moose
02:19
well if you want to hang out with them
02:21
which these scientists did so they were
02:23
studying moose in the yellowstone area
02:25
and i think they were specifically at
02:26
this time looking at how they were
02:27
responding to predators so wolves
02:29
numbers had declined in yellowstone and
02:31
moosa got used to living without them
02:33
and then i think they'd come back and
02:34
the scientists wanted to see if moose
02:36
had forgotten how to escape
02:37
wolves and so they needed to put wolf
02:39
poo and we
02:41
where moose lived to check how they
02:42
responded to the threat
02:44
and so this researcher called joel
02:46
berger
02:47
asked a woman who worked on the set of
02:49
star wars to make him a moose suit so he
02:51
could go and deposit moose poo and wee
02:53
around moose yeah because they did used
02:55
to before the musu
02:56
came along did attempt to sort of throw
02:59
balls
03:00
of poo and we out at the moose in order
03:03
to
03:04
attract them towards it but they
03:06
couldn't throw far enough so they ended
03:07
up just littering
03:08
the uh the landscape they still
03:10
sometimes use bolts they use snowballs
03:12
yeah so they get snowballs and they'll
03:14
put sometimes they even put human wheel
03:16
on because they want to see how they'll
03:17
um
03:18
deal with humans so they'll wee on a
03:20
snowball and then throw it
03:22
towards the moose yeah that's right and
03:24
they would slingshot them as well
03:25
and joel berger wrote about this he's
03:27
reading a book called uh the better to
03:29
eat you with
03:30
and he describes the moment where he
03:31
first hit it's like this eureka moment
03:33
where he's in
03:34
the place observing the moose and he
03:36
says to his colleague
03:37
wait i've had a brilliant idea i'm going
03:39
to wee on the snowball but then
03:40
he he says he's run out of wii because
03:42
he recently went to the loo
03:43
so he just instead of explaining that
03:45
problem i would say you've run out of
03:47
women
03:50
again okay
03:54
but he his we stockpile was depleted
03:57
so he just made a snowball with his
03:59
hands and then turned to his colleague
04:00
and said quick press on this
04:02
uh so i can throw it at the deer it's i
04:04
think his colleague
04:06
is his wife is it not it was this was a
04:08
male colleague
04:09
not his wife or maybe he's got more than
04:10
one colleague yeah
04:12
probably not after this experiment
04:15
probably goes through colleagues quite
04:16
quickly
04:17
um i've been to yellowstone and seen the
04:20
moose and
04:21
you can drive right up to them and they
04:22
just sit there oh so i don't know why he
04:24
needs to sneak up on them
04:26
yeah that's a really good point are they
04:28
actually yellow stones or are they urine
04:29
coverage
04:30
um it was just called stone national
04:33
park before
04:35
well this is the thing that so when they
04:37
do it in the experiments with the
04:39
snowballs they they also use human feces
04:41
and they have to
04:42
use used toilet paper i think because
04:44
they say well we're going to do this in
04:45
a safe biodegradable way rather than
04:47
just
04:47
pooing into a snowball yeah that's
04:50
interesting i think i would take the poo
04:52
and then put the snowball around it
04:53
that's how you do that
04:54
who went to the snowball yeah yes well
04:58
everyone's got different methods james
04:59
and we'll see whose is more effective
05:01
i don't think you'd be very good at this
05:02
andy i'm lethal in a snowball fight
05:08
you have to wait for the other team to
05:09
contract dysentery though don't you
05:12
meanwhile you're being pelted it's a
05:14
long technique james but
05:15
come the next snowball match in two days
05:17
they are gonna lose
05:18
[Laughter]
05:20
so the idea with this moose suit is that
05:23
they wanted to sneak up
05:24
on the moose in order to get close
05:26
enough um by
05:27
tricking the moose into thinking they
05:29
were fellow moose
05:31
and uh so this is who he did do it with
05:33
his wife
05:34
who's uh written up in all the articles
05:36
as miss cunningham
05:38
so miss cunningham and dr berger got
05:40
inside the moose suit she was the back
05:42
he was the front
05:43
and they walked up to the moose and i
05:44
don't think the moose took to them too
05:46
well
05:46
uh from what i really did oh he said it
05:48
worked quite well in the end he managed
05:50
five successful deposits
05:52
um but maybe they didn't like it at
05:53
first did they make it realistic
05:56
did they push the real wolf droppings
05:59
that they were testing the moose with
06:00
out of the back end of their costume
06:01
moose no because they don't want the
06:03
moose to think that wolves look like
06:05
moose that all wolves come disguised as
06:08
that yeah it's a wolf in uh
06:10
in moose clothes clothing yeah so the
06:12
moose i was saying it's just a human
06:14
in moose clothing to mean and who's
06:17
yeah this is just a
06:19
way to really confuse a lot of moose
06:21
isn't it
06:22
yeah but the moose wouldn't be able to
06:24
make the connection between the poo
06:25
they'd seen coming out and think smell
06:26
it and think oh that's what
06:28
that's of course they would that's what
06:30
animals do all the time
06:31
animals are always smelling poos and
06:33
being able to recognize other animals
06:36
but they i don't think that a moose is
06:38
clever enough i'm sorry if this is
06:39
slandering the moose community
06:41
to see a scientist dressed as a moose
06:43
pushing a wolf poo
06:44
out of a fake moose costume and then go
06:46
over and sniff it and think
06:48
that's a dangerous animal but do you not
06:49
see that they might be confused
06:51
[Laughter]
06:55
no one's debating that
06:58
but this is so you ask if this was
06:59
realistic and um
07:01
i guess she was quite a good costume
07:02
designer because star wars is quite big
07:04
um but it was made of styrofoam and
07:07
cloth and a lot of them seem to be made
07:08
of styrofoam so scientists quite often
07:11
want to sneak up on
07:12
animals for various reasons and
07:13
styrofoam seems to be material of choice
07:17
so someone this year in montana uh
07:19
dressed up as a grizzly bear
07:21
in glacier national park in montana to
07:24
try and scare mountain goats
07:25
and again styrofoam costume right and is
07:28
that to train the goats to be afraid
07:30
of bears yes wow that's good it's
07:33
because
07:34
do you know why they've stopped being
07:35
afraid of predators generally
07:37
sorry what animals do we talk about this
07:38
is mountain goats mountain goats is it
07:40
because there aren't enough predators
07:41
around to be afraid of
07:43
we're back on um urine and feces it's
07:46
due to human urine so there was a piece
07:48
in the new york times last week
07:49
about how in this national park uh all
07:52
the mountain goats are flocking towards
07:54
where humans go because they we
07:56
along all the trekking tracks and the
07:58
wii's full of salt and goats love salt
08:00
so human urine creates salt licks
08:02
and so now they've just stopped being
08:03
nervous about predators because they
08:04
spend so much time around humans
08:06
so how do they scare them do they just
08:07
run up to them and do they rip them
08:09
apart with their
08:10
bear costume hands that's not scaring so
08:13
much that is scary
08:15
you wouldn't say terrible news someone
08:17
recently got scared by a bear and then
08:19
you read the small print it turns out
08:20
they got torn to pieces by it
08:23
but it's poorer encore all the other
08:25
goats would be very scared
08:27
that's true yeah if you invited all the
08:29
goats to an event
08:30
yeah so there's going to be a massive
08:31
urine lump for you all to lick and then
08:33
a bear turns up and rips ever rips the
08:35
coat to pieces you stop licking urine
08:36
lumps yeah and also
08:37
sorry is poor encourage a laser ultra a
08:40
real phrase that people use
08:41
i was i was quite scared by that phrase
08:43
yeah me too um
08:44
i saw i thought you just messed up what
08:46
you were saying but you carried on
08:48
i was gonna address it after the podcast
08:50
you're right mate
08:52
it's a french phrase you it's obviously
08:54
a french fries it's an english podcast
08:57
oh yeah i forgot that sorry i was
08:59
thinking of my other podcast
09:00
are you actually a frenchman in an andy
09:02
costume
09:03
[Laughter]
09:05
hey um we lost and sorry i want to tell
09:08
you about
09:09
that oh yeah sorry yeah yeah it's a
09:11
phrase so we know what it means oh you
09:13
don't yeah yeah yeah
09:14
yeah we know what that means but for the
09:16
people at home
09:18
you explained that anyway because you
09:20
explained what would happen with the
09:21
bear
09:22
killing one goat in there yeah i know
09:24
but i just think dan's being a bit cocky
09:26
there so
09:26
we definitely know what he means when he
09:27
didn't know what language it was a
09:28
second ago
09:32
so we uh we lost a iconic man in a suit
09:35
this week um the sad passing
09:38
of a man called haruo nakajima
09:41
who was for the first 12 godzilla movies
09:44
godzilla
09:46
spent his the first well spent a large
09:48
chunk of his career
09:49
inside the same godzilla suit so they
09:52
use the same actor he's like andy circus
09:54
for uh the lord of the rings
09:56
trilogy you know he's just used as the
09:57
cgi guy he was the same guy in every
10:00
suit
10:00
my face then when you said andy circus
10:03
in lord of the rings was the same as
10:04
your face when abby said the french
10:06
friends
10:07
so andy circus was uh gollum in um
10:11
lord of the rings he wasn't in a suit
10:12
was he because i i think i've seen clips
10:14
of that and
10:14
he's like a cgi motion right guys so and
10:18
he also is
10:19
uh the chief ape in the planet of the
10:21
apes films yes he basically is
10:22
and what else does tin tin he's um
10:25
captain
10:26
haddock and he's something else in king
10:29
kong king kong he is king kong
10:34
but i would go and see a circus show
10:37
which was andy circus
10:39
as all the animals that andy circus has
10:40
played over the course of his career
10:42
and they're all andy circus in different
10:43
costumes what about he was in a little
10:45
dora
10:46
as one of the bad guys would you include
10:48
that yeah 100
10:49
okay but anyway so um
10:52
this guy was famous in japan for being
10:55
godzilla and he was in it for 12 movies
10:57
um he's just passed away age
10:59
88 and in order for him to properly
11:02
understand how godzilla might
11:04
move he spent a lot of time at the zoo
11:07
watching the elephants and bears to see
11:09
how they walked and how they
11:10
so he claimed that he did method acting
11:12
on on how godzilla would exist he took
11:14
it really seriously
11:15
um yeah so we lost him this week a very
11:17
iconic man in a suit
11:19
on star wars as well sort of in costume
11:21
news of star wars um for a very long
11:24
time
11:24
they lost obi-wan kenobi's robe
11:28
the one that alec guinness wears in the
11:30
movies and so
11:31
um it was a shame because it's such an
11:33
iconic thing they obviously didn't
11:34
realize at the time how iconic it would
11:36
become over the years
11:37
um but it was found in 2005 and
11:40
it was in the shop warehouse of this
11:42
company called
11:43
angels that does um costume lending for
11:46
movies and for
11:47
halloween costumes and so on so yeah
11:50
angels in fact there used to be one or
11:52
there
11:52
still might be one which is soho yeah
11:53
just around the corner from us and um
11:56
uh yeah they found it in there and it
11:58
spent
11:59
the sort of 30 years that it's been
12:00
missing being rented out during
12:02
halloween
12:03
yeah for people dressing as monks
12:06
so it would be a fancy dress costume it
12:08
made it into a few movies unknowingly
12:10
like the mummy it's in the mummy
12:12
yeah so this is in 2005 they found it
12:15
again and
12:16
um yeah there was someone working there
12:17
was like this feels like this is not
12:19
your regular
12:20
monkey how did they know it was his did
12:21
it have his name tag in the background
12:23
so yeah i couldn't find that detail um
12:26
what i do know is is that
12:27
the um the creator of the costumes the
12:30
original star wars costume designer
12:32
different to the one you're talking
12:32
about anna
12:33
he verified that it was that he said
12:35
yeah so there must have been something
12:36
on it to identify it
12:38
angels is amazing though i didn't know
12:40
this place exists it basically supplies
12:42
costumes for all the best films so
12:45
three of the five nominees this year for
12:47
best costume
12:48
uh all the costumes came from this place
12:50
angels it's been supplying
12:52
um a hollywood film costume since 1940
12:55
since the 1940s so i think its first
12:57
oscar was in 1948 for hamlet
13:00
and its most recent is the grand
13:01
budapest hotel and it's just this one
13:03
place in london that everyone goes to
13:04
get costumes and it supplied my um
13:07
costume a few years ago in 2012 when i
13:09
went as a mayan
13:10
did it yeah that wasn't in the article i
13:12
read absolutely
13:13
no it will be now they'll do an update
13:16
that's got to go in
13:18
um costumes yeah yeah uh did you see in
13:20
the news this week
13:22
that in game of thrones um jon snow's
13:25
cape
13:25
is made out of an ikea rug
13:27
[Laughter]
13:30
that is so funny to present the channel
13:32
4 news oh
13:34
no here we go deliberate ignorance
13:37
fianna
13:38
um i actually um i've never seen it but
13:40
do they all have capes with the
13:42
quintessentially ikea type patterns on
13:44
them that's the um
13:46
the ladder that's going up the wall is
13:47
just a lot of billy buck cases
13:49
that's really annoying because there's
13:50
one bit missing and that's the key scene
13:52
in the tv series yeah
13:54
and the other big game of thrones news
13:56
is that
13:57
there was a big battle this week not too
13:58
much for spoiler and it featured half of
14:01
all the stunt
14:02
performers in the uk whoa most of them
14:05
were set on fire
14:07
and they they beat the world record for
14:09
most people set on fire at one time
14:13
presumably the officially recorded most
14:16
people on fire well guinness doesn't
14:18
recognize the record
14:20
but they people in the industry kind of
14:21
know what the record was they think it
14:23
was
14:23
there were 13 burning actors in saving
14:26
private ryan
14:26
okay and in braveheart there were 18
14:28
people who were partially burned
14:30
okay they were kind of the record okay
14:31
they've gone up to
14:33
20 people set on fire at the same time
14:35
or 73 people set on fire over the course
14:38
of a show
14:39
bloody hell are they all okay they are
14:42
but it's quite weird because they put
14:44
this gel on you and they set fire to you
14:45
and this the gel kind of keeps the heat
14:47
away from you
14:48
but you can't breathe while it's
14:49
happening otherwise you breathe in the
14:50
fire
14:51
so you have to hold your breath for like
14:53
30 seconds
14:54
uh and it's like doing an underwater
14:56
scene apart from it's much more
14:57
dangerous because if you breathe in
14:58
you're just going to breathe in fire
14:59
this is insane surely we have cgi that
15:02
can replicate fire that doesn't involve
15:04
people having to inhale
15:05
flames i think the old ways are the best
15:07
yeah
15:08
it's it's exactly the opposite of an
15:10
underwater scene james
15:12
let's just sort of pick you up on that
15:15
yeah
15:16
you're right but yeah and apparently one
15:18
big problem is after it's
15:20
finished after you they've put you out
15:21
you kind of lie on the floor
15:23
and you have to lie there for a few
15:24
minutes because if you stand up you
15:26
might get reignited by accident and
15:27
that's one of the
15:28
most dangerous things because there's a
15:30
lot of fire around and
15:32
this is really this sounds like a
15:33
ridiculous program they don't have any
15:35
of that on the channel four news
15:38
well the one good thing is that ikea
15:40
stuff is often flame so that
15:42
might be a
15:43
good you know use for that that's good
15:45
you might watch one
15:46
so jon snow could have put everyone out
15:48
with his cape
15:49
one by one
15:56
okay it is time for fact number two and
15:58
that is james okay my fact this week
16:00
is that switzerland has 18 living
16:04
ex-presidents okay
16:08
i think that's quite a lot it's huge
16:10
yeah because how many ex-prime ministers
16:11
have we got four or five
16:12
yeah four we've got major blair brown
16:15
cameron
16:16
that's it yeah yeah yeah as far as i
16:18
could see
16:19
to come up in a sort of runner-up in
16:21
that uh is italy with prime ministers
16:23
it looks like they've got 10. wow yeah
16:26
but italy goes through um governments
16:29
like i go through pants
16:31
once every couple of years but with a
16:34
huge amount of corruption along the way
16:35
[Laughter]
16:39
but switzerland it is a bit of a cheat
16:41
because their presidency is very unusual
16:44
and they only have like a one-year
16:46
president each time and it rotates with
16:48
everyone who's in the cabinet and so all
16:51
you have to do is get
16:52
elected into the cabinet and then wait
16:55
your turn until everyone else has become
16:56
president and then you'll automatically
16:58
become president
16:59
and also there's no maximum number of
17:01
times that you can be president so
17:03
you can just sit there and it's like the
17:05
record is six times
17:06
and there are quite a few people who are
17:08
currently in the cabinet who are just
17:09
waiting for another go
17:11
yeah but they're doing other stuff as
17:12
well no
17:15
just sitting there in the mountains but
17:18
you don't get any extra power at all as
17:20
president do you so they've just got
17:21
this rotating council of seven who are
17:23
all exactly on a par
17:24
and then you just get to be cool
17:25
president for a year it's like a
17:26
children's game it's a bit like i don't
17:28
know
17:28
if this is like this but it sounds a bit
17:30
like uh do they have like a council in
17:33
star wars which is a bit like that like
17:34
a council of jedi's
17:36
oh the council of jedi's yes yeah yeah
17:38
there's a thing like that
17:39
yeah yeah that's in the prequel it's in
17:41
phantom menace so
17:42
um that's about samuel jackson that's
17:45
the one if you're gonna watch one that's
17:46
the one
17:47
um samuel l jackson and um
17:51
yoda there's a new uh i think it's a new
17:53
species of bat
17:54
that has been named after yoda yes and
17:57
um
17:58
there was a headline about it in the
17:59
times uh a few days ago and it said
18:02
named after yoda comma new bat has been
18:05
that was the headline
18:05
in the time so the president
18:09
is um what you might call primus
18:11
interpares which obviously i don't need
18:13
to explain what that is to dan
18:14
uh but it is it's the first among equals
18:17
so everyone's equal but they're kind of
18:19
they take the ceremonial you know it's
18:22
like dan hosting the podcast
18:23
yeah yeah there's a bit more not quite
18:28
like that
18:29
i would say dan's a fourth among equals
18:34
and they can go on state visits but
18:36
technically they don't call them state
18:38
visits because
18:39
of this equality between all of the
18:41
cabinet and so if one of them came to
18:43
britain on a state visit we would call
18:45
it
18:45
that but they wouldn't call it that they
18:47
just call it a foreign visit
18:48
i think it would be funny if all seven
18:50
of them had to come and just
18:51
sit on the same chair whenever they had
18:53
to do a state visit
18:55
i would watch that and they have to
18:56
answer in one voice when they're
18:58
answering questions on the press like in
18:59
that improv game
19:00
yeah at the same time or the other
19:02
improv game where you say one word at a
19:04
time yeah i could do it
19:06
so do you think that's how they decide
19:07
policy is they play that one word at a
19:09
time game
19:10
let's let's try it for british policy we
19:13
should make yetis
19:17
illegal there we go we've got a policy
19:19
already sorry
19:22
you screwed yourself there yeah that's
19:24
why they've never been seen
19:27
um no it's incredible so you said yeah
19:29
two people have held the post six times
19:31
one of them the record is being a
19:32
cabinet minister for 31 years
19:35
yeah wow 31 years just sitting in the
19:37
cabinet they're not just doing that
19:39
they're they're making policy they're
19:41
working very hard absolutely
19:43
no one's disputing the might of the
19:45
swiss state
19:46
i think it's important that we say that
19:48
but they yeah they maintain their other
19:49
job right like the president in 2014
19:52
their job was also being foreign
19:53
minister they didn't stop being foreign
19:54
minister
19:55
that took up most of their time that's
19:57
their main job as it were presidency was
19:59
a sort of
19:59
sideline so i've been researching
20:02
ex-presidents
20:03
in general okay so did you know that joe
20:05
biden can never drive a car again
20:08
but he's not yeah no but he has been
20:11
ex-vice president right so ex-presidents
20:13
and vice presidents are not allowed to
20:15
drive
20:15
after they leave the white house but are
20:17
you using ex-presidents as a catch-all
20:19
term to refer to presidents and vice
20:20
presidents
20:21
because i'm sure that is what the vice
20:22
president says
20:25
i've been the vice president of the
20:27
united states of america
20:29
it's very useful on the lecture circuit
20:30
um and this isn't a law
20:32
either but it is a secret service rule
20:34
as it were as in the secret service says
20:36
well we really think you shouldn't drive
20:37
and most people basically stick to it
20:39
because someone else is driving you
20:40
around i guess but george bush uh w
20:43
drives around his family farm with a
20:45
truck and that's about as far as he's
20:46
allowed to drive
20:47
are they looked after for the rest of
20:48
their life by the secret service you get
20:50
secret service protection for the rest
20:52
of your life
20:52
right is that the same with prime
20:54
ministers do you think
20:56
i think if you started a war in iraq you
20:58
have a lot of security
21:00
forever i think if you're gordon brown
21:02
you just
21:03
know a policeman might ring out once a
21:06
month to check you're all right
21:07
because david cameron was at wilderness
21:09
when we were there wasn't he yeah
21:10
and he had some goons around apparently
21:12
he did yeah he did
21:14
but i missed him ah i don't know we
21:16
normally
21:18
catch up at those things
21:21
um guys is this something everyone knows
21:23
about switzerland
21:24
that what is the capital oh
21:28
i think there are five whoa yeah
21:31
i've headed your bets to the pub quiz i
21:33
think it's like the cabinet
21:34
there are loads of capitals and none of
21:36
them is more important oh
21:37
or they each become the capital on a
21:40
rotation
21:41
nice um you're all wrong it doesn't have
21:44
a capital i didn't that's why i didn't
21:45
answer it because there is none
21:47
okay so obviously everyone thinks that
21:48
bern is the capital of switzerland but
21:50
i just had no idea that it has no
21:53
official capital so its constitution
21:55
doesn't mention it
21:56
it's that de facto capital isn't it it's
21:58
a de facto capital but um there was a
22:00
committee was set up by this seven
22:01
person council in 2002
22:03
to actually start work on making bern
22:06
the proper capital
22:07
um and then it was suspended in 2004 and
22:10
not resumed since because it was too
22:11
difficult a job
22:12
all i'm saying is if you're in a pub
22:14
quiz and they ask you that question go
22:15
for my answer not anna's
22:17
because one you'll get the point and two
22:20
it'll take you a long time to write
22:21
about this council in 2002 and
22:23
yeah and they don't give you much room
22:24
sometimes on them sorry is this paper
22:26
am i saying burning i think burn in the
22:28
pub quiz yeah but
22:29
if i answered that well really geneva is
22:31
the financial capital and lausanne is
22:33
the industrial capital and burn is the
22:34
political capital and there are a couple
22:35
of others would i get the point no
22:38
you can only put one answer down because
22:40
otherwise you could put every word
22:42
that's ever been invented
22:43
as the answer to every question they
22:46
never give you that long
22:47
[Laughter]
22:49
just because this is about switzerland's
22:51
government it is unbelievable their
22:53
system of referenda
22:54
and so in the past 20 years they've had
22:57
more than 180
22:59
referendums or referenda um the
23:02
runner-up is
23:03
ireland which has had 22 and latvia then
23:06
which has had eight they just have them
23:07
constantly
23:08
about everything yeah it's bizarre and
23:10
one of the ones they had for instance
23:11
was the one
23:12
in 1959 as to whether women should be
23:15
allowed to vote
23:16
and they voted that down so that was a
23:18
referendum that only men could
23:20
take part in because women still
23:21
couldn't vote in 1959 most men in
23:23
switzerland voted against women getting
23:25
the vote and they didn't get it until
23:26
1971.
23:27
so all you need is a hundred thousand
23:30
signatures
23:31
um from registered voters in order to
23:33
have the referendum so that's why
23:35
it can happen so easily it's it's just
23:37
people need to sign up
23:38
there was a party that tried to have a
23:39
referendum called the apppp
23:42
um and they were trying to ban the use
23:45
of powerpoint
23:46
uh in switzerland um and
23:49
this the app claimed that 2.1 billion
23:52
swiss francs was being wasted
23:54
on powerpoint presentations from the
23:56
sort of like taking people away from
23:58
their jobs to see powerpoint
23:59
presentations and so on
24:00
they said 85 percent of workforce people
24:03
uh
24:04
saw no point in a powerpoint
24:05
presentation did they have a um petition
24:07
about that then
24:08
yeah i think they did and i think they
24:09
failed to get
24:11
the hundred thousand people to sign up
24:13
what i was thinking is that their
24:15
powerpoint
24:15
presentation for short would be the app
24:18
ppp
24:22
that is great that's like someone trying
24:24
to do my initials and then really
24:26
stammering suddenly
24:28
so when you become a member of the party
24:30
you have to buy the party manifesto
24:32
which is set out in this book called the
24:33
powerpoint fallacy
24:35
and it's authored by the guy who found
24:37
the party who's called uh
24:39
matthias poem um and he was asked in an
24:42
interview
24:42
uh so is this just a promotional gimmick
24:45
for your book
24:46
and he said yes it is a tool to promote
24:48
my book
24:50
and then he said there's like further
24:51
reasons for him doing it as well but
24:52
like yeah
24:53
basically it was set up to sell his book
24:55
i guess oh yeah fair enough
24:56
at least he's honest yeah but that
24:58
existed that was a party wow
25:00
well a party one guy one guy
25:03
that's true yeah i don't know how many
25:04
people's a lot of my parties are like
25:06
that
25:09
[Applause]
25:13
okay it is time to move on to fact
25:15
number three and that is my fact
25:17
my fact this week is that a new zealand
25:20
scientist is planning to hunt
25:21
for the loch ness monster inside of a
25:24
cup
25:26
quick quick search or big cup
25:29
yeah true actually it's it's um it's
25:31
quite small messy
25:33
yes oh yeah yeah no it's a big it's it's
25:35
a large cup it's it's a couple liters
25:37
um it's a few cups basically the idea of
25:40
this
25:41
is that a new zealand scientist called
25:43
professor neil gemmell
25:44
has been promoting this thing called e
25:48
dna or edna and the idea is that we can
25:52
now
25:53
taking samples of water from various
25:56
lakes and oceans and so on
25:57
can analyze the dna that's found inside
26:00
each cup and they're able to diagnose
26:02
what animals are in there what animals
26:04
aren't in there if there's meant to be
26:05
in there it's it's a sort of new system
26:07
of being able to count
26:08
up fish um and any any ocean life
26:11
uh of a specific area with accuracy from
26:14
within just a bit of water
26:16
the idea behind going to look for nessie
26:18
is he's effectively doing this as a
26:20
publicity stunt to promote the idea of
26:22
e-dna
26:23
this basically got picked up by the
26:24
papers this was never his intention
26:26
when he announced the idea that he
26:27
wanted to do more stuff with edna
26:29
uh cryptozoologists got in contact with
26:31
him and said could you do this for the
26:32
loch ness
26:33
and he said you probably could but i'm
26:35
not planning to do that
26:36
the paper is kind of reported that he
26:37
said yes that's what i'm planning on
26:39
doing
26:40
and as a result when he'd go to schools
26:42
and everywhere else to talk about it
26:43
children would ask him specifically
26:45
about loch ness and
26:46
using loch ness he started explaining
26:48
the procedures and people just way more
26:50
interested generally so
26:51
he's now up for the idea of doing the
26:53
loch ness thing because people are
26:54
actually listening it's insane you have
26:56
to do it via the loch ness monster but
26:58
you know what he should try next is
26:59
organizing a swiss referendum
27:01
[Laughter]
27:02
well the other thing about it is that
27:04
there's a now a massive library
27:06
of fish dna because obviously it's no
27:09
good finding a bit of dna
27:10
and then thinking well what did this
27:12
come from when you don't know the
27:13
dna of let's say a cod so there was a
27:16
massive drive
27:17
organized by a scientist who is called
27:19
jessie alcebel
27:21
they did 500 expeditions and they got
27:23
basically
27:24
thousands and thousands of specimens of
27:25
animals from all over the oceans
27:27
so now they have this huge library of
27:29
tens of thousands of fish dna samples
27:31
and now they can actually match it up to
27:33
something
27:33
so that was the big fingerprinting drive
27:35
that's good yeah because otherwise
27:36
you've just got a bit of dna
27:38
that's completely useful i don't know it
27:40
could be messy yeah sure
27:42
could be anything yeah who really needs
27:44
some kind of references to me
27:46
it's a hard thing to research because i
27:48
kept getting articles about um
27:50
like world's oldest woman dies you just
27:52
keep getting articles about people
27:53
called edna don't you
27:54
yeah yeah so one of the ways this is
27:57
going to be
27:58
important is because we need to be able
28:00
to keep count of our fish and know where
28:01
they are because fish stocks are being
28:02
depleted
28:03
and we have a bunch of ways of counting
28:05
fish i was reading an article i think it
28:07
was in the atlantic
28:09
about how a lot of scientists and
28:10
fishermen still just do the traditional
28:12
way of counting fish
28:13
which is basically that you're on a ship
28:16
um you've
28:17
what's this just a traditional way must
28:19
be just one one
28:20
two two fish two fish three fish four
28:23
yeah
28:24
it is this but they spend months and
28:26
months out there so in massachusetts
28:28
these guys go out in a boat
28:29
and they have a conveyor belt set up on
28:31
their boat and they get this huge net
28:33
and then they plop
28:34
all these fish onto the conveyor belt
28:36
and then someone's job is to pick a fish
28:38
off a competitive conveyor belt shout
28:39
what species it is
28:41
throw it into the right species pile
28:43
someone else's job is to like shove it
28:44
up against a measuring board
28:46
and automatically a magnet measures how
28:48
long it is take a mug shot of it
28:50
yeah it's exactly like that yeah but
28:52
then do we eat these fish or do they
28:54
throw them back on they throw them back
28:55
in well they
28:56
weigh them so the question is how do
28:58
they know that it's not the same
28:59
you know the next time yeah what have
29:01
you done already hey jerry this one
29:03
looks a bit like that one from three
29:05
weeks ago
29:07
are you throwing them back alive still
29:09
yeah so they're putting them on the
29:10
conveyor belt
29:11
still alive they're shoving them up
29:13
against the measuring boards still alive
29:15
they plop them on a set of weighing
29:16
skills still alive and then they're sent
29:18
back down and no one believes them yeah
29:23
this is you're right that's the ufo of
29:25
the fish world isn't it yeah
29:27
so the reason that it's really hard to
29:29
break out of this system which is
29:31
actually not as efficient as for
29:32
instance using a drone to count all the
29:34
fish
29:34
or maybe using a dna monitoring system
29:37
is that
29:37
it's kind of like the thing andy
29:39
mentioned it's a referencing problem so
29:41
because we started counting fish this
29:42
way in the 1950s or 60s
29:45
the only way we know how many fish there
29:47
are compared to before
29:49
is by comparing it to the previous
29:50
account right so we just have to keep on
29:52
doing this system if we suddenly do a
29:54
new system we'll find way more fish and
29:55
we won't know how to compare it to how
29:57
many there were before
29:58
so we're stuck with it we're stuck with
29:59
guys what we need to do is come up with
30:01
a new system
30:02
and then do them both together for a few
30:04
years
30:06
which is a really good idea james and
30:07
then compare the difference
30:09
yeah you should get on the committee
30:12
um i have a cryptozoology effect right
30:15
because we're on nessie
30:16
yeah so this is a story from the bbc
30:18
this is north carolina last week and it
30:20
was about bigfoot dan oh
30:22
i know there was a sighting of bigfoot
30:24
yeah hugely exciting a group of
30:26
hunters called bigfoot911 they said
30:28
they'd seen bigfoot
30:29
only for a local shaman to get in touch
30:32
saying it was me
30:33
yeah i was walking around in a suit made
30:35
of animal skins
30:37
and he's called gawain um but the man
30:39
who wrote the group said on facebook i
30:41
want to address the recent revelation
30:42
from the gentleman that stated that i
30:44
saw him in the woods
30:45
this is quite a fascinating story but
30:46
there are a few problems with it number
30:48
one
30:48
the creature that i saw was eight foot
30:51
tall with stringy matted hair the
30:52
gentleman in the picture does not appear
30:54
tall
30:55
two the creature moved with speed
30:57
unmatched by any human
30:59
so but the thing is that gawain mcgregor
31:01
was there looking for bigfoot himself
31:04
yes he wanders around dressing in animal
31:06
skins reciting what he says is a
31:08
sasquatch prayer
31:09
and he says that he himself has met
31:11
bigfoot before
31:12
but has now been mistaken for bigfoot
31:14
very good are they just seeing each
31:16
other constantly and thinking they're
31:17
citing bigfoot
31:20
they did find nessie this year did they
31:22
uh they found a nessie
31:24
it was a nine metre model of the loch
31:26
ness monster built in 1969 for a
31:28
sherlock holmes movie
31:30
and sank to the bottom of loch ness and
31:33
they found it with an underwater robot
31:35
they took a photo of it
31:36
that's amazing that's really cool yeah
31:38
that's awesome
31:39
did they get did anyone get excited
31:41
initially or were they all sensible
31:43
people who
31:44
indeed
31:47
do you know you must know about robert
31:50
reins
31:50
um the nessie hunter who i'd never heard
31:54
of
31:54
but is really cool so he's a proper
31:57
scientist
31:58
he died not that long ago you're already
32:00
looking skeptical andy
32:01
but he's made he made massive
32:02
contributions to science in america
32:05
but was also obsessed with the loch ness
32:06
monster and convinced it existed
32:08
um so he had 800 patents
32:12
um he developed this uh way to improve
32:14
radar and sonar images and now it's used
32:17
in patriot missiles
32:18
which they use in the military he found
32:20
the titanic wreck
32:21
and he found the wreck of the bismarck
32:23
he was one of the people on that team
32:25
who uncovered the titanic um he made
32:27
massive leaps in ultrasound imaging
32:30
he contributed to like eye surgery but
32:32
he's just remembered for the fact that
32:33
he was obsessed with the
32:34
less monster and so for instance he
32:37
hired a perfumer once to concoct the
32:39
kind of scent
32:40
that would attract a creature like the
32:42
loch ness monster
32:43
and he trained dolphins to find it so he
32:45
got cameras on dolphins
32:47
and trained them to be able to find
32:48
nessie um but yeah it's so weird he's
32:50
this really cool
32:51
legit guy he once played a violin duet
32:53
with albert einstein
32:55
he was a harvard scientist but who also
32:58
kept on trying to find the loch ness
33:00
monster it's weird isn't it that's his
33:02
word this guy's my hero
33:03
yeah he painted a form of chopsticks
33:05
with hinges on them as well he's doubly
33:07
my hero
33:08
um i was reading that in this is about
33:11
in 2012
33:12
and i couldn't find an update on this
33:14
but um in america
33:15
louisiana um christian schools
33:19
that are sort of you know um sort of uh
33:22
believe that dinosaurs existed at the
33:24
same time as humans creationists so
33:26
creationists sort of schools
33:27
um they started teaching that the loch
33:30
ness monster is real
33:31
a solid scientific fact to help back up
33:33
all of their
33:34
creationist uh stuff so there's an ace
33:36
textbook
33:37
um this is uh biology uh 1099
33:41
accelerated christian
33:42
education inc who published it and it
33:44
reads are dinosaurs alive today
33:46
scientists are becoming more convinced
33:47
of their existence
33:48
have you heard of the loch ness monster
33:50
in scotland nessie for short has been
33:52
recorded on sonar
33:53
from a small submarine described by
33:55
eyewitnesses and photographed by others
33:56
nessie appears to be a plesiosaur
33:59
so that's actually taught as fact within
34:01
these schools it's quite cool i didn't
34:03
know
34:03
that that's not quite cool it's not cool
34:06
yeah the alicia saws i don't think
34:07
they're dinosaurs really
34:09
yeah so that is a massive mistake
34:11
they've made there yeah they're not
34:12
dinosaurs no but in the same way that
34:14
pterodactyls were not dinosaurs yeah but
34:15
don't put sore on the end of your name
34:17
and
34:17
not be a diner dino is not on the front
34:21
of the name
34:22
yeah but sores on the end of everything
34:24
also tyrannosaur is a dinosaur yeah yeah
34:27
it's like
34:27
koala bears and not bears as everyone on
34:31
twitter has been telling me
34:39
okay it is time for our final fact of
34:41
the show and that is
34:43
andy my fact is that your liver grows
34:45
and shrinks by
34:46
40 every 24 hours i am in love
34:50
with the liver yeah it's great wow what
34:53
a thing okay so
34:54
uh this was based on a new york times
34:56
article i read it's just a sort of
34:57
feature on the
34:58
it wasn't really a news article as as
35:00
such no breaking news you've got a lever
35:02
but
35:03
it is so cool so the lever grows and
35:05
drinks every day
35:06
it's got its own internal clock so it
35:08
knows what time to do it
35:10
and it's it grows and shrinks in
35:12
accordance with
35:13
day and night more or less so they
35:16
tested mice
35:17
and mice their liver expands after dark
35:20
and then it shrinks back when daylight
35:22
is approaching but that's because mice
35:23
are nocturnal
35:25
and obviously humans are diurnal so our
35:27
liver grows
35:28
in the morning and then it shrinks at
35:30
night do you think it depends like when
35:31
you go to bed so i go to bed extremely
35:33
late
35:34
and dan goes back relatively early yeah
35:36
so do you think his liver expands
35:38
earlier than mine maybe so your livers
35:40
might be different sizes now
35:42
just because of your own body clocks
35:43
that's cool does uh
35:45
would my liver get jet lag when i go to
35:47
australia i think
35:49
all of you gets jet lagged does that
35:51
mean that there are british people
35:52
walking around
35:53
australia with tiny litters getting
35:56
pickled on the beer
35:57
much quicker i think that's what we're
35:58
saying yeah and australians here have
36:00
massive livers no that's not what we're
36:02
saying
36:03
they have the same problem don't they
36:05
they would have the same problem yeah
36:07
so it's the size of a chihuahua at which
36:10
stage
36:11
chihuahuas don't grow and shrink 40
36:13
during the day
36:14
full size small full-sized chihuahua
36:17
hanging on the livers at full size
36:18
chihuahuas are
36:19
like they're big right well that's not
36:21
as big as a great day
36:22
i said a small two hour day i know but
36:24
just picture it very quickly a chihuahua
36:26
inside me right now
36:27
i'm in a really tiny chocolate i think
36:29
you mean a chihuahua without the tail i
36:30
think
36:31
when you picture it they're the size of
36:33
the mexican state of chihuahua
36:35
right okay that is uh based on a mental
36:38
floss article so that
36:40
is a metaphors are very reliable so i
36:42
don't know yeah
36:43
yeah i believe that a chihuahua yeah oh
36:47
please okay chihuahuas aren't that big
36:50
they're bigger than that
36:52
yeah anna's gesturing a really tiny dog
36:54
with your hands
36:55
it's a mouse dressed up as a chihuahua
37:00
yeah i just think it's amazing yeah it's
37:02
incredible um
37:03
it is very awesome is it thought to be
37:05
because it's so that it can get used to
37:07
rejuvenating
37:08
is that right so the if it's you know
37:10
flooded with lots of poisonous stuff
37:12
at least it's able to like shrink and
37:13
rebuild itself constantly
37:15
it is like basically a bit of x-men
37:17
hasn't it
37:18
yeah because it's really part of
37:20
everyone's got this part of the body
37:21
that's regenerating all the time
37:22
yeah oh yeah so we're like part
37:24
wolverine just in our liver
37:26
yeah and we've mentioned before oh
37:27
wolverine is all liver
37:30
wow that's good so we've said before
37:32
that if you chop your liver down to a
37:34
quarter of the size
37:35
it will regenerate within a few weeks
37:37
yeah to its full size
37:38
and i think you've said that if you put
37:40
a chihuahua's liver into a great dane it
37:42
will grow to the size of a great danes
37:44
liver yes
37:45
it's mad so you can donate half of your
37:48
liver to somebody
37:50
yeah and they within a few weeks will
37:51
have a full liver and so will you
37:53
so we only need one liver for the whole
37:55
human race really yes
37:57
it's like that greek myth where they
37:59
share one eye but if like you left a bit
38:01
of eye behind in the socket
38:03
and then the eye just multiplied hang on
38:05
doesn't prometheus when he's chained to
38:07
the mountain in the myth
38:08
gets his liver torn out by a bird every
38:10
day and then it grows back
38:12
i think they did nobody so they must
38:14
have known
38:15
hang on they can't how would they know
38:17
how could they know
38:18
so but prometheus gets a liver torn out
38:20
every day and then the next day it's
38:21
grown back and the bird tears it out
38:22
again and that's his punishment yeah
38:23
yeah
38:24
how did they know that they must have
38:26
known i don't think they did
38:27
you think it's a coincidence i think
38:29
it's a coincidence i'm calling it
38:31
so did you know that tim cook you know
38:32
who's the current ceo of apple
38:34
um wanted to donate his liver or 50
38:38
of it to um steve jobs when he needed a
38:40
liver donation
38:41
and tim cook said that he's only been
38:43
shouted at by steve jobs
38:45
three or four times in their entire
38:46
career and they work very closely for
38:48
many many years
38:49
and one of the times was that when he
38:51
knocked in his door and said can i give
38:52
you some of my liver
38:53
and steve jobs said no don't be an idiot
38:56
you shouldn't have to do that for me he
38:57
shouted at him yeah apparently he got
38:59
angry because i think tim cook was
39:00
really insistent i said i
39:02
was in his hand
39:05
oh my god you're tripping it on my floor
39:08
get out of here
39:09
what is this chop liver so
39:12
steve jobs actually had a liver
39:13
transplant and i think 2008
39:16
or we had a liver transplant in the
39:17
2000s and the doctor who transplanted
39:20
his liver later bought his house
39:23
which is quite nice i went on to the old
39:25
qi forums
39:26
um where we do our research for the tv
39:28
show and found a discussion between me
39:30
and andy
39:31
about whether we could eat human livers
39:33
um
39:34
and not die basically because there's an
39:37
old fact that if you eat a polar bear's
39:38
liver you'll die because it's got so
39:40
much vitamin a in it
39:42
and so we worked out how much vitamin a
39:44
there was
39:45
per gram in a human liver which is 575
39:48
international units
39:50
and then how heavy our liver was and
39:52
then what the maximum
39:53
single intake dose for vitamin a was in
39:56
a human
39:57
and we worked out that if you at one and
39:59
a third raw livers in a single sitting
40:02
you would probably die of vitamin a
40:03
poisoning it might be a bit different if
40:06
you cooked it but not too different so
40:07
if hannibal lecter for instance at
40:09
two human livers in one sitting he would
40:11
die of vitamin a poisoning
40:13
but that's why they never show that
40:14
scene in the film because they knew it
40:16
would be unrealistic to show him eating
40:17
two livers yeah well the other thing
40:18
that would be realistic in the
40:20
film is if you eat too much vitamin a
40:22
your body stops being able to store it
40:24
and you turn
40:24
orange so the police should have been
40:27
able to find him by just looking for an
40:29
orange person
40:30
wow did you know that
40:33
you can grow a baby in a liver like
40:36
human baby
40:37
four babies have been born not out of a
40:40
womb
40:41
but out of a liver deliberately or
40:43
ectopically right well
40:45
or nearly so normally it gets fertilized
40:48
moves down
40:49
in the womb sometimes it gets stuck in
40:51
fallopian tube
40:52
problem it's called an ectopic pregnancy
40:54
sometimes
40:55
one in a hundred thousand times
40:59
the egg just falls out of the fallopian
41:01
tube and it wanders off through the body
41:03
in the very very rare cases where the
41:05
the fertilized egg lands
41:07
in the abdomen in the liver it's got a
41:10
massive blood supply there
41:11
the only thing it lacks is the muscular
41:13
wall of the womb so it's not as well
41:15
protected
41:16
but no placenta though so how do they it
41:19
grows
41:20
because again because food comes through
41:21
it this is incredible because it does so
41:23
much the liver does like 500 jobs
41:25
everything it does 500 jobs it's like
41:27
the george osborne of the human body
41:30
and so the last time was in 2003 in
41:32
south africa doctors
41:33
literally went into a woman's liver and
41:35
pulled out a healthy
41:37
weight what that is one of the best
41:40
facts that's incredible
41:41
can you imagine for the baby as well
41:43
half of its day it's flat gets 50
41:46
bigger
41:48
[Music]

hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:22
covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:24
sitting here with james harkin
00:26
alex bell and anna chazinski and once
00:29
again
00:30
we have gathered around the microphones
00:31
with our four favorite facts from the
00:33
last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order here we go
00:37
starting with my fact this week
00:39
my fact is 10 of the ufc
00:43
is owned by the uae
00:46
that is quite surprising so the ufc
00:48
stands for ultimate fighting
00:50
championship yes oh yeah what does uae
00:52
stand for
00:52
united arab emirates and
00:55
10 of the ufc is owned specifically by
01:00
abu dhabi uh it's a company called flash
01:02
entertainment which is
01:03
owned by the government and in 2010 they
01:06
bought 10
01:07
of this company which last year or
01:10
perhaps even early this year was sold
01:12
again for four billion it's a huge
01:14
industry now
01:15
um and they've retained their 10 so yeah
01:17
a government is part of the ultimate
01:19
hardcore fighting machine yeah great so
01:22
let's explain what ufc is for the
01:24
uninitiated
01:25
like me okay well um if you've been
01:28
reading the news
01:29
this week you will see that the biggest
01:31
boxing match for a very long time has
01:33
happened between a man called conor
01:34
mcgregor
01:35
and floyd mayweather when you say has
01:37
happened it's not happened yet in our
01:38
universe has it that's true we're
01:40
recording this on a monday you're
01:41
hearing this from a friday onwards so
01:43
yeah
01:43
it's uh yeah let's take a punt i think
01:45
it's really sad that conor mcgregor died
01:47
within 10 seconds of
01:48
entering the octagon and yeah so conor
01:51
mcgregor is the ufc fighter in this case
01:53
floyd mayweather is the boxer
01:55
and um ufc is a collection of different
01:58
disciplines of martial arts brought
01:59
together
02:00
in a ring known as the octagon and it
02:02
means that when you're fighting an
02:03
opponent
02:04
there are just many different ways that
02:06
you'll be fighting against them
02:07
at different martial arts styles it's no
02:09
holds barred isn't it that was what it
02:11
was originally always marketed yeah they
02:12
used to say there were no rules didn't
02:14
they
02:14
it says on the wikipedia page and it's
02:16
immediately followed by a list of rules
02:17
yeah there's a lot of rules yeah yeah it
02:19
says there are no rules and then
02:20
actually even in its first fight uh it
02:23
banned biting
02:24
eye gouging uh fish hooking head butting
02:26
hair pulling and groin strikes what's
02:28
fish hooking
02:29
fish hooking is when you go for an
02:31
already open cut
02:32
or it's when you do like a right hook
02:34
but with a fish i think with
02:36
a fish like a monty python sketch
02:39
um but it was actually the first two of
02:41
those a band right so
02:42
uh uh biting and eye gouging and the
02:44
other two are all frowned upon and then
02:46
often i think the fighters will agree
02:47
that when there were two fighters that
02:49
had ponytails they agreed not to pull
02:50
each other's hair and stuff because it
02:51
would make a better fight
02:52
but interestingly the the biting and the
02:54
eye gouging are the two headline things
02:56
that are banned and that's the same two
02:57
things that were banned in the ancient
02:58
greek pancration wrestling
03:00
yeah which was like 2000 years ago is
03:02
that deliberate i wonder
03:04
if it is i don't know it's a very
03:05
intellectual sport at ufc yeah
03:07
well yeah i knew nothing about it so
03:09
i'll believe anything you tell me
03:11
invented by plato was it yes yeah
03:14
yeah he was their first champion
03:17
um do you know why it's called the
03:18
octagon um it's got
03:20
eight sides yeah it yeah i framed it
03:23
quite badly the origin of the name the
03:26
octagon
03:26
is a really really bad chuck norris film
03:29
from the 80s
03:30
so the guy who was commissioned to
03:31
design the pitch
03:33
are we calling it the square the ring
03:36
thank you
03:36
pitch the ring in which i will be
03:38
fighting in the pitch
03:40
with george foreman um but yeah this guy
03:42
was commissioned to
03:44
design the ring he was called jason
03:45
cousin and he didn't really know
03:46
anything about fighting or what he was
03:48
supposed to do
03:49
and he just heard of this chuck norris
03:50
film that was about no holds bad
03:52
fighting and it was called the octagon
03:54
so he said sod it let's make it an
03:56
octagon that's so cool it's quite i mean
03:58
it's as good a shape as any right
04:00
in fact you could well you could say
04:02
it's better than a square because
04:03
it's closer to a ring like a ring is a
04:06
something with infinite sides
04:07
yeah and an octagon's got more sides
04:09
than a square compared to infinity
04:11
though
04:11
it's like hardly more on the way to that
04:13
many things they should have a
04:14
dodecahedron
04:16
they should yeah good just for the
04:18
visual if you're listening to this right
04:19
now and you're thinking well what's this
04:21
octagon look like uh it's steel mesh
04:23
all around it and the ring wall as it
04:26
were the steel mesh wall goes up taller
04:28
than the
04:28
let's say yes so they have to be lowered
04:32
in by crane
04:33
uh into the ring yeah um we were saying
04:36
that it's
04:37
quite no holds barred it gets quite
04:39
violent and
04:40
people were kind of outraged in the 90s
04:42
when ultimate fighting and mixed martial
04:44
arts was invented
04:45
and the thing that i think outraged
04:47
people the most or the thing that became
04:48
the epitome of it was the fact that it
04:50
was done with bare knuckles
04:51
so it was bare knuckle fighting so
04:53
people were saying this is so dangerous
04:54
look how barbaric it is
04:56
and with bare knuckles you know that's
04:58
just goes to show how barbaric it is
05:00
and so they banned the bare knuckle
05:02
element of it after a few years and
05:03
added gloves to make it safer
05:05
and in fact that made it much more
05:07
dangerous because the reason that bare
05:08
knuckle
05:09
is better than wearing gloves is that if
05:12
you punch someone super hard with your
05:14
bare knuckle then you basically break
05:15
your fist
05:16
and so most people don't want to punch
05:18
people too hard whereas as soon as you
05:19
got boxing gloves on
05:20
then you can punch someone much much
05:22
harder without damaging yourself so by
05:23
adding
05:24
gloves you kind of save the hands but
05:25
instead you give people much more severe
05:27
brain damage
05:28
that was quite aggressive the way that
05:30
you said that fact because you had a
05:31
fist the whole time
05:32
and you were kind of jabbing the air
05:34
yeah it felt good i could see the
05:36
attraction actually
05:38
there was a study on a few years ago
05:39
where researchers worked out a code for
05:42
how intense somebody smiles and then on
05:44
the day prior to
05:45
uh fight when the fighters have that
05:47
traditional face-off like press
05:48
conferencing
05:49
yeah these researchers watched 152
05:52
different ufc fighters
05:54
and worked out how much they were
05:55
smiling and then they found that the
05:57
more a fighter smiles the more likely
05:59
they are to lose the fight and they
06:00
think it's due to the link of like if
06:01
you smile more you have lower
06:03
testosterone and you're less aggressive
06:04
in nature and
06:05
they worked out that whilst in the short
06:07
term it means they're more likely to
06:08
lose that fight the next day they're not
06:10
more likely to lose all the fights
06:12
coming up so
06:13
it's literally how much you are smiling
06:15
the day before your fight
06:16
the day before your day well this is
06:18
interesting because um conor mcgregor
06:21
has been sparring against these pro
06:23
boxers to sort of get him into shape
06:25
um so one of them has come out
06:28
uh because he he that's he that's great
06:31
thank you
06:32
i just want to say you know
06:33
congratulations mate wish you all
06:35
the luck in your love life uh no he's uh
06:38
he
06:38
sort of was kicked out of the conor
06:40
mcgregor camp and then he revealed a lot
06:42
of the
06:42
process of how he's training and one of
06:44
the things he's doing is he is doing
06:46
long stair-offs with these boxers so he
06:49
just
06:49
he's practicing the stare i just would
06:52
say at his stage i would not be focusing
06:54
on that element of the game i don't care
06:56
how important the stair is but isn't it
06:58
true that we did say a few podcasts ago
07:00
that
07:01
divers professional divers half of their
07:03
job is climbing up to the top
07:04
exactly yes thank you james really half
07:07
of his job is walking to the ring
07:08
this is high if you were diving from a
07:10
high board half your job
07:12
yeah i remember climbing ladders i
07:14
remember it vividly
07:15
it's ingrained in my brain and we use
07:17
the word facts very loosely yeah
07:19
so are you saying half of a fighter's
07:21
job is staring contest yeah if you're
07:23
really good at not blinking though you
07:25
could probably
07:25
win the blinking competition dry out
07:27
your opponent's eyes and then they'd be
07:28
blinded
07:29
it's not a blinking competition it's not
07:32
like chess boxing where you play a bit
07:34
of chess
07:34
and you play a bit of boxing it's like
07:36
you fight for three minutes and then you
07:38
just sit there and stare at someone
07:40
i mean that would i would watch that
07:42
it'd be amazing if he had just like a
07:43
smaller
07:44
uh uh belt for a blinking champion for
07:48
the contest
07:49
but it could be that you have three
07:50
minutes of fighting then you have a
07:51
staring competition and whoever
07:53
wins a staring competition gets one free
07:55
punch
07:56
at the start of the night oh yeah nice
07:59
you should invent that as a sport and
08:01
put it in a non-gun or something and
08:02
play god created something amazing and
08:06
the kicking can be
08:07
really damaging can't it so in i think
08:10
we talked about the fight between
08:11
muhammad ali and antonio enoki before
08:14
so this is a fight that cena is
08:15
basically the precursor to mma to mix
08:17
martial arts and this was when muhammad
08:19
ali took on a japanese wrestler called
08:21
antonio and noki in the
08:23
70s in the 1970s can you say mma
08:27
yeah mma not mm-hmm oh sorry yeah um
08:31
this is the precursor to mma mixed
08:33
martial mma
08:34
wow
08:37
this is the precursor to mixed martial
08:39
arts and this was when muhammad ali
08:41
took on this japanese wrestler called
08:43
anton muhammad alay
08:44
[Laughter]
08:49
anyway the point was muhammad ali and
08:50
antonio enoki had this fight
08:53
um to see which of the disciplines was
08:55
gonna win and
08:56
um enoki caused massive damage to ali so
08:59
basically he spent the whole time lying
09:00
on the floor i think yeah
09:02
almost the entirety of the time he lay
09:03
on the floor and just kicked muhammad
09:04
ali in the shins really hard
09:06
and ali got blood clots after that and i
09:08
think his legs were permanently damaged
09:10
from then on yeah to have surgery and
09:11
stuff because of it but it was called a
09:13
draw
09:14
i think which was good because it meant
09:16
that neither of them had disgraced
09:17
themselves in front of their fans
09:19
yeah and enoki said afterwards that the
09:21
reason he just kicked muhammad ali
09:23
is because ali had such devoted fans
09:26
that he'd been warned if he laid a hand
09:28
on him
09:28
then his fans would kill him so he
09:30
decided to go at him with the feet
09:32
instead yeah do you think when muhammad
09:35
ali's supporters came up to him later
09:37
and tried to attack him he's like no no
09:38
i didn't lay your hands on him i think
09:40
that's exactly what he said
09:43
go back and read the small print of our
09:44
threat
09:45
[Laughter]
09:47
i love that like as fans would be going
09:50
up going hey man we're going to kick
09:52
your ass like no this guy just
09:53
kicked muhammad ali's ass like yeah you
09:55
stand no chance again
09:57
yeah exactly and when the angry mob
09:59
comes down he can just lie on his back
10:00
and kick them
10:03
abu dhabi is not the only investor in
10:06
the ufc there are many other people you
10:09
said they only have 10
10:10
so i'm not surprised exactly other
10:13
people who have a stake in the ufc
10:15
are ll cool jay
10:19
whose name do you know where ll cool j
10:21
comes from no
10:22
it's short for ladies love cool james
10:25
really
10:26
yeah oh that's very cool has anyone ever
10:28
called you that james
10:30
no you sound like you tried to make that
10:32
take off first and no one would have it
10:35
you just got there just too quickly
10:37
otherwise that's all they'd become
10:40
um also calvin harris flea from the red
10:44
hot chili peppers
10:45
trey parker of south park um really
10:48
maria sharapova the tennis star and
10:51
sylvester stallone and conan o'brien who
10:54
is the late night talk show host in
10:55
america
10:56
who's been having conor gregor a lot
10:58
recently and i was like i hadn't didn't
10:59
know he had an interest
11:00
he's got a business interest yeah so
11:02
that's quite a who's who of um
11:04
sports thousand yeah entertainment the
11:07
buy-in was 250 000 so i think
11:09
they all bought the sort of the minimum
11:11
of it but again this is back in 2010 and
11:13
the sport exploded so those guys are
11:15
probably
11:15
making some money i can't believe all
11:17
those people are making some money
11:19
finally finally i mean after years of
11:21
poverty
11:24
well i mean you picked the one name that
11:25
probably does need the money
11:29
there was a fact that coincidentally was
11:30
doing around the reddit this week about
11:32
ufc which is that
11:33
there's a fighter called rory mcdonald
11:35
and so at the end of all the fights they
11:37
have walk no at the beginning of all the
11:38
fights they have
11:39
walk-out music so when they introduce
11:40
each fighter and he was quite unhappy
11:42
about a lot of the music that he was
11:43
getting and the guy that was organizing
11:45
it
11:45
but he didn't really say anything
11:47
because he thought that his like manager
11:48
and everything were just organizing it
11:50
themselves and eventually he mentioned
11:52
something and
11:54
um the guy who's organizing music was
11:55
like no well i thought you were
11:56
requesting all of these
11:57
and it turned out that he'd had his
11:59
phone number changed a couple of years
12:00
ago and a fan and got hold of his phone
12:02
number
12:02
and was requesting stupid music like um
12:06
like rihanna's we found love
12:09
hamlet you can't touch this so like all
12:11
these songs yeah were kind of dissing
12:13
him and making fun of him a bit
12:14
it was just somebody taking the piss
12:15
like three years i could think of worse
12:17
songs yeah i could have
12:18
sent the teletubbies theme on you know i
12:21
think
12:21
the builder i think whoever the families
12:23
did a good job to just about find that
12:25
level where they didn't he didn't get
12:26
found out for like years you're right i
12:27
would have been found out on the first
12:29
day
12:31
when it was just you making a fart noise
12:33
[Laughter]
12:36
conor mcgregor got in trouble quite
12:37
recently for saying that he could beat
12:40
jesus in a fight yeah uh this was last
12:43
year he said there's not a man alive
12:45
that could beat me
12:46
but jesus isn't alive so maybe he could
12:48
and come back from the dead
12:50
but i don't know i'd still whoop his ass
12:53
but that's true because you only have to
12:54
lie down for like 10 seconds for your
12:55
hour as jesus would take three days to
12:57
get up again
12:58
nice oh yeah so he'd get back up but
13:01
they'd actually converted the arena into
13:02
a little mix concert at that point
13:06
[Music]
13:11
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:13
that is
13:14
llc we are not making that step
13:19
okay my fact this week is that palau is
13:22
about to pass a law
13:23
meaning that every hotel in the country
13:25
has to be five star
13:26
i will admit that i spent a good two
13:28
minutes when you sent this by email
13:29
looking for the
13:31
footnote because i thought the star was
13:32
an asterisk and i was like five what
13:35
i was like scrolling through all the
13:36
replies
13:38
so what this is is a new law um to try
13:41
and make
13:42
just high-end tourism in this country
13:44
palau which is in the pacific
13:46
and they're suffering from climate
13:48
change more than everyone else
13:49
really and like all these um pacific
13:51
countries are
13:52
and they have problems with
13:54
infrastructure when they're getting the
13:55
loads of tourists in
13:56
and so they think well if we only have
13:58
high-end tourists that means fewer
13:59
tourists but still the same amount of
14:01
money and they want
14:02
new hotels to come in with their own
14:04
water treatment system with their own
14:06
power and stuff like that
14:08
and so palau is a collection of islands
14:10
right so is this every single one of
14:12
their 280-ish islands having five-star
14:14
hotels or is there a central spot to it
14:16
well it will be if you want to put a
14:18
hotel in any of those places
14:20
it'll have to be five-star yeah and i
14:22
i've been to palau have you yeah
14:24
we went when i was a kid because i lived
14:26
in hong kong and that's uh not too
14:28
far away quite far i mean you didn't row
14:32
there did you
14:33
no we got we got the we got the holidays
14:35
the jet ski
14:36
um no yeah we we uh holidayed there and
14:39
it was in i mean this is we're talking
14:42
15 20 years ago so
14:43
it was in huts by the beach so i'm but
14:46
those can be five star
14:47
obviously i just know already that
14:50
you're exactly the kind of person
14:51
they're now working to keep out
14:54
you're the person this policy is aimed
14:56
at
14:58
it took us 15 years to get the laugh
15:00
through but he's definitely not coming
15:02
back now
15:04
so i've got some stuff on hotels okay um
15:07
there was there's a really good article
15:08
in the economist about the various
15:10
standards that hotels have to stick to
15:12
um and so for instance the hilton chain
15:15
of hotels there's a manual
15:16
that stipulates that staff have to
15:18
answer the phones after three rings
15:20
exactly
15:21
for instance um whereas intercontinental
15:23
you have to wait four rings
15:25
is that right i used to work for
15:26
intercontinental hotels did you ever
15:28
answer the phone before or after full
15:30
range i think i might have done
15:31
well is that why you're working here
15:33
yeah yeah
15:34
i i quite appreciate that role actually
15:36
because it is quite startling when you
15:37
ring someone they pick up really fast
15:38
yeah
15:39
totally um they have there's one chain
15:41
which uh wasn't
15:42
allowing itself to be named which all of
15:44
its hotels all omelets have to match a
15:47
laminated
15:48
model omelette that they have there
15:50
which is cigar shaped and they have to
15:51
model it on that
15:52
all right um yeah uh intercontinental
15:55
also you might remember this rule james
15:57
specifies that the rooms have to offer
15:59
at least four pornographic films
16:02
at least four at least four yeah you
16:05
don't want to turn up and there's only
16:09
can you imagine calling up reception and
16:11
be like hi
16:12
could do with a couple more i seem to be
16:15
missing one of my favorites
16:17
so this is your first night i know it's
16:19
been a long session and i just need one
16:21
or two more to kick me over to the end
16:23
could you change the sheets while you're
16:24
up here please
16:29
by the way you picked up on the fourth
16:31
ring
16:32
more three ring guys
16:36
we didn't ask about your sexual
16:37
preferences
16:41
a hotel in colorado downloads pictures
16:44
of your family from the internet and
16:45
frames them for when you arrive at the
16:47
hotel
16:49
either brilliant or the most creepy
16:51
thing i've ever heard in my entire life
16:52
yeah
16:53
i think i know which one of those it is
16:54
there's also just one more which is a
16:56
hotel in mexico a luxury hotel
16:58
where they do research into you
17:00
beforehand
17:01
and the housekeeper matches the color of
17:04
the thread in the guest sewing kits to
17:06
the clothes that you're wearing and
17:08
again they get that from photos on
17:10
social media do you think i think
17:11
actually it must be from when you've
17:13
arrived so there must be an emergency
17:14
you arrive at the reception desk and
17:16
they're like she's got a red dress on
17:17
quick get the red thread in the box
17:18
that's good because most of the pictures
17:19
of me on social media are from fancy
17:21
dress parties
17:22
so you just get i don't know what kind
17:24
of stuff do you wear you get some face
17:26
paint
17:26
yeah yeah there were a couple of um
17:29
zero star hotels in switzerland and the
17:32
first one was in a cold war bunker and
17:34
so there are no tvs there are no
17:35
separate bathrooms
17:36
um there's no daylight because it's in a
17:38
bunker but it doesn't look too bad like
17:40
it's basically like a kind of low-end
17:42
youth hostel
17:42
the second one um is just like a bed and
17:45
a bit of a wall like upper mountain in
17:47
switzerland
17:48
and then there's a butler who is
17:49
actually a local farmer who comes and
17:52
is responsible for giving you the
17:53
weather forecast and telling you jokes
17:55
um and that's great it's it's all about
17:58
it's a sort of tiresome critique on
17:59
hotel culture it doesn't sound good
18:01
though
18:01
i reckon i'd pay for that in the hotel
18:03
to have a farmer come and tell me jokes
18:05
yeah me too
18:06
especially if they checked my social
18:07
media and saw what kind of jokes i like
18:09
good point yeah he'd be like this is an
18:12
easy one
18:13
[Laughter]
18:18
[Music]
18:23
okay it is time for fact number three
18:25
and that is
18:26
alex my fact this week is that every
18:28
canadian citizen is entitled to a free
18:30
government-issued portrait of the queen
18:33
of our queen of our queen and their
18:36
queen
18:36
they're actually entitled to five
18:38
portraits of
18:39
the royal family in various combinations
18:41
can they choose whichever members they
18:43
like
18:44
um as in if you prefer princess eugenie
18:47
and prince andrew you can have those two
18:48
you know what i don't think they're on
18:49
offer i think it's mainly like phillip
18:51
and the queen
18:52
and i think prince william yeah it's the
18:54
big it's the headliners it's the main
18:56
characters um but uh there are just five
18:58
different ones and you can order up to
18:59
like one of each so you can get five in
19:00
total right so you'd be like pokemon you
19:02
gotta unlock
19:02
eugenie with your dedication
19:06
presumably these are prince not original
19:08
oil paintings every time you yeah
19:11
huge frame delivered yeah no yeah these
19:13
are just paint or you can download them
19:15
like free so i've downloaded mine even
19:16
though
19:16
not you're not canadian i know but that
19:19
must be against the law
19:20
so this is part of a lot of services
19:22
that you can get from the governments of
19:23
canada
19:24
if you ring one eight hundred oh canada
19:26
you get oh
19:27
you can't i know you get onto a helpline
19:29
that provides that information on
19:31
canadian governmental programs and
19:32
services and stuff like that
19:34
it's really cool but the oh is that a
19:36
zero or is it the o in the keyboard the
19:39
letter o rather than the numbers
19:40
really because when you give someone's
19:42
phone number you often use
19:43
the word o to mean zero don't you like
19:46
oh eight hundred yeah
19:47
it's really confusing a lot of canadians
19:48
going through some random pizza place
19:50
somewhere or demanding pictures of the
19:52
queen
19:52
like what's going on um interestingly
19:55
when you go to the website i looked at
19:57
the pictures as well
19:58
um i couldn't see as many as five
19:59
actually i saw you could have the queen
20:01
or philip or the queen with philip so
20:03
those are your options
20:04
that i um and they have lots of rules
20:07
though for if you do download them for
20:09
what you're allowed and allowed to
20:11
not do with them so for example you
20:13
cannot use the images
20:14
on adhesive seals that's one what's an
20:17
adhesive seal i guess um like a sticker
20:21
on an envelope
20:21
yeah that's what i was thinking like on
20:23
an envelope i guess a stamp is what
20:24
they're saying
20:25
i see there's a seal as in that holds
20:27
the envelope together
20:28
yeah yeah so you're not allowed that you
20:30
know all the time that rather than
20:32
buying a normal envelope you just buy
20:33
one and then use a sticker i always do
20:35
that but then i always put a sticker of
20:37
the queen on so now i'm a bit worried
20:38
oh yeah you gotta recall all those
20:41
postcards from over the years james
20:42
can you recall a postcard
20:47
the postman just knocks on you know
20:48
sorry i'm just gonna
20:51
she doesn't wish you were here anymore
20:54
also can i just say
20:55
postcards the one thing you don't have
20:57
to put in an envelope
20:59
as the words came out of my mouth
21:05
and the one the one final thing you're
21:06
not allowed to use it for there's other
21:08
things but
21:08
um another thing you're not allowed to
21:10
use it for is to advertise if the queen
21:12
or philip have visited
21:13
your shop so the example they give is
21:15
for example if the royal highnesses the
21:17
duke and duchess of cambridge were to
21:18
visit a cheese shop
21:19
that shop could not use a photograph of
21:21
the occasion to advertise
21:23
its goods is that like when you go into
21:25
like a curry house and they've got like
21:26
a sign first of gary lineker
21:28
yeah or like a laundrette but isn't it
21:31
always gary lineker
21:33
he just visits lawn dressing curry
21:34
houses all the time it must be that gary
21:36
lineker's going to a lot of curry houses
21:38
with signed photos right yeah yeah or
21:41
arthur i mean have you ever seen him on
21:43
any linen i haven't so
21:45
it's the same photo of gary lineker
21:47
right it's the same yeah i think that he
21:49
just doesn't have
21:50
an oven or a washing machine so he
21:52
always constantly has to use the
21:53
laundrette and eat out
21:55
he goes to the curry house spills curry
21:56
all over himself so he has to get
21:58
everything trying to yes
21:59
an endorsing messiah um something else
22:02
that you can get free in canada
22:04
that's quite cool is the flag that's
22:07
flown at the top of the
22:08
equivalent of big ben basically which is
22:10
the ottawa peace tower
22:11
so it's a huge clock that's sort of part
22:13
of their parliament buildings
22:15
and you can write off you can sign a
22:17
form and write off
22:18
and request one of those flags because
22:21
every single day or about 250 days of
22:23
the year
22:24
they take the flag down and they change
22:26
it and put up a new one
22:27
and then they wash that one and iron it
22:29
out and they send it to whoever in
22:30
canada has requested it
22:31
really they must be massive though
22:33
aren't they they are big yes
22:35
and so there must be more than one
22:36
person must request it
22:38
right so this is what's happened you've
22:39
i think you've hit upon a problem
22:41
um they've had at least 20 000 requests
22:44
at this point which means that there's
22:45
now a 73-year waiting list to get your
22:47
flag
22:50
so you can have it delivered to your
22:52
grandchildren you're going to be pretty
22:53
young to
22:54
make an application now don't you you
22:56
really do to be successful
22:57
but why did they keep giving away flags
22:59
sorry why do they need a new one every
23:01
day
23:01
um i don't think they do i think this
23:02
was just an idea they had it been a
23:04
fantastic thing to do to donate a flag
23:06
each day to some or
23:07
most days of the year to somewhere in
23:08
the country so it's every day they
23:09
replace the flag not every year it's
23:11
about so it's every weekday
23:12
um except bank holidays or apparently
23:14
when the weather's poor they don't
23:15
bother changing it
23:16
every canadian citizen is entitled to
23:19
three hours to vote whenever there's an
23:20
election
23:21
in in the in the booth uh no it doesn't
23:24
no
23:24
so you're allowed three hours off work
23:26
to vote
23:28
what are you doing in there basically if
23:31
your work schedule means that you finish
23:34
work at say
23:35
four o'clock or something uh and the the
23:37
polls
23:38
close at seven o'clock then that's fine
23:40
but if your work schedule means you
23:42
don't have
23:42
three hours spare they have to give you
23:44
three hours off
23:46
yeah it's good that isn't it yeah it's a
23:47
lot of time to get to a polling
23:49
station yeah probably have lunch as well
23:52
yeah let's go to the pub i might not
23:54
even vote to be honest
23:58
i got another queen canada fact so the
24:01
queen
24:01
appears on the banknotes of
24:05
canada as she does in australia and all
24:08
around the commonwealth
24:09
um but interesting claim that canada has
24:12
over it is they were the first country
24:14
even beating the uk to having the queen
24:17
on a banknote before anyone else was it
24:20
like as soon as she became queen they
24:22
rushed it out
24:23
no it was pre it was this was in 1935.
24:25
the child
24:26
yeah she was this nine-year-old you
24:28
remember this
24:29
i remember reading it before you just
24:31
said it i knew it
24:33
time traveller i went back to order my
24:36
flag
24:39
did you know in australia you can also
24:42
get a
24:43
portrait of the queen but you can also
24:45
request cd and dvd recordings of the
24:47
national anthem if you want them
24:48
so you if you google constituents
24:50
request program
24:52

24:54
political representative for that and
24:55
you can request a booklet on the flags
24:57
of australia you can get a booklet on
24:59
australia's national symbols and yet you
25:00

25:09

25:11
portrait of the queen
25:12
yeah yeah yeah okay if you're in a
25:14
commonwealth and you have this option uh
25:16
if you're listening in britain just a
25:17
picture of gary lineker will be great
25:20
please post it to us on our qi account
25:28
okay it is time for our final fact of
25:30
the show and that
25:32
is chozinski my fact this week is that
25:34
the first ever encyclopedia britannica
25:37
said that humans were divided into five
25:39
categories
25:40
uh those categories were american
25:42
european
25:43
asiatic african and monstrous
25:46
jeez the five types of humans did they
25:49
believe that there were
25:50
monsters is that what we're saying i
25:52
read this in this really good book i've
25:53
just started reading it's called you
25:55
could look it up
25:56
by a guy called jack lynch and so what
25:58
it was was
25:59
that uh there were often it was kind of
26:01
an age of exploration and
26:02
often a lot of rumors about the kind of
26:04
people you'd find in strange places
26:06
maybe there were kind of mythical
26:08
semi-human creatures around so there
26:09
were reports for instance
26:11
of men who had feet backwards or men who
26:13
didn't have any noses
26:15
there were reports of humans who had
26:17
dogs heads and who communicated by
26:19
barking
26:19
and so there were kind of these rumors
26:21
about mythical monsters you are you are
26:22
describing bigfoot and werewolves and
26:24
these are all still real real real
26:27
things
26:28
out there today anna right so this is
26:30
the casual tournament they used to cover
26:32
themselves
26:32
yes anything we know it's miscellaneous
26:34
basically yeah and this went back to
26:36
linnaeus who classified her homo sapiens
26:38
10 years earlier so in 1758
26:40
and he actually said that there was homo
26:43
ferrous
26:44
as well as a different species which was
26:46
wild men and then homo monstrous
26:48
which was monsters and yeah so we're not
26:50
quite sure what they are but weird
26:52
looking made up people
26:53
so i was reading up on the first ever
26:55
encyclopedia britannica because um
26:58
weirdly is you almost feel like the
27:00
authors should be famous names
27:02
yes i didn't know a single one so there
27:05
were two guys who effectively brought it
27:07
together
27:08
one was called colin mcfucker
27:11
and that's exactly how he pronounced it
27:14
with the question mark at the end
27:16
he never knew the names macbook
27:23
yeah he um he also set up with a guy
27:26
called andrew
27:27
bell and alex your surname is belle find
27:30
it all about him yeah well what's
27:31
interesting is
27:32
for the encyclopedia britannica he was
27:35
the
27:35
engraver he was the one who did all of
27:37
the drawings uh which on our podcast
27:39
when you're not on the microphone with
27:40
us you are our our illustrator
27:42
for all the things so you both have the
27:44
same surname that's exciting
27:46
i like the way that you said belle as if
27:48
there was no exclamation point at the
27:49
end of it
27:50
as well so you've got fargo
27:56
yeah i don't know what's going on with
27:57
my pronunciations but bell was a very
27:59
interesting guy
28:00
um he was quite small he was four foot
28:02
six um and he had a big nose that he
28:04
would sometimes try and hide by wearing
28:06
a paper mache version
28:08
in order to hide the bigness of it yeah
28:11
you would think right
28:12
no i think he was a joker and he did it
28:14
whenever anyone stared at his nose he
28:16
put a bigger one
28:16
put a bigger one to say are you looking
28:18
at my nose
28:20
i think he was like because he was gonna
28:23
be
28:24
in my book it's an engraving of
28:26
you
28:29
and he also um he used to so as well as
28:31
doing encyclopedia britannica he used to
28:33
engrave crests and dog collars
28:35
um and he he made sure that he always
28:38
rode the tallest horse that was
28:40
available
28:41
so if he was going to just rent a horse
28:42
he'd be like the tallest one please i
28:44
like that
28:45
going to hire a horse they've just got
28:47
the same options
28:48
like at the car rental place where you
28:49
like color and heights
28:51
yeah compact or do you leave it fully
28:53
fed or do
28:54
someone else do that yeah so the oldest
28:57
known
28:58
encyclopedia britannica is still in use
29:01
apparently and it was only discovered in
29:02
2010
29:03
and there's an 18 volume set that was
29:05
from 1797
29:06
and it just belonged to this family in
29:08
chelmsford and they'd used it growing up
29:10
and stuff and they were still using it
29:11
all the time
29:12
they bought it for 15 pounds the full
29:14
set which seems
29:15
unbelievable for 18 volumes of
29:16
encyclopedia but now it's worth like 9
29:18
000
29:19
right yeah um understandably it seems
29:21
like not very much money for the
29:23
encyclopedia
29:24
oldest i agree yeah but you can get them
29:27
on
29:27
um cd-rom these days yeah that's true
29:31
yeah it's weird with it
29:35
um if wikipedia was printed out on paper
29:37
it would be about
29:39
1 900 volumes worth of britannica really
29:43
that would be the most tedious i mean
29:45
encyclopedias are not exactly the
29:47
greatest read of all time are they but
29:49
imagine wikipedia
29:50
all those little pages for like high
29:52
schools in the middle of america
29:55
well there was a project like it was
29:57
more of an art project but this guy
29:58
called michael mandeberg
29:59
um in 2015 um printed out some of it and
30:03
kind of did all the math and work to how
30:05
much of course and um it was called from
30:06
a
30:07
to zap so that a was a aaaa exclamation
30:10
mark which is like the first
30:11
wikipedia entry he could find the
30:13
beginning to zap which was zed zzzzzzzz
30:15
apx motion mark which was a really
30:17
random kids tv show that i remember
30:19
watching
30:19
really yeah isn't that weird i remember
30:21
watching ah
30:23
yeah classic my favorite encyclopedia is
30:26
the full volume
30:28
encyclopedia of lubricants and
30:29
lubrication nice
30:31
have you read it no it's not you
30:33
couldn't put it down it's you couldn't

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qi offices
00:22
in covert garden my name is dan
00:24
schreiber and i am sitting here
00:25
with anna chazinski and miller and james
00:28
harkin
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four
00:32
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with you and
00:39
my fact is that genwa airport has
00:41
relaxed its liquid band but only for
00:43
pesto
00:44
i wouldn't even say pastel was a liquid
00:47
it's more like a soup
00:48
isn't it well soup is a liquid you're
00:50
not allowed to take soup through
00:52
i mean there is one group of people that
00:54
you don't want to haggle with is
00:55
probably airport security
00:56
so they say don't bring it i wouldn't i
00:59
went through airport security this time
01:01
and i went to the passport guy and the
01:03
guy said have you got a problem
01:04
and i think he was trying to be nice but
01:06
he had a glaswegian accent and he
01:07
sounded like he's trying to
01:08
invite me outside for a fight
01:13
did he then say politely do you want to
01:14
take this outside
01:16
and then he politely smacked me in the
01:18
face
01:19
but the personal campaign so basically
01:21
this airport was confiscating about 500
01:24
yards of pester every three months and
01:26
decided it was gone too far
01:27
and so this is sort of it's a charity
01:29
thing really it's a campaign called
01:30
pesto is good
01:31
you're allowed one 500 ml of pesto um
01:34
and you buy a 50 euro stamp which will
01:36
let you take it on board and they scan
01:38
it through the same machine that
01:38
medicine and breast milk goes
01:40
through and so is this a tourism thing
01:41
were they feeling a financial knock
01:44
well i think partly because they're
01:45
known for pesto in that area so like
01:47
it's nice to bring but also i think it's
01:48
slightly and it's a charity thing so the
01:50
money goes to a company called the
01:51
flying angels foundation which brings in
01:53
kids from the developing world who need
01:54
to have
01:55
operations um but a similar thing
01:56
happened in city airport um they were
01:58
seizing an awful lot of marmite
01:59
so this summer they did more of my
02:00
amnesty where you could trade in your
02:02
big jar for a small
02:03
pot marmite's an interesting liquidy one
02:07
is it a liquid well it is unless you
02:09
bash it really hard and then it turns
02:10
into a solid
02:11
because it's non-nutritional that's not
02:12
true is it yeah so all we need to do is
02:14
invent this non-newtonian
02:16
liquid to be applied to things like
02:19
bottles of water
02:20
and you can give it a smack before you
02:22
get to immigration
02:23
it goes in there's a solid block bring
02:24
in a block of ice you have to why don't
02:26
you just bring in a massive block of ice
02:27
in a bottle
02:28
so you can't do that do you know if you
02:30
freeze if you freeze your water and you
02:31
bring in a bottle of ice
02:33
then they will let you bring it through
02:34
i think actually some will and some
02:36
won't
02:36
yeah maybe yeah there's actually an
02:38
interesting thing with um airports
02:40
confiscating things a lot of airports
02:41
don't have the same rules so in some
02:42
airports lipsticks count as liquid and
02:44
some accounts are solid
02:45
it's so weird what you can and can't
02:46
bring onto planes i was reading this
02:48
year
02:48
that uh the tsa in america confirmed
02:51
via their instagram that you're allowed
02:53
to bring live lobsters on as part
02:56
of your carry-on luggage well they're
02:58
not liquid that's true so
03:00
humans are quite liquid by that logic so
03:01
why should we be allowed to we're
03:09
but the other thing is your live lobster
03:11
presumably likes living in water
03:13
so how do you keep it alive without
03:15
bringing the water in yeah you get them
03:16
20 tiny waters and then you put them
03:18
together
03:19
yeah you put it in pesto yeah the photo
03:22
in question on the instagram that they
03:23
uploaded was of a 20 pound lobster
03:26
it's ginormous and it was allowed on
03:28
because lobsters are allowed odd they're
03:30
just put in the overhead carry storage
03:32
um do you know that the tsa they're into
03:34
their instagram is crazy popular it's
03:35
got 780 000 followers and
03:37
rolling stone uh named it the fourth
03:39
best instagram account in the world
03:40
beating nasa
03:41
okay and beyonce nasa beyonce and the
03:44
tsa
03:47
so it's um kim kardashian that geo
03:49
somebody i've forgotten
03:50
then tsa then beyonce than nasa pour
03:53
somebody who you forgot it they've
03:54
worked so hard
03:56
they've made it to the top three my
03:58
favorite it's probably justin bieber
03:59
what a slap
04:01
i'm really sorry number three um but so
04:04
their account is amazing so they
04:06
confiscate nine guns a day
04:08
in american airports most of them are
04:09
loaded and there's on this instagram and
04:11
basically the instagram is
04:13
pictures of stuff that's being
04:14
confiscated and their dogs does very
04:15
well on the internet
04:16
but things they've taken include live
04:18
eels a live grenade a knife hidden
04:20
inside an enchilada
04:21
a medieval mace a dagger hidden inside a
04:23
replica of the eiffel tower and a
04:24
chihuahua that sneaked into its owner's
04:26
back when they weren't looking
04:28
you know when they started banning
04:29
liquids on planes they weren't short to
04:31
do about breast milk at first
04:33
and they quite quickly decided that
04:34
breast milk should be the one exception
04:36
which it is but
04:37
it used to be the case that women were
04:38
sometimes asked to prove that it was
04:40
their own breast milk by drinking it
04:42
but they all a lot of them said it was
04:43
disgusting so one woman said it was
04:45
embarrassing and disgusting having to
04:47
drink my own breast milk i wonder if it
04:48
goes back in and just refills
04:50
i don't know how that works in terms of
04:52
the body
04:53
i think it spoils it i think there's an
04:54
article a while ago with someone gotta
04:56
be made to do that i was like but
04:57
if i do that like it won't all keep
04:58
liking it i think she'd be on a business
05:00
trip or something and they made her
05:01
taste it all and
05:02
then it spoils and you can't keep it so
05:03
what's the whole point so when they
05:05
first started burning things they
05:06
originally banned pens
05:08
for the first couple of weeks uh on the
05:10
grounds that the ink they contained was
05:12
a fluid
05:13
yeah makes sense how come they were
05:15
allowed back on i think if your pen has
05:17
more than 100 milliliters of ink in it
05:19
then
05:19
you probably got the wrong pen
05:20
manufacturer it could be well as novelty
05:23
life large pens that you bring in oh i
05:26
just
05:26
i'm signing a massive check for someone
05:28
like this
05:30
and then they also stopped people from
05:32
bringing phones on for a while and so
05:34
many people
05:34
were upset about that that people were
05:36
switching their paris
05:38
or brussels flights from london at a
05:40
rate of 10 a minute
05:42
oh yeah they lost loads of money um
05:44
british airways didn't they they lost
05:46
like a million dollars in a really short
05:47
amount of time
05:49
um but yeah because people so desperate
05:51
to have their phones for just a one-hour
05:52
plane journey it's not a long trip from
05:54
london to paris
05:55
no and you can't use your phone in the
05:57
air
05:58
no but maybe if you had a blackberry you
06:01
could um kind of
06:02
draft some emails yes or playing a snake
06:05
yeah
06:06
placenta lake was huge back then snakes
06:08
on a plane
06:11
um i was reading about things that have
06:12
been left at airports this year
06:15
so um the first is a headstone that was
06:18
found
06:19
uh that had the inscription you will
06:21
always be remembered never forgotten
06:22
that was left at an airport
06:24
uh that was at dublin airport that they
06:26
accidentally left the never forget
06:28
uh headstone there's also a toilet seat
06:32
a cistern human ash
06:33
false teeth and glass eyes so that's all
06:36
from the last few years
06:37
did you say a toilet seat and a sister
06:39
yeah that sounds like someone on a gap
06:40
year who's heard the facilities in
06:42
indonesia are really bad
06:43
and they've brought i'll just bring my
06:45
own toilet it's fine
06:47
carrying around with them well speaking
06:48
of toilets and airport again just news
06:50
from this year involving airports and
06:52
toilets
06:53
there's a airport in tokyo
06:56
that for a few months of this year
06:58
provided toilet paper
07:00
for anyone on the toilet uh for not only
07:03
themselves
07:04
but then a separate toilet system that
07:05
provided paper for their smartphones
07:08
so what you'd wipe your bum and your
07:10
smartphone no no no
07:12
you wipe your smartphone with the toilet
07:14
paper no so you would have one toilet
07:16
roll for your bum yeah and then another
07:18
toilet roll
07:19
for your smartphone a smaller mini roll
07:21
because they were worried that so many
07:22
people use their phone now on the
07:24
toilets
07:24
that they're getting all sorts of dirty
07:25
bacteria on them and then that goes on
07:27
to their head when they
07:28
hold on to so this is just a little bit
07:30
of toilet roll to just wipe your
07:31
smartphone down
07:32
sure once you're done on the toilet
07:34
can't fold that toilet paper and make it
07:35
smaller
07:43
okay it is time for fact number two and
07:46
that is
07:47
james okay my fact this week is that it
07:49
has been scientifically proven
07:51
that the beatles were an average band
07:54
who didn't really influence music
07:56
outrageous proven by whom what are you
07:59
talking about just outrageous well i'm
08:00
mostly saying this just to wind down up
08:02
um but this is um a real study it was
08:05
done by a biologist called
08:07
armand la roy and he's from the imperial
08:09
college london
08:11
and what he is he's an evolutionary
08:13
biologist and he plotted the 50 years of
08:15
hit singles from the us billboard chart
08:17
into a computer program
08:18
the models evolution and found out which
08:21
song was influenced by which song
08:23
he found out that the beatles are just
08:25
kind of an average band who didn't
08:26
really influence that many people
08:28
oh yeah and really around that time it
08:31
was more the who and the rolling stones
08:32
that did the
08:33
influencing and overall it's more
08:35
hip-hop music
08:36
so is this sort of changes in musical
08:39
style
08:40
like kind of changes in the direction of
08:42
where music was going yeah
08:44
kind of so what they did was they got 30
08:46
second snippets of
08:47
music and they put it into the computer
08:49
program and the computer program could
08:50
tell the difference between different
08:52
musical properties like
08:53
instruments used or chord patterns or
08:55
whatever and they look to where they
08:57
might have got that idea from
08:58
in an evolutionary way okay
09:01
but i think it's an interesting point
09:03
isn't it no yeah
09:06
no i mean because if you like you're
09:07
more likely to find bands that say
09:09
beetles are an influence to them then
09:10
you are not
09:11
i would say so i think what we're saying
09:12
is all those bands are wrong
09:14
i know who knew i think this guy did
09:16
acknowledge that uh the beatles were
09:18
still part of that revolution
09:20
in american music it was just like the
09:22
rolling stones and the who seemed to
09:23
create more of a change
09:24
and he also did acknowledge the very
09:26
obvious truth that because the beatles
09:27
were heard so widely by so many people
09:30
even if a change was coming in music
09:32
that influenced them
09:33
they were then the ones who influenced
09:35
so many more people
09:36
because they were just so popular bob
09:38
dylan i can't remember the exact quote
09:39
but bob dylan said that the beatles
09:42
changed america completely they knocked
09:45
america into a basically a revolution of
09:47
culture
09:47
involved in the beatles had a bit of an
09:49
awkward relationship though didn't they
09:50
like john lennon
09:51
loved bob dylan and you know was
09:54
inspired by some bob dylan songs to
09:55
write things like norwegian wood and to
09:57
go a bit
09:57
deeper but bob dylan i think people
10:00
think wasn't really influenced by the
10:01
beatles at all
10:02
and yet now has written one of his best
10:04
new songs on his new album is called
10:06
dear john or something is a really
10:08
moving song about john lennon
10:09
is it yeah so um amandla roy who is the
10:12
guy behind this study or one of the guys
10:14
behind this study
10:15
he's also one of the guys behind a thing
10:17
called darwintunes.org
10:19
and this is a website um from a few
10:21
years ago where they would play you some
10:23
music
10:23
and then you say whether you liked it or
10:25
you didn't like it and they keep doing
10:27
that and then
10:27
eventually they hope to evolve the
10:29
perfect bit of music
10:31
that everyone liked so again it's a kind
10:33
of evolution through music
10:35
so i'm going to play you um some of this
10:37
and see what you think about this so
10:39
so this is a song that in theory all of
10:41
us in this room should like
10:42
um well i'll start off doing something
10:44
that was from 150 generations so 150
10:47
times people have said i like this i
10:49
don't like this and
10:50
it kind of evolved into a certain kind
10:52
of music so this is this
11:02
[Music]
11:06
i mean it's not bad for something player
11:07
than a nokia yeah
11:09
yeah you're not impressed well no it
11:11
sounds like a reader
11:13
okay so what i'll do now is i'll play
11:15
something from 8
11:16
700 generations so this has gone through
11:19
much more evolution so this in theory
11:21
should be much more
11:22
nice to the ear see what you think of
11:23
this exciting
11:29
[Music]
11:46
it's slightly better i still feel like
11:48
it's not quite at beatles level
11:51
of songwriting genius well pop music is
11:54
repetitive
11:54
yeah that definitely was um i found a
11:57
few
11:58
um interesting connections between
12:01
beatles
12:02
and comedy um okay so
12:05
this is uh this is an interesting thing
12:07
to me and perhaps comedy fans out there
12:09
there was a team called but
12:10
i can't imagine any comedy fans are
12:12
listening to this podcast yeah that's
12:14
true
12:14
so i'll do a bit of explaining uh there
12:15
used to be a group called beyond the
12:18
fringe
12:18
starred dudley moore peter cook jonathan
12:20
miller alan bennett
12:22
they were the big awakening of comedy in
12:24
the 1950s in britain did a lot of
12:26
satirical stuff kind of kind of the
12:28
birth of
12:29
satire some would say and uh the
12:32
applause that was used at their show for
12:35
their recording was taken by the
12:36
producer of george martin
12:38
who did all of the beetle stuff and he
12:40
put it to the beginning of sergeant
12:41
pepper so if you know the song sergeant
12:43
peppers
12:44
when there's that um let me introduce to
12:46
you the actually there's
12:47
lots of flaws going on that's from
12:48
beyond the fringe in the 1950s yeah
12:51
it's a comedy applause going on so this
12:53
year it's been the 50-year anniversary
12:55
of sergeant pepper's lonely hearts club
12:57
band
12:58
that's right do you know that adolf
13:00
hitler is
13:01
on the cover of that album so they have
13:04
if you know the iconic album yeah
13:05
there's loads and loads of faces
13:07
um they didn't have jesus on there uh
13:09
and they didn't have gandhi
13:11
but they do have adolf hitler okay
13:14
i don't remember him being on there well
13:15
he's in disguise he is
13:17
a little bit he's behind the beatles
13:20
he's completely obscured
13:21
completely obscured this is according to
13:25
the guy who made it who's called sir
13:27
peter blake
13:27
yeah and i don't know if he's joking or
13:29
not but he did say
13:31
that when you look at the photographs of
13:33
the outtakes that they were doing at the
13:34
time you can see that hitler was there
13:37
but actually when they did the final
13:38
picture he was hiding behind the beatles
13:40
themselves
13:40
that does sound a bit familiar actually
13:42
yeah oh god they should they need to do
13:44
you know when they do sort of like weird
13:46
ultrasound scans on great works of
13:47
renaissance
13:48
art and they find another mona lisa
13:49
underneath the mona lisa oh no
13:51
they need to do that to the album cover
13:53
yeah there could be all sorts of people
13:54
under there yeah
13:56
um i was reading about how people
13:58
sometimes it said john lennon created
14:00
sort of flipping sound around when he
14:02
threaded up his real player the wrong
14:03
way around
14:04
was there before but they popularized it
14:06
and apparently uh george learned his
14:08
solo backwards where i'm only sleeping
14:09
then they reversed it in the real
14:10
recording
14:13
true very cool he recited the words
14:15
backwards no and the solo
14:16
on the guitar oh really which if true is
14:19
quite cool closely with sound editing
14:20
now
14:21
things like splicing cutting moving
14:22
around is really easy but then it was
14:24
all
14:24
literally cutting up the film yourself
14:26
and moving it like that so
14:28
um when they did a take of strawberry
14:29
fields forever john lennon wanted part
14:31
from one take apart from a different
14:32
take
14:33
and so they but um they'd be recorded at
14:34
different tempos and different pictures
14:36
so they had to try and sort of merge the
14:38
two
14:38
because otherwise they can't just switch
14:39
halfway through from like different keys
14:41
yeah
14:41
the reverse technique thing is really
14:43
interesting because they do that in
14:44
comedy films as well
14:45
particularly for slapstick movies they
14:47
do it for when the slapstick stunt is so
14:49
outrageously harsh
14:51
they start it backwards so say for
14:53
example um
14:54
in guesthouse paradiso they slam in two
14:56
sharp forks into adrian edmondson's
14:58
nostrils so you see the hand go huang
15:00
and just
15:01
hook his nose right up and you couldn't
15:03
do that even with rubber it's such a
15:04
tight precision
15:05
thing oh i see but you can start you can
15:07
pull them out so
15:08
you start with it adrian edmondson had
15:10
to learn his lines backwards
15:12
no say it to the screen and then they
15:14
remove it and then when you flip it the
15:16
other way around
15:17
it goes in and then his lines are
15:19
forward um there was another music study
15:21
i was reading about that was done quite
15:22
recently
15:23
which was a study that was done in spain
15:25
which
15:26
looked into how pop music has changed
15:28
and if just to kind of satisfy i guess
15:30
our parents generation
15:31
it found that it has got too loud and it
15:34
all sounds the same now so
15:36
i study found that a study found this
15:38
they analyzed 464 000 songs from 1950s
15:41
to 2010
15:43
and they looked at like the diversity of
15:45
note combinations and they looked at
15:47
different chord progressions and when
15:48
they changed keys and stuff like that
15:50
and they found that the melodies of
15:52
songs today are all more similar to each
15:54
other and that they don't have as many
15:55
changes within them that the timbrel
15:58
palette employed is less so
15:59
that's a different kind of instruments
16:01
in the olden days you'd have some
16:02
trumpets and you'd have an
16:03
organ suddenly and you'd have a triangle
16:05
but now it's just
16:07
you know a lot of it's more electric are
16:09
we necessarily saying that that is worse
16:11
or better or
16:12
they certainly weren't because they are
16:13
objective scientists proper scientists
16:15
you see but i
16:16
am so because what you could say is that
16:19
they
16:19
really tried lots of different things
16:21
over the years and now we've found
16:22
something that really works and it's
16:24
taylor swift's new song
16:25
you could say that we're currently
16:27
breaking all records on youtube guys
16:28
is it only half of them are me
16:37
okay it is time for fact number three
16:39
and that is josinski
16:40
my fact this week is that when the first
16:42
pilgrims went over on the mayflower
16:44
one of them brought 139 pairs of shoes
16:47
with him
16:49
um so this is the voyage of the
16:51
mayflower which was in 1620 when
16:54
uh a bunch of pilgrims went over and
16:56
they landed in america and they set up
16:58
the first permanent settlement in new
16:59
england
17:00
and so obviously extremely famous and
17:02
it's the pilgrim fathers
17:04
and yeah they actually were not very
17:05
well prepared to go and take over
17:07
a new totally unexplored really land
17:10
well it sounds like they're prepared if
17:12
they're going to do a lot of walking
17:14
i'm not even sure they were practical
17:15
walking shoes i've got to say really
17:17
um it was 126 pairs of shoes and 13
17:19
pairs of boots
17:21
and to be fair he was a shoe maker it
17:23
was a guy called william mullins
17:25
maybe he thought he was going to sell
17:26
them to the locals i don't know
17:28
i mean what else is he going to bring
17:29
with him yeah like he's not gonna bring
17:31
sausages with him is he yeah he's a
17:33
shoemaker he's a shoemaker
17:35
actually there were over there was
17:36
around 130 passengers in total
17:39
on board so a pair of shoes for each so
17:41
maybe he was thinking business terms
17:43
but the rest of them didn't go barefoot
17:45
they just all brought the sensible one
17:46
pair one spare pair
17:48
um but yeah they weren't very well
17:49
prepared they didn't bring kind of
17:51
useful things like kind of fishing lines
17:53
or a plow
17:54
but yeah some other people brought a
17:55
trumpet uh someone brought a drum
17:57
someone brought a complete history of
17:59
turkey so these were
18:00
sort of almost gentlemen these people so
18:03
they wanted to take stuff that they
18:05
valued which wasn't necessarily the
18:06
super useful stuff that a labourer would
18:09
be able to work with
18:10
do you know there were two babies born
18:11
on the mayflower one was born when they
18:12
docked in america and one was born at
18:14
sea
18:15
um and they named him oceanus so that's
18:17
so nice
18:18
i was actually reading into oceanus i
18:20
would pronounce that oceanus
18:22
[Laughter]
18:24
so oceanus hopkins was his name um had
18:28
he kept his mother's maiden name
18:30
he would have been called oceanus fisher
18:32
which is quite nice
18:35
determinist yeah so unfortunately
18:37
oceanus didn't live
18:38
too long um he died probably six years
18:41
into life they're not they're not fully
18:43
sure
18:43
um but his father stephen hopkins has an
18:46
interesting story
18:47
because he was part of the crew on the
18:50
mayflower
18:51
but he was also on a boat that tried to
18:54
settle in the new world 10 years earlier
18:56
in jamestown in virginia and
18:59
on his way there the boat got wrecked
19:02
off the coast of bermuda and he got
19:03
stranded there with a bunch of other
19:05
fellow passengers for several months
19:07
and the story of that rescue um that
19:10
brought them back
19:11
um was what william shakespeare says he
19:13
based the tempest on
19:15
oh no way yeah well it's speculated it
19:17
speculated he did um
19:18
but they're questioning whether even one
19:20
of the characters as well was named
19:22
after stephen hopkins
19:24
oceanus's dad because there's stefano
19:28
in the tempest and supposedly stephen
19:30
hopkins was one of shakespeare's
19:31
neighbors
19:32
supposedly lived in the same area as
19:34
shakespeare so quite a famous family by
19:36
by default and situation quite a lot of
19:39
adventures for one guy
19:41
and he worked with john smith as well as
19:42
pocahontas fame so that was jamestown
19:44
well that was because he was a guy who
19:45
went to jamestown 10 years earlier
19:47
whatever so yeah he was working with
19:49
john smith to try and set up their
19:50
colony there i think he had like a
19:52
mission to like get in as many movies as
19:53
possible
19:54
four movies were a thing like yeah good
19:57
point
19:58
he's like you know those actors that you
19:59
get that are in basically every movie
20:01
yeah like they've just got the one line
20:03
or whatever yeah he's a bit like john
20:05
goodman who's in every
20:06
good movie like he was for ages whenever
20:08
there was a best picture he was in
20:10
argo and he was in um the artist and he
20:13
was in everything wasn't he yeah but
20:14
never had a main part
20:15
do you know james that is unbelievably
20:17
weird that you've just said that
20:18
because a john goodman was on board the
20:21
mayflower no
20:22
no he's not the same guy yeah he's much
20:24
older than he looks
20:25
really really good at moisturizing oh my
20:28
god they were also i was just looking at
20:29
the names there were some other good
20:31
names because they were
20:32
pilgrims they were religious a lot of
20:33
them so they named their children
20:35
strange things like there was someone
20:36
called remember
20:37
there was someone called resolved and
20:39
someone called humility and then
20:40
actually remember they left him in the
20:42
departure
20:44
dublin airport um there was william
20:47
brewster who was one of the most famous
20:49
people who went across and became an
20:50
elder in the community
20:51
he brought his children who were called
20:53
true love and wrestling
20:55
yeah wrestling i saw that that's so cool
20:58
wrestling brewster
20:59
what's his name such a good name that's
21:01
something straight out of lock stock or
21:02
something
21:03
can i just say dan you are about to have
21:05
a baby scene yeah
21:06
wrestling is a strong name wrestling's
21:08
an incredible wrestling schreiber
21:10
yeah yeah that was good yeah or oceanus
21:12
is also a
21:14
very strong option constantly correcting
21:17
the pronunciation of his name
21:18
forevermore
21:20
it's actually anus
21:25
so they were trying to escape religious
21:29
tolerance or intolerance depending on
21:30
which way you look at it they're
21:32
basically trying to escape the anglicans
21:34
with the puritans but of the 100 just
21:36
over 100 people on the boat
21:38
more than 60 of them were anglicans so
21:40
they were trying to escape them but they
21:41
were basically with them
21:43
on the boat the whole way and they
21:45
called themselves the saints the
21:47
puritans
21:48
and they called the anglican strangers
21:51
but the crew on the mayflower called the
21:54
puritans some singing puke stockings
21:58
in a flattering way does that mean
22:00
something different i'm not sure how
22:02
that can be flattering
22:04
puke stocking i can only imagine that
22:06
they had puke colored stockings
22:08
ah okay yeah because didn't make
22:12
the mayflower left a bit later than
22:13
dementia because there was another ship
22:14
called speedwell and
22:16
there was they've both done part of the
22:18
journey but then speedwell got a leak
22:19
and so its passengers went onto
22:21
mayflower because they wasted time and
22:22
meant the mayflower had to go through
22:23
sort of choppier water and storm season
22:25
they've been trying to avoid
22:26
so you play with one of puke stocking if
22:27
you were on there so do you think maybe
22:29
they were just puking a lot that's why
22:30
they were called puke stockings pull it
22:31
into their stockings
22:34
the stick bag is the 17th century yeah
22:37
so um it's the
22:38
400th anniversary of the of the trip
22:42
in 2020 and i was reading that in order
22:45
to celebrate it there's a company
22:47
that is creating a virtual reality um so
22:50
you put on the vr
22:51
thing and it's going to place you on the
22:53
boat and it replicates the whole journey
22:55
so they're going to make it
22:56
sail from plymouth to plymouth so you
22:58
can do some virtual puking into your
23:00
stuff
23:00
exactly i wonder if that's an elephant
23:02
though
23:04
yeah exactly
23:11
okay it is time for our final fact of
23:13
the show and that is my fact
23:15
my fact this week is that a new
23:16
scientific paper on why horses only have
23:19
one toe has been published the author of
23:22
that paper
23:23
is called brianna mchorse
23:27
mchorse that's brilliant it's not even a
23:29
name it's not understanding that
23:30
anyone's
23:31
it's a name it is a name it is a name it
23:33
is a name that people have had before
23:34
yeah in fact if you go to mccourse.com
23:36
there's a man
23:37
charting all the mccourses through
23:39
history
23:40
they say that they're all descended from
23:42
john w mchorse who was born in 1819
23:45
oh really and no one's quite sure why he
23:48
got called my course because it doesn't
23:49
seem like there were any more courses
23:50
before him
23:51
but according to one idea um he was in
23:54
america
23:55
and he was hanging out with a guy called
23:57
sam houston and but he was called machus
23:59
at the time and sam houston said my
24:02
horse would be a better name for a texan
24:04
than machus
24:05
okay and so maybe the name came as a
24:08
joke
24:09
yes and mchugh's slash mchorse
24:12
went on to have 12 children so the name
24:14
spread like wildfire even in its first
24:17
generation of use
24:18
and uh if you go to mcchorus.com the guy
24:21
who runs it who is a mccourse himself
24:23
he no one else is going to be running my
24:24
course.com
24:27
he uh he has a spreadsheet of the
24:30
genealogy
24:30
and family tree of all the mccourses
24:32
since that guy and it's amazing how many
24:34
courses you can get since 1819 um
24:37
there's a lot
24:38
it's kind of cool to have a name where
24:39
you can pinpoint when it came and then
24:41
to see
24:41
like tracing it back because there's
24:42
tons of miller it's like you where if
24:44
it's if
24:48
yeah the cost does sound like it's a
24:50
burger you can get in french mcdonald's
24:51
doesn't it
24:52
yes yeah yeah it also sounds like if it
24:55
means son of
24:56
um then it sounds like you'd call
24:58
someone of course as an insulting joke
24:59
saying your mum obviously shagged a
25:01
horse
25:01
doesn't it because you're saying son of
25:03
force i'm putting that forward as an
25:04
alternative theory for the origin of the
25:06
name
25:06
based on no evidence don't tell the guy
25:08
that runs that website he'll be got it
25:10
yeah so the paper that uh mchorse
25:12
published brianna mchorse's mechanics of
25:15
evolutionary digit reduction in fossil
25:17
horses
25:18
so the thing to know about her is she
25:20
doesn't study horses for a living
25:22
she is an evolutionary biologist and
25:24
she's just been looking
25:25
into why horses now have this one toe as
25:29
opposed to
25:30
five which is what their ancestors might
25:33
have had
25:34
their ancestors might have had four on
25:35
the front and three on the back i think
25:37
okay if you look at tapias that's what
25:40
they have which is like similar to an
25:42
old kind of horse
25:43
and they reckon that basically it helps
25:46
them to run
25:46
faster and because if you've got long
25:49
slim legs with just these one toes it
25:51
helps you to gallop
25:53
and the reason they had to do that is
25:54
because they stopped living in the
25:55
forest because there were no forests
25:57
when the ice age hit america
25:58
so there were no forests they had to
26:00
live in the open so they had to run away
26:01
from predators
26:02
and so they needed really speedy legs if
26:05
horses had
26:06
feet like we have feet so like literally
26:09
a foot would that be better for them or
26:12
are they
26:12
ultimate i think what we're saying is
26:14
for what they evolved into which was
26:16
this large open pastures with no forest
26:19
this was the best that they
26:20
could come up with presumably that's how
26:22
evolution works i think probably the
26:24
more direct answer your question is no
26:26
if a horse was randomly born
26:28
with four human feet on the end of its
26:30
legs it would be at a disadvantage
26:32
but if it had human feet it could wear a
26:33
trainer as well having to go to a
26:34
blacksmith yeah so be more convenient
26:36
that's a really good point and they
26:37
don't make those bouncy nike
26:39
horse shoes today whereas they don't
26:40
even get anything also
26:42
horses did evolve in america so maybe
26:44
when this guy came over on the mayflower
26:46
he thought that he could sell his shoes
26:48
to all these people
26:49
he was like come on guys this is really
26:51
gonna help you out but you said brianna
26:53
didn't
26:53
it's not she didn't set out to study
26:55
horses but she may have been drawn
26:56
towards them so there was a 2002
26:57
academic paper about nominative
26:59
determinism which is brilliantly called
27:00
why susie sells seashells by the
27:02
seashore implicit egotism and major life
27:04
decisions which found that people
27:06
disproportionately do tend to pick
27:07
careers that mirror their names so they
27:08
have a larger proportion than you'd
27:09
expect of dentists and denises in the
27:11
dentistry industry
27:12
ah although not everyone believes it
27:15
today there have been a few papers since
27:16
that kind of think that maybe they
27:18
slightly cherry-picked their data that's
27:20
true i read that paper by albert
27:22
skeptical
27:22
he um it's really hard to please that
27:25
guy
27:26
a great one this is not nominative
27:28
determinism but i was watching
27:29
um what i lied to you last night um the
27:32
comedy panel show
27:33
and david haye the boxer was a guest on
27:35
it and he named
27:37
his son cassius after cassius clay
27:40
muhammad ali
27:41
that means his son is called cassius hay
27:44
hmm that's fantastic
27:46
okay yeah rob bryan got a big laugh on
27:48
the show
27:50
that's the way he tells him um i just
27:52
that reminded me of a
27:54
fact which is in our new fact book which
27:56
comes out this year um
27:58
which is that on the uspga most golfers
28:01
play with a glove to keep their hands
28:03
from blistering um but the one of the
28:05
only players that doesn't use a glove is
28:06
called lucas glover
28:07
you know james uh just while we're
28:09
talking sports do you know who the new
28:11
reigning
28:12
champion of most bullseyes in a minute
28:14
is
28:15
for darts um phil taylor
28:18
no um if i name a load of dance players
28:21
will i get it no
28:22
you're in the wrong industry oh is it
28:25
steve backley the javelin thrower
28:27
no robin hood it's lee mack the comedian
28:32
he set the record this year it's uh and
28:34
he beat it by
28:35
one uh for most bullseyes within a
28:37
minute and
28:38
um i learned this on a tv show called
28:40
would i lie to you
28:41
was it was it true or was it a lie it
28:43
was true how out of interest just so we
28:45
know
28:46
um how many of your facts this week have
28:48
come from would i lie to you
28:49
and should we give them the credit if
28:50
the whole thing's just that is it more
28:53
or less than 20
28:54
less that's a lie yes damn it points to
28:57
james
28:59
um have you guys ever seen you guys
29:02
would have seen this because i put it on
29:03
would i like to yeah loads of times
29:04
yeah it's great how good was that whole
29:08
cassius hay bit
29:10
um have you guys ever seen the feet of a
29:12
newborn
29:13
horse no they are incredible
29:16
so guys if you're listening at home
29:18
you've got a google image this right now
29:20
um what they look like is um i was
29:23
trying to work out a good metaphor for
29:25
them actually
29:26
how to describe them they look like kind
29:27
of a cross between a squishy
29:29
crab claw and an anemone with like a bit
29:32
of cat's pore in it
29:33
and they're really slimy and what it is
29:36
is uh
29:36
if the horse was born with its hoof
29:38
fully exposed it would damage the
29:40
mother's birth canal as it came out
29:42
and so the hoof is covered in this kind
29:44
of grotesque slimy anemone layer
29:47
which stops it from being damaged and
29:48
then it falls off as soon as the horse
29:49
is born
29:50
so the way that some animals would do it
29:52
is they would come out not quite
29:54
fully formed so that it wouldn't do that
29:55
but horses are in danger as soon as
29:57
they're born because
29:58
the mother spills uh her birth fluids
30:01
everywhere and immediately that alerts
30:03
predators to the scent
30:04
so the foal needs to be ready to run as
30:06
soon as it pops out so it pops out and
30:08
then it sheds this slimy layer of goo
30:10
on its feet and then it gallops away but
30:12
it's the most amazing thing if you see
30:14
it you would never guess it belonged to
30:16
a horse
30:16
scary isn't it with animals like that
30:18
it's almost like you're being born
30:19
into the beginning moment of the hunger
30:21
games like
30:23
the platform comes up and there's a
30:24
siren and you just have to survive
30:26
yeah you're right that's your opening
30:28
moment into life i've got something on
30:30
um a racehorse okay the greatest
30:33
racehorse of all time
30:35
he was called eclipse and was born in
30:38
the 1764
30:39
solar eclipse around that time and
30:42
that's why they got the name
30:43
uh and he had to retire from racing
30:45
because he won
30:46
so often that no one would ever bet on
30:48
any other horse no way
30:50
and at the time i mean still but at the
30:52
time horse racing was all about the
30:54
gambling
30:54
wow and so he was so good they just
30:57
wouldn't let him race anymore
30:58
and he was extremely famous bits of his
31:01
body after he died would kind of
31:02
materialize like um
31:04
holy relics so there were nine authentic
31:07
hooves of his
31:08
turned into ink stands now if he did
31:11
actually have nine legs and that could
31:12
they like winning these races
31:19

[Music]
01:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:22
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:25
coming to you from the
01:26
qi offices in covent garden my name is
01:28
dan schreiber and i am sitting here with
01:30
andrew hunter murray anna chazinski and
01:33
alex bell and once again we have
01:35
gathered around the microphones with our
01:36
four
01:37
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:39
and in no particular order
01:41
here we go starting with you andy my
01:44
fact is that the original director of
01:46
jaws was a man called richard richards
01:48
who was fired because he kept referring
01:50
to the shark as a whale
01:54
so he not read the script i don't know
01:56
if he had read it or not but he had he
01:58
definitely had
02:00
he had because it's not he when you say
02:02
he kept referring to it wasn't even like
02:03
loosely in conversation
02:04
he was in a meeting with the producers
02:07
he'd ridden a
02:08
treatment where all the way through the
02:09
treatment he kept saying and then the
02:11
whale
02:11
[Laughter]
02:14
yeah the producers have got the right to
02:16
turn the novel jewels into the film and
02:18
um
02:19
and they took him for lunch and they
02:20
decided to let him go and then they gave
02:22
it to spielberg
02:23
that's right yeah here's a classic bit
02:25
of trivia that i bet everyone who knows
02:28
jaws knows but again i didn't know this
02:30
the shark has a name oh yeah i am not in
02:33
the movie just on set
02:36
so like you know on the back of his seat
02:40
actors and directors um which was bruce
02:45
wasn't he named after steven spielberg's
02:46
lawyer that's right yeah he was named
02:48
after his lawyer who is called bruce
02:50
raynor and bruce became the name of the
02:53
shark on the set
02:54
i bet bruce is quite a good name though
02:56
isn't it for a shark
02:57
there's something about it i don't know
02:59
it's an australian sounding name i think
03:00
of sharks being australian
03:01
it's the name you know you're making
03:03
that connection it's the name of the
03:04
shark and finding nemo
03:07
that must be a nod to that it must be
03:09
absolutely well it's a good thing they
03:11
didn't give it the other nickname that
03:12
it had on set which was the great white
03:14
turd yeah
03:14
and also floors because it would never
03:17
work oh yeah
03:18
spielberg basically rewrote the movie a
03:20
bit because
03:21
they couldn't go to the shelter work it
03:23
was such a bad mechanical shark
03:25
which i mean you know if you're filming
03:26
anything mechanical in salt water it's
03:28
going to be
03:28
difficult yeah so they made three
03:31
mechanical sharks
03:32
so that they could film it from
03:33
different angles with different bits
03:35
there had to be 16 people
03:36
on a nearby floating barge operating
03:39
different bits of the shark because the
03:40
whole thing was pneumatic they had loads
03:42
and loads of pipes to operate because
03:43
they had motors which all broke so they
03:44
had to put pneumatic tubes in to make it
03:46
work which meant they had to have a huge
03:48
like operating station and it all had to
03:50
work at the same time so
03:51
they compared it to an orchestra in an
03:53
article i read so
03:55
they all had to be doing the right
03:56
things all 16 people at the right time
03:58
so it all works properly
03:59
and sometimes there will be a bit where
04:01
15 people got it right and the shark
04:02
comes out of the water as you're filming
04:04
but then it's mechanical eyes are shut
04:07
oh that shot's wasted so then you have
04:08
to go back and do it again and then
04:09
something else won't be working right or
04:11
one of the fins will be whacking why
04:12
have they given it mechanical eyelids
04:16
use the eyelids yeah does jaws ever
04:18
blink we need to re-watch that film
04:19
that's not a classic moment there's no
04:21
one-eye wink that he gives to the camera
04:24
just before he eats someone
04:26
they wanted actually the producers asked
04:28
spielberg to
04:29
train a great white shark initially for
04:31
the film yeah that is so hollywood
04:35
turns out you can't do that
04:39
that is amazing he moved on to this did
04:41
you know that for some of the shots in
04:42
order to
04:43
make the shark look bigger they used a
04:45
body double
04:46
for the guy who plays the main character
04:48
and they used they used a jockey
04:50
um because he was really small so they
04:52
used a four foot nine x
04:54
jockey to be in the shark tank just to
04:56
make it look that bit bigger but that's
04:58
a bit like in
04:58
all those films like in casablanca they
05:00
had small people wandering around
05:02
the cut out of the plane uh in that
05:04
famous last scene in the background
05:05
because it makes the plane look bigger
05:06
so they don't have to have a bigger
05:07
cutout
05:07
like that all sorts of perspective gags
05:09
like that do you know one of the main
05:11
problems with
05:11
jaws the mechanical one it's the jaws
05:15
the jaws are not right in the jaws of
05:17
the thing
05:18
they're not right for a shark or they
05:20
shouldn't work they're not right for a
05:21
shark
05:22
i'm sure they wouldn't work at various
05:23
points but this is really interesting i
05:24
think great white sharks have a much
05:26
weaker bite than you might
05:27
suspect they're not weak no one's saying
05:30
they're weak
05:31
but their jaws aren't attached to their
05:33
head properly so they operate with a
05:35
separate
05:36
muscle and what that means is what they
05:38
can do is
05:39
approach you in the water and give you a
05:42
test bite which is soft
05:44
and then if they like the taste of you
05:45
and they think you'll be good they come
05:47
back for a kill bite
05:48
so loads of people who've had a tangle
05:51
with a great white shark and escaped
05:52
have probably been given a test bite
05:54
which is still serious and you can still
05:56
bleed to death obviously but they
05:57
haven't been given the full
05:59
kill i do that with food it's really
06:01
weird alex
06:02
it's not going to a restaurant
06:06
because then you you walk off around the
06:08
restaurant
06:09
once you've given it the test
06:12
um but the jaws obviously on the
06:14
mechanical truck they don't have those
06:15
two gradations so it's just a massive
06:17
hinge and it's just
06:18
it just noshes away so why do they do
06:21
the test by
06:22
why don't they just go in with a big
06:23
bite is it safe energy or something well
06:25
they might not like
06:26
what they eat you know they might they
06:28
might find oh it's all full of bone and
06:30
i don't want to eat the bone
06:31
they might say oh i'll go off and find a
06:32
seal to eat instead because they're all
06:33
blubber and delicious so i guess when
06:34
you've got a mouth that big you're kind
06:35
of committing when you're biting
06:37
something you've got to do something
06:38
with it yeah what if there's a tree
06:39
floating in the water and you make a
06:40
mistake if you go in for a massive kill
06:41
bite
06:42
you're just chewing on bark you're
06:43
feeling like an idiot yeah whereas if
06:45
you give it a quick test no it's a tree
06:46
i knew it was true
06:47
um so here's something interesting when
06:49
they first put
06:50
the shark into salt water it sank
06:54
so when they were gonna film and they
06:55
had to retrieve it from the bottom of
06:57
martha's vineyard
06:58
and it's because it was salt water and
07:00
they'd only ever tested it
07:02
in fresh water okay which they were
07:04
expecting that it was going to work like
07:05
it did in fresh water but then it sank
07:07
to the bottom
07:08
which is the exact opposite of how a
07:09
real shark would work
07:11
and do you remember i mentioned this a
07:12
few episodes ago on the podcast
07:14
they don't have a swim bladder and so
07:16
they don't often go into
07:18
fresh water because it doesn't work
07:20
there so they'll sink in fresh water
07:22
but i don't understand so obviously
07:24
salty water is more buoyant
07:26
and so i don't understand what would
07:28
sink in salt water that wouldn't sink in
07:30
fresh water no one does i don't think
07:32
this is one of those universal mysteries
07:33
that
07:35
no one does but which i mean i don't
07:37
know
07:39
i've got something so bizarre that i
07:40
found out in the course of this which is
07:42
that
07:43
it is related but you're not going to
07:44
know why initially so
07:46
polygraph tests are sold very often um
07:49
across the u.s like you can sell your
07:51
polygraph testing services
07:53
for various reasons and all the websites
07:56
that advertise polygraph tests say
07:58
um you can use these for and then
08:00
there's a list of the main things you
08:01
use them for
08:02
so for theft arson murder robbery
08:05
infidelity assault
08:07
and fishing tournaments and it turns out
08:10
so i learned this looking at these shark
08:11
catching tournaments
08:12
and the idea is that you go and you have
08:14
to catch the biggest shark that you
08:15
possibly can
08:16
and one of the main uses of polygraph
08:18
tests is
08:19
having lie detector tests after these
08:21
tournaments to check that people haven't
08:22
cheated
08:23
no yeah this is what and it's on all
08:25
these line detector websites they're
08:27
like yeah
08:27
murder arson cheating wives fishing
08:30
tournaments
08:30
obviously why are you cheating they're
08:32
shocked because sharks
08:34
what you do is there are sharks sales
08:36
people who collect large sharks
08:37
throughout the year and keep them alive
08:39
and then they flog them to people who've
08:40
entered the tournament
08:41
[Music]
08:44
at the tournament with a giant shark in
08:46
your bag
08:48
get on a boat and slowly lower it for
08:51
your jacket
08:52
that's why bag searches originally come
08:54
from sharks all right
08:57
uh the guy who was the guy who at the
08:59
original book he really regrets
09:00
eventually writing it yeah so pete
09:01
eventually
09:02
regretted the fact that sharks were
09:04
vilified via
09:05
jaws and suddenly it set off this spate
09:08
of shark hunting and shark murdering
09:10
expeditions
09:11
and shark populations in america were
09:13
reduced by up to 50
09:15
some people say um not just because of
09:18
shark hunting but that was a huge thing
09:19
and it still happens today these shark
09:21
hunting
09:22
tournaments um caused by the fact that
09:24
it created this bad reputation for
09:25
sharks who obviously only kill about
09:27
one person every two years whereas we
09:30
kill hundreds of thousands of them every
09:31
year look at something like a hundred
09:33
million sharks per year
09:37
it's a massive number there's also that
09:38
great fact about how vending machines
09:40
killed twice as many humans as sharks
09:42
yeah but if we had a shark in the
09:45
corridor
09:46
i think the figures might start creeping
09:48
up
09:50
like you could only get a twix by
09:52
reaching into the mouth of a shark
09:57
[Music]
10:00
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:03
that is
10:04
alex my fact this week is that until the
10:06
1960s
10:07
high-speed trains in britain would drop
10:09
carriages off at stations that they
10:11
weren't stopping at
10:13
so your trailer's going along yeah and
10:16
all the people in the back
10:17
carriage want to get off at the next
10:19
stop but the train's not stopping
10:20
there's a high speed train it's a high
10:21
speed train
10:22
so you have to run into the back
10:24
carriage and then they just cut it off
10:26
yeah i don't think everyone would like i
10:27
think they would get in and sit at the
10:29
back carriage but you wouldn't just like
10:30
run and jump as the carriage was like
10:32
leaving the train but they would
10:33
uncouple the train as they were
10:34
approaching the station
10:35
and there would be a guard in that
10:37
carriage with a break
10:38
and then the carriage would just roll to
10:40
a stop at station which meant that
10:42
anyone who wanted to get off that
10:43
station could but it wouldn't slow down
10:44
the train so what would they do with
10:46
then the carriage
10:47
oh this is the clever bit because the
10:48
carriages would then be picked up by the
10:49
next slow train that was coming through
10:51
so the slow trains would actually get
10:52
carriages added on
10:54
why is it only high-speed trains it
10:55
seems like they're the most difficult
10:57
trains to accurately drop off a carriage
10:59
at a station i don't think the high
11:00
speed trains are going
11:01
faster than the actual trains its high
11:03
speed is in express trains they're not
11:04
stopping at the stations that's what
11:06
takes longer
11:07
so when did they stop doing this well
11:09
they did it for like 40 50 years and
11:10
then finished in the 1960s
11:12
and now the replacement service is when
11:14
you get on a train and it splits in two
11:15
parts when you get to a certain station
11:18
that's so cool so like in theory our
11:19
grandparents should remember that
11:22
yeah if they lived in england you know
11:23
they might have been on one of the
11:25
jettisoned
11:26
it was a pretty common thing yeah wow
11:27
another thing you could do until the
11:28
1970s
11:29
so this is from 1889 to the 1970s is
11:32
anyone on the train
11:33
could cause the train to brake and this
11:35
still happens in trains around the world
11:37
quite a bit
11:38
yeah but now i think the driver has an
11:40
override button
11:41
so but i didn't realize this there was a
11:43
there was a cord that ran all the way
11:44
from
11:45
you know where the driver's sitting and
11:46
where the brakes are all the way along
11:48
the roof
11:48
to the back of the train and a little
11:50
cord drops down in each carriage and you
11:51
pull it
11:52
but what you have now is you pull the
11:54
cord
11:55
and the driver has three seconds to
11:56
decide whether to override it
11:58
so if the driver sees the cord's been
12:00
pulled yeah he's got three seconds to
12:02
make a crucial decision of
12:04
is it worth stopping for this emergency
12:06
i don't know what this emergency is
12:07
probably because a passenger has done it
12:09
and i can't see it
12:10
yeah but what what kind of information
12:12
can he get in those three things yeah
12:13
yeah how does that help well exactly
12:15
i don't know maybe maybe he's running
12:17
late
12:18
it can't be that bad but maybe he thinks
12:20
we're coming into a station in a minute
12:23
do
12:23
it better maybe that's it he has got a
12:26
communication line with the passengers
12:28
pulled the cord as well so he can just
12:30
shout really quick
12:30
quick what's going on you wouldn't have
12:33
time three seconds
12:36
most of my conversations with my father
12:38
are about three seconds
12:39
we say everything we need to um yeah i
12:43
was on a train to edinburgh
12:44
not too long ago and in the bathroom
12:47
just above the toilet
12:48
there was a big red button that said
12:50
stop we're in the bathroom
12:52
it's in the toilet and it won't go down
12:54
like yeah
12:55
it was a train stop button in the toilet
12:57
it's interesting you raised the toilet
12:58
thing
12:59
because there's a blog by someone who
13:00
works in railways who says that this is
13:01
a serious problem with the emergency
13:03
button because it is in the accessible
13:05
toilets and people often pull it
13:06
thinking it's the flush
13:07
yes um if you're an older person you're
13:09
a bit confused or a bit drunk then
13:11
it often gets pulled to flush the loo
13:12
and then you've braked the train okay so
13:14
one in ten
13:15
train carriages in the uk still
13:17
jettisons
13:18
uh toilet waste onto the track
13:22
one in ten this was in 2015 so they are
13:24
trying to replace them all by 2020
13:26
but it's still quite a large number yeah
13:28
and that's why there are signs saying
13:29
don't
13:30
flush at stations at stations but it's
13:32
pretty medieval it's
13:34
pretty medieval well there was a massive
13:35
report in wales online recently
13:37
um in which they said it's disgusting
13:39
look at all this excrement on the train
13:41
tracks and they showed a picture of it
13:42
but then they pixelated
13:44
everything you could possibly object to
13:45
so it's just a picture of a train track
13:48
what so what do the others do do they
13:49
have a sewage system they just store it
13:51
in the trees
13:52
yeah yeah and then they fling it out
13:54
over the countryside whether they
13:56
change it when they're serviced could
13:57
they not build underneath the tracks
13:59
just speaking of the excrement bits
14:02
well and a big train at nappy
14:05
yes you just lay the train on it's back
14:09
on a massive mat
14:12
sorry then what were you going no it's
14:13
honestly way better than what i was
14:14
trying to say
14:15
we'll leave it at that did you know we
14:17
used to have sail trains
14:18
in this country no what's a sail train
14:21
trains with
14:22
a sail and uh these existed as you'd
14:25
imagine in kind of windier areas
14:27
so on the coast and in
14:30
yorkshire there was one um there was one
14:33
in 1831
14:34
one opened which took produce from the
14:36
strathmore valley which is in scotland
14:38
to dundee
14:39
um but obviously i had the problem if
14:41
it's quite hard to attack
14:43
on a train way you can't really control
14:45
the angle of which you're going
14:47
um and so they had to have a horse
14:49
trotting alongside it at all times to
14:50
take over when the wind dropped
14:52
so it's very difficult to get every
14:53
passenger to duck when the boom goes
14:55
over
14:57
yeah that in in china remember i had
15:00
that fact in the super early days of the
15:01
podcast about
15:02
they have wheelbarrows in china that we
15:05
still don't know about
15:06
so in they used to do that in china and
15:08
there's descriptions of it where
15:10
this guy would see a fleet of sails
15:12
coming
15:13
when he looked over a mountaintop in a
15:14
field and what it was is that they used
15:16
to put giant sails on their wheelbarrows
15:18
and let the wind
15:19
help them carry along that's okay
15:21
they're a load yeah it's amazing isn't
15:23
it
15:23
do you know what the longest train ever
15:24
was the longest train running at the
15:26
moment it's in
15:27
someone's native country who knows where
15:30
dan's from
15:30
it's in australia oh it's in australia
15:32
it's called the gun
15:34
g-h-a-n gun gun so
15:37
the sunday service of the gun is 44
15:39
carriages
15:40
it's 0.7 miles long it's about a 15
15:43
minute walk
15:44
how long how far does it travel is it
15:45
like it only moves about two meters and
15:47
then it's at the next station and you
15:48
have to walk all the way out of the
15:50
train oh yeah it doesn't even need to go
15:51
yeah if you're at the wrong end of that
15:53
the buffet carriage is
15:55
at the back of this oh you'd starve
15:56
anyway but um so
15:58
if you built a car that long yeah that's
16:01
impressive
16:02
but a train you're just adding carriages
16:04
right yeah yeah is that impressive
16:06
yeah effectively that could be much
16:08
longer if they just added more
16:10
let's do those freight trains that are
16:11
like five six congresses long time oh so
16:13
is this a passenger ship this is a
16:14
passenger
16:14
yeah but you need platforms long enough
16:18
that's the really those are the unsung
16:20
heroes
16:22
pouring concrete for a year at the
16:24
desert yeah so where does it go to
16:26
it goes across australia right so it's a
16:27
proper yeah i think it goes all the way
16:29
from the north coast to the south
16:30
huge long road yeah that's amazing so
16:32
you'd need that you'd need that for
16:34
a variety of fun um there's probably
16:37
play rooms in there there's probably a
16:38
barbers there's probably a cinema
16:40
there's probably
16:41
none of these things are facts
16:46
you can't just make up what your fantasy
16:48
big
16:55
and remember it as genuine knowledge i
16:58
said probably
16:58
i know but yeah i mean that's that in
17:01
itself is problematic saying probably
17:03
really but the balance of probability
17:05
says there will be one of them
17:07
but it probably is there possibly
17:10
is there probably isn't i think that
17:13
probably is
17:14
you can't say there probably isn't
17:16
there's a microscopically small chance
17:18
that there are all of those things you
17:19
just listed
17:20
as far as we can go with this fact i
17:22
think okay god
17:23
um this is really cool in japan they're
17:26
now building new trains
17:28
that are invisible no they're not no
17:30
they're not
17:32
what they are is kind of invisible
17:34
they're sort of almost invisible
17:36
they've put this mirrored surface on the
17:38
outside of it so it blends into its
17:40
surroundings by reflecting so if you're
17:42
going through
17:43
nature for example and you're surrounded
17:44
by trees blue sky green grass all that
17:46
sort of stuff
17:47
if that's on the other side of it that
17:49
kind of mirrors off the side of the
17:50
train
17:51
therefore oh so you're not just going to
17:53
see hundreds of passengers like sitting
17:54
and nothing
17:55
it's not that yeah it's good so if
17:57
you're going on a nice countryside walk
17:59
and your footpath crosses over a railway
18:01
then now you won't be able to see the
18:02
train coming yes exactly
18:04
sounds ideal you'll just see yourself
18:06
coming towards you at high speed
18:09
that guy is running fast
18:14
[Music]
18:17
okay it is time for fact number three
18:19
and that is chizinski
18:21
my fact this week is that birds in cages
18:23
hop in the direction they're meant to be
18:25
migrating
18:26
wow that's very sad do they do that
18:30
only during migrating periods yes this
18:33
is the amazing thing about it
18:34
if you've got a caged bird that's a
18:36
migrating bird then as soon as the time
18:38
comes when it would usually be migrating
18:40
first of all it puts on all this body
18:41
fat because that's what birds do so
18:43
a lot of birds will double their body
18:45
weight in preparation for big migrations
18:47
so it'll put on all this weight and
18:49
it'll get really really restless and
18:50
frisky and start flapping around the
18:52
cage
18:52
and then when the migration period
18:53
starts it will then start moving towards
18:56
the end of the cage that is in the
18:57
direction of where it would be migrating
18:59
and it will stop at exactly the time
19:01
that it would have arrived at its
19:02
destination
19:03
wow um so perfectly timed but it's now
19:06
fat
19:07
exactly doubled its weight and it can't
19:09
burn the weight off and it's not where
19:10
it wants to be
19:11
yeah just in terms of uh observation of
19:14
that
19:15
you obviously see the bird hopping that
19:17
way but it will reach the end of the
19:18
cage yeah it's a good point isn't it so
19:20
it doesn't just hang by the end of the
19:22
cage the whole time right therefore
19:23
some people must observe the bird
19:25
hopping the other way uh yeah so i think
19:27
it will kind of maybe wander backwards a
19:29
bit this is actually not explained in a
19:31
lot of the sources that reference it but
19:32
what it does do is it faces in that
19:34
direction
19:35
it will try to flap towards that
19:36
direction and then get rebounded off the
19:38
cage
19:39
i guess and also what they do is they'll
19:40
sit on their perch facing the direction
19:42
they're supposed to be going
19:43
and they'll flap their wings a lot but
19:45
stay motionless because they realize
19:46
they can't get out of the cage
19:48
um during migration extraordinaire do
19:50
you know how they found out about this
19:51
or one of the ways they found out about
19:53
this
19:53
is with a device called an emlin funnel
19:56
yeah
19:56
it's a very cool thing so it's a plastic
19:58
enclosure with a paper funnel leading
20:00
out from the
20:01
top of that on the base of the funnel is
20:04
ink pad so you put the bird in there
20:07
you cover the top of the funnel so it
20:10
can't just fly out
20:11
and then you track the direction it
20:13
moves in and as it flaps
20:14
it leaves foot marks in the ink on the
20:17
paper
20:18
yeah so you can tell exactly the
20:19
direction it's moving and flapping in
20:21
and they have
20:21
at the surface you have um you can
20:23
project different star constellations on
20:25
the top
20:26
to see if that has an effect because
20:27
sometimes they go magnetically but
20:29
sometimes they might do it by looking at
20:30
the stars above them yeah that's
20:32
horrible that's like the truman show for
20:33
birds it is
20:34
yeah eventually they end up just writing
20:36
messages in the ink saying please god
20:38
somebody let me out of here
20:40
once they discovered this then people
20:42
realized you could do these brilliant
20:43
experiments to work out what it was that
20:45
causes birds to migrate in certain
20:46
directions so as you say andy
20:48
you could change the constellations to
20:50
see if they navigated by that
20:51
you change the magnetic field around a
20:53
bird's cage so obviously they navigate
20:55
by
20:55
um the magnetism of the earth and so if
20:58
you put a couple of magnets
20:59
you create a magnetic field around a
21:00
bird cage and change the direction they
21:02
think is north
21:03
they'll suddenly point in a different
21:04
direction i heard on the radio the other
21:07
day that
21:08
whales that suddenly get lost in the
21:10
ocean they think it's actually down to
21:12
solar flares because the solar flares
21:14
mess with the magnetism of the earth if
21:16
you get hit by massive ones so
21:18
suddenly the whales would be put on a
21:19
different course and that's why
21:21
groups of them have been that's not a
21:22
solid theory but because they just
21:24
are trying to work out why seemingly
21:26
healthy groups of whales get lost
21:28
that's amazing uh just one more thing
21:31
except related to this
21:32
there was so there was this amazing
21:33
experiment done recently into
21:35
reed warblers that were picked up in
21:37
russia and it was to work out exactly
21:39
how much burs can tell
21:41
if you change the magnetic field so
21:43
scientists went they found some reed
21:44
warblers in russia
21:45
and they created a magnetic field around
21:48
their enclosure
21:49
that mimicked conditions in aberdeen um
21:52
and the weird thing about this is that
21:54
it's a very distinctive magnetic flavor
21:56
of aberdeen lots of oil refineries
21:59
yeah we've been held hard times recently
22:01
yeah exactly some weather spoons
22:03
so they did this but the weird thing was
22:06
that
22:06
aberdeen is on roughly the same line of
22:08
latitude so the same distance from the
22:10
equator
22:11
as the place in russia where they've
22:13
studied the birds and so you would have
22:15
thought that
22:16
for them if they're just testing the
22:17
magnetic distance from the poles
22:19
they would think it was the same place
22:21
but it turns out they can tell how far
22:22
east or west they are as well
22:24
so what happened was all they did was
22:26
change the magnetic field
22:28
and the birds would usually point west
22:30
because they would migrate to
22:32
europe so southwest and as soon as you
22:34
change the field the birds swiveled
22:35
round and they pointed east
22:37
knowing that they're in aberdeen and
22:39
they need to point in exactly
22:40
a different direction in order to get
22:42
where they're going to migrate to
22:44
they're very clever very cool it's so
22:46
weird that we're missing this
22:48
thing that all these animals have it's
22:51
so annoying we've got
22:52
nothing that even remotely makes us go
22:54
oh i can relate to that
22:56
which is nothing there's no sense of
22:57
magnetism that's crazy
22:59
the thing you said about how they put on
23:01
how birds put on loads of weight before
23:03
they migrate so that they've got enough
23:04
energy to get them through
23:07
it's amazing even their organs grow and
23:09
shrink
23:10
in this period so all the organs
23:13
involved with
23:14
feeding like the stomach and the liver
23:16
and the kidneys and so on they get
23:17
bigger
23:18
to support the fueling process but then
23:21
when during the takeoff for migration
23:23
those organs shrink
23:24
and then the heart and the flight
23:26
muscles they all grow
23:28
so there's a complete reconfiguration
23:30
they're changing the way the plane is
23:31
built as they fly
23:32
oh so cool wow that is amazing that is
23:36
awesome um i should actually say that
23:38
loads of what i'm saying comes from an
23:40
episode of in our time
23:41
including the headline fact which is on
23:43
bird migration which is brilliant you
23:44
should look it up in our time's always
23:45
good
23:46
yeah do you um i when planet earth was
23:49
coming out
23:50
the david adam wrote documentary i was
23:52
sat watching aleister father gill
23:54
who is the program maker behind blue
23:57
planet
23:58
and planet earth i went to a chat that
24:00
he did a sort of talk at the bbc
24:02
and he was talking about his favorite
24:04
moment being the moment that the birds
24:06
had to migrate over everest in order to
24:09
migrate they had to go
24:10
over mount everest and it took every
24:13
ounce of their energy
24:14
you get geese flying over mount everest
24:16
do you go to the top mount everest
24:18
you've
24:18
taken all your energy you just see a
24:20
flock of geese flying over you
24:22
are they are they using thermals are
24:24
they flying
24:25
they are flying they never stop flapping
24:27
their wings they never glide
24:29
they never glide they never get it's so
24:31
rough
24:32
like that there's only i think what is
24:34
it a tenth of the oxygen
24:36
yeah you find at sea level obviously
24:38
when you're up that high and they're
24:39
still managing to fly
24:40
all the time so they are panting
24:41
presumably at that point we worked out
24:43
that geese couldn't glide as in have we
24:46
have we tried to
24:48
make anyone's ever stuffed a dead goose
24:50
and turn it into a glider
24:53
what i mean is like do scientists
24:55
knowing the makeup of a makeup a geese
24:57
no they could do it they just haven't
24:58
worked out to do it they just don't have
25:00
the confidence
25:03
because presumably if they're up there
25:04
and their wings are you know they've got
25:06
wings
25:07
surely just spreading them out must buy
25:09
them some glide type things i think
25:10
they're quite heavy creatures they're
25:11
quite i don't know i really don't know
25:13
they wouldn't be able to
25:14
because because of evolution so the ones
25:15
that tried a long time
25:17
the old evolution explains evolution
25:20
that's your answer every week there was
25:23
once a goose like you died
25:27
when is god going to be the answer
25:28
[Laughter]
25:32
[Music]
25:35
okay there's time for our final fact of
25:37
the show and that
25:38
is my fact my fact is that
25:42
each year 26 tons of clothing
25:45
is left behind at the starting line of
25:47
the boston marathon
25:49
that is one ton for every mile of the
25:52
marathon
25:53
but why i mean why people are people
25:55
just taking off all their clothes when
25:56
they get to the start of the marathon
25:58
this is exactly what's happening uh it's
26:00
early in the morning it's gonna be cold
26:02
so they bring long trackies a zip up
26:05
jacket or whatever
26:06
and then when the marathon starts they
26:08
take off the outer clothing so that
26:10
they're in the classic marathon runner
26:11
clothing
26:12
and they just drop it they just drop it
26:13
where it is that may be difficult if
26:15
you're riding the back of the marathon
26:16
you've got a huge there's like
26:17
a horse jump together yeah really good
26:21
point
26:21
yeah i think they chuck it to the side
26:23
okay uh this is an article that was
26:25
written
26:25
about a person in america called judy
26:28
potassi
26:28
and judy potassi used to help marathon
26:31
runners if they you know needed
26:32
somewhere
26:33
some coffee and some tea and stuff it
26:35
was just generally a helpful person
26:36
loved the marathon and for years runners
26:39
would be doing this just taking off
26:40
those bits of clothing leaving on the
26:42
ground
26:42
and occasionally charities would come
26:44
and collect some of them and bring them
26:45
to charities
26:46
and in one year no charities came and
26:49
they bagged up all the stuff and they
26:50
threw it in the trash and that really
26:51
infuriated her because she said this is
26:53
such a waste so she's made it her
26:54
mission
26:55
to now collect all of these clothes and
26:57
to begin with it wasn't as much
26:59
as 26 tons it was even less it changes
27:02
all the time the latest article the
27:03
article i'm specifically getting it from
27:05
it was 26 that they managed to collect
27:07
obviously it varies year by year
27:10
the exact quote from her is now i have
27:12
201 volunteers we cover all the way
27:15
to ashland town line and we've gotten up
27:17
to 52
27:18
000 pounds which is the equivalent of 26
27:21
tons that is amazing and the reason it's
27:24
gone up dramatically is because there
27:26
used to be a bus service right at the
27:27
end of
27:28
the boston marathon that would bring you
27:29
back to the start so people could
27:31
collect their clothes
27:32
but they cancelled the bus service so
27:34
now all of these clothes people just go
27:36
well you know what we'll just leave it
27:37
there so they now collect these all and
27:39
they give them to charities and raise
27:40
so much money but yeah there must be an
27:43
awareness thing as well though if you
27:44
run
27:44
you know what's going to happen to the
27:45
closer you think well i might as well
27:46
bring loads of clothes and
27:48
i would hope so because i can't believe
27:50
running a marathon is hard enough
27:51
without having to admit to yourself that
27:52
you have to lose an entire outfit in the
27:54
process
27:55
and also i'm the kind of unlikable
27:57
person who would definitely throw my
27:59
clothes aside
28:00
bear in mind where i'd thrown them and
28:01
then walk back a bit later to pick them
28:03
up and i'd be pretty irritated
28:06
down by that point so there's a thing
28:09
about the boston marathon which is that
28:10
it's for
28:11
it's for very good runners in obviously
28:13
all marathons are very very good runners
28:14
but
28:15
only the fastest amateurs get in and
28:17
qualify for the boston marathon
28:19
so there is a guy his name is derek
28:22
murphy he's an american man
28:23
and he is a marathon enthusiast and
28:26
he's made it his life's work to spot
28:29
people cheating in marathons
28:31
from hundreds of miles away hundreds of
28:33
miles away yeah he's got this incredible
28:35
telescope but it's only 26 miles
28:41
some really elaborate cheating going on
28:43
like when you run the other way around
28:44
the world
28:44
yes um so the bbc did a profile of him
28:48
he has this blog called marathon
28:49
investigation
28:50
and he started wondering you know
28:52
whether people cheat to get to qualify
28:53
for the boston marathon they'll run
28:55
another marathon
28:56
which you have to do and he looks at
28:57
suspiciously fast times
28:59
and he looks at photos taken during the
29:01
race to see if he can track people down
29:03
so he's caught people who've used other
29:05
people's bib numbers
29:06
or he's caught people who've perhaps
29:08
missed out stages throughout
29:10
but he has also vindicated at least one
29:12
person where the authorities thought
29:13
that runner was cheating
29:15
and he managed to find the evidence to
29:16
say no i don't think his person was
29:18
cheating
29:19
why is he i mean i really support
29:21
vigilante
29:22
justice in certain cases i suppose
29:26
but is this a major problem in morality
29:29
and
29:29
crime if you support batman you should
29:32
support this guy
29:33
that's what i'm saying because he's like
29:35
imagine the downgrade that batman
29:37
would have to take to be doing that so
29:40
in 1980 there was a woman called rosie
29:43
ruiz who was declared the winner of the
29:45
of the of the marathon um but then was
29:47
it was later found out that she'd taken
29:48
the subway for part of the way
29:50
yeah come as if no one noticed her
29:53
ducking out of the marathon popping into
29:55
a subway station and then
29:56
you probably think someone's ducking out
29:58
just to get themselves the drink or
30:00
ducking out all together yeah yeah being
30:02
like
30:02
actually this is not it can't be lined
30:04
all the way can it it's 1980 as well
30:06
maybe it was just less organized but i
30:08
think the suspicious bit is when you
30:09
come out of the subway and join the race
30:10
that's the crucial that's true
30:12
yeah i read about it lady because you
30:14
know you can go off trail
30:15
um a florida woman who became lost
30:18
during a half marathon
30:20
when she just took the wrong corner um
30:22
so she was found nearly 12 hours later
30:24
in the middle of a 25 000 acre park just
30:27
completely lost
30:29
at what point do you think you stop
30:31
running
30:33
at what point is it obvious to you that
30:34
you've you're now no longer running the
30:36
marathon
30:37
yes do you think she just thought she
30:40
was way ahead
30:42
i didn't know that um you know that you
30:44
have to wear one of those bibs when you
30:46
run a marathon yeah
30:47
they have trackers in them and they have
30:49
mats across the
30:51
marathon course what which
30:53
electronically log you
30:55
making particular checkpoints along the
30:56
way that is an amazing sure anyone who's
30:59
ever run a marathon knows that but i had
31:00
no idea that's like in a computer game
31:02
when you get hit checkpoints exactly
31:04
yeah
31:04
and so and so sometimes that's a way of
31:06
identifying cheaters if the bib missed
31:08
out several checkpoints
31:09
yeah yeah so another cheetah there was a
31:12
woman called catherine schweizer
31:14
who so maybe your guy with a telescope
31:16
might want to get onto her
31:18
she was a woman and she tried to run the
31:20
marathon in 1967
31:22
and she registered with just her
31:24
initials so it was gender neutral so it
31:26
wasn't known that she was a woman
31:27
and she ran the marathon and people were
31:30
quite supportive in the crowds but then
31:32
jock semple who was a race official was
31:34
really against the idea of women running
31:35
people thought women were way too
31:36
fragile
31:37
it kind of muddied the masculinity of
31:39
the sport for men
31:40
and so he stormed onto the track and
31:42
tried to drag her off it
31:44
at which point her boyfriend came and
31:46
kind of defended her
31:47
which is a little bit annoying from the
31:49
feminist perspective but her boyfriend
31:50
came on and pushed jock's emperor out of
31:52
the way
31:52
and she finished and the nice thing
31:54
about her is that this
31:55
year was the 50th anniversary of when
31:58
she did that and she ran it again great
32:00
yeah she wasn't a cheater though was she
32:03
yeah she cheated by pretending to be a
32:04
man okay technically speaking she wasn't
32:06
allowed to enter
32:07
yes right yeah i guess so she's the bad
32:10
guy in this story
32:12
the furthest away i guess that the
32:14
marathon has ever been run off the
32:16
course since we're talking about that is
32:18
uh sunita williams who's a nasa
32:19
astronaut and she ran it while she was
32:21
on the international space station
32:22
on a treadmill so someone argued she was
32:24
going way faster than anyone else
32:26
because she was
32:26
oh yeah watching the earth at the same
32:28
time there's a thing about the berlin
32:29
marathon which is that loads of
32:31
records get broken on that marathon
32:33
course and not for example on the london
32:35
one or the kuala lumpur one or the
32:36
boston one
32:37
and there are all these reasons which
32:39
combine to make berlin one of the best
32:40
places to break a speed record
32:42
so it's really flat there are very few
32:45
corners uh it's never more than 53
32:47
meters above sea level
32:48
so lots of lovely oxygen and it's in
32:50
september which is quite a good time of
32:51
year because the weather's not crazy
32:53
and it's mostly on asphalt and so there
32:55
are all of these different
32:56
combination factors that conspire to
32:59
make it a great
33:00
record whereas boston the boston
33:01
marathon course the finish line is so
33:04
much lower than the starting line
33:05
that it is ineligible for world record
33:07
attempts no
33:09
way because you're running down here
33:10
basically running downhill
33:12
wow no way why don't they just move it
33:15
then
33:15
i don't know i'll put it the other way
33:16
around
33:17
[Laughter]
33:20
record-breaking the boss of marathon is
33:21
a quite interesting thing so in 2010
33:23
a guy broke the world record for the
33:25
boston marathon his name was robert k
33:27
cheerio from kenya but he broke the
33:29
record that was set previously
33:31
by a man also named robert k cheerio by
33:34
complete coincidence no relationship no
33:36
relationship so weird right he must have
33:38
changed his name to no no i mean i
33:41
suppose
33:42
maybe maybe it's a more common name
33:43
maybe it's a bit like a john smith for
33:46
your name or something but that's
33:47
amazing um so the first
33:49
african person to win the boston
33:51
marathon one in 1988
33:52
um i guess probably because logistics
33:55
got easier for people to enter at that
33:56
point maybe from abroad
33:58
so 1988 was the first african person to
34:00
win it it was ibrahim hussein from kenya
34:02
since then there have only been three
34:04
winners who haven't been kenya not
34:06
ethiopian
34:09
he all just went oh we're actually much
34:12
better at this than these guys
34:18

00:46
you're about to hear
00:47
so enjoy this week's app here we go
00:59
[Music]
01:05
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:08
no such thing as a fish
01:09
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:11
qi offices in covent garden
01:13
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
01:15
here with anna chazinski
01:16
andrew hunter murray and jason haisley
01:19
and once again we have gathered around
01:20
the microphones with our four favorite
01:22
facts from the last
01:23
seven days and in no particular order
01:26
here we
01:26
go starting with you jason
01:29
my fact is the curator of the british
01:32
lawnmower museum
01:34
is allergic to grass
01:35
[Laughter]
01:38
so is it his mission to destroy all the
01:39
grass in the world
01:41
with the lawn mowers i'm mowing it away
01:43
yeah exactly yeah yeah
01:44
so it's something very hateful that
01:46
museum
01:48
one act of revenge yeah a gigantic scale
01:51
this is a guy called brian raddam who
01:53
runs the british lawnmower museum in
01:55
southport
01:56
he's an ex-lawn mower racing champion
02:00
does that mean he sits on lawn mowers
02:02
yes that's a ride them around
02:03
cool racing but he had to give up racing
02:06
because it was making him sneeze so much
02:10
so but he so he took his love of lawn
02:12
mowers and turned it into the british
02:13
lawnmower museum
02:14
which is a place to behold i have to say
02:17
have you been to it
02:17
yeah i have oh is it actually really
02:19
good it's really good because it's one
02:21
of those
02:22
odd bits of the british museum that you
02:24
sometimes get where you just get lots
02:26
and lots of iterations of the same thing
02:28
which just makes it so interesting yeah
02:31
so you're saying it's mainly lawn mowers
02:33
it is mainly law yeah they do have what
02:35
he calls
02:36
grass cutters which are lawn mowers he
02:38
doesn't like
02:41
like the flymo for instance because the
02:42
flymo doesn't have the helical
02:44
blade that cuts the grass it has a thing
02:46
that spins around and just
02:48
whacks at it so it leaves a very
02:50
unsatisfactory cut
02:51
so those are grass cutters according to
02:53
him not lawn mowers
02:55
right so this i so i know that you've
02:58
been there because i've read a book that
03:00
you wrote called bollocks to alton
03:01
towers yes
03:02
and that's a chapter in it right it is
03:04
yeah yeah so you did this as part of a
03:06
big research mission
03:07
it was yeah it was a the the mission of
03:09
the book was to try and find places to
03:10
go for a day out that were
03:12
unexpected unusual esoteric uncommercial
03:15
that sort of thing
03:16
and there's lots and lots of little
03:18
museums all over britain
03:19
you know there's a pencil museum in
03:21
keswick famously yeah
03:22
which is great oh it is great but they
03:24
had a terrible time they were really
03:25
badly flooded out
03:27
now because it does flood doesn't it
03:28
yeah and i think it was last year i
03:30
think they might have only just reopened
03:31
after this terrible terrible flooding
03:33
that they had
03:33
and pencils can survive flooding can't
03:35
they it was a pen museum that would have
03:37
been probably
03:37
terrible but you can lash the pencils
03:39
together into a massive raft
03:41
to escape a string now if it was a
03:44
blotting paper museum it would be ruined
03:46
wouldn't it
03:46
yeah disaster did you see at the lawman
03:49
museum
03:49
the celebrity lawnmowers certainly did
03:52
there is um brian may's qualcast
03:56
um they asked nicholas parsons for
04:00
a donation of a lawn mower and he agreed
04:02
and then
04:03
unfortunately his shed was broken into
04:05
and his lawnmower was stolen
04:07
so he gave them a pair of secateurs
04:09
instead
04:11
but the the crowning bit of the
04:14
celebrity department is joe pasquale
04:17
strimmer what's so great about that
04:21
well because i think just those three
04:22
words mark it out as being possibly the
04:24
finest museum exhibit in the country
04:26
don't they
04:28
what i find really weird is that
04:30
apparently they've got um albert pierre
04:32
points
04:32
one yeah the really famous hangman who
04:35
hanged over 400 people which is kind of
04:38
a morbid thing to have in the
04:39
museum and someone on uh on pinterest
04:42
pointed out when they went to the museum
04:43
that it's actually hanging by a noose
04:45
no is it so that's quite nice that is in
04:47
dubious taste
04:48
wow he just said the least he didn't mow
04:52
any of the
04:53
you know condemned people to death nor
04:55
did he hang any lawnmowers
05:00
you're right that's been misrepresented
05:02
i forgot to mention the other
05:03
significant thing about the
05:04
lawnmower museum is that it's upstairs
05:09
so all those lawn mowers must feel
05:10
fairly we're in an alien habitat
05:12
actually
05:13
that's so funny we're so far from the
05:16
thing that we wish to cut like a dalek
05:18
museum being upstairs yeah
05:20
that's great they've got a couple of
05:21
other quirky things there as well
05:22
they've got a
05:23
two-inch lawn mower which is a lawn
05:25
mower that cuts a two-inch
05:27
strip through the grass and brian radam
05:30
when he came across this thought what on
05:32
earth could this possibly have been for
05:34
so he rang the manufacturer and said why
05:35
did you make a two-inch lawn mower and
05:37
they said we deny ever making a two-inch
05:39
name
05:41
so no one knows what this thing was for
05:43
wow um
05:44
do you know about finnish postman and
05:46
lawn mowers so
05:47
postman in finland have started in the
05:49
last year mowing
05:50
their customers lawns for a small fee
05:53
because they're trying to find extra
05:54
things to do
05:55
because it doesn't take them all their
05:56
time and maybe i think post is declining
05:58
a little bit in terms of the amount of
05:59
posts
06:00
so on their quietest day which is
06:02
tuesday you can pay them i think about
06:04
60 quid a month and they'll mow your
06:06
lawn wow but you have to provide the
06:08
lawn mower
06:08
they're very insistent about that that's
06:10
like in um just on the
06:12
postman the lack of mail in new zealand
06:14
now there's a one
06:15
particular city that deliver kfc as well
06:18
as
06:18
your mail wrap it around the bucket with
06:20
an elastic band
06:22
yeah and they're doing a thing in france
06:23
where you can get postman to go and
06:25
check on your elderly relatives
06:27
if you don't want to i presume you can
06:28
pay and it's called
06:30
watch over my parents oh wow you can
06:33
order them to call in and just check no
06:34
just to check they're all right you know
06:35
either two
06:36
four or six times a week so in pre-lawn
06:39
mower days
06:40
when people used to have to mow the lawn
06:42
by hand by
06:43
scythe there would be tailor-made size
06:46
which would stay the same length and if
06:48
you wanted to cut your grass different
06:50
lengths in like the 17th 18th centuries
06:52
then you added wooden blocks to your
06:54
shoes or took them off so if you had a
06:56
lawn that you needed to be a bit longer
06:57
rather than changing the length of the
06:59
size or i guess the position where you
07:01
held it then you put some
07:02
wooden planks under your shoes what if
07:04
you were really short
07:06
and the scythe came in the same size
07:07
wouldn't you end up just hacking into
07:09
the earth
07:10
no you just have to put very large
07:12
wooden blocks under your shoes i said i
07:14
said i understand
07:18
were they an accessory that you bought
07:20
with them i'm not sure if they came as a
07:22
package i'm sure they did a two-for-one
07:23
deal but you'd have to have all your
07:24
gardeners would have to have different
07:26
size blocks wouldn't they depending on
07:28
their height yeah
07:29
and if that's probably an amusing mix-up
07:31
where two of the gardeners got the wrong
07:33
blocks on and then
07:34
you know one bit of lawn was uneven yeah
07:36
that was comedy sketches in the 18th
07:38
century were all about
07:39
incorrectly voting for us
07:43
unless you had a very strict height
07:45
policy when hiring gardeners
07:47
yeah that'd be the other thing like you
07:49
know you must be this high to go on this
07:51
ride
07:51
yes um i was trying to find other people
07:55
who were so lawnmower man
07:58
allergic to grass i managed to find a
08:00
journalist who's allergic to newspaper
08:04
yeah it's really unfortunate he has to
08:06
go right he still does his job but he
08:07
has to wear gloves now whenever he's
08:09
at the office and it's to do with the
08:11
ink that they use
08:12
inside his name's michael dresser he's
08:14
been with the paper 38 years so he's had
08:16
this allergy for a really long time
08:18
and it's the pine resin that they use in
08:20
the newspaper inc
08:21
um so yeah so he can't touch the
08:23
newspaper so he's allergic to that
08:24
found a marathon runner who's allergic
08:26
to exercise
08:28
um you can be allergic to exercise in
08:30
what way so as soon as
08:32
she uh started running and doing any
08:34
kind of exercise
08:36
she would just come out with puffiness
08:38
and and uh
08:39
rashes and all sorts does she still run
08:41
marathons
08:42
yeah she does yeah on uh other allergies
08:45
i think isn't
08:46
lisa stansfield allergic to her own
08:48
saliva
08:49
oh how do you pretty sure
08:53
sorry who is it she's a singer how do
08:56
you deal with that
08:57
um i guess get yourself a job which
08:59
involves having your mouth open a lot of
09:00
the time
09:01
like she did oh yeah wouldn't that
09:03
provoke more
09:04
saliva production good question i
09:07
haven't thought this through
09:08
maybe she had one of those dentist
09:09
things in her mouth the whole time you
09:10
know when you're
09:11
having any work done they have that
09:13
suction well that would have showed up
09:14
on her singles though wouldn't it yeah
09:15
but that might you might have mistaken
09:16
that for that sort of madonna style
09:18
uh microphone yeah she's the ones that
09:22
goes into the mouth and there's a
09:23
constant background harm on all of her
09:25
singles yeah
09:26
she's the dentist suction thing that's
09:28
incredible
09:29
yeah the other thing from the lawnmower
09:31
museum is they've got
09:33
there was a prototype of a robot
09:35
lawnmower there
09:36
called made by husqvarna i think i
09:39
pronounced that right
09:40
which cost something like a million
09:41
pounds to develop and had a retail price
09:44
of 2
09:44
000 pounds and was so expensive that
09:46
obviously it didn't sell very well
09:48
which is a shame because it's got a
09:50
brilliant anti-theft device built into
09:52
it
09:52
if it detects it's being stolen it
09:55
starts
09:56
screaming so
09:59
developed a screaming robot
10:02
[Laughter]
10:03
if only nicolas parsons had had one
10:05
[Laughter]
10:10
[Music]
10:12
okay it's time for fact number two and
10:14
that is chozinski
10:16
my fact this week is that jimmy carter
10:18
once gave a speech
10:19
in poland where he accidentally
10:21
announced he wanted to have sex with all
10:22
polish people so when he said we never
10:26
fired a bullet was he just talking about
10:28
sexual frustration
10:31
this was so it was his first trip abroad
10:33
as president uh it was in 1977
10:36
and he had this translator called steven
10:38
seymour and uh he was a good translator
10:40
but polish was his fourth language
10:42
and he was having to translate into
10:44
polish and usually a translator is
10:45
translating
10:46
from the language into english if
10:49
they're your translator but
10:50
jimmy carter asked him to translate his
10:52
speech into polish for the polish people
10:54
and he translated the phrase
10:57
i want to get to know the polish people
10:59
better as i want to have sex with the
11:01
polish
11:02
i want to have carnal sexual knowledge
11:04
of the polish people
11:06
so that's what he did and he made all
11:07
these other mistakes in this speech as
11:09
well for instance he opened it by
11:10
trying to say i left the u.s just this
11:13
morning to come here
11:14
and he ended up saying i left the u.s
11:16
never to return
11:18
it started he was moving to poland
11:21
that would be a major league defection
11:24
coup for the soviets
11:26
it would i read that another of the
11:29
reasons was that seymour the original
11:31
translator was a really good translator
11:33
of written
11:34
polish but it wasn't quite so good at
11:36
simultaneous spoken translation
11:39
i see maybe that was something to do
11:40
yeah okay yeah so we should have been
11:42
writing it down
11:43
on a big screen behind people yeah yeah
11:46
so my favorite jimmy carter
11:47
mistranslation in one of his speeches is
11:50
that
11:51
we've all got one he's got he's got a
11:53
greatest hits list
11:54
um he was in japan and he was giving a
11:57
speech
11:57
and this is post him being president
11:59
when he started the speech
12:01
with a with a joke and halfway through
12:03
he realized oh no this is this is not
12:05
going to translate i'm
12:06
telling a joke and the punch line's just
12:08
going to come out all wrong through
12:09
translation of this japanese translator
12:11
so i'm just gonna get this weird
12:13
confused silence but he's like i'm
12:15
halfway through gotta gotta do it so he
12:17
delivers the joke
12:18
and then the japanese translator
12:20
translates and he gets this
12:22
massive laugh humongous laugh and so
12:24
afterwards he went up to the guy and
12:25
said that is incredible that you managed
12:27
to translate that joke you must be an
12:28
incredible translator
12:30
and the translator said ah no uh what i
12:32
did actually was say
12:33
president carter just told a joke
12:35
everyone must laugh
12:37
that resulted in this ginormous laugh
12:41
what a dude oh is that translator still
12:43
working and does he do stand-up gigs in
12:45
the uk
12:46
please so did you know that
12:50
jimmy carter set up a hotline that you
12:53
could ring
12:54
to report people for being too cool
12:56
[Laughter]
12:59
this is true he was he was a big
13:01
environmentalist jimmy carter who set up
13:03
the
13:03
department of the environment in the
13:04
states and he put solar panels on the
13:06
roof of the white house
13:08
and one of the things he did was that he
13:09
at some point he passed a law
13:11
saying that air conditioning in
13:13
government buildings and businesses
13:15
couldn't go any lower than 26.7 degrees
13:19
celsius
13:20
which is 80 fahrenheit that is quite
13:22
hard it is quite hot isn't it
13:24
and lo and this affected 55 million
13:26
people who
13:27
had a very sweaty time but he set up a
13:30
hotline so that you could ring and
13:32
report
13:32
people if they turn their aircon lower
13:34
than that
13:36
and you would they could be given a ten
13:37
thousand dollar fine
13:39
no yeah of course reagan
13:42
took the solar panel straight off didn't
13:44
they when he went to the white house
13:45
in the face he said they were a joke um
13:48
jimmy carter
13:49
has won three grammys has he
13:52
yeah for what spoken word uh so
13:56
all the spoken word of his books that he
13:58
keeps pumping out he's written a lot of
13:59
books
14:00
and he's won three grammys but he's been
14:02
nominated a lot more times i think he
14:05
looking through the list of spoken word
14:07
grammys he has been nominated more than
14:08
anyone else
14:09
really yeah he lost in 1999
14:12
to christopher reeve he lost in 2002 to
14:14
quincy jones in 2008 he lost to obama
14:18
but he was up against obama as was bill
14:21
clinton
14:22
so three of the nominees were presidents
14:24
of the united states of america the
14:26
grammys
14:27
that was the big presidential race of
14:28
2008 wasn't it that was the one i was
14:30
watching
14:31
yeah then he lost in 2010 to michael j
14:33
fox then he lost in 2015 to joan rivers
14:36
but then he won in 2016.
14:38
that feels like a pity win after all
14:40
that effort that feels like yeah exactly
14:43
just give it to him he'll go away i love
14:44
jimmy carter do you
14:46
he's he's just the best guy he's just
14:48
the most principled
14:49
moral guy so he's the only president who
14:52
doesn't really take
14:53
speaking fees and any speaking fee has
14:55
ever taken which is always minimal goes
14:57
to
14:58
charity do you think he stopped taking
14:59
them because he keeps making such
15:00
massive gas
15:01
and everything insulting the audience by
15:04
accident via translation
15:06
always just coming on to whoever is
15:08
listening he still gives i was listening
15:10
to
15:10
a podcast which is really good it's the
15:13
washington post presidential podcast and
15:15
they did
15:16
about an hour on every president so
15:18
follow jimmy carter
15:19
from start to finish you've got quite
15:22
ecoterroric tastes
15:24
an hour we've had 45 now i mean i
15:26
haven't i haven't listened to like
15:28
rutherford b
15:28
hayes or anything yet i don't know how
15:32
i'd fare there
15:33
but he still gives sunday school classes
15:35
and people come from all over the world
15:36
to listen but you know he's pretty
15:38
he's an evangelical born again christian
15:39
so he just gives religious lessons
15:42
at sunday school every week he's just
15:44
such a decent guy
15:45
claims to have seen a ufo hasn't he yeah
15:47
he's also a bit weird it's
15:48
a very famous incident of jimmy carter
15:51
claiming to have seen a ufo
15:52
one of the promises he made in his
15:53
presidential campaign was that
15:55
he would investigate all
15:57
extraterrestrial experiences or
15:59
something i think
16:00
and then when he got into power he said
16:01
he couldn't because it was all too
16:03
secret or something he's too busy now to
16:05
go around
16:06
his a counter for ectoplasm
16:10
he builds houses doesn't he as well yeah
16:12
and fun amazing furniture
16:14
does he come on how good is the footage
16:17
it's
16:18
it sells for i think i might have
16:19
mentioned this before but if i haven't
16:21
uh yeah he builds like beds and
16:23
chests did you say it sells for a lot of
16:25
money yeah
16:26
thousands yeah but how much would it
16:27
sell for if you sold it under a
16:28
pseudonym
16:31
which would have been an eccentric thing
16:33
to do um
16:35
yeah he sent his first text three years
16:38
ago
16:38
jimmy carter oh well done jimmy yeah and
16:41
his second text this was the message of
16:43
his second text
16:44
i did not mean to send that first text
16:46
without wanting to have sex with you i
16:47
am sorry
16:50
still using seymour to translate all my
16:52
stuff
16:55
yeah though his second text was that was
16:57
my first text message
16:59
uh yeah he was his first text this is
17:08
yeah no it was to his grandson and it
17:10
was did you see colbert last night
17:12
p he ends it with p which i think he's
17:14
referred to as papa
17:15
um but uh his grandson is on twitter so
17:18
he did a screen grabber
17:19
president it might just be a real ass
17:22
about it
17:24
patio furniture maker
17:33
okay it is time for fact number three
17:35
and that is
17:36
my fact my fact this week is that
17:38
narcissists
17:39
don't like looking at themselves that's
17:42
not weird so this is
17:44
a new study that's come out of austria
17:46
from the university of graz
17:48
and the idea is that they took a pool of
17:50
around 600 people and surveyed them
17:52
to see whether or not they were
17:53
narcissistic and so um
17:55
out of that they found 43 people that
17:57
they selected 21 who scored really
17:59
highly as being narcissistic
18:01
and 22 with lower scores and they were
18:03
shown pictures of themselves
18:05
and close family friends and so on and
18:07
their brain activity which was monitored
18:09
every time they saw the picture of
18:10
themselves when their eyes
18:12
locked onto themselves it registered as
18:14
not enjoying it
18:15
um yeah which is and that was not
18:18
enjoying it more so than non-narcissists
18:20
or maybe just
18:21
enjoying it the same amount or not
18:23
having this in a special
18:24
surge of enjoyment i guess yeah yeah
18:27
which is i've just realized because
18:28
obviously narcissus
18:29
in the myth does like looking at himself
18:31
you've just got this fact
18:33
yeah yeah that says he likes it a lot
18:35
yeah to his detriment it turns out
18:37
does he die he doesn't die but he gets
18:39
turned into a flower
18:40
i would say that is a kind of death that
18:42
is a plot twist i did not see coming
18:45
it's a daffodil isn't it that he was
18:47
turned into well we think it's a
18:48
narcissus
18:49
it's like oh it is there's a flower
18:51
called my scissors which is yeah and
18:52
they sort of droop over the
18:53
riverbank daniel and they look like
18:55
they're looking at themselves with their
18:56
little trumpets
18:57
yeah so that's why he was turned into
18:59
one of those okay by the gods
19:01
i think he starved to death first
19:03
because he was so captivated by his
19:04
reflection
19:05
and i should just say for the parents
19:07
out there or anyone who's watched qi
19:08
that we don't know that the etymology of
19:10
narcissus the flower comes from
19:11
narcissus the person
19:13
to me it seems so obvious that it
19:14
definitely does it's a flower
19:16
that he was turned into and it drapes
19:18
over lakes but some people say it's
19:20
related to
19:21
a word that means to poison or something
19:24
they're okay they might be totally
19:26
unrelated to each other do you know how
19:28
to do you know how to tell if someone's
19:29
a narcissist
19:30
you just ask them because they don't
19:33
care they'll
19:34
they'll say yeah i'm a nasty oh that's
19:36
true psychologists have developed
19:38
a one question test for narcissism
19:41
wow and it's a pretty good one
19:44
and then there's a more advanced one
19:45
which is a 40 question test but it
19:47
replicates pretty closely the one
19:48
question test
19:49
do you guys know about the anaphase
19:52
facial beauty analysis
19:54
no no this is a thing you can do i
19:55
thought okay well let's do something
19:56
about looking at yourself so i went on
19:58
this website
19:59
and it takes a photo of your face and
20:01
then it analyzes you and it gives you
20:02
your facial beauty analysis
20:05
so that's the kind of thing a narcissist
20:06
would do it doesn't it yeah so i was
20:08
just i was
20:09
i was role-playing um so this is what my
20:12
this is how my facial beauty
20:14
beauty analysis reads your nose is too
20:18
long for your ears
20:19
your inner ocular distance is too big
20:21
for your eyes your nose is too wide for
20:24
your face with
20:25
your face is too narrow your nose is too
20:27
wide for your mouth
20:30
wow look only some of that is true it's
20:32
pretty brutal isn't it
20:34
what i what i got stuck on though is
20:35
your nose is too long for your ears
20:39
how do those things correlate how are
20:42
you not that your ears are too short for
20:44
your nose
20:44
yeah why is the nose to blame what's my
20:47
nose done
20:49
but i don't think you could fit it in
20:50
your ears even if you want no i don't
20:52
think so
20:53
god knows i've tried it's not well it's
20:55
not that long then is it if you can't
20:56
even fit it into your head
20:59
what so what was it trying to tell you i
21:01
think it succeeded in telling me exactly
21:03
what it wanted to do
21:06
it may just be an exercise in i don't
21:08
know abuse honesty no idea
21:11
what what's the url for that it's it's
21:13
it's anaphase a
21:14
n a face and a face definitely doing
21:17
that
21:18
i was looking up stuff about looking in
21:20
mirrors yeah
21:21
you know the thing about animals looking
21:23
in mirrors which i think we've met we
21:24
must have mentioned before
21:25
that they do it but they do it and that
21:28
the way to tell if they can tell
21:30
that they are the animal in the mirror
21:31
is by painting a dot on them and then
21:34
um if they try and get rid of the dot
21:37
that's how they know
21:38
this was invented by a guy called gordon
21:40
gallup jr this was
21:42
his innovation experiment in the 1970s
21:45
although
21:45
one of the first people to do it was
21:47
charles darwin who
21:49
in 1838 went to london zoo and entered
21:51
an orangutan's cage with a mirror
21:53
to experiment wow well that's been done
21:56
all this time yeah wow and the orangutan
21:59
loved it
21:59
he said she was astonished beyond
22:01
measure but did she know it was her
22:03
reflection
22:03
i don't know i don't think i don't think
22:05
he did the dot test do you know about
22:07
the
22:07
17th century fashion for having a mirror
22:11
hanging on the wall of your drawing room
22:13
and then next to it an oil painting of
22:15
exactly the reflection in the mirror
22:17
what no really yeah
22:21
why cool i couldn't find out anything
22:23
more about this i just i came across
22:25
this fact and couldn't get anywhere
22:26
further with it but it was
22:27
i don't know whether it was in order to
22:30
show off the artist or in order to show
22:32
off the
22:32
what the mirror can see yeah right what
22:35
a hassle because if you ever wanted to
22:36
redecorate you always have to hang those
22:38
two next to each other then
22:40
yeah and in the same position actually
22:42
obviously because
22:43
yeah you can't move the mirror can you
22:45
otherwise it's not going to reflect and
22:46
also
22:46
if you walk up to the wrong one you
22:48
might think you're a vampire there was
22:54
another weird fashion for the clawed
22:55
glass which was about the same time i
22:57
think the 18th century
22:58
which was a period of time where people
23:00
decided that uh beautiful views and
23:03
landscapes actually looked more
23:04
attractive in mirrors
23:05
than they did in real life just with the
23:08
bare eyes
23:09
and so this clawed glass was invented
23:10
and people would walk up mountains and
23:12
they'd take a clawed glass with them
23:13
and the idea was that you got to the top
23:15
of a mountain and then you get to
23:17
take out this mirror and it would be a
23:18
tinted mirror so it gave it a bit of a
23:20
ethereal dreamlike quality and you'd get
23:23
to look at the view in a mirror
23:24
and then go down again but you'd have to
23:26
face away wouldn't you from the view
23:28
yeah look into the mirror see the view
23:30
behind you
23:31
imagine how bizarre so you're facing
23:33
away from the thing you've come up the
23:34
thing to see
23:35
yeah you can look at it which is exactly
23:37
like the selfie thing
23:39
where you get a lot of people facing
23:40
away from the view
23:42
oh yeah so that's the original selfie
23:45
that's it
23:46
it's sort of the original selfie yes
23:49
yeah kind of
23:50
yeah and we all got quite excited about
23:54
that for a minute
23:56
so listen narcissus then was because he
23:58
was in love with his own reflection
24:00
he might not have liked seeing a picture
24:03
of himself because that would have been
24:04
the right way round
24:05
yeah ah yes absolutely so
24:08
that's why people tend to much prefer
24:10
their reflection to pictures isn't it
24:11
yeah
24:12
because the image you're used to seeing
24:14
is the one in the mirror but as soon as
24:16
you see a photo you think oh my face
24:18
your nose is too long for your ears
24:19
[Laughter]
24:24
[Music]
24:27
okay it is time for our final fact of
24:29
the show
24:30
and that is andy my fact is that
24:32
clenching one's buttocks is a technique
24:34
christie's auctioneers are taught to
24:36
stop their hands shaking
24:40
but it doesn't actually say where
24:41
they're being told to put their hands
24:43
while they're clenching their baskets
24:46
yeah so this this is a piece about
24:48
extraordinary things that christie's
24:50
has found out over the years it's by
24:52
christie's and one of them was this
24:53
amazing
24:54
fact about how the auctioneers calm
24:56
themselves down wow
24:58
is this them holding priceless bits of
25:00
art or is this when they're actually
25:01
conducting
25:02
i think when you're conducting an
25:03
auction because you're standing at the
25:04
front in front of everyone you and
25:05
you're gesturing
25:06
so you have to look in control of the
25:09
situation i suppose
25:10
yeah so that apparently comes i don't
25:12
know how
25:13
what the mechanism is whether simply the
25:16
focusing on another muscle in your body
25:18
removes the tension from your hands yeah
25:19
it must do right i guess so
25:21
i don't know i'm trying it now and i
25:23
think it makes you a bit more shaky
25:24
but i'm so i guess the shaking is
25:26
because they talk about
25:28
auctioneers as being a sort of an acting
25:30
gig almost
25:31
you get up on stage and you need to make
25:33
the audience love you because that's
25:35
going to make an
25:36
auction successful and on christie's
25:38
site they were saying with interviews of
25:40
various auctioneers the first 10 seconds
25:42
is where you need to grab them otherwise
25:43
you might not have a successful
25:45
auction which seems bizarre if you're
25:47
there to buy things
25:48
do you know what i mean like it's you're
25:49
not buying off this guy it's credibility
25:52
you're buying
25:53
because you are it's so i mean i
25:55
remember
25:56
going to a which is quite similar what's
25:58
it called when
25:59
you go to a charity thing and raffle no
26:02
the one
26:03
that's above a raffle where you bid for
26:05
super raffle
26:09
one of those things where like you
26:10
donate a holiday or you donate your
26:12
mansion for a week
26:13
oh yeah i've been to loads of things
26:14
where people have donated their mansion
26:17
where have i been who makes endeavor and
26:20
stuff what's it called
26:21
it's a charity auction yeah so you know
26:23
when you go to a charity auction
26:24
it's you inspire people to buy stuff
26:27
just by being that charming i remember
26:29
going to them recently and clive
26:30
anderson was doing the auctioning and
26:32
people
26:32
definitely bid on stuff that they would
26:34
absolutely not have had he not kind of
26:36
cajoled them a bit here and persuaded
26:38
them a bit there i think it makes such a
26:40
difference because it's in the moment
26:41
isn't it that's what affects you in an
26:42
auction
26:42
that's true i did a gig not too long ago
26:44
with a christie's auctioneer
26:46
and it was a very rowdy room and it was
26:48
a charity night it was raising money for
26:50
this new um
26:51
this new university for brain studies
26:53
and he was given a lot of stuff to
26:55
auction off
26:56
and the room was chaotic as you would
26:58
expect it was in the v
26:59
a everyone was just busy on round tables
27:02
eating so he had to try and maintain
27:03
their attention in order to sell all
27:05
this stuff and he did this trick when he
27:07
felt like he lost the crowd
27:08
he went he made that noise
27:12
and every time the crowd would silence
27:14
look back to him and then he'd continue
27:16
on with the auction
27:16
but he did it like 50 times during the
27:18
night well they all ponies
27:20
[Laughter]
27:23
it was an amazing technique like that's
27:24
how he shut up an entire room
27:26
yeah one of the things i didn't realize
27:27
is that auctioneers will keep an eye on
27:29
each other as well
27:30
so one of them if they feel that you
27:32
know if auctioneer a
27:34
is up there and he doesn't think he's
27:36
quite got the room he's not inspiring
27:37
them enough he can nod to auctioneer b
27:39
he'll come up and take his place
27:40
and try and raise the temperature of the
27:42
room and it works the other way around
27:43
as well auctioneer b
27:44
can just go up to him and tap him on the
27:45
shoulder and go you've lost him mate
27:47
i'll do it wow
27:48
it's like a tag team ouch imagine if
27:50
that was true in all performing arts
27:51
imagine andy if you're bombing one night
27:53
and dan just comes up behind you taps
27:55
you on the shoulder and says i'll take
27:56
it from here
27:57
what do you mean imagine
27:59
[Laughter]
28:01
remember i think it's the word you're
28:02
looking for and they they used to in the
28:04
old days
28:05
have to do mock auctions the auctioneers
28:07
at christie's before the bosses of the
28:09
company
28:10
to just make sure that their skills were
28:11
good yeah the bosses would just sit
28:13
around with with the drink and then
28:15
the auctioneers would have to do it it's
28:17
all a bit more professional now so they
28:18
get voice actors and
28:20
and uh acting coaches in to teach them
28:23
about engaging the voice and
28:24
maybe also about posture and engaging
28:26
the audience i don't know
28:27
well christie's does in-house courses if
28:29
you want to get into it
28:30
you spend you do a workshop with one of
28:32
them yeah wolverhampton actually has a
28:34
two-year degree
28:35
for auctioneering yeah they teach you to
28:37
auctioneer
28:38
and to value things as well um
28:41
how much my vote for this place on the
28:42
yorkshire university auction course
28:44
i got 9 000 pounds 9 000. do i hit 10.
28:49
um yeah so did anybody look up butter
28:51
clenching
28:52
no no no more than usual so butter
28:55
clenching
28:57
you're all aware of the international
28:58
penny chuffing competition are you
29:00
right well this takes place annually at
29:02
the new inn in wedmore in somerset
29:05
where the uh contestants have to clench
29:08
three two pence coins in between the
29:10
cheeks of their butters
29:12
then walk waddle or hop four yards
29:16
across the pub before depositing the
29:17
coins
29:18
in a pint glass wow oh my god you get
29:21
one
29:22
point for every coin you get in the
29:24
glass and
29:26
the last report that i could find from
29:27
2015 three people scored
29:29
nine points is that the full so they
29:32
managed three
29:33
journeys across the pub do you have to
29:36
pick them up with your buttocks
29:38
that isn't indicated okay nor is nor is
29:41
what happens to the coins afterwards
29:44
whether they go into a particular till
29:48
is it a full pine and do you have to
29:49
down it once you've finished no it's
29:50
just a pine glass
29:52
well it's a shame that would make the
29:53
competition more fun wouldn't it yeah
29:55
yeah
29:55
um that is fantastic i don't like to
29:58
brag
29:59
i think i could do that well there's
30:01
only one way to find
30:02
out so somerset
30:07
here's the other thing of course right
30:08
if you put yourself in the room there
30:09
that's a lot of
30:10
bum isn't it yes now what happens is
30:12
apparently they have they have some sort
30:14
of
30:14
modesty blanket that they put around
30:16
themselves while hopping
30:18
waddling or walking four yards across
30:21
the pub with some money up their ass
30:26
um david suchet the poirot
30:29

30:32

30:39
yeah is it called the sushi sachet no
30:42

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:21
qi offices in covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:25
sitting here with james harkin
00:27
andrew hunter murray and alex bell and
00:29
once again we have gathered around the
00:31
microphones with our four
00:33
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:35
and in no particular order
00:37
here we go starting with you alex
00:40
my fact this week is that one percent of
00:43
the entire planet's wood supply
00:45
is turned into ikea furniture [ __ ]
00:49
that's true but they've only got 400 or
00:52
so shops globally
00:53
have you ever been to one yeah but
00:54
they're pretty big think about how many
00:56
books there are right
00:57
in the world how many trees are needed
00:58
for that so if you think of an amazon
01:00
warehouse
01:01
globally all the warehouses surely more
01:03
wood goes there i think the amount of
01:04
volume that pulses through those shops
01:06
is huge so
01:07
one of the reasons that their furniture
01:08
is so cheap is the way they've packaged
01:10
it
01:10
so when you if you open up like an ikea
01:12
bookcase uh package
01:13
it's incredibly tightly packed together
01:15
there's very little polystyrene in it
01:16
and that's like part of the reason it's
01:17
so cheap apparently
01:18
also you have to um transport it from
01:20
one place to another but you're not
01:22
transporting any air
01:23
which is heavy when you put a lot of it
01:25
in there they like
01:27
they're wooden lorries um
01:30
so one thing that you can't really flat
01:32
pack is sofas and armchairs
01:35
because they just come as one big object
01:37
don't they and so one way they tried to
01:39
fix that was by making
01:41
inflatable sofas uh and by making these
01:44
inflatable sofas they would reduce the
01:45
use of raw materials by 85
01:48
and transport volume by 90 wow
01:51
and the idea was you would buy this
01:53
inflatable sofa you blow it up at home
01:55
and then you'd put some
01:56
um cloth over it and you wouldn't know
01:58
that it was air
01:59
absolutely but aren't they effectively
02:02
manufacturing furniture for bouncy
02:03
castles
02:05
yeah but bouncy castles are quite um
02:07
comfortable
02:08
yeah if you've ever sat on one you've
02:10
never watched a whole film on a bouncy
02:11
castle though
02:12
and i do i do want to do that sometimes
02:14
who was it who did
02:15
um who was it well yeah we'll see our
02:19
friend comedian we'll see what did
02:20
bouncy castle hamlet and bouncy castle
02:21
macbeth
02:22
but in that case he was acting on the
02:24
bouncy castle rather than people
02:25
watching on the bouncer yeah that's true
02:26
i would go to a bouncy theater
02:28
yes but that's because a lot of theaters
02:29
are very uncomfortable seats yeah
02:31
they do hang on it's so difficult you
02:33
constantly get an obstructed view
02:34
because
02:35
everyone in front of me
02:40
so did this work well it did work up to
02:43
a point in that they were
02:44
you could sit on them the problem was
02:47
they
02:47
picked up a lot of static electricity
02:49
and so they turned into massive
02:50
dust collectors so you sofa would be
02:53
full of dust
02:54
and also they didn't really weigh
02:55
anything so float away
02:58
yeah that's basically it they would kind
03:00
of float away from where you left them
03:01
so
03:02
the one good thing about sofa is it's
03:03
always in the same place yeah so i think
03:05
that's the one good thing about it
03:06
[Laughter]
03:08
it's one of the good things yeah so this
03:11
is like a hover sofa
03:12
it was a bit like that basically um in
03:15
the stores they would all
03:16
start to gather in one corner at the
03:18
start
03:20
and one of the workers at ikea said they
03:22
were like a gathering of swollen hippos
03:24
wow can you imagine coming into work and
03:26
then all of the selfies have moved to
03:28
one color i look terrified you wouldn't
03:30
be you'd be paranoid that they're
03:31
conspiring against you you've caught
03:32
them mid-meeting like toy story
03:35
so that's the thing about ikea is that
03:37
the stores famously can only go around
03:38
the one way
03:39
yeah there's a few shortcuts yeah i've
03:42
heard this yeah
03:42
so like often it's like the door section
03:44
and they're all fake doors and one of
03:45
them's a real door
03:47
that's true you have two ikea workers
03:50
one of them's always allowed to tell the
03:52
truth
03:54
um but the the guardian did a thing
03:56
about uh the architecture of an ikea
03:58
shop they interviewed a few
04:00
architectural professors and they found
04:01
that 60 of ikea purchases are impulse
04:05
the reason they get so many impulse
04:06
purchases is that you have to put an
04:08
item in your trolley when you see it
04:10
because otherwise you probably won't see
04:11
it again because you're going around the
04:13
whole shop yeah yeah
04:14
yes yeah sling at anything i'll put it
04:16
there for the moment yeah i always go
04:17
around twice
04:19
once making a mental image of everything
04:21
i want to buy
04:22
do you really everyone in the ikea
04:24
control room was like who is this freak
04:26
i was watching one of the monitors
04:28
that's like those mind palaces isn't it
04:29
you have a mind ikea
04:31
it's full of hundreds and hundreds of
04:33
items um do you know about
04:34
janja wintersol no okay she has a mind
04:38
palace
04:39
and she was given a week to memorize all
04:41
328 pages and 4818 items
04:45
of the 2018 ikea catalogue and she
04:48
managed to do it
04:49
wow you're kidding really yeah well as
04:52
as in people have tested her and she's
04:53
got everything right
04:54
yeah that's amazing yeah twice as many
04:57
ikea catalogs are printed every year as
04:58
bibles
05:00
oh there yeah and 75 of the ikea
05:03
catalogue is cgi it's not real
05:05
what what yeah i know no what does that
05:08
mean they're not the
05:09
the furniture is really if you buy it
05:10
you're not just like in a fall through
05:11
your sofa i mean like the
05:13
pictures aren't actual pictures of the
05:15
product the item
05:16
they're the cgi rendering they're
05:17
actually andy circus pretending to be
05:22
just speaking of the catalogue and
05:24
memory of uh all the items all the items
05:26
obviously
05:27
have very odd names so you'd have to be
05:30
memorizing these very odd names as well
05:31
like billy bookcase exactly and it was
05:34
uh it was revealed this year
05:35
um why they're called what they're
05:37
called all the items at ikea and it's to
05:40
do with the founder and the fact that
05:42
uh kamprad this is her name he is the k
05:45
in ikea okay i can't remember his first
05:47
name but it begins with i it's inva
05:49
yeah and the initial is his first name
05:50
his second name and then i believe it's
05:52
his
05:52
the town he lived in the lake that he
05:54
lived next to the storm where he grew up
05:56
and then his hometown there we go
05:57
yeah so um uh he had dyslexia and so he
06:01
found it impossible
06:02
to um just memorize regular codes
06:05
and regular names so they came up with
06:07
this system whereby
06:09
everything in ikea was given something
06:11
that he could relate to
06:12
so that he could he could memorize the
06:14
category of name that it has
06:16
so for example um if it's a bed textile
06:19
it'll be named after a flower or a plant
06:21
so he'll know okay it's going to be a
06:22
flower a plant that's
06:23
that's easy to remember beds wardrobes
06:25
and hall furniture
06:26
are norwegian name places bookcases are
06:30
either scandinavian boy names or
06:32
professions um and so every little
06:34
product has its own category of
06:37
um of theme but all of his children are
06:40
named after things that you can get in a
06:41
house
06:43
so he's got a child called bed another
06:45
one
06:46
there's another one fact here because
06:49
billy bookcases
06:50
there are about 60 million in the world
06:52
which is
06:53
nearly one for every hundred people
06:57
there's one person at 100. does anyone
06:59
here have a billy bookcase yeah i do
07:00
of have three you've got three yeah i've
07:02
got three as well i think
07:04
i i used to have some but i don't
07:06
anymore i've got one so that's seven
07:08
between us so we are we have more than
07:11
average that's more than one percent
07:12
yeah it's more than one percent what we
07:14
would actually need is um no
07:16
point not four of them yeah
07:19
some math banter there um they also use
07:23
one percent of the world's cotton every
07:24
year according to them
07:26
do they yeah campaign used to be a nazi
07:29
i know it was such a shame he seemed
07:31
like such a quirky fun character and
07:33
then it got to that bit of the story
07:34
it's the elephant in the room yeah and
07:36
the elephant is wearing a swastika round
07:37
band i'm afraid
07:38
yeah well he's a he has apologized for
07:40
it very previously since then he was a
07:42
teenager
07:43
he was 17 in 1943 so uh he wasn't
07:46
involved in the early stages we can say
07:47
that
07:48
do you remember the actor haley jo
07:50
osmond yes yeah
07:51
he was in the sixth sense exactly the
07:53
kid in the sixth sense oh yeah
07:54
yeah uh he was discovered in an ikea
07:58
his parents had lost him three years
08:00
earlier
08:02
yeah haley joel osmond um he was in uh
08:05
in burbank in america
08:06
they have an ikea he was inside it and
08:08
there were just people sitting there
08:10
taking photos casting kids basically and
08:13
they
08:13
it was just a desk and said come over
08:15
have your photo taken and we'll put you
08:16
up for casting
08:18
and so he was with his parents walking
08:20
through ikea saw that sat down they took
08:22
photos of him
08:23
and he immediately got cast for a pizza
08:25
hut commercial for their new bigfoot
08:27
pizza
08:28
so now i find our way down this time
08:32
tangential ikea information with the
08:35
keyword bigfoot right at the end
08:37
we have a google alert set up for
08:38
bigfoot
08:40
so while he was on tv robert zemeckis or
08:43
tom hanks must have seen it because they
08:45
then
08:45
called him in or the casting director
08:47
certainly for the movie forrest gump
08:49
so he before he was in sixth sense he
08:51
plays forrest gump's son at the end of
08:53
the movie does he
08:54
and then he went on to sixth sense and
08:55
so but discovered in an ikea what was
08:57
the main feature of the bigfoot pizza
08:58
why was it called a bigfoot pizza
09:00
i reckon it must have been big was it
09:01
shaped like a foot it tasted like feet
09:09
[Laughter]
09:14
[Applause]
09:18
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:21
that is james
09:22
okay my fact this week is that the nazca
09:24
people
09:25
would employ someone to walk around with
09:27
a dead fox on their head
09:29
cool so the nazca people these are the
09:31
people of peru
09:32
from from my holiday from your holiday
09:35
i've just
09:36
come back from peru yep uh i want to
09:38
talk about peru because i think it's
09:40
amazing i found it quite hard finding
09:41
out about this fact james and i presume
09:43
that's because you've got the facts from
09:44
a tour
09:44
guide or from some intrinsic esoteric
09:47
bit of local james was the guy that they
09:49
employed
09:51
uh i got this from an exhibition at the
09:53
national art museum of lima
09:55
and it was someone who listens to this
09:57
podcast called patricia who took
09:59
me and my wife round and one of the
10:01
things i had in this museum was a dead
10:03
fox
10:04
and apparently what happened was if you
10:06
were growing um crops
10:08
and you wanted to scare the birds away
10:10
they didn't have scarecrows they were to
10:12
have a person with a fox on their head
10:13
so the birds flying around would see the
10:15
fox and think oh that's a [ __ ] so i'm
10:17
not going to go down and eat the crops
10:18
she's like a human scarecrow that's
10:20
great but why wouldn't all farmers
10:22
just then not wear a dead fox on their
10:23
head every day well because they're
10:25
heavy
10:26
aren't they a whole fox the whole fox is
10:29
dead it's pretty much like
10:30
it's the one that they had in the museum
10:32
was like a spread out
10:33
um carpet kind of thing kind of a carpet
10:35
thing yeah you get fox um
10:38
you know like scarves that like posh old
10:40
women were in the 19 yeah but bird's not
10:42
going to get tricked by that
10:43
no but you'd look amazing um
10:46
i think um i'm not sure it was actually
10:48
a fox
10:50
because i like all this facts that's why
10:52
i couldn't find it online
10:54
were you even in peru i have a feeling
10:56
it might have been a
10:57
zorro which is
11:02
is a peruvian desert fox a faux fox
11:05
[Music]
11:07
but the nazcas are famous they're
11:09
pre-colombian so before the europeans
11:11
went over to
11:12
peru and they're most famous because
11:14
they lived in the desert and they made
11:15
these massive lines
11:16
in the middle of the desert which you
11:18
can go and visit and um you fly of them
11:20
and you can see all these different
11:21
shapes
11:22
of things were they amazing to see they
11:25
were quite amazing to see yeah
11:26
basically because i always wanted to
11:28
yeah and so i was impressed by them
11:31
were they larger than you would have
11:33
expected
11:34
they were smaller to me because i was a
11:36
long way away in an aeroplane
11:38
oh yeah but some are bigger than others
11:40
and you have lots of shapes of animals
11:42
and stuff and there are some massive
11:43
ones which are just a triangle so
11:44
they're a bit [ __ ]
11:45
but then there are smaller ones which
11:48
are like a monkey or something or
11:49
or a killer whale and they're really
11:51
cool that that's that's very cool
11:53
so they didn't know what they looked
11:55
like is this the latest theory that
11:57
cause i've read a better theory well i
11:59
think it's an incredible coincidence
12:00
they look like animals
12:04
i mean that would explain the triangles
12:06
i think they would know they didn't have
12:07
power
12:08
flights so the question is how did they
12:09
know there are hills around so they'll
12:11
be able to stand on the hills and see
12:12
them
12:13
have you heard of hot air balloon theory
12:16
oh god
12:17
sorry this is a man
12:20
why do i get the feeling this is gonna
12:21
be full of hot air
12:24
this is a man uh who is called jim
12:27
woodman right uh from the 1970s
12:30
of him is owned by ikea yes in the 1970s
12:34
he put forward this theory that in fact
12:37
the nazca people did see
12:39
these uh line formations and they did it
12:42
from the air by
12:43
hot air blooms which he believes they
12:45
were able to build
12:46
um and so what he said is that he
12:49
notices that
12:50
um they had an amazing textile industry
12:53
that
12:53
uh had high grade weaving and clothes
12:55
that's true yeah
12:56
so and he also said that you know um
12:59
they knew what smoke did you know they
13:01
knew that hot air rised and so on they
13:03
they knew the basic things and all they
13:04
needed to do was put two things together
13:06
we've not found any hot air balloons
13:08
because he says
13:10
floated away exactly it floated away to
13:13
the 19th century
13:14
[Laughter]
13:16
what he says is that they used it for
13:18
burial rituals so what they were doing
13:20
were they were putting
13:21
the dead nazca people inside the hot air
13:24
balloons and they would fly off into the
13:26
pacific
13:26
ocean so but if you happen to
13:30
accidentally be
13:31
in one of the funeral baskets of a hot
13:34
air balloon
13:34
then you could see from above there's a
13:36
few holes obviously
13:38
in his um in his theory one is that he
13:41
actually tested it out using the basic
13:43
stuff that they had and it could only
13:45
make sort of awkward lift-offs for a few
13:47
minutes at a time
13:48
i read that they built one they got to
13:50
about 400 feet out oh well maybe that
13:52
maybe they've kept going maybe this is
13:53
an old article
13:55
why are you encouraging him because i
13:57
think this actually holds a lot of water
13:58
this theory so
13:59
do you know yes so they were fresh
14:02
professional balloonists who built this
14:04
trial balloon in 1975
14:06
admittedly they were doing it to a
14:07
design from the 18th century
14:09
still but they used only things that the
14:11
nazca people would have had available to
14:13
them so only local
14:14
cloths using the same sort of materials
14:16
and crops
14:17
even the fires that they got the hot air
14:20
from
14:21
were made using wood that was available
14:23
locally
14:24
and it did work i mean obviously it
14:26
would have been for a treat or a special
14:28
occasion
14:29
right here's the problem with the
14:30
pacific ocean burial theory
14:33
is that the prevailing winds are going
14:35
in a different direction
14:37
so if the balloon did go up it would
14:38
crash into the andes mountains
14:40
on the east of it yeah but there are a
14:42
lot of hills around there
14:43
are mountains so you can see it from
14:45
high up i think oh that's another flaw
14:47
to the theory of them not seeing it you
14:48
can actually see it from mountains
14:51
is it not there's something about them
14:52
all being along the same line of
14:53
longitude or lasting they're all
14:55
basically in a straight line around the
14:56
world
14:56
correct well the people who i spoke to
15:00
reckon that they are do you remember
15:03
in the viking times they would have
15:06
like labyrinths and you would walk
15:08
around them and it would be a kind of
15:10
penance or it would be a kind of a
15:11
religious walk or something like that
15:13
and they think a lot of them because of
15:14
that because if you look at them they're
15:16
like a labyrinth there's one way in and
15:18
one way out
15:19
and you can walk along them as they
15:21
that's cool you know if you think of a
15:23
monkey which is a line drawing
15:24
you can walk into the tail go all the
15:26
way around there and then come out from
15:27
the legs
15:29
exactly like that yeah but i think the
15:31
truth is nobody knows because
15:33
when the spanish came they got rid of
15:35
all of
15:36
um the history and also they didn't
15:38
write anything down the nasca people and
15:40
actually none of the pre-columbians
15:42
wrote anything down
15:43
they didn't have any writing actually
15:44
alex and i went to a talk where we found
15:47
out
15:48
how they were made oh yeah so we went to
15:50
see this guy
15:52
a historian called eric von daniken and
15:55
i was like what are you dragging me into
15:56
this is so embarrassing you came along
15:59
and uh eric von daniken who was um a
16:02
very big part of a tv series called
16:04
ancient aliens but obviously
16:06
writer of the book chariots of the gods
16:08
uh which was the global sensational
16:10
best-selling uh greatest book ever
16:12
published piece of [ __ ]
16:15
great non-fiction uh that uh yeah um
16:19
obviously that's a massive theory that
16:21
they had help from aliens but
16:22
obviously when you look at it it looks
16:24
more like it's hot air balloons
16:27
i don't like this tactic of you giving
16:29
one ridiculous theory
16:30
and then giving one even more ridiculous
16:32
theory and expecting us to
16:34
buy the second one it's like a price
16:35
it's probably there's a what is it
16:37
yeah there's a pricing theory in shops
16:39
so they say look you can have this one
16:40
which is cheap and cost 50 quid you can
16:42
have this one which cost 600 quid or you
16:43
can have the 10
16:44
000 pounds one so you get the 600 quid
16:46
one or it's like james thinking the
16:47
triangle now's kind of a bit [ __ ]
16:48
because there's a monkey one right next
16:50
to it it's like it's still pretty high
16:51
yeah that's good that's true actually um
16:54
while we were in
16:54
peru we went to um a place called the
16:57
sistine chapel of america
16:59
uh san pedro de anda jualias
17:02
or something like that and it's very
17:05
nice church
17:06
but the tour guide was a bit boring so
17:08
we kind of just ducked out
17:09
and next to it there was a little museum
17:12
of like
17:13
nazca people and they had a whole load
17:15
of stuff about aliens
17:17
and it was a proper museum and they had
17:19
these you know these elongated skulls
17:21
that
17:22
they they find sometimes and stuff like
17:23
that and they literally in this museum
17:25
had no bit of saying
17:27
no it's not aliens they're just like
17:29
nobody knows
17:30
you're kidding
17:36
that's amazing it was the previous
17:38
people in the same area who made the
17:40
elongated skulls
17:41
i can't remember the name begins with p
17:43
but um i've got it in my notes somewhere
17:45
um do you know how the nazca died out
17:48
blow away over farming or something
17:50
really quite irritatingly dull
17:52
is it el nino or like some kind of
17:54
weather phenomenon yeah it is yeah and
17:56
alex i don't think it's irritatingly
17:58
dull but
18:00
if it is what i meant was like not alien
18:02
like not like they weren't like what
18:03
meteor it was just like well it is to do
18:05
with crops so
18:06
let's see how far we get shall we so
18:08
basically they
18:09
they used to live on these um trees
18:12
called farangos which are very very cool
18:14
very hard wood very good for building
18:16
things
18:16
and the roots go 150 feet down because
18:19
it's so dry there
18:20
so they used to live on those and then
18:21
they started chopping them all down kind
18:23
of like easter island
18:24
so that they could grow crops right and
18:26
then they grew loads and loads of crops
18:28
and then at about 500 a.d there was a
18:30
massive flood
18:31
which completely destroyed their
18:32
civilization swept across the plain
18:34
destroyed all their homes and within 200
18:36
years they've been conquered and died
18:37
out
18:38
but the way we know this is so cool a
18:40
team from cambridge university
18:42
went there and they measured the amount
18:44
of pollen in the soil
18:45
at different depths so they can say oh
18:48
well up to 480 there's loads of juarengo
18:50
pollen
18:51
then there's a bit of cotton pollen and
18:52
then suddenly there's this big boom in
18:55
loads of other crops like squash and
18:56
mazes and things and that's how they
18:58
knew that they chopped down all the
18:59
trees in the area and they were just
19:00
having huge fields of crops instead
19:02
that's what doomed them
19:03
wow so did they do crop circles then as
19:05
well no for the aliens
19:08
there is one theory by the way which is
19:12
um it is it is to do with aliens but
19:14
it's a more it's
19:15
yeah it's not like one of these
19:17
unreasonable
19:18
it's a more scientific approach which is
19:20
that rather than the aliens built the
19:22
line
19:22
like us setting up seti or things in
19:25
order to
19:26
look to to the universe for signals of
19:28
life it was basically
19:30
big sos not sos but you know what i mean
19:32
like it was attempted
19:34
their attempts of saying there is life
19:35
down here and drawing animals so that
19:37
anyone looking
19:38
down onto earth might see that things
19:40
were man-made
19:41
that again it's a theory i've not spoken
19:43
about two years later james flies over
19:44
in a plane as an ass bishop
19:53
okay there's time for fact number three
19:55
and that is andy
19:56
my fact is that instead of going outside
19:59
the painter gainsborough
20:00
painted outdoor scenes by making a
20:02
little model with
20:04
moss and broccoli so
20:07
broccoli were his trees exactly and he
20:10
used coal for boulders
20:11
little pebbles for stones exactly so he
20:14
he was a famous landscape painter
20:16
and british right british was born in
20:19
1727 just to give you an idea 1988
20:22
and yeah he would make for inspiration
20:24
these weird little
20:26
models and and he used broccoli for
20:28
trees it's all because it's basically a
20:29
piece of art for another piece of art
20:31
yeah it is yeah he wasn't painting
20:33
directly from him but it was to give him
20:35
ideas of what
20:36
he wanted to move what goes where and
20:37
longer yeah because it's much easier to
20:39
move a piece of broccoli than it is to
20:40
move the tree and it's all about
20:42
the shape of the painting like he he was
20:44
really precise about exact
20:45
the exact shape of his hills and where
20:47
the cow would go and everything
20:48
did he have little cows yep great what
20:51
were they made of like cockroaches or
20:53
yeah that's right that's why if you look
20:55
closely at the games we're painting
20:57
all the cows have little antenna and
21:00
hard shell-like
21:01
[Laughter]
21:03
one of the reasons that he's not as
21:04
famous i didn't know his name i have to
21:06
admit
21:07
um and he gets often compared to is it
21:10
constable who lived
21:11
very much near him and i think partly
21:13
the reason is
21:14
he was held back slightly by his little
21:16
broccoli model village
21:19
and got stuck in it because with
21:20
constable there's a
21:22
great thing of geographically you can
21:24
visit all of the lands that he was
21:25
painting and that's a huge
21:27
thing to go there and wander through the
21:29
fields and look at the trees that were
21:30
you know in his paintings but yeah i was
21:33
like sorry i've eaten it
21:35
it was delicious
21:39
it is tragic though because he loved
21:41
landscapes but the thing that sold and
21:43
made you money at the time was portraits
21:44
obviously for wealthy people
21:45
commissioning pictures but he just
21:47
wanted to do the landscapes that's all
21:48
he was really interested in
21:49
so it's really sad they only became
21:51
popular as things you could buy
21:53
just in their own right after his death
21:55
his brothers were quite interesting his
21:57
his brother
21:58
humphrey was a mechanic and he invented
22:00
a method of
22:01
um condensing steam in in sort of
22:04
separate
22:04
containers that then um james watt used
22:07
when he was developing his
22:08
did he yeah how can you find that
22:10
interesting and stuff about pollen in
22:12
the nasdaq region is irritatingly dull
22:14
no he said irrigating
22:16
[Laughter]
22:20
and his other brother was called um john
22:22
but they everyone called him scheming
22:23
jack because he
22:24
used to come up with little ideas for
22:25
curiosity yeah he had he invented copper
22:28
wings that he tried to fly with
22:29
and he had a sulfur yeah and he had a
22:31
self-rocking crib
22:33
and um a cuckoo that cuckoos all year
22:36
long a cuckoo clock
22:38
um a cuckoo clock yeah that cuckoo'd all
22:41
year long
22:42
most cooking clocks that are made in
22:44
germany or whatever they don't
22:45
only do it once do it during spring no
22:48
but they do it like once an hour right
22:50
i think his was just all the time
22:53
they sound like quite a group of um you
22:56
know the brothers are all making things
22:58
aren't they
22:58
yeah that's what i mean it was quite an
23:00
interesting spread you often get that
23:01
with this this like historical families
23:03
they often have really interesting
23:04
is it because they're all rich and they
23:06
don't have to do proper jobs i think he
23:08
wasn't
23:08
very rich to start off he became very
23:10
wealthy um
23:12
and he got really annoyed later in life
23:13
because he got annoyed with
23:15
customers saying can you paint my child
23:18
dressed up as henry viii please
23:19
but i wanted to get my child exactly
23:21
right and he said you're not gonna get
23:22
a good likeness of your child if he's
23:25
dressed december the eighth in the same
23:26
thing
23:26
i read that he painted with paint
23:28
brushes that was six feet long
23:30
i read that i'm not sure whether it's
23:33
completely true supposedly what he did
23:34
was he put the canvas he was painting on
23:36
right next to the person sitting for the
23:37
painting
23:39
and then he'd paint from a bit further
23:40
back that's an unbelievable amount of
23:42
precise skill if you can do that
23:43
i paint yeah vague likeness of someone's
23:45
smile
23:47
have you heard about his huge rivalry oh
23:50
with joshua reynolds with joshua
23:52
reynolds who was another
23:54
very famous artist of the time and um
23:57
they just really got on each other's
23:59
nerves and so once joshua reynolds
24:01
insisted
24:01
that blue wasn't really a good color
24:06
i think he was saying that it should
24:07
mostly be used in small amounts unless
24:09
you're painting the sky
24:10
obviously but anyway one of
24:12
gainsborough's most famous paintings
24:14
is called the blue boy oh yeah as a
24:16
young man who is in a completely blue
24:18
suit
24:19
so there is a theory that says that uh
24:21
this was painted as a reposter reynolds
24:22
saying
24:23
you can use blue in paintings or the
24:25
other argument is he painted the blue
24:27
boy
24:27
and then reynolds said actually blue and
24:29
you should really only paint girls
24:32
exactly and there is a painting they've
24:34
recently found which was by
24:36
gainsborough and then someone slagged it
24:38
off to the man who'd had it commissioned
24:40
and the man who had it commissioned
24:41
hired reynolds to repaint everything
24:44
except
24:48
but now the painting is 80 different so
24:50
underneath 80 percent of it is an
24:52
original gainsborough
24:53
and then the top 80 is uh reynolds
24:57
which is such a deep criticism um just a
25:00
few
25:01
other odd ways that artists paint
25:04
these days different methods um
25:06
[Music]
25:08
this is really interesting in ukraine
25:10
there is
25:11
a series of scuba divers that now go
25:13
down and do
25:14
underwater paintings under watercolors
25:17
yes under watercolor paintings yeah and
25:21
um they so they go underwater for up to
25:24
40 minutes of the time
25:25
they bring with them canvases that are
25:27
obviously water-resistant and they use
25:29
water-resistant paints
25:30
um but now these landscapes of
25:33
underneath the ocean you know of seaweed
25:35
and so on
25:36
painted from the bottom of the ocean
25:38
really cool that's tough if you can't
25:39
use blue as well isn't it
25:44
[Applause]
25:48
okay it is time for our final fact of
25:51
the show
25:52
and that is my fact my fact this week is
25:54
that the u.s navy's submarines are
25:56
starting to control
25:57
their periscopes with xbox controllers
26:00
it's amazing starting to what so they've
26:03
started trialing the use of it the
26:04
trials went very well
26:06
and now they're implementing it properly
26:08
level two
26:12
uh with the idea behind this i used to
26:14
have in my head the way that periscopes
26:16
work and i think i got this from batman
26:18
movies from the 60s
26:19
you used to have some person looking
26:20
through almost like the peep show
26:22
contraption
26:23
there these binoculars that would be
26:25
sent up to the surface
26:26
and you would move around like that
26:28
these days they have a joystick
26:30
and the joystick people have been
26:31
finding very hard to use and they
26:32
started testing it out then by using
26:35
xbox controllers thinking let's see how
26:37
this goes down
26:38
well and everyone has taken to it
26:40
surprisingly well
26:41
to the point of accuracy that it just
26:43
makes more sense to do it
26:44
both for the accuracy and then secondly
26:46
for the cost
26:47
because these controllers cost nothing
26:49
but these joysticks
26:50
that they're paying for each time costs
26:53
you know tens of thousands you get
26:54
joysticks these days isn't it it's hard
26:56
to get joysticks yeah
26:57
is it can you use any you always use wii
26:58
controllers if you prefer it's dangerous
27:00
using a weak controller
27:01
because if you wave your arm it might
27:03
fire a torpedo
27:06
but that's what happened when we first
27:07
came out isn't it everyone smashed
27:09
everything in their houses
27:11
that was a big thing at the time and you
27:13
don't want to smash a window in a
27:14
submarine
27:17
um yeah the um i believe that the
27:20
captains and so on who've been talking
27:22
about the fact that this is going to go
27:24
into place are saying you know if one
27:25
breaks and you happen to be near land
27:27
you can just go to a local shop buy a
27:29
new xbox controller because of course
27:31
the thing about
27:32
being a submarine is there's no
27:33
guarantee
27:36
that's the problem yeah then maybe they
27:38
should buy a few to bring with them
27:40
so i was looking into uh periscopes oh
27:43
yeah
27:43
so i didn't know that um periscopes were
27:46
not invented for the submarine they were
27:48
invented
27:48
or popularized if you like by the first
27:50
world war in the trenches
27:52
and the other thing that was invented
27:53
was the periscope rifle where
27:55
you attach the firing mechanism and the
27:57
rifle to
27:58
um a periscope so you can fire from the
28:01
safety of your
28:02
own trench completely inside your trench
28:04
now the disadvantage was that they were
28:06
much less accurate than actually looking
28:08
through the size of a proper rifle
28:09
obviously because they were a bit
28:11
jerry-rigged but then we used a great
28:13
deal in the campaign at gallipoli uh
28:16
and in gallipoli accuracy mattered a lot
28:19
less because some
28:21
trenches were five yards away from each
28:24
other
28:24
no yes um so during world war one
28:28
um the allies tried to train seagulls to
28:32
defecate on the periscopes of u-boats
28:35
um so they won't be able to see where
28:36
they were going how did it go
28:39
it didn't go so well the main problem
28:42
was twofold um they couldn't tell the
28:45
difference between friendly
28:46
subs and enemy subs uh and also they
28:49
don't tend to go out to sea very much
28:51
seagulls they tend to live on cliffs
28:54
where there aren't so many
28:55
submarines around the home so the other
28:58
thing they did was
28:59
they would um send two swimmers to a
29:02
submarine one would have a black bag and
29:04
the other one would have a hammer
29:05
and the first one would try and put the
29:07
black bag over the periscope so they
29:09
couldn't see where they were going
29:10
and if he failed the other one would
29:12
smash the glass with a hammer it feels
29:14
like
29:15
the second guy is the most important one
29:17
yeah because he can do the most damage
29:19
yeah no the second guy feels like an
29:20
afterthought of a plan being like and
29:22
what if that doesn't work sir
29:24
smash it with a hammer you'd think
29:27
that one swimmer could cope with having
29:30
a black bag and a hammer
29:33
yes i mean how big were hammers back in
29:36
the first world war they were small but
29:37
black bags were massive
29:40
um do you know there are some golf
29:41
courses which have periscopes
29:43
james you like golf i do i know that um
29:46
if you go and watch
29:47
um golf tournaments or you this happened
29:49
in the past i don't know if it still
29:50
happens i haven't been to one for ages
29:52
but
29:52
you would be able to buy little
29:54
periscopes and because
29:56
everyone stands around the green because
29:57
they want to watch what's happening yeah
29:59
um there's only so much space there's
30:01
lots of people so you can see over the
30:02
top of people's heads it's great
30:04
james this is not universal you haven't
30:06
missed it every course you've been to
30:07
shut up
30:08
there are golf courses which have
30:09
periscopes i found one from the 20s and
30:11
then i found one
30:12
modern one one modern one where the
30:14
first hole
30:15
is quite hard to see to the green yeah
30:18
so you need to see if the previous
30:19
golfing party have moved
30:20
before yeah so they have a 30 foot high
30:24
periscope
30:25
which is from an old navy submarine they
30:28
took it off in the 60s
30:29
and they installed it at the golf course
30:31
so you can just check out the lie at the
30:33
land ahead of you whether it's safe to
30:34
play
30:34
there are a lot of courses that you have
30:36
blind shots that you can't see the shot
30:38
but the way they deal with it is with a
30:39
little bell
30:40
um after you've played your shot you
30:42
ring the bell so it's safe for the other
30:43
guys to play behind you
30:45
but you may not know if there's no one
30:48
there
30:48
you've you've come after they've left no
30:50
one's there to ring the bell yeah
30:52
what you need is a constantly ringing
30:53
cuckoo clock
30:56
but you can slightly pause that's the
30:59
problem it's constantly ringing
31:01
but then you get there and you hold the
31:03
beak of the cuckoo exactly yeah
31:06
while trying to swing i think this is
31:07
how crazy golf was invented
31:14

[Applause]
01:10
[Music]
01:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:15
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:20
covent garden
01:21
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:23
here with james harkin
01:24
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
01:27
and once again we have
01:28
gathered around the microphones with our
01:30
four favorite facts from the last
01:32
seven days and in no particular order
01:35
here
01:35
we go starting with you james
01:38
okay my fact this week is that avril
01:41
lavigne
01:42
is the celebrity most likely to give you
01:44
a virus
01:45
that's rude what that's rude why you can
01:48
get viruses in lots of different ways
01:51
not always in rude ways oh okay well in
01:53
the ways i'm thinking of it's rude
01:55
it could be stood next to her on a tube
01:57
and she's got a cold and she touches one
01:59
of the
02:00
poles and then you touch it just
02:01
afterwards and then you touch your face
02:03
and then you might catch a virus that
02:04
way does she use the tube very much
02:06
these days
02:08
that's why she's the most likely she's
02:10
an obsessive public transporter
02:13
of course i'm talking about computer
02:14
viruses yes
02:16
and this is a study by mcafee
02:20
and it's the most dangerous celebrities
02:22
tm
02:23
study hang on is it mcafee i thought it
02:26
was mcafee i was at mcafee i said mcafee
02:28
as well okay well that sounds like you
02:30
three are all right and i'm wrong
02:32
no not necessarily who knows i don't
02:34
think anyone's said it before
02:36
now have they known well you always see
02:37
it written down don't you why would you
02:38
speak it out loud
02:39
yeah it's like microsoft
02:41
[Laughter]
02:42
so the problem with this right is that
02:44
if you start googling avril lavigne
02:46
it leads you to websites where you can
02:48
get viruses it can do apparently
02:50
fourteen point five percent
02:52
yeah yeah well i googled her seven times
02:54
in the course of research for this
02:55
podcast and my computer is now riddled
02:57
with
02:58
virus exactly i've got no research on
03:00
average levine
03:01
i just stopped i closed my computer i've
03:03
got a stonking case of stuxnet
03:07
it's weird because mcafee speculated
03:10
about why
03:10
it could be and they said that viruses
03:13
you'd normally put a virus in from the
03:15
most popular searches and so they think
03:17
that
03:17
the reason she's become the most
03:18
virus-laden person is because interest
03:20
in her has suddenly peaked
03:22
because she's working on a new album and
03:24
there's an internet conspiracy that
03:25
she's been replaced by an imposter
03:27
that's right i would still say that she
03:29
is not the most popularly googled person
03:31
on the internet in 2017.
03:33
i can think of one more oh yeah
03:35
christine aguilera
03:36
that's right yeah her husband chad from
03:39
nickelback
03:40
did they not split up what they reunited
03:44
did they yeah oh god james do not do
03:46
that to me i know dan
03:48
you're a big fan no i'm just worried
03:49
that chad will get sad build up more
03:51
material and release another nickelback
03:53
album onto the world
03:54
keep him happy he's got nothing to say
03:57
um so they do these charts every year
03:58
don't they so in previous years they've
03:59
had other celebrities i think maybe in
04:01
2015 it was ellie goulding who was the
04:03
most popular
04:04
and there's a men's and women's chart as
04:06
well just because i don't think we
04:07
couldn't possibly be expected to
04:09
compute people of different sexes or
04:11
both giving you computer viruses
04:13
well i think women are susceptible to
04:14
different viruses maybe
04:16
is that it is it i don't know who are
04:18
some of the male ones
04:19
so um bruno mars um i'm reading this
04:23
list of celebrities and trying to work
04:24
out which ones have been and which ones
04:26
are women
04:27
such as my pop culture knowledge uh
04:29
justin bieber i'm pretty sure he's a man
04:31
sean diddy coombs uh and zayn malik i
04:34
think are the only men
04:36
in the top ten is that puff daddy sean
04:38
diddy coons it is indeed
04:39
yeah yeah okay and um celine dion's on
04:42
there nice to see celine
04:44
making an appearance another canadian
04:46
pop star
04:47
yeah so according to uh actually justin
04:49
bieber's canadian is interesting
04:51
in fact this is a very heavy canadian
04:53
list yeah
04:54
she so supposedly um celine dion is the
04:58
top-selling canadian artist of all time
05:00
and apparently avril lavigne is number
05:01
two
05:02
and james and i were trying to work out
05:04
surely
05:06
like surely she can't be in it too
05:07
available she's not shania
05:09
because she's got a lot of country fans
05:11
yeah yeah
05:12
i didn't know she was canadian though
05:14
have you checked that i didn't
05:16
know well you brought her up i didn't
05:18
bring her up
05:19
yeah you did i said she's number two
05:21
what about shania twain no
05:22
i said what about aladdin sparrow set oh
05:24
yeah he said atlanta smart set and then
05:25
i said nope beats her and should i talk
05:27
right now
05:28
that was me until now i have been
05:29
laboring under the miss apprehension
05:31
that avril lavigne and alanis morissette
05:32
are the same person
05:35
i realized now they're not they're very
05:37
different people
05:38
yes cool some others in the top 50
05:43
um anna kendrick number 13
05:46
don't know who she is oh come on she's a
05:47
very famous actress haley steinfield
05:49
number 23 don't know who that is
05:52
uh tayana taylor number 45 don't know
05:55
who that is
05:56
and zendaya number 50 don't know who
05:58
that is
05:59
i'm impressed you know all the others uh
06:01
well the others were will smith jackie
06:03
chan
06:04
so i heard of them doesn't ring any
06:06
bells attenborough is attenborough
06:07
anywhere
06:08
which one david
06:12
all right no actually neither any
06:14
dimblebees make the list
06:16
no your computer's safe andy okay
06:22
it's the idea that you are downloading
06:23
things related to these people so you're
06:25
downloading wallpapers or ringtones or
06:27
whatever i think that's it yeah so if
06:28
you were to search for avril lavigne and
06:30
try and find a little knockoff mp3 of
06:32
one of her
06:33
hits then that might give you a virus i
06:36
understand which i think
06:36
explains why a few of them are pop stars
06:40
yes of course yes because dimbleby
06:42
didn't release an album
06:43
well he releases 45 minutes of
06:45
absolutely blazing uh
06:47
comment and analysis every week so
06:50
anyway i was looking up computer viruses
06:52
because as we've ascertained i didn't
06:54
know research whatsoever on avril
06:55
lavigne
06:56
and uh the first ever human to get a
06:59
computer virus got one in 2010
07:02
is this like a cyborg yes ah so there's
07:05
a guy called dr mark gasson
07:07
from the university of reading and he
07:09
had a chip in his hand which he used to
07:10
go should have put it on his shoulder
07:14
he used it to go through security doors
07:17
and unlock his phone and stuff like that
07:18
the bbc described it quite sniffily i
07:20
thought as a sophisticated version of id
07:22
chips used to tag pets
07:24
um and he gave himself a virus as an
07:27
experiment
07:28
to see whether people could for example
07:30
hack into pacemakers in future
07:32
yeah and this is now one of the big
07:34
worries and what happened when he gave
07:35
himself a virus did he come down with a
07:37
cold what
07:38
uh i think he couldn't get into his
07:39
phone
07:41
wow that's worse than a cold yeah the
07:43
future looks bleak
07:45
the first computer virus ever was the
07:47
cookie monster virus
07:49
right i think or i mean i think there
07:50
may be there are various claims for what
07:52
constitutes a
07:52
virus but in the late 1960s there was
07:55
this cookie monster
07:56
virus which was some malware that froze
07:58
your computer until you typed the word
08:00
cookie at it
08:00
and then it kept freezing your computer
08:02
you typed the word cookie and you had to
08:04
incessantly feed it cookies
08:06
and it was just created at brown
08:07
university to piss off their fellow
08:09
students
08:09
but if you type the word oreo it cured
08:12
it
08:15
that's very good it is good and there
08:16
was one there was one version of it
08:18
which would demand that you type cookie
08:20
incessantly until you literally couldn't
08:21
do anything because you just have to
08:22
type the word cookie over and over and
08:24
over again and then eventually it would
08:25
crash and the message would come up
08:26
saying i didn't want a cookie anyway
08:29
it was good in the olden days when
08:31
computer virus makers were just having
08:33
fun
08:33
yeah yes there was like a golden age of
08:37
computer piracy uh there was one called
08:39
casino
08:40
which would you know well actually it
08:43
would remove all the files from your
08:44
computer so it was quite bad
08:45
but it will also swear at you you know
08:47
it would say you [ __ ]
08:48
say bye to your balls and then it would
08:51
give you
08:52
it would give you a jackpot slot machine
08:54
you've got five chances to spin the
08:56
wheels and get three matching icons like
08:58
in a fruit machine
08:58
and if you didn't then it swore at you
09:01
and then deleted all your stuff
09:02
so it was bad but it was at least it was
09:04
a bit personal yeah at least you had a
09:06
bit of fun before you lost all of your
09:08
life
09:08
yeah yeah they used to have a sense of
09:10
humor didn't they
09:12
before the pc brigade do you know what
09:14
okay
09:16
do you know what um the american
09:18
government has stopped
09:20
uh worrying about this year um nazis
09:24
this is definitely about computer
09:26
viruses right stuxnet
09:28
no being hacked into by other countries
09:30
it's no
09:31
uh they yeah they stopped worrying about
09:32
that a while ago i guess the
09:34
thing that they've stopped this year is
09:35
they've stopped uh providing updates on
09:37
how they're going to deal with the
09:38
millennium bug
09:41
with y2k and this is this is thanks to
09:44
trump
09:44
uh basically there's an obscure rule
09:47
that means that federal agencies are
09:49
required to keep providing
09:50
updates on how they would deal with the
09:52
y2k bug
09:53
um and basically they've noticed that it
09:56
was just costing a lot of
09:57
money in terms of time because it was
09:58
all this paperwork constantly being
10:00
having to be filed
10:02
so they finally have had it stopped the
10:04
americans are no longer looking at how
10:05
to prepare
10:06
for the millennium bug that's quite
10:08
sensible of trump actually and i know
10:09
you don't hear that very often but
10:11
if he was the only person who realized
10:14
that the millennium had passed and
10:15
nothing had happened then
10:16
good on him i bet he was because he made
10:18
that a big feature of the campaign
10:19
didn't he
10:20
do you remember stop that bug
10:23
the crowd's chancing
10:27
have you heard of defcon not defcon the
10:29
security setting where you say we're at
10:31
5 or whatever this is a hacking
10:33
convention which happens
10:34
in las vegas every year so they converge
10:36
on this hotel in las vegas
10:38
and one of the things they did this year
10:40
was they hacked into u.s voting machines
10:42
and they uh rick rolled them they got
10:43
them to play raycasty songs instead of
10:47
well they've got the voting machines to
10:48
play cassie's song yeah but why have
10:50
they got microphones and speakers on
10:51
them
10:52
well i presumably they say things like
10:53
thank you for voting
10:55
what do you mean presumably you've never
10:58
voted
11:03
that's weird though isn't it in america
11:04
what we're saying here is that if you
11:06
vote in america
11:07
it gives you a little tune afterwards
11:09
well no it's not what i'm saying
11:11
but it's what i presume i presume to
11:12
have microphone somehow guys if you're
11:14
in america can you write in another
11:16
voting machines talk to you as you vote
11:17
um but there's a terrible thing about
11:19
when
11:19
you're a normal guest staying at this
11:21
hotel during defcon you're just being
11:22
constantly hacked into at all times so
11:26
there's there's an account of a
11:27
journalist who went there and he
11:28
basically had to turn off
11:29
everything he had to turn his iphone
11:30
into a brick turn off wi-fi turn off 3g
11:33
not use anything and the local ups store
11:35
you know they did printing and stuff
11:37
they said we are not accepting any
11:39
printing for hotel guests
11:41
from links in emails we are only we're
11:43
not accepting usb
11:44
sticks we're only accepting very
11:47
particular kinds of things because
11:48
people just kept on hacking into the ups
11:50
store as well
11:51
it's like having a bunch of kind of
11:53
hardened criminals
11:54
even if they're not actually committing
11:56
crime in this case stay in your hotel
11:57
and you would lock up all the minibars
11:59
yeah it's like a pickpockets convention
12:01
yeah all the people in the hotel who
12:02
don't know about the convention are just
12:03
constantly having their pockets picked
12:04
yeah yeah
12:05
do you know who claims to be the most
12:08
popular hacking target
12:10
in the world oh john mcafee it is indeed
12:13
yeah mr mcafee himself um
12:16
says he's the badge of honor for any
12:18
hacker because
12:20
he's mr anti hacking software um but he
12:23
tricks people by changing the
12:24
pronunciation of his son
12:25
willy nilly from mcafee which it clearly
12:28
is
12:29
um so another celebrity whose
12:32
name is associated with hacking is
12:35
britney spears
12:38
britney spears has an instagram account
12:41
and there is a thing with malware called
12:44
command and control system it's quite
12:46
complicated but basically
12:48
if you're a virus you need to keep
12:50
getting updates so you keep need to go
12:52
to different websites to get your
12:53
updates
12:54
but the websites always move so that
12:56
people can't catch them
12:57
but you need to know where the websites
12:59
are and so what these hackers are doing
13:01
is they're using comments in britney
13:03
spears instagram accounts to hide the
13:05
addresses
13:06
where these cnc systems are held wow
13:10
so if you were to read all the comments
13:11
in britney spears's instagram and you'll
13:13
be able to
13:14
i do and you do yeah have you noticed
13:16
any urls hidden in the
13:18
i mean they're quite well hidden in code
13:19
and stuff oh well then i haven't
13:22
you read them all on facebook yeah i do
13:26
keep being great brittany so all they
13:29
have to do is delete andy's comments and
13:31
the ones that are left yeah are going to
13:33
be
13:34
cnc systems wow does this mean that
13:36
hackers
13:37
have to have this massive knowledge of
13:39
britney spears filling their brains now
13:41
because they've had to plow through
13:42
these series of comments about her in
13:44
order to find their code
13:45
my feeling is that the computer probably
13:47
does it automatically
13:48
because the one thing that computers are
13:50
best at probably is going through large
13:52
amounts of data and sifting out the
13:54
important bits
13:55
now so i don't get to read the i prefer
13:57
to when she was bold kind of
13:58
comments below but they might see the
14:00
photos right if it's
14:01
if it's people doing it they might see
14:03
the i mean when you're on the internet
14:05
you often see pictures of britney spears
14:07
who are not it's quite nice though that
14:09
even though they are doing this illegal
14:11
activity that if they did meet up
14:12
they will have all got a good knowledge
14:14
of what she's up to in life and there's
14:16
a common thing they can talk about yeah
14:18
so you reckon when all of the hackers
14:20
kind of meet up once a year they
14:21
probably chat about britney
14:23
they're probably like 45 minutes on the
14:24
malware stuff let's leave a good 15.
14:33
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:35
that is andy
14:37
my fact is there is a type of dinosaur
14:38
which is almost always found
14:40
on its back sexy sexy
14:44
um so it's like lie back and think of
14:47
gondwanaland
14:48
yes they didn't die having sex guys
14:52
okay because then you'd have to find an
14:53
equal number on top of those
14:55
you're right ankylosauruses um so
14:58
there's been a new study into them and
14:59
basically
15:00
uh 70 of them are found upside down
15:02
which is a lot more than other dinosaurs
15:04
and there were loads of theories about
15:05
why like they got turned upside down by
15:07
predators because they have
15:08
a really big shell on their back so
15:10
you'll be able to eat the soft
15:11
underbelly
15:12
exactly uh all that after they die their
15:14
body's filled up with gas and then they
15:16
rolled over onto their back because of
15:18
that and
15:20
none of these theories are right and
15:21
it's really obvious in the end the
15:23
conclusion
15:24
is that they got swept out to sea and
15:27
then they turned upside down because the
15:28
gas in their bellies was lighter
15:30
and then they sank to the seabed that
15:32
way and they stayed upside down
15:33
and then they became fossilized and
15:35
other animals don't do that so that's
15:36
the difference
15:38
i wonder why they um bloated and other
15:40
animals didn't is it because of the
15:42
heavy
15:42
shell i think they all blow but i think
15:44
it's the shell which make a difference
15:45
and this is the cool thing to study this
15:47
the scientists from the canadian museum
15:49
of nature in ontario they studied
15:51
armadillos
15:52
because that was i guess a close
15:54
equivalent in the real world
15:56
so they have a close shell-like thing on
15:58
their back yeah
15:59
have we said the name of the dinosaur
16:01
yes okay
16:03
ankylosaurus is that do you know what
16:05
that means ankylosaurus or is that
16:06
anything to do with fused and kilo means
16:09
so like fused together plates oh okay
16:13
yeah so these guys just to give you a
16:15
picture of what they look like
16:17
they look a bit like armadillos don't
16:18
they they've got this big heavy shell
16:21
they look a bit like a tank but then
16:23
they got a massive tail with a big knob
16:25
on the end
16:25
yeah okay and have we known about them
16:28
for a long time and
16:30
and now we've just worked out why
16:31
they're upside down
16:33
right it's not like their new dinosaurs
16:35
that we thought
16:36
yesterday were different upside down
16:38
because we couldn't recognize them
16:39
upside down
16:40
yeah we thought they were tables
16:45
it would still be an upside down table
16:47
it would but a table's more easy to
16:49
identify when it's
16:49
upside down whereas a dinosaur is
16:51
completely impossible to recognize
16:53
i'm trying to think of something else
16:55
with the legs in the air power station
16:57
that's what we thought they were yes i
16:59
thought they were mini power stations
17:02
and they've got i think they've got very
17:03
thick skin and this is part of the
17:04
reason why this happens because their
17:05
skin's so thick it can take the gas
17:07
pressure
17:08
um the pressure of all those decomposing
17:09
gases building up and so that means they
17:12
float for a while on their backs before
17:13
sinking
17:14
okay and scientists call it bloat and
17:16
float understandably
17:18
ironically seeing as they sink yeah well
17:20
they float at first
17:22
sure sink doesn't rhyme well exactly you
17:25
have to be then shrink and sink bloat
17:28
and float shrink and sink
17:30
what rhymes with fossilized
17:33
um so this uh massive knob at the end of
17:36
their tail you would think that they
17:38
would kind of swing it round to batter
17:39
people with
17:41
which they probably did but it's there
17:43
weren't people though so
17:45
i guess yeah that's probably why they
17:47
thinking yeah
17:48
um but they weren't kind of whippy their
17:51
tails they were fused
17:52
so they were kind of straight hard tails
17:55
that they would bash people with
17:57
knobbly bit do you mean it was like
17:59
effectively like a javelin then in that
18:00
it was a sturdy
18:01
it's like a javelin but with a shot putt
18:04
on the end of it yeah but then it's
18:05
fused to your spine
18:07
yes it's like a javelin but if you threw
18:09
it you would fly with the javelin
18:11
because it didn't throw its tail off
18:13
every time it was under attack
18:14
effectively it's like a german i mean
18:16
i'm trying to picture the
18:17
the sort of shape and length of it it's
18:19
like you know you know
18:20
tails that animals have yeah it's like
18:23
that
18:24
yeah but it's solid like a javelin
18:27
well like a chaplain yeah it's a really
18:29
strong simile i don't know
18:31
it's i don't know where well here's an
18:34
interesting thing that
18:35
that combines james's javelin tale with
18:38
uh andy's upside down table dinosaur um
18:42
they've worked out recently plesiosaurs
18:44
which
18:45
um had the longest neck of any of the
18:47
dinosaurs i believe
18:48
um 23 foot long what they couldn't work
18:51
out this has been another dinosaur
18:52
underwater mystery
18:53
is how they could swim at speeds with
18:56
that neck because
18:57
the pressure of the water pushing the
18:58
neck around just wouldn't work
19:00
and what they think now is that they
19:02
actually extended their neck and held it
19:04
like a rod
19:05
like a firm javelin as they swam
19:09
through the waters did you accidentally
19:10
research javelins for this
19:12
is that what you want to talk about so
19:15
one thing about diplodocus
19:16
necks originally it was thought they
19:18
held them straight
19:19
and upright at about 60 degrees like a
19:22
giraffe neck
19:23
which obviously was wrong but then it
19:25
was thought they held them level in
19:26
front of them and counterbalanced their
19:28
tail
19:28
but that also has fallen out of favor
19:30
and the latest theory is that they had a
19:33
sort of
19:33
swan like curve to their neck wow
19:36
really yes because almost all land
19:39
vertebrates
19:40
which are studied like birds for example
19:43
hold
19:44
their necks in that sort of uprightish
19:46
curve
19:47
like a pelican like a pelican exactly
19:49
like a bent javelin
19:50
like a bench um
19:54
although there are some and some
19:55
calculations say that if it
19:57
had held its head completely upright or
19:59
at a at a rigid
20:00
upright angle uh using traditional
20:03
methods it would have had to use
20:04
half its energy pumping blood to its
20:07
brain
20:07
using traditional methods maybe you had
20:10
untraditional methods maybe you had some
20:11
birds supporting it on either side
20:15
using the old ways whichever way a
20:18
dinosaur does it must be more
20:19
traditional
20:20
whatever way we do it um on
20:23
animals lying on their backs with their
20:25
legs in the air i was looking for
20:27
examples of animals doing this it's
20:28
actually quite rare
20:29
and quite hard to look into but there
20:31
was a new scientist
20:33
forum where someone posted a question
20:35
which was
20:36
when i was younger my mom used to drive
20:38
us past a field with a horse in it
20:40
there was a sign that read this horse is
20:42
not dead he sleeps that way
20:44
and the horse was always lying on its
20:46
back with its legs locked straight up in
20:48
the air
20:49
does anyone know what was going on is
20:51
this common
20:53
are they sure it wasn't the table
20:54
[Laughter]
20:56
were there answers on the phone there
20:58
were lots of answers most people said
21:00
the legs in the air makes sense because
21:02
horses have a locking mechanism which
21:03
makes their legs
21:04
so when horses go to sleep which they
21:06
usually do standing up then their legs
21:08
lock so they don't
21:09
yeah fall over but no one could quite
21:12
answer the question of why it was
21:13
sleeping on his back with his legs in
21:14
the air they all said that it's quite
21:15
unusual
21:16
maybe it's just a special horse a
21:18
special i love having to put a sign up
21:20
this horse isn't dead
21:21
don't knock on our door i think i would
21:23
put that sign up if i had a dead horse
21:25
and i didn't want anyone to know about
21:26
it
21:26
it's just asleep to save you having to
21:29
go and bury it
21:30
just for the whole designer um so you
21:33
we we've talked about t-rex arms before
21:36
i think
21:37
um or everyone knows that they have
21:39
these tiny arms which look really
21:40
impractical
21:41
yeah so there was a theory that
21:44
um they would use them to stand up
21:46
because do t-rexes lie down to sleep
21:50
i guess they can afford to but then how
21:51
do they get up again or do they sleep
21:52
like a special horse on their back with
21:54
their legs
21:56
um but the latest theory suggests that
21:58
they did not use their arms to get up
22:01
because they sometimes went a month
22:02
without using their arms for anything
22:05
that amazing how do we know that you
22:08
know what that sounds like
22:09
sounds like one of those charity months
22:10
that you do for something
22:13
like no um yeah no amber
22:18
we could we could set that up so yeah
22:20
how i mean how do we know that that is a
22:22
really fair question
22:23
don't know we know that
22:28
but then how do you write a diary if
22:29
you're not using your art
22:31
it was just an empty month in the diary
22:33
go straight from first gen to second feb
22:36
sorry for not writing and raising money
22:39
from
22:40
diplodocus around the corner yeah
22:42
successful no humber
22:45
[Music]
22:45
[Applause]
22:49
okay there's time for fact number three
22:51
and that is my fact
22:53
my fact this week is that snakes that
22:56
eat
22:56
snakes can eat snakes that are 139
23:01
of their body length wow so that is the
23:04
equivalent
23:04
of me as a six foot one person eating
23:08
an eight foot four inch tall hot dog
23:11
in one bite but the hot dog is also
23:14
as broad as you yeah yeah it's a massive
23:17
hot dog it's a big hot dog it's
23:18
it's yeah i mean we should really be
23:20
talking about where i got this hot dog
23:21
from
23:22
i think hot dog is like one of those um
23:25
it's like a mascot in a in a sports
23:28
thing
23:28
they'll be about eight foot yes that's
23:30
all right yeah and they'll be about
23:31
human size
23:32
one of those guys yeah so um i found
23:36
this on a website called
23:39
snakesolong.blogspot.com
23:41
and i the reason i found it was i saw a
23:43
video earlier this week of a snake
23:45
eating a snake and what i didn't
23:47
ever stop to think was when they eat
23:48
snakes they do actually start with the
23:50
head
23:51
and they just eat it as a snake they
23:54
just like
23:55
the equivalent of like a train going
23:56
into a tunnel like it just
23:58
disappears you would if you're a snake
24:00
one you're not going to eat it bum first
24:02
are you because that's disgusting yeah
24:04
and then two you're not going to eat it
24:05
sideways like a corn on the cob or
24:07
something
24:07
so it's the only obvious way to eat that
24:09
that's slightly what i thought though i
24:10
thought they don't
24:11
necessarily i thought they would eat
24:12
chunks of it i didn't know that you just
24:14
i didn't know they swallow everything
24:16
also i think i think i would eat a snake
24:18
bum first if she wasn't
24:20
well for a start you get the bit you
24:21
don't want to eat really very much out
24:23
of the way first
24:24
it's like saving your roast potatoes at
24:26
the end of a roast dinner it's exactly
24:27
like that
24:28
yeah yeah i don't see that i don't have
24:30
a second
24:33
the good thing is that it fits into you
24:34
more neatly because you fit the body of
24:36
the snake exactly into you
24:38
like the length of a snake so yeah
24:40
you're much more like a russian doll of
24:41
snakes
24:42
yes that's true so here's the issue
24:44
though um and which is what the headline
24:46
fact is meant to be highlighting
24:49
is that they can eat snakes that are
24:51
longer than themselves so that would
24:52
seem like a bizarre move because they do
24:54
have to eat it in one go
24:55
otherwise if they take a break halfway
24:58
through a snake
24:59
they the the rest of the snake could
25:01
start rotting which is really bad for
25:02
them in the digestive system or
25:04
they have to haul another snake with
25:06
them if they're escaping a predator
25:07
so they've doubled their body size and
25:09
their weight in order presumably they
25:11
can because obviously they can eat like
25:13
huge like deer and stuff that stretch
25:14
out their skin so presumably they just
25:16
fold the snake up inside themselves
25:18
so that's that's the issue because of
25:20
the length of the snake
25:22
um they can their stomachs don't go all
25:24
the way to their tails they have
25:25
actually a lot of muscle down near the
25:26
bottom so obviously it can only go
25:28
as far as deep as their stomach goes so
25:30
that's the issue they need to work out
25:31
when they're eating the snake how can
25:32
they fit that entire snake into their
25:34
body but don't they just
25:35
fold it they sort of concertina it they
25:37
yeah yeah
25:38
concertina their ribs and then the dead
25:40
snake inside them is squished
25:42
up and then the living snake outside can
25:44
stretch out it's like an accordion
25:46
it's like an accordion yeah um so there
25:48
is a myth that snakes
25:49
uh which are owned domestically uh
25:51
stretch themselves out
25:53
next to their owners or next to family
25:55
pets so they're measuring them
25:57
to see how long they are this is not
25:59
true
26:00
another website about this an amazing
26:02
snake website which said
26:03
false snakes have no sense of
26:05
measurement they are not
26:07
rulers they do not know how long they
26:09
are versus how tall or long
26:10
anything else is i think that can't be
26:12
true
26:13
but they it's true that they don't in
26:16
the wild
26:17
measure out the deer that they're
26:18
planning to eat
26:20
because it would run away they must know
26:22
how long they are though
26:23
like if it it's so you know if you're
26:26
escaping from something you know that
26:28
your tails out of its reach and stuff
26:29
yeah do they have a
26:30
basic idea do they have a sense of self
26:32
i think is the question we're asking
26:34
do they even know they're a snake that's
26:36
true but i think they must have a basic
26:38
idea of how long they are
26:39
must do but otherwise they'd keep
26:41
thinking they were hidden well but
26:42
actually their entire body
26:44
that's just stupid like a four-year-old
26:46
playing hide and seek
26:49
they just put their tail over their eyes
26:52
they can't see me
26:54
they do sometimes eat their own tail
26:56
don't they yes they do eat themselves
26:58
when they get stressed i think
26:59
is that oh so that's not by accident
27:00
they haven't sometimes by accident it is
27:02
by accident
27:03
because they're like i'm not that long
27:05
that this tale could be here
27:07
it must be someone else they don't even
27:08
prey on themselves and then get up to
27:11
about halfway along themselves they
27:12
think oh hang on
27:14
they do do that yeah no never eat bum
27:17
first
27:17
it always happens when you do that um
27:20
yeah they sometimes eat their own tail
27:22
and it might be if a predator has been
27:24
on their tail and it's got the smell of
27:26
it
27:26
and they just see a lot of them just
27:28
work by movement and if the tail is
27:29
wiggling around
27:30
it smells like prey but it isn't they're
27:33
not supposed to
27:34
as in it's not useful to them to eat
27:36
themselves
27:38
um i was reading about an australian guy
27:40
called tony barton
27:41
who saw a snake eat another snake um so
27:44
he saw
27:44
a uh red belly black snake eat an
27:47
eastern brown snake in his garden he
27:50
took a picture of it and the snake as
27:52
snakes do then went for a sleep because
27:53
they can't chew they always go away and
27:55
have to have a sleep so their stomach
27:56
can digest what they've actually eaten
27:58
and he went back a bit later to check on
28:00
it and he said the black snake
28:02
had his mouth a bit open and he saw a
28:03
pair of eyes inside the mouth
28:05
and then he photographed the snake
28:07
hauling itself back out of
28:09
the other snake's body um so it latched
28:11
onto the snake that had eaten its jaw
28:13
and pulled itself out and then slithered
28:15
away covered in mucus
28:17
that's interesting i wonder if that
28:18
means he was eating bum first though
28:21
no he was eating head first what he said
28:22
was interesting he turned around inside
28:24
something that's very impressive
28:26
very clever yeah i don't think i'd have
28:28
the wherewithal to do that do you think
28:30
you'd back up
28:31
i think i'd just lie down and die if
28:34
i've been completely swallowed by a
28:35
snake i don't think i'm going anywhere
28:36
yeah really
28:37
i think i'll think of it it's that kind
28:38
of defeatist attitude
28:40
it's gonna make brexit a failure yeah um
28:43
one thing about when snakes eat
28:45
animals they completely change they
28:47
almost become another animal
28:48
not quite but what okay so for example
28:51
when a python eats a whole deer right
28:52
yeah
28:53
its metabolism gets 40 times faster
28:57
and the blood is blood goes milky
28:59
because it suddenly has all these fatty
29:00
acids its heart
29:02
increases by 40 in size it completely
29:04
changes
29:05
wow and this is so cool okay so when
29:07
humans
29:08
um eat we increase our oxygen
29:10
consumption by about
29:11
a quarter because we need to speed up
29:13
our metabolism we need to get more
29:14
oxygen into our body
29:16
to digest the food right after python
29:18
eats an animal let's say 65
29:20
of its weight it increases its oxygen
29:22
consumption 36 fold
29:24
wow which is a huge amount so humans
29:26
when we're sprinting we increase tenfold
29:28
snakes do um 36 fold and if a snake was
29:31
to eat a prey that was
29:33
bigger than it was let's say one and a
29:34
half times it was like you said dan
29:36
it might be taking in 100 times as much
29:38
oxygen that's amazing
29:40
so when i was i don't know if i
29:41
mentioned this but i was in peru a few
29:43
weeks ago
29:44
and when you're in altitude and you're
29:46
eating you're always out of breath you
29:48
have to keep stopping you can't really
29:49
talk and eat at the same time because
29:51
and now i know it like you say it's
29:53
because you're taking more oxygen
29:54
you shouldn't talk with your mouth full
29:55
anyway james i've been meaning to say
29:56
that
29:59
but for snakes it must be ten times
30:01
worse right yeah
30:02
that's why they lie in the sun is the
30:04
speed of their metabolism that's why
30:05
they have to lie in the sun after
30:06
they've had a big meal
30:07
and it takes so much energy to digest
30:09
the meal that when a python has had a
30:11
big meal
30:12
half the energy it gets from the meal
30:14
goes on digesting the meal
30:17
what a waste that's like you know when
30:18
we say it takes up more energy to eat a
30:20
stick of celery than
30:22
you get from it they say do you know it
30:24
takes more energy to eat one of those
30:25
baby deers than you'll actually get
30:28
it's completely pointless
30:30
[Applause]
30:35
okay it is time for our final fact of
30:37
the show and that is
30:38
anna my fact is that medieval street
30:41
performers
30:42
multiplied numbers together in public
30:44
for entertainment
30:46
it's great it's amazing and presumably
30:48
they were quite hard numbers there
30:49
weren't things like six times nine
30:50
well they weren't 54. i've got some
30:53
change here somewhere
30:56
james where's your hat um
30:59
this is something i found in a book
31:02
online a book called lost discoveries
31:04
the ancient roots of modern
31:05
science and it's basically the fact that
31:08
in sort of late medieval times arabic
31:11
numbers were coming over from india so
31:13
the numbers that we use today
31:14
come over here count our sheep
31:18
migrant refugee arabic numbers were
31:20
coming over
31:21
from india and they were better than
31:23
roman numerals and you could do things
31:25
like long multiplication and long
31:26
division with them
31:27
but the authorities in europe didn't
31:29
trust them so they sort of banned them
31:31
so it meant that there were these street
31:33
performers who kind of had this secret
31:34
knowledge of arabic numbers and so they
31:36
could do what seemed like
31:37
incredible multiplication i mean it was
31:39
quite simple you know it'd be like
31:41
12 times 16 which obviously we can edit
31:44
out the huge ports well we all work that
31:46
out
31:46
four times four times four times three
31:48
hundred and eight oh well it's not that
31:50
then
31:51
yeah so it's 64 threes 192
31:56
who would who would be there to sort of
31:58
fact check them yeah that's a really
32:00
good point that's
32:00
such a good question i guess they just
32:02
took on face value like yeah you come
32:04
back you say
32:05
i've got some multiplication it's
32:06
correct trust me and they put money in
32:08
your house but hang on when did we get
32:10
um arabic numbers in the west in western
32:12
europe was it roman numerals and today
32:15
so i think yeah are you serious let's
32:17
get them until after
32:19
this is because this is what's so
32:20
fascinating about them they were known
32:22
to exist
32:23
from like the 6th century and they
32:25
started coming over there was a pope who
32:27
tried to introduce
32:28
them in the 10th century into europe and
32:30
the authorities hated them
32:31
they hated zero for instance can i just
32:33
ask sorry to interrupt but which pope
32:35
was it because
32:36
like popes famously don't use arabic
32:38
numbers do they
32:39
it's always pope pius the x yeah yeah
32:42
you're right yeah
32:43
so they're the ones who are sticking
32:44
with it you're absolutely right it was
32:46
pope sylvester
32:47
the two
32:51
he actually he got in a lot of trouble
32:53
because his real name was gerbert of
32:55
aoriak which i like
32:56
um so gerbert went to spain and so he
33:00
got from
33:00
africa some knowledge of these arabic
33:02
numbers and he went back to italy became
33:04
pope
33:04
and tried to spread this knowledge and
33:06
people just thought it was black magic
33:08
that he could actually add numbers
33:09
together and do division
33:11
and so they labeled him as a sorcerer
33:12
and this dogged him throughout his
33:14
papacy
33:15
the fact that he could perform this
33:16
weird black magic um i find that
33:18
absolutely amazing i would have thought
33:19
in the doomsday book
33:20
you would have said there are six sheep
33:22
here and you know you'd have the number
33:24
six
33:25
i guess not and we're saying that is not
33:27
the case no no that was incredible
33:28
didn't adopt it still as james said sort
33:30
of early renaissance wow
33:31
mid-renaissance um and i was reading
33:34
quite a lot about zero
33:35
which was seen as like the pinnacle of
33:37
the evil of arabic numbers because
33:39
it represented nothingness and that was
33:41
seen as really ungodly
33:43
but merchants in europe kind of picked
33:46
up on this
33:46
underbelly of arabic numbers and
33:48
realized it's much easier to use them
33:50
so they had to use them in secret um and
33:53
so they'd flash zeroes at each other
33:55
which meant i use arabic numbers we can
33:57
use arabic numbers in this chapter so
33:58
this flashes
33:59
at each other what is flashing gesture
34:01
with the hands they do a ring with their
34:03
hands
34:03
you know that game when you're at school
34:05
and you do a ring and if they see it
34:06
below your waist you're allowed to punch
34:07
them in the arm oh unless you get your
34:09
finger inside
34:09
yeah yeah unless you put a one in there
34:12
yeah do you reckon that's an ancient
34:13
kind of musty that's definitely i think
34:16
where that trace is back to yeah
34:18
yeah this is actually why so the word
34:20
zero comes from
34:21
a word sipher which is also where the
34:24
word cipher comes from
34:25
because zero was used as this secret
34:28
cipher thing
34:29
and the person who named zero was a guy
34:32
called mohammed al-khorazimi
34:34
who also invented based on his name the
34:37
algorithm
34:39
so the algorithm is a corruption of the
34:42
name al-khwarazimi
34:43
cool there was a guy called johann
34:46
martin zacharias dasa
34:48
he was german and he once multiplied two
34:52
20-digit numbers together in six minutes
34:55
okay which was considered extremely good
34:57
at the time and i think now
34:59
was that in his head uh in his head yeah
35:01
whoa
35:02
it depends on what if it was just a
35:04
billion times you know
35:05
or a thousand billion times a thousand
35:08
billion that's not actually that
35:09
difficult it's true
35:10
although a thousand billion is still a
35:12
long way off twenty years isn't it
35:14
you're right but anyway he managed to do
35:16
it wow and then he managed to multiply
35:18
two 100 digit numbers in eight and three
35:21
quarter hours
35:25
who was sticking around to watch that
35:27
full show i think he'd stay for the
35:29
first hour
35:30
and a half wouldn't you you'd want to
35:31
come back for the ending though you
35:32
wouldn't want to miss it
35:33
yeah yeah and you don't know when the
35:35
ending's going to be exactly so it's
35:36
mostly a tension thing
35:38
yeah wow um sorry are we saying he did
35:41
this in his head or he did it in his
35:43
because the famous mathematician carl
35:45
friedrich gauss
35:46
um said that someone skilled in
35:48
calculation could have done the
35:50
calculation in
35:51
half that time with pencil and paper oh
35:54
okay which i think is a bit harsh really
35:56
for someone who's multiplying hundred
35:58
digit numbers yeah i think it is yeah
36:00
i think it's a bit sniffy actually and
36:02
um in the book girdle escherbach which
36:04
we have downstairs
36:06
they talk about this guy desert and they
36:08
say that he had an uncanny sense of
36:10
quantity
36:10
he could just tell without counting how
36:12
many sheep were in a field
36:16
well i mean it again it all depends how
36:19
many sheep there are in the field
36:20
because i like to think that below is
36:21
below a certain threshold of sheep i
36:23
could just tell how many sheets are in
36:24
there well this is interesting
36:26
so what is that number like how many
36:27
would you you could definitely tell if
36:29
there were four
36:29
i could definitely tell but if there
36:31
were 12 by just looking would you know
36:33
there were 12. no i wouldn't
36:34
no so what's the level um if you're
36:37
standing in a 3x4 grid
36:39
perfectly i could tell there were twelve
36:41
how often does that happen
36:42
seldom from my studies because all
36:44
you've really worked out there is that
36:46
there's a three and a four
36:47
you've calculated the 12. i would
36:49
instantly say there are 12 there
36:50
sure that's because your multiplication
36:52
tables are so good thank you
36:54
you should be a street performer
36:57
really low rent three by four give me
37:00
any number
37:01
between one and four this guy could do
37:04
his sheep thing up to thirty
37:06
up to around 30. this is he would
37:08
literally just
37:09
quick look and just see right yeah he
37:12
must have been a real scream at parties
37:14
rusty
37:14
no we don't want to go out of the field
37:16
again no come on just once more
37:17
take me out of the field or do you think
37:19
he'd walk into your party and
37:21
immediately go oh there are only 42
37:22
people here
37:24
if you were in a party and you could
37:26
tell how many people were there
37:28
and you could look at a plate of canapes
37:30
and know exactly how many canapes were
37:31
on the plate
37:32
you would know whether you had to
37:33
quickly go for the canopies in my
37:35
experience there are very few people at
37:36
the party and i never have to go for
37:38
more cannabis
37:42
but the the arabic zero numeral has come
37:44
in very handy indeed
37:47
do you know in moscow as a street as a
37:50
busker you have to go through a really
37:51
rigorous process now
37:53
to be able to busk and so this is to be
37:56
able to play on the moscow subway
37:58
musicians have to actually go through
38:00
this proper selection process where
38:03
they are selected by a jury so they go
38:05
in and they have to do this full
38:06
performance to a jury of professional
38:07
musicians
38:08
and to a bunch of people from the tv
38:11
talent show voice of russia
38:15
which i imagine is like a very high bar
38:17
to clear imagine going in as a busker
38:18
and simon cowell is there
38:20
yeah yeah but also imagine that you're
38:23
tom jones on the vice in the uk
38:25
and then as part of your job you have to
38:28
go and watch a load of buses
38:29
that's hard to imagine that happening
38:31
but isn't it true on the tube that they
38:33
need to be a certain standard
38:34
on the london underground there are
38:35
rules i think you can't have people who
38:37
are completely crap
38:38
because you need to you need to bid for
38:40
the slots as well and also
38:41
london has a code of conduct which it
38:43
advises buskers on
38:44
one of the tips that it gave out was if
38:47
you only know a few songs
38:48
move to a new location when you've
38:50
played them yeah
38:52
very good advice yeah in russia you have
38:54
to perform two hours of original
38:56
material
38:56
two hours yeah before you can bust
38:59
original material original material
39:01
because people tend to want their hits
39:02
don't they
39:04
don't want the busker's new stuff
39:08
i don't want to hear paul mccartney's
39:10
new stuff
39:17

01:29
covent garden my name is andrew hunter
01:31
murray and i'm sitting here with james
01:32
harkin anna tashinsky and our special
01:34
guest this week is
01:35
carried lloyd uh carriad is a comedian
01:38
we all know she's been on qi a load of
01:40
times
01:40
she's in an improvised show called
01:42
ostentatious which is jane austen based
01:44
improvised comedy with me
01:46
and she also is the presenter and host
01:49
and producer and everything
01:50
of the podcast grief cast which is about
01:54
grief and about people you've lost but
01:56
it's also very uplifting and charming
01:58
and funny and wonderful
01:59
so do give that a listen okay starting
02:02
with fact number one this week and that
02:04
is carried lloyd my fact is that
02:07
unity mitford was the only person to be
02:09
bffs with
02:11
churchill and hitler she was best friend
02:14
best friends forever just
02:16
for any uh for any 80s kids in the room
02:18
yeah she definitely best buddies
02:20
bezzies with hitler she was very busies
02:22
with hitler but she was also very old
02:24
family friends with churchill
02:26
and at some point uh just before war
02:28
broke out
02:29
so she was living in germany uh
02:31
basically completely in
02:33
hitler's inner circle she was completely
02:34
there and she used to write
02:36
to her friend winston and beg him very
02:38
regularly
02:39
to make peace with hitler because she
02:41
really believed in both countries now
02:43
caveat yes she was a massive fascist so
02:45
obviously
02:46
not like saying i love her but she did
02:48
really believe that england and germany
02:50
could work together and become this
02:51
incredible superpower
02:52
and she always said if they go to war
02:55
i'll kill myself i'll kill because he's
02:56
my two greatest leaders my country
02:58
and spoiler the moment will break out
03:00
she went into a park and she shot
03:02
herself in the head but
03:03
spoiler spoiler alert it didn't work she
03:06
survived
03:07
with the bullet in her head wow but then
03:09
she did also die
03:10
due to an infection but much later much
03:12
much later
03:13
so hitler her bff yeah and when she did
03:16
shoot herself in her head hitler felt so
03:17
bad
03:18
obvis it was his fault hashtag you
03:19
caused the war um
03:21
he arranged for a train to take her to
03:24
switzerland and then her mother and i
03:25
think it was debo the younger sister
03:27
came and got her but he
03:28
he you know the war's breaking out
03:30
everyone's leaving countries hitler made
03:32
sure that she got out of germany and he
03:33
knew she was going back to britain
03:35
and he funded her health care and stuff
03:37
it's very easy to accidentally read the
03:38
story and go
03:39
oh that's quant i know yes i know again
03:42
he was a massive fascist but also
03:46
i think he was quite big into he was one
03:47
of the worst yeah
03:49
you know there's a theory about hitler
03:51
funding all this so yeah the theory is
03:53
that uh her sister deborah and her
03:55
mother took her home after she
03:57
tried to kill herself she then
03:59
recuperated at a little
04:01
uh nursing home in a village called
04:04
wiggington in oxfordshire the home was a
04:07
maternity home
04:08
this and there is a story this is
04:10
rubbish there is a story from the woman
04:12
who ran the home
04:13
that she may have had a baby and the
04:16
baby had a tiny moustache
04:18
and was a massive fascist yeah and so
04:21
the journalist who wrote about this she
04:23
asked the woman
04:23
who she thought the father might be and
04:25
and she said well my mother always said
04:27
it was hitler's
04:28
although there is no record of this
04:31
happening so it's probable there is not
04:32
a secret hitler love child
04:34
but they definitely copped off didn't
04:35
they no also that's okay
04:37
yeah there's a lot of like it was very
04:39
suspicious in the inner circle
04:41
all the germans hated her they were like
04:43
there's this british woman who hitler
04:45
literally she would like advise him and
04:46
wind him up on stuff
04:47
and she was extremely jealous of uh ava
04:50
braun as well
04:51
and eva brown was very jealous of her
04:52
yeah so unity definitely was in love
04:54
with him but
04:55
seeing what i've read seems to be like
04:56
that nothing happened basically
04:59
he was kind of using her because she was
05:01
extremely useful and the other weird
05:02
thing about unity is her middle name was
05:04
valkyrie
05:05
unity valkyrie midfielder and she was
05:06
born in the town of swastika
05:08
so weird so weird and so it said that he
05:11
was very um superstitious and it was
05:13
said when he found this stuff out about
05:14
her and she was a six foot
05:16
blonde blue-eyed woman that he kind of
05:18
felt like she was very lucky but
05:19
apparently they
05:20
like nothing ever he apparently there
05:22
was no way they ever slept together but
05:23
she definitely would off
05:25
and she's just she used to kind of hang
05:26
out with other fascists did she sleep
05:28
with churchill
05:29
no but they her sister decca was married
05:32
to esmond romally
05:34
who the big rumor is that he was
05:36
churchill's secret
05:37
son and it was all sort of hidden that
05:38
he was actually a nephew but yeah i
05:40
thought churchill was quite happily
05:41
married though
05:42
he's not like that massive fascist
05:44
hitler so this town of uh swastika is in
05:47
ontario
05:48
yes and they wanted to change the name
05:51
um during the war to winston
05:54
um because of obvious reasons yeah and
05:57
they even did it i think or
05:58
at least they got pretty close but then
06:00
everyone who was living there said no
06:02
and so they took down all the new signs
06:03
and they said no wait we were called
06:05
swastika before hitler came along yeah
06:07
we came up with the idea first why
06:09
should we change our names
06:10
and they were named after the the symbol
06:13
which was a good luck symbol
06:14
in is it hindi or hinduism
06:18
so that's you know they were there
06:19
beforehand doesn't dan have a fact about
06:21
that guy i think possibly also in canada
06:24
who was called adolf hitler yeah and he
06:26
was asked if you're gonna change your
06:27
name and he said i'm not gonna let
06:29
one guy ruin the name and he didn't
06:32
change his name yeah yeah
06:34
they were amazed amazing family yeah
06:36
there literally isn't one of them that
06:37
wasn't
06:38
somehow involved in something so unity
06:40
was
06:41
well they were all bizarre but she was
06:43
bizarre so she said
06:44
that her and her sister grew up her to
06:46
be a fascist her sister
06:48
one of her sister to be a communist yes
06:49
and she said that they used to scratch
06:52
she would scratch a swastika and her
06:54
sister would scratch
06:55
a hammer and sickle into the window of
06:56
the bedroom that they shared together
06:58
and the scratches were still there
06:59
and so they really pursued their dreams
07:01
yeah there was an article in the
07:02
guardian about how they're kind of
07:04
inspiring in a twisted way because
07:06
she was like i'm in love with hitler i'm
07:07
gonna go track him down and she did and
07:09
she went to germany and she sat in a
07:10
cafe that he frequented she said that
07:12
after months yeah she sat there every
07:14
single day until eventually
07:16
he was like who's that six foot blonde
07:17
woman that keeps staring at me and
07:18
that's how she got to know him and
07:20
apparently she's she told she wrote to
07:21
deca and said
07:22
this is my plan like any good obsessed
07:24
teenager this is how i'm gonna get him
07:26
and her in debt so her and deca jessica
07:28
mitford shared a room and they had a
07:30
chalk line down the middle of the room
07:32
and at one end was a bust of lenin and
07:34
the other end was a picture of hitler
07:35
wow but they were obviously still
07:38
sisters and loved each other very much
07:39
and then
07:40
completely opposite but obviously
07:42
growing up in exactly the same household
07:43
do you think maybe like sometimes
07:45
brothers and sisters
07:46
go against their brothers and sisters
07:48
right yeah well they sort of if you read
07:50
any of the mitford stuff there's an
07:51
amazing
07:51
biography by mary s lovell which is the
07:54
the best
07:55
mitford s one to be which says that they
07:57
all of them had these incredibly
07:58
obsessive personalities and filled them
08:00
with
08:00
so either fascism or communism or pam
08:02
who was obsessed with farming
08:05
the best yeah pam is the one that pam's
08:07
the one someone everyone forgets but she
08:09
introduced a new breed of chicken
08:11
into this country yeah so and pam
08:13
apparently was
08:14
quite a wit and like even more was in
08:16
love with her but the only people who
08:17
heard her jokes were the chickens yeah
08:19
that was sad with a six so there was yes
08:22
yeah and there's a brother who died in
08:24
the war and then you have nancy
08:26
who was a very famous writer diana who
08:28
obviously also
08:29
being of a fascist they do not don't do
08:31
well on this is the mistress of oswald
08:33
mosley
08:34
the wife the wife eventual wife of us
08:36
with moses well i was just referring to
08:37
the courting of faith
08:39
was the one who famously said hitler had
08:41
beautiful blue eyes oh yeah
08:43
did she tell stephen fry this well
08:45
stephen definitely mentioned it on qui
08:47
he said he says stephen fry says that
08:49
she said to him of course you never met
08:50
hitler did you
08:54
she was an incredible woman dying she
08:55
was said to be like the most beautiful
08:56
woman of her age like
08:58
men were literally falling over and then
09:00
she married a guinness
09:01
i had an affair not a pioneer
09:05
and then had an affair with oswald
09:06
mosley and then ended up marrying him
09:08
and then went to prison went to prison
09:10
and she was the only um
09:11
during the war they were interred and
09:13
she and
09:14
another woman were allowed their
09:16
husbands in holloway prison so she was
09:18
in hollywood women's prison
09:19
and then oswald was allowed to join up
09:20
because churchill said that was okay
09:22
because he was mates with the family
09:24
and nancy metford was famous for doing
09:26
the upperclass and lower class writings
09:29
you and you was the famous essay she
09:31
wrote yeah about
09:32
the correct ways what things show you
09:35
off as being partial not posh right
09:37
yes have you got a test for us uh i
09:39
couldn't do one
09:40
um how do you pronounce the word
09:44
which refers to a large cat with a mane
09:48
a lion no not posh not partial
09:52
no lion oh you're pretty partial
09:55
i'm putting it on i think it rhymes with
09:57
barn apparently
09:59
yeah how do you pronounce the game which
10:01
i like to play where i hit
10:02
little balls around with a stick in a
10:04
field uh golf
10:07
goo goof
10:11
goth oh yeah i got who's that goth like
10:14
darren gough
10:15
go and play a game of golf oh wow
10:18
there was a study recently that found
10:20
the queen has become less posh over the
10:21
course of her reign
10:22
as in if you listen to her vows from
10:24
1953 yeah she's still
10:26
quite posh she's still quiet though if
10:28
you listen to the old recordings it's
10:29
almost like
10:30
it sounds almost but that's her accent
10:32
is less partial she still lives in a
10:33
mask
10:35
she hasn't kept it real recently yeah
10:36
but she talks quite straight i think is
10:38
what we're saying
10:39
she lives in a palace but she talks
10:40
pretty straight she says bff yeah
10:42
yeah um wasn't the non-uu thing part of
10:45
it was about
10:46
that thing where people who want to be
10:48
posh put on
10:49
posh words so things like soviet instead
10:52
of napkin
10:53
so it wasn't about telling the posh from
10:54
the working class it was about telling
10:56
the posh
10:56
from the kind of middle class who wanted
10:59
to be the really
11:00
posh don't say the posh word
11:03
yeah they just call it a napkin yeah
11:06
whereas the
11:06
social climate says the soviet exactly
11:09
what if you call it a mouth face wiper
11:12
just a plain old weirdo yeah it was just
11:15
nancy was very like acerbic
11:17
and witty about so she was sort of
11:18
taking the piss out of people
11:20
there was a lot of piss taken involved
11:22
wasn't there yeah apparently a gentleman
11:24
when he's drunk may become amorous or
11:27
modeling
11:27
or vomit in public but he would never
11:30
become truculent
11:32
that's how you know andy's so common
11:36
regularly chocolatey fighty
11:43

13:20
okay on with the podcast
13:27
okay it's time for fact number two and
13:28
that is anna
13:30
my fact this week is that in the 1920s
13:33
doctors prescribed intentionally
13:34
terrifying flights and airplanes to cure
13:37
deafness
13:38
why did they think that that would what
13:40
was their reason well
13:41
i would think maybe because it makes
13:43
your ears pop yeah but like
13:44
that i it was not that no it was the
13:47
shock factor so it actually
13:50
it actually started with someone who
13:51
couldn't speak it was an army serviceman
13:53
who i think
13:54
lost the ability to speak during the
13:55
first world war and this is in 1921 this
13:58
doctor called charles mcinerney
14:00
said it was a psychological problem and
14:02
that the solution would be
14:04
going into a plane and being treated to
14:05
a series of loops and nose dives and
14:08
spins and things that made him think he
14:09
was going to die
14:10
and lo and behold he was he took this
14:12
prescription he did it
14:13
he stepped off the plane and he said i
14:15
don't know if i can speak anymore
14:17
and it turned out he could because he
14:18
said that and then it started being
14:21
touted as a cure for everything
14:22
including deafness so deaf flights were
14:25
a thing that was
14:26
quite commonly prescribed and charles
14:28
lindbergh very famous um obviously
14:30
aviator
14:31
on his business card he had death
14:33
flights as one of the things that he
14:34
offered
14:35
really take deaf people up the idea was
14:37
that people
14:38
might have suffered from these things
14:40
for psychological reasons you were
14:41
saying
14:42
yeah shell shocky kind of thing yeah so
14:44
would they take yeah was it only
14:46
if you developed deafness or was it more
14:48
like oh i've been deaf since birth
14:50
there were some people who were deaf
14:51
since birth so for example
14:53
uh in 1930 there was a boxer called fred
14:56
mayhem
14:56
his nickname was dummy uh which is a
14:59
cruel nickname because he'd been deaf
15:00
since the age of eight months oh my god
15:02
so he took a flight in 1930
15:04
it was designed to cure his hearing it
15:06
was designed to cure his hearing with a
15:07
parachute jump that he was going to take
15:08
out of the plane okay in front of a
15:10
crowd of thousands
15:12
the parachute failed to open oh my god
15:15
and he died
15:16
where's the happy ending andy uh
15:18
probably in the next fact i'm afraid
15:21
sometimes people did die the idea also
15:24
was that it had to be a surprise so
15:26
the patients were told that where are we
15:29
going
15:30
don't worry just put on this rucksack
15:34
they were told they were just going in a
15:36
flight because it was the altitude that
15:37
cured the deafness
15:38
right and then they'd go up in the
15:40
flight and then it would be a horrible
15:42
shock when you suddenly started nose
15:43
diving towards the ground or spinning
15:45
around in circles yeah because obviously
15:46
if you knew it was going to happen then
15:47
the cure wasn't going to be
15:48
effective have you heard about this
15:50
flight that happened in um
15:52
in 1969 with alan funt have you heard
15:55
this before
15:55
i don't think i've ever heard the work
15:58
before i think i'd remember
15:59
he was the host of a prank show in
16:01
america that was like absolutely
16:02
massive uh kind of like candid camera
16:05
sort of you know
16:11
camera which is like the original you've
16:12
been framed and he was hugely hugely
16:14
famous as much as
16:16
i would say jeremy beedle was in his day
16:18
and he was on a flight
16:19
with his family and they had a camera
16:20
crew because they were going to film
16:22
like this new
16:23
um prank show and it um got taken
16:25
hostage
16:26
so the plane a guy stands up and and it
16:28
was at the time apparently there was
16:29
loads of
16:30
this happening and they were just
16:31
constantly in 969 being taken to cuba it
16:33
was like quite fashionable
16:35
so everyone starts panicking then some
16:36
of the passengers
16:38
see alan funt and go oh it's a prank
16:41
and it wasn't a prank so alan from
16:44
standing up he's like it's not a prank
16:45
which obviously is what alan front would
16:46
do if it was a prank
16:47
so the whole plane starts laughing and
16:49
relaxing because they think it's
16:51
a prank and i think they even got flown
16:53
to cuba and they were on the ground for
16:55
like five hours with everyone really
16:56
relaxed thinking
16:57
in a minute yeah it seems that the whole
17:00
plane thinking in a minute the camera is
17:01
going to come out we're all gonna laugh
17:03
and they were winding him up the whole
17:04
time and he was with his wife and child
17:06
and the daughter has recounted it and
17:08
said like they just thought
17:09
they just he was getting more and more
17:11
frustrated and upset it's because no one
17:13
would believe hijacker
17:14
no alan eventually fund hijack the plane
17:18
himself
17:18
yeah take me to anywhere apart from cuba
17:21
it did happen a lot i remember randy had
17:23
a fact where there was a guy who said
17:25
take me to cuba but the flight was
17:26
already going
17:27
oh yeah oh my gosh that's a that's a
17:30
book of heroic failures classic that one
17:32
yeah um charles lindbergh oh yeah one of
17:35
his other specialties
17:36
listed on his business card which is an
17:38
amazing business card by the way
17:40
including death flights uh one of the
17:41
other things he offered was a plane
17:42
change in mid-air
17:44
yeah wow this was a trick in early
17:46
aerial circuses
17:47
where you would just climb out of the
17:49
plane you were in or flying
17:51
and climb into another plane next to you
17:52
that's would you do that if you're
17:54
traveling and you'd do it for an
17:56
exchange or is it a trick
17:58
it's a trick right changing your flight
18:00
wasn't it
18:01
if anyone from ryanair is listening they
18:03
will be considering that
18:06
he was a real uh daredevil in some ways
18:08
so
18:09
limburg he did um new york to paris in
18:12
1924
18:13
i did not know this thing about it he uh
18:15
had to get rid of all non-essential
18:16
equipment make the plane as light as
18:18
possible
18:18
so he took out all non-essential
18:19
equipment and then he put a big fuel
18:21
tank on the front of the plane so he
18:22
could get
18:23
have as much fuel as he needed
18:25
unfortunately that meant
18:26
he could not see out in front of him no
18:28
i'm not even kidding oh my god
18:30
to see out of the plane in front of him
18:31
he had a few options he
18:33
installed a periscope in the cockpit oh
18:36
my god
18:36
he also sometimes just had to open the
18:39
right-hand door
18:39
to peek out
18:42
his final option was just to turn the
18:44
plane sideways for a bit
18:46
that's how i drive it does work it does
18:50
um but yeah um aerial acrobatics was
18:53
super popular in the 1920s it was this
18:55
very specific phase because
18:56
a lot of people learned to fly in the
18:58
first world war and then they realized
18:59
they could make a living out of it
19:01
and barnstorming it was called and it
19:03
became this very popular thing
19:05
and i can't tell if it was i think the
19:07
etymology of it is vaguely unclear it's
19:09
either because
19:10
people would often do these amazing
19:12
aerial acrobatics in
19:14
like fields and people would stand by a
19:15
barn and watch but also
19:17
quite a common trick they'd do is to fly
19:19
through a barn so they'd open the doors
19:20
of a barn
19:21
and then you had to fly your plane
19:23
through the barn and come out the other
19:24
end
19:24
is that where the trope of bursting into
19:26
a barna then you burst out the other end
19:27
and all the chickens are
19:28
you know flapping around you know what
19:30
happens in every show
19:33
seinfeld runs into a bar it happens
19:36
lessons
19:41
but is that obviously where the word
19:42
barn store it was a real barnstormer i
19:44
think it is from
19:44
yeah it is yeah yeah i've seen videos of
19:46
them going flying through
19:48
and i'm sure that must be where it comes
19:49
from yeah it must be yeah
19:51
they i think they played some stunt
19:53
games of tennis
19:56
oh my gosh on the wings from one wing to
19:58
another
19:59
there are a few photos of people doing
20:01
oh it's wing walking
20:02
you know normally you're just sort of
20:04
discreetly strapped to the plane you're
20:05
not standing completely free because
20:06
obviously you'd immediately fall off
20:08
did that mean you had to hit the ball
20:09
ahead of
20:11
where the person was at the time how
20:13
does physics work i think
20:14
the person who really suffers is the
20:16
ball boy
20:18
this guy called ulmer locklear who was a
20:20
20s stunt pilot
20:22
he i think was the first person to fly
20:24
from one plane to another in midair
20:25
possibly
20:26
sorry fly from one plane sorry sorry
20:28
climbing he launched a smaller plane out
20:30
of the window
20:32
of a jumbo jet that's incredible um
20:36
so all mologra was a stunt pilot in the
20:37
20s and in the film in a film called the
20:40
great air robbery
20:41
his one stunt he did he climbed down
20:43
from a plane to a speeding car
20:45
fought the baddie for a bit kicked the
20:47
baddie out of the car
20:48
then he grabbed the plane's
20:49
undercarriage and climbed back into it
20:51
as the car overturned and crashed you
20:54
should never climb back into someone's
20:55
undercarriage
20:57
very rude um do you know another old
20:59
cure for deafness around about
21:01
this time in the 1920s and before was to
21:04
make your own artificial eardrum or have
21:06
an artificial eardrum inserted
21:08
but um you could order them i was going
21:10
to say online and they sent you
21:12
um things that were often made of elf's
21:14
claw or pig's bladder or
21:16
fishbone or something called
21:17
goldbeater's skin which i didn't know
21:19
about but your dad probably would andy
21:21
because it's in used in the gold leaf
21:23
making process and apparently it's
21:24
animal intestine
21:25
but anyway you put this on a little
21:27
stick and you put it in your ear
21:28
and it apparently replaced your eardrum
21:30
it didn't work but
21:32
it was invented in 1853 or pioneered
21:36
by a doctor called joseph toynbee who is
21:39
polly toynbee's great grandfather
21:42
is that right isn't that weird that's
21:44
good i read the other day and i haven't
21:46
looked into this i just saw the headline
21:47
that your eardrum moves
21:49
um the same way as your eyes move
21:52
so when your eyes kind of move to the
21:53
left or right your eardrums
21:55
slightly move around like cats ears you
21:58
know when they like cats are obviously
22:00
just doing it themselves
22:00
our eardrums are obviously doing it yeah
22:02
oh my god i can kind of
22:04
feel it if you move your eyes around
22:07
i mean you think that might be your ear
22:08
bones moving in your jaw
22:10
oh yeah yeah it might be all right the
22:12
other thing with um you know like
22:14
well no i can feel it too maybe your ear
22:16
bones do you have ear bones too
22:18
it's not just anna no i'm just moving my
22:20
eyes
22:22
oh there's something moving in there i
22:24
think that's
22:25
which is connecting to your earbuds but
22:27
why would my jaw move when i'm just
22:28
moving my eyes
22:29
because you're moving the muscles around
22:30
your eyes to look that way
22:32
carry on we're not really into logical
22:34
fact-based explanations here
22:36
so this is kind of a psychological
22:37
affliction that they thought could be
22:38
cured by flying and
22:40
there was another fashion for curing
22:42
psychological afflictions in about the
22:43
1920s
22:44
and this was pioneered by this doctor
22:46
called henry cotton and i'd never heard
22:48
of this but he thought that
22:49
all madness or depression or anxiety was
22:52
caused by physical stuff
22:54
and could all be cured by surgery and so
22:56
he used to just
22:57
pull more and more body parts out of
22:59
people until they were cured so we'd
23:00
start with the teeth
23:02
so you'd go in and you'd pull out all of
23:03
your teeth if you're mad and then if
23:05
you're still he'd go for another body
23:06
part he'd keep on going so
23:08
then um he's like that game operation
23:11
i thought he invented it he was like
23:13
this is fun it was a lot like operation
23:15
he'd go
23:15
tons was next and then add a noise and
23:17
then he'd remove your colon
23:18
if you still weren't you're like you
23:26
once my stomach's gone yes my anxiety is
23:28
gonna go because i'm trying to deal with
23:30
not having a stomach
23:31
so i'm probably just gonna be really
23:32
upset probably not well platypuses don't
23:35
have stomachs
23:36
don't they no they used to be very
23:38
anxious
23:39
no they don't and they used to this
23:41
happened to my granny
23:42
um they used to pull out all your teeth
23:44
as prevention for
23:46
tooth decay yeah when you were 18 or 21
23:49
and this was offered to her she was
23:50
extremely poor working class lady and so
23:52
they said well
23:52
to save you some money and worrying
23:54
about your teeth just take them all out
23:55
lose them out did you go for it yeah
23:56
shut up
23:57
whole every single tooth removed he was
23:59
offered it didn't didn't take
24:01
ladies yeah this guy did pull out his
24:04
own children's and wife's teeth as soon
24:06
as he had children and a wife
24:08
but now he had children at what point in
24:10
the ceremony or the reception did he do
24:12
it
24:12
the christening there's one in there
24:14
they'll kiss the bride well
24:16
just one thing before i do that you may
24:18
now play the bride's mouth open
24:26
okay it's time for fact number three and
24:27
that is james hawking
24:29
okay my fact this week is that there is
24:31
a patch of snow in scotland that fell
24:34
11 years ago and has just melted this
24:37
week
24:37
that is amazing it's sad it's very sad i
24:40
thought it was amazing when i looked
24:41
into it i realized it was sad
24:44
at first i was like yeah so there are
24:47
these people who kind of always looking
24:49
for the last bit of snow that's on the
24:51
scottish mountains
24:52
and most years it's still there when it
24:55
starts snowing again so
24:56
it's always going to be there and
24:58
actually it always melts from the top
25:00
so the bed at the bottom will have been
25:01
there for the whole time but this
25:03
week and i'm going on a bit of a limb
25:05
because as we're doing this podcast i
25:07
think there might still be a tiny bit
25:08
there
25:09
but it's like a bit the size of a
25:11
rucksack or something
25:12
there's hardly anything and it looks
25:14
like it's on its last legs probably
25:15
we're recording this on
25:16
september 29th and i think by the 30th
25:19
or by the start of october it'll
25:20
definitely be gone
25:21
god but you're in trouble if there's an
25:22
unexpected blizzard in scotland over the
25:24
next week
25:25
yeah exactly yeah hasn't it only
25:27
disappeared six times in the last 300
25:30
years or something yeah i'd like that
25:32
so yeah i read it as in the last 300
25:34
years there have only been six
25:36
times when there's been no snow on the
25:37
ground in britain
25:39
you know like every time you listen to
25:40
the news at moment you feel like it's
25:41
end of days
25:42
and then you read a story like that
25:43
where you go and the snow has also gone
25:46
and you think oh god but it's got a name
25:48
yeah
25:49
and there's a few of them i think the
25:51
one that i'm talking about is called the
25:52
sphinx
25:54
and it's because there's a rock above it
25:56
that looks a bit like the sphinx
25:57
no i didn't know that was the reason
25:59
yeah were they like i think it was
26:01
i thought it was like the patch of snow
26:02
asked you a riddle when you get there
26:05
and if you answer wrong it folds you
26:07
into its cold heart
26:08
i don't know that's how it keeps going
26:10
it keeps on absorbing but
26:12
one more virgin to come and ask me the
26:14
question andy whenever hey
26:16
[Applause]
26:16
[Music]
26:18
so these people are very interesting
26:21
guys
26:21
there's no patch hunters yes and so this
26:24
is we only know about this because of
26:25
this guy ian cameron yeah and he's like
26:27
one of the main guys
26:28
and he often goes and tries to find
26:29
these patches and then we'll take photos
26:31
of them
26:32
and then eventually pretty much if ian
26:34
cameron says they're not there anymore
26:35
they're probably not there anymore yeah
26:36
and he's got a facebook group which you
26:38
can go on and
26:39
you know every few days he posts and
26:41
he's like oh there's still a little bit
26:42
left here but probably not tomorrow
26:44
but and all the data he gathers is
26:46
really useful for
26:47
climate scientists because he's got a
26:49
record stretching back years and years
26:50
now which is very useful in terms of the
26:52
temperature on the ground
26:53
and this is what they think it's climate
26:54
change is that what yeah well he is
26:56
quite circumspect about it he says look
26:57
i'm just going to leave it to the
26:58
scientists
26:59
to decide this kind of stuff i wish more
27:01
people would take that
27:03
i suppose it seems pretty likely that
27:04
it's climate change right yeah
27:06
well you know what i like ian i'm going
27:07
to leave it to the scientists but yeah
27:09
it clearly is
27:10
um but he told the new statesman when
27:12
they uh they spoke to him he said it
27:14
might sound weird to say but it's like
27:15
seeing an elderly relative or an old
27:17
friend
27:18
you're slightly disappointed if it's not
27:19
in as good a condition
27:22
and you're really disappointed if you
27:23
turn up and it's not there
27:25
yeah he is all about the snow isn't he
27:27
yeah i think he just he only cares about
27:29
these snow patches and he says he
27:31
i'm sure he cares about other things his
27:33
poor wife covering herself in snow
27:35
look at me ian look at me his children
27:38
wearing snow
27:39
hats eating clothes desperately putting
27:41
carrots out in front of their noses
27:43
are we snow now no you're hot you're hot
27:46
and you're nothing to me
27:49
it's it's i'm sorry it's not like that
27:51
being against child i would like to
27:52
capture it so the ft reported
27:54
he is an enthusiast but he is not mad
27:57
so tell that to his poor melting wife i
28:00
think ian cameron is a bit of a hero but
28:02
yes you know he's
28:03
like looking at this kind of thing and
28:05
not no one else is
28:06
but actually it's like you say really
28:07
good data and no he's
28:09
amazing it's amazing it needs recording
28:11
people do seem to be taking notice
28:13
there's a whole
28:13
there's a whole wikipedia article called
28:16
snow patches in scotland
28:18
um which i suspect maybe ian cameron
28:20
wrote this
28:22
there are things like it's so weird it
28:23
does seem to be a big thing based on
28:25
this so it describes a relatively little
28:27
known snow patch
28:29
which was scotland's largest at the time
28:30
of writing it said
28:32
this patch does not appear in the known
28:34
literature on the subject
28:35
so it may be very underrecorded only the
28:37
hipsters know about that one exactly
28:39
it's really obscure you probably haven't
28:40
heard of it do you want some good news
28:43
sure
28:43
yeah you want to know about the world's
28:45
tallest snow woman
28:46
of course guys i feel like
28:49
[Laughter]
28:50
so her name is olympia and she is 30
28:53
feet shorter than the statue of liberty
28:56
her arms consist of 27 foot tall
28:59
evergreens
29:00
and uh she has 16 skis for eyelashes
29:04
and 2 000 feet of rope hair
29:07
like she's amazing and five red auto
29:10
tires for lips which were painted by the
29:12
mahou
29:12
kids association so basically the whole
29:14
town got together and made this
29:16
you know this because there's a sheet
29:17
this from the photo this absolute
29:18
travesty of a small person
29:20
i want to know what the carrot is made
29:22
out of because presumably that's the
29:23
size of a bus
29:25
is made of muslin chicken wire and wood
29:27
frame by the msad
29:28
number 44 elementary school children uh
29:31
yeah if that magically came to life and
29:34
approached me one night i would run for
29:36
the hills
29:37
andy why is that why would that happen
29:40
like in the snowman oh i see you
29:42
christmas thing i would not go walking
29:44
in the air with that
29:45
beast i would sit indoors with a
29:47
hairdryer on full blast if it came near
29:49
me
29:50
i mean it's not a hundred percent clear
29:51
just looking at this from a bit of a
29:53
distance that she is
29:54
a woman they've given eyelashes in the
29:57
classic cartoon
29:58
version of gender i think i think a snow
30:00
vagina would be a bit much
30:04
you don't see many snow penises on the
30:05
old snowman do you do
30:15
um have you guys heard about the uh
30:18
oldest ever
30:20
antarctica ice it is and it was
30:23
discovered this year
30:24
it dates back guys 2.7 million years
30:29
yeah is that the one that putin drank
30:31
sincerely
30:33
do you not remember that he did that
30:34
they drilled down to some really old ice
30:36
and then melted it and putin drank it
30:38
what just dropped it in a whiskey or
30:40
something
30:40
to live forever no he wasn't
30:43
he wasn't down at the bottom of the hole
30:44
eating the eyes and then they jumped
30:46
down to him
30:47
um yeah no so as a climate scientist
30:50
keep on drilling down because the snow
30:52
that falls and then compacts in
30:53
antarctica obviously
30:54
uh not obviously but it has tiny bubbles
30:56
of air which tell you a huge amount
30:58
about the climate
30:59
two million years ago and you can find
31:01
out how much carbon dioxide there was
31:02
and what that means for the temperature
31:04
of the earth which is going to be very
31:06
useful for us over the next century
31:08
but this this year in april uh there was
31:11
a freezer in canada where they had ice
31:13
cores
31:14
that dated back thousands and thousands
31:15
of years yeah you're way ahead of me
31:17
carried no
31:18
there was a freezer malfunction and they
31:21
melted
31:22
guys i've had that with ice cream and
31:23
it's really disappointing
31:25
yeah it is so disappointing imagine if
31:26
there was 22 000 years of history in
31:28
your ice cream
31:29
okay if it's queen and black's chocolate
31:30
i'd be as upset as i would be
31:33
and the director of the canadian ice
31:34
core archives a guy called martin sharp
31:36
and he said
31:40
this is a bad day for martin sharpe
31:43
he said i've had better days
31:46
um but by a massive stroke of luck which
31:49
sounds crazy but there was a massive
31:50
struggle like 90
31:51
of it was saved solely because uh
31:54
camera crew had been filming a
31:55
documentary about
31:57
this ice core archive and they had said
31:59
can we move most of it into this other
32:00
freezer which has better lighting
32:01
no way so thank god most of it was safe
32:04
that's amazing is it like an ice cream
32:05
where
32:06
if it refreezes it's not quite as good i
32:08
think that's right yeah
32:09
and then you still eat it but you think
32:11
oh i should have eaten this earlier yeah
32:13
it's hard to shove the little bubbles of
32:15
ancient carbon dioxide back in at the
32:16
right height
32:17
i love them though because they're like
32:19
time capsules but from literally
32:20
millions of years ago i kind of find the
32:22
fact that these bubbles
32:23
are 2.7 million years old more exciting
32:26
than the ice
32:27
because it's like a little world even
32:28
though it doesn't have the cool stuff
32:29
like the blue peter
32:30
badge or whatever inside it it's still
32:32
like a little time capsule
32:34
apparently you're not supposed to make
32:35
snowmen in um antarctica
32:37
really really it's taboo according to
32:39
the telegraph taboo
32:40
they're apparently um the rules are
32:44
designed to prevent the antarctic
32:46
animals from being disturbed right yeah
32:48
that's fair enough animals
32:49
penguins i don't know they might be like
32:51
what the is that yeah you know
32:53
hey that's my snow imagine i came into
32:55
your house and rolled up all your
32:56
cushions and made a giant cushion man
32:57
and
32:58
you woke up yeah it does sound like i'd
33:00
wake up because it sounds like
33:01
that happened in a dream i think the
33:02
other day for the penguins they're like
33:04
just mind their own business and
33:05
suddenly
33:05
someone's taking all their like houses
33:07
had no land animals permanent land
33:09
animals apart from that tiny fly it's
33:10
got penguins
33:11
i think it doesn't have yeah but they
33:13
they they live in the sea the only i
33:14
think we did
33:15
we did this on qi the only permanent
33:17
land animal
33:18
is a mid is a mid with no wings hey and
33:21
what the midge doesn't have feelings
33:22
it's even worse for the mix because it
33:24
could be quite a small
33:26
snowman but to them it's going to look
33:27
like that one from maine
33:30
the princess okay i now understand the
33:32
point because what about like
33:33
the the antarctic bases they've built
33:35
and all the science stations like no
33:37
one's like hey we're disturbing them are
33:39
they
33:39
no the penguins are fine with that yeah
33:41
that must look like the death star to
33:43
the midges
33:51
okay it's time for a final fact that is
33:52
my fact this week my fact is
33:54
that the first person ever to use the
33:56
word sponge cake
33:58
was jane austen oh
34:01
good old jane good on jake now we
34:03
mentioned this because carrie ed you are
34:05
in an improvised comedy group called
34:06
ostentatious which is about jane austen
34:08
yeah i am ahm
34:09
great she's in that with me i'm a pogo
34:12
yeah joseph
34:13
isn't that rachel paris he's a great
34:15
comic isn't he joey
34:16
amazing yeah he does very well andy is
34:19
also in that group with me i am i'm in
34:20
australia
34:21
and you guys have got some big shows
34:22
coming up we have we're going to the
34:23
west end
34:24
uh for three dates the piccadilly
34:26
theatre we're going december 5th january
34:28
23rd and
34:28
um special valentine's day february 13th
34:31
go the day before that's what the
34:32
fashionable couples are doing
34:34
and then on february the 14th you can do
34:37
something actually fun
34:40
at the piccadilly theater at 7 30. yeah
34:42
ostentatious are playing their biggest
34:43
dates yet
34:44
and we've both seen it and it's amazing
34:45
it's fantastic yeah so
34:47
sponge cake so we know our jane austen
34:49
right andy we know our channel
34:51
but she coined the word sponge cake and
34:52
she's got a few citations in the oxford
34:54
english dictionary and this is
34:55
so it doesn't mean that she invented the
34:57
sponge cake she's the first person just
34:59
to
34:59
write it down well they called it
35:01
something else before her
35:03
do they call it cake sponge yeah it's so
35:06
with the first record of the word comes
35:08
from her writings
35:09
i'm not even convinced it's a word well
35:12
is it two words or is it one word
35:13
i thought she wrote it down hyphenated
35:15
she wrote it down highlighted in a
35:16
letter to her sister she said
35:18
you know how interesting the purchase of
35:19
a sponge cake is to me
35:21
and i think it was the famous jane
35:23
austen sense of humor coming in there
35:26
so it's interesting the first mention of
35:27
a sponge cake is it being given a sick
35:29
burn in a letter
35:31
which is a shame because sponge cake is
35:32
a great thing yeah but you know other
35:34
words that she
35:35
either coined or first usage the first
35:38
evidence of it comes from her
35:39
i went through the oed and found as many
35:41
as i could did you read the whole thing
35:43
well i've only start at the beginning
35:45
[Music]
35:47
um auntie bilius they're all kind of
35:50
very austin-y words the ones
35:52
like there's coddle cousinly she she
35:55
invented cuddle
35:57
didn't invent them i suppose but she's
35:59
the first example we have
36:00
okay don't you have isn't it something
36:02
you coddle an egg yeah yeah so maybe
36:04
it's coddle in just that specific
36:06
term as in to mollycoddle yeah yeah
36:09
irrepressible obtrusiveness
36:13
titopi what's titabi titopi
36:16
it's the study of tits photography
36:19
sorry i'm sorry i apologize photographic
36:24
oh i'm getting confused uh titopi i
36:26
think it means
36:27
like a tit-up
36:31
oh yes i suppose a tit-up is a mistake
36:33
or something
36:35
no darcy's always tit-hopping isn't he
36:37
that ball went really titty
36:40
that's how lizzy fell and gad as into
36:43
god about
36:43
you're kidding though the verbal use of
36:46
gadge
36:47
that's cool better than sponge cake to
36:48
be honest yesterday
36:50
they're quite niche words yeah that's
36:52
what i think it's not like shakespeare
36:53
who just invented the
36:55
and all the main words
36:58
before that we just literally we left a
37:00
gap
37:01
um i've got some mind-blowing news on
37:04
that anna
37:05
oh yeah so shakespeare's always always
37:06
said that shakespeare invented 1700
37:08
words
37:09
right and i'm always saying it and
37:12
so the words include bump hurry
37:16
road i mean it's it's nonsense
37:19
so the reason that he gets all these
37:22
citations
37:22
is because the first um team of people
37:25
compiling the oxford english dictionary
37:27
knew his works intimately because they
37:29
were all lexicographers so when they
37:31
were thinking
37:31
oh well where's the word critical you
37:34
know they say oh there is a critical in
37:36
whatever play it was and then now that
37:38
we've got better technology we're going
37:39
back and we're finding way earlier ones
37:41
so we thought that the word puke was a
37:43
shakespearean coinage
37:44
turns out it dates back to 1465. it's
37:47
almost two centuries before
37:48
shakespeare wrote it i bet you also was
37:50
saying the word road come on
37:52
can't we talk on a road
37:55
yeah because it would be weird if
37:56
shakespeare's plays were just full of
37:58
words that no one had heard of
37:59
the audience the audience would leave
38:01
baffle imagine the reviews you know but
38:03
you know people say now oh i find
38:05
shakespeare hard to understand perhaps
38:06
it was happening
38:08
in the 16th century people like i don't
38:09
know what it's all about
38:13
did you see the amazing website right
38:14
like austin.com no
38:16
it tells you you can type in a word it
38:18
will tell you how many times she used it
38:19
or is she ever
38:20
so she only used the word swoon four
38:23
times
38:24
which for people who watch justin tatus
38:25
will know we use that word quite a lot
38:27
she's read curtsy six times
38:29
she never used the word marvel so where
38:31
is it
38:33
she had invented superheroes she was
38:36
mainly using the word dc
38:39
she did um there were things that i
38:40
think that she may have invented
38:42
like so the phrase tom dick or harry i
38:44
think comes from her and you can imagine
38:46
her
38:47
thinking that up from her own head right
38:50
or dog tired comes from jane austen
38:52
again
38:53
like that's kind of thing maybe she had
38:54
made up good writing yeah
38:56
if i've told you once i've told you a
38:57
hundred times no she came up with that
38:59
yeah
39:00
that was from her that is a biggie
39:01
that's probably i'd say that's a lasting
39:03
achievement yeah but you're only saying
39:04
that because you've been told that a lot
39:05
of times
39:06
that's right i think it's above puke
39:09
yeah
39:11
um jane austen wrote not very well well
39:14
according to some according to this
39:16
professor this is really
39:18
interesting according to a lot of people
39:20
as well
39:21
a lot of men throughout the years have
39:24
written harsh reviews of her
39:25
well virginia woolf didn't like her much
39:27
oh no that is well well virginia woolf
39:29
was a man
39:29
[Laughter]
39:31
it's extremely interesting you raised
39:32
virginia woolf so this is a
39:34
study done by his professor called
39:35
catherine sutherland and basically what
39:38
she's saying is jane austen didn't write
39:39
like we think she wrote
39:40
that was the work of an editor so i
39:42
agree with carrie and andy that like her
39:44
novels are
39:45
perfection in terms of like the
39:46
construction of the sentences in the
39:48
english language
39:49
but what this academic says is that that
39:51
was all the
39:52
editor and if you look at her works her
39:54
first drafts of work she writes totally
39:56
differently
39:59
on the back of a mirror big nice man
40:02
came in the room yeah and he was like
40:04
so nice well she was more experimental
40:07
so it actually sounds like she was more
40:08
interesting and she said that she wrote
40:10
a bit more like virginia woolf so for
40:12
instance
40:13
when she had exchanges between
40:14
characters like speech exchanges
40:16
she wouldn't separate out one speaker
40:17
from another so it would all be like
40:19
blurred in a more stream of
40:20
consciousness kind of way yeah keeping
40:22
the idea of speech which she's so good
40:24
at
40:24
yeah so good yeah well the editor was
40:26
one who had to separate it out
40:27
and um she couldn't spell so she um
40:30
didn't didn't know which went first of i
40:32
and e
40:32
she didn't know punctuation well also
40:34
loads of people didn't spell yeah the
40:36
rules hadn't been set
40:37
you and you have not been set yeah yes
40:39
the rules hadn't been set i think maybe
40:40
she was a little bit worse than other
40:41
writers at the time and also she didn't
40:43
separate things into paragraphs very
40:44
well so
40:46
a woman in the like 19th century or the
40:48
one before that
40:50
she hadn't had a lot of education had
40:52
she look i'm not saying she didn't do
40:53
very well
40:54
we're really bristling aren't we yeah
40:56
could it be that she didn't try and
40:58
write sponge cake she just misspelled
41:00
like sponge carcasses
41:03
what book is that in jail you know how
41:05
interesting the purchase of a sponge
41:06
is to me
41:08
that is a way more interesting letter to
41:10
be fair to be fair
41:11
um virginia woolf said that um one of
41:14
the reasons that she was so popular
41:16
is there are 25 elderly gentlemen living
41:18
in the neighborhood of london
41:20
who resent any slight upon her genius as
41:23
if it were an insult to the chastity of
41:25
their aunts
41:26
wow that's a lovely sentence equally
41:28
brilliant writer virginia
41:30
i know it's so sad they're both so
41:31
fantastic and yet didn't like each other
41:33
well austin didn't have many opinions
41:35
there will come in the years after my
41:37
death a woman who is crap
41:40
and i will call her virginia but spell
41:42
wolf wrong
41:45
but didn't charlotte bronze hate her as
41:46
well there's a question yeah
41:48
i'm sure there's a quote from bronte
41:49
that said i read quite like i read that
41:51
and i recognized no love that i've ever
41:53
known
41:53
i can imagine the bronte is not getting
41:55
along yeah but they're all howling on a
41:56
more somewhere
41:57
a very different vibe but wasn't it that
41:59
when the bronzies came out they were
42:00
really popular jane austen
42:02
went out of favor for a long time
42:03
completely out of favor and actually
42:05
it's i think it's partly only due to
42:07
cinema that she's back in
42:08
so silent movies very bad and improvised
42:10
comedy oh yeah
42:11
we have affected her quite heavily
42:15
silent movies i think would have been
42:16
terrible for austin because it's words
42:18
because it's all conversation i think
42:20
the first adaptation was 1940 of pride
42:22
and presence yeah she's an amazing film
42:24
black and white family starring uh
42:25
laurence olivier yes as
42:26
lizzie bennett uh his most versatile
42:30
um yeah there's been some amazing
42:32
spin-offs i don't know anyone looked
42:34
into this like
42:35
i mean obviously the austin industry
42:37
myself and andy are employed by
42:39
is huge and there's lots of fan fiction
42:42
and lots of people writing other books
42:43
so i just looked up like
42:44
top of the top 20 of other books there's
42:47
just like
42:48
definitely not mr darcy prom and
42:50
prejudice colonel brandon's diary pride
42:52
and prejudice and zombies mr darcy takes
42:54
a wife pride and prejudice continues
42:56
they read like titles from our show like
42:58
they're incredible
42:59
amounts i read that a lot of people do
43:01
um this fan fiction because there's not
43:03
enough sex in the actual yes a lot of it
43:05
is sexy
43:06
darcy's passions pride and prejudice
43:07
retold through his eyes by regina
43:09
jeffers
43:10
um i think is a little bit more sexy
43:13
than her stuff because she doesn't
43:15
really go into it it has to be said
43:16
darcy and elizabeth nights and days at
43:18
pemberley these are all available to buy
43:20
guys
43:21
nights and days all right hot nights of
43:24
family mr darcy's undoing
43:26
a pride and prejudice variation do you
43:28
know her sexiest line may be
43:30
um or the line that most overtly refers
43:34
to sex
43:35
it's pretty sponge i
43:38
would like to see sponge square
43:40
pants
43:41
kids tv show oh my god um this is just a
43:44
real classic jane austen line it's um
43:46
in mansfield park fanny price the main
43:48
character is it fanny price is the rude
43:51
name
43:51
it's funny it's funny no it's a
43:53
reference to her getting pregnant and
43:54
the sentence is just about it's one of
43:56
the last sentences it's about how fanny
43:58
price and her husband come into some
43:59
money
44:00
just after they had been married long
44:01
enough to begin to want an increase of
44:03
income
44:04
that's not the rudest line in mansion
44:06
park it is an
44:07
overt reference to sex though well would
44:10
you like an overt reference
44:12
to something else you know i would it's
44:15
in manchester park as well and there's a
44:16
character called mary crawford who's a
44:18
bad bad girl
44:20
and um she's talking about the admiralty
44:22
and she says she used to know a load of
44:24
admirals
44:24
and she says arrears and vices i saw
44:27
enough
44:29
of rears which are both kind of
44:32
admirable but they're also both
44:34
references
44:35
to something else i don't get it still
44:38
vices as in woodwork
44:40
yes okay rear is in the back of the room
44:43
yes yeah no and that's an incredibly
44:45
filthy line that is quite raunchy
44:48
the academic community is divided of
44:49
whether it refers to sodomy or spanking
44:51
but it's it's one of the two she's
44:53
trying to hint that mary crawford is a
44:55
very
44:56
saucy not not nice lady
45:00
and that our main character is in
45:01
trouble so that's what she's doing a
45:02
good character study
45:03
she could have said that she's known a
45:05
lot of c but
45:08
and with her bad spelling she could have
45:10
made that quite obvious
45:12
um you can play jane austen role-playing
45:14
game now which i really
45:16
want to play
45:19
so if you don't want to out for
45:20
ostentatious you could
45:23
no there's this online role-playing game
45:24
and it sounds really fun um
45:26
and i think i saw that the video game
45:28
yeah you get to pick a character and
45:30
then you
45:31
um have all these interactions so some a
45:33
guardian journalist went and played it
45:34
and
45:35
started out by making this character who
45:37
lost her handkerchief and then
45:39
found it and then went for a walk and
45:40
bumped into a gentleman
45:42
although the the writer did say that
45:44
while she was going on this virtual walk
45:46
she saw a bunch of sheep stacked on top
45:49
of each other so some of the algorithms
45:51
in the game need some ironing out
45:53
she said every austin novel there's a
45:55
discrete sheepstank
45:58
my my lord will it be this sheep are
45:59
stacked so fine today
46:02
about 10 years ago um an austin buff and
46:05
an author
46:06
sent off some of her manuscripts to
46:08
various british publishers
46:09
seeing if you could get them published
46:11
and he made very slight changes to the
46:12
title
46:13
and the characters and um the student
46:16
who used was alison
46:17
lady as an a lady which is austin's
46:20
pseudonym um it wasn't the world's
46:22
greatest student
46:25
he's the guy who runs the jane austen
46:26
festival in bath they all rejected the
46:29
manuscripts
46:30
um and only one of them spotted the fact
46:32
that it was almost identical to austin's
46:33
work
46:34
he got one letter back from penguin he
46:36
just sent them pride and prejudice
46:38
and they wrote back saying thank you for
46:40
your recent letter and chapters from
46:41
your book first
46:42
impressions it seems like a really
46:43
original and interesting read
46:46
i'm going to say i really do like
46:48
penguin though don't you i'll show you
46:50
an excellent publisher and thank god
46:53
they haven't spotted the art book is
46:55
just a complete
46:56
rip-off of bleak
46:59

00:14
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:22
covent garden my name's anna i'm here
00:25
today with andy james and fellow qy elf
00:29
alice campbell davies and once again
00:32
we've gathered around the mics with our
00:33
four favorite facts from the last seven
00:35
days and in no particular order here we
00:38
go starting with you alice so my fact is
00:42
humans should be able to sense magnetic
00:44
fields
00:45
should be should be so um there's been a
00:48
little bit of research into this not
00:50
that much actually but we have
00:52
cryptochrome in our retinal cells which
00:54
is what's responsible for pigeons
00:56
migration and that kind of thing and we
00:58
also have magnetite in our brains which
01:00
is a magnetic nanoparticle which helps
01:02
direct other animals like bacteria so
01:04
why the disappointing
01:07
lack why can't i say where i live from
01:09
here well you live south can you point
01:11
south from here yes i can actually but
01:14
only because you know where the river i
01:15
know where the river is
01:17
well they have actually done some
01:18
studies on this there's a really
01:20
controversial study from the 1980s done
01:22
by a guy called robin
01:24
baker where he took a bunch of students
01:27
out on a minibus drove them on a really
01:29
securities route all around manchester
01:31
and then blindfolded them and told them
01:33
to point to home um a bunch of them that
01:35
didn't have magnets strapped to their
01:37
heads could point home and a bunch of
01:38
them with magnets strapped to their
01:39
heads couldn't which suggests that
01:41
magnetic fields were interrupting their
01:43
ability to point homework but then no
01:45
one else has managed to replicate this
01:47
study no in fact it's been disproven
01:49
multiple times but he has said that he
01:52
has replicated the study so in a sense
01:54
maybe all of these people lived in that
01:56
massive tower on dean's gate in
01:57
manchester which you can see from pretty
01:59
much the whole city
02:01
i think they were blindfolded on the
02:02
journey weren't they yeah i'm not sure
02:03
if they were blindfolded on the way home
02:05
that might have takes it too far it's an
02:08
amazing beginning for a horror story
02:09
though where you have to put on a
02:11
blindfold and get on the professor's bus
02:12
and then it goes away and you don't know
02:14
where you're going i thought i mean i
02:15
would have assumed that there was a
02:17
really exciting surprise awaiting me
02:18
like a hen party or a big champagne
02:20
picnic if i was blindfolded and put on a
02:22
bus if i was just strapped to a magnet
02:24
until the point at something would you
02:25
not think you were being kidnapped maybe
02:27
by my professor
02:29
i don't know i had perfectly normal
02:31
professors what normal professors who
02:33
take you on head parties
02:37
so there were two um
02:38
two people who tried to replicate this
02:40
called max westby and karen partridge
02:43
and they were at the university of
02:44
sheffield and they were unable to do it
02:46
and they quite sniffily said maybe it
02:48
depends which side of the pennine hills
02:50
you're on whether it works that's an
02:52
academic slam
02:54
it is but i think maybe people from
02:55
yorkshire just aren't as good
02:58
um it's ironic considering that a
03:00
partridge a real partridge probably
03:03
would be able to sense which side of the
03:04
penins it was on
03:06
that's irony for you
03:08
right there
03:09
there are a lot of different kinds of
03:11
and sometimes actually weak jokes can
03:13
disqualify us
03:15
irony being particularly appropriate
03:16
because they use iron
03:18
to sense where they're going oh that's
03:20
ironic you've got to admit that hannah
03:23
it's still not ironic um so some humans
03:26
are magnetic um and they they can
03:29
literally pick things up um that
03:32
i can literally pick things up with my
03:35
hands
03:36
um i can't that's why i always have to
03:38
ask you to do it for me do you pour that
03:40
coffee into my mouth do you mean they
03:42
can
03:43
they can just hold their hand hovering
03:44
over a magnet and the magnet will fly
03:46
towards their hand um they are people
03:47
who've had magnetic implants in their
03:49
fingertips
03:50
um wouldn't that get very problematic
03:52
though you know opening a fridge or
03:54
something yeah you'd just be stuck to
03:56
the fridge the whole time absolutely
03:58
fortunately you buy the fridge so you're
03:59
all right so these implants are quite
04:01
weak you wouldn't actually stick to your
04:02
fridge but people are getting them bio
04:04
hackers and um there's a lot of
04:05
interviews with these people saying they
04:07
really don't regret it they think it's
04:08
fantastic because you're finally able to
04:10
pick up tiny metal objects and determine
04:12
whether metals are ferrous which is
04:14
something that we've always wanted to be
04:15
able to do um and you can feel electric
04:18
fields if you have one of these little
04:20
implants so if you go near a microwave
04:22
then your finger starts vibrating i
04:24
think i also can tell when i'm near a
04:26
microwave
04:27
you have visual clues don't you it's
04:29
true it's only useful if
04:31
you're worried about being near a
04:32
microwave and you have hidden microwaves
04:35
in this environment
04:36
or if you don't know if it's a prop
04:38
microwave like if your house is also a
04:39
film set and so it is a useful implant
04:42
to get um unfortunately it has to be
04:44
done by like a tattoo artist or
04:46
something so you can't get an
04:47
anaesthetic to have it done and it is
04:49
relatively painful um according to one
04:52
of the people who's got it done they put
04:53
a massive syringe in your finger and
04:55
then they fire a magnet into it what is
04:57
it in the fingertip yeah or is it they
04:59
could put it anywhere in your body i
05:00
guess
05:01
no james i'm just saying they could i'm
05:04
not saying they would if you're
05:05
suggesting a world of which my magical
05:07
penis tells me where the microwave is
05:10
like a pointer
05:11
[Laughter]
05:13
it would be like dowsing for water
05:15
wasn't it
05:16
dowsing for microwaves
05:19
imagine being near a branch of curries
05:23
there are people who
05:24
claim to be magnetic but who aren't
05:26
really yeah you know you see pictures of
05:28
them online and they got spoons attached
05:30
to them yes like circus performery type
05:33
tricks well often it's just people and
05:36
they get into like the local tabloids
05:38
don't they yeah because they're magnetic
05:40
but they never are like a lot of the
05:42
skeptics kind of go there and try them
05:44
out and it turns out a lot of people are
05:46
leaning back in the pictures
05:49
and if they lean forwards the spoons
05:50
would just fall off um also if you got
05:53
kind of greasy skin then it will stick
05:55
to the kind of sebum in your skin um so
05:58
that everyone's kind of sticky in a way
06:00
so not only are you a liar but you're
06:02
kind of a greasy sweaty liar yeah yeah
06:05
uh james randy the famous skeptic from
06:07
australia he um would douse people in
06:09
talcum powder and suddenly they would
06:11
not be magnetic anymore oh really but
06:13
surely you could just disprove it by
06:14
putting a magnet next to them and
06:16
proving it didn't stick yeah although
06:20
they would be able to make it stick
06:23
that's how sweaty are these people that
06:24
random friction so i've got a little pen
06:26
here and i can kind of stick it on my
06:28
head if i kind of lean back a little bit
06:30
yeah we do need to get aircon in this
06:31
room
06:34
remember being that humans have magnets
06:36
in their nose uh that maybe we once used
06:39
to navigate so they found magnetite in
06:41
our ethnoid bone in our nose oh sure and
06:44
so there's lots of speculation about
06:47
the fact that we might have been able to
06:49
use this at some point to navigate isn't
06:50
there yeah i think the theory about
06:52
there being uh magnetic stuff in the
06:54
nose was disproven by a guy called joe
06:56
kashvink or something i can't pronounce
06:58
his surname at caltech
07:00
who is the the biggest critic of baker's
07:03
work um and he has just uh conducted an
07:05
experiment last year where he set up a
07:07
big faraday cage in a caltech basement
07:10
to block out other magnetic waves of
07:12
sorts and put people in it and then
07:14
subjected them to um magnetic fields
07:16
from different directions and he has
07:18
actually shown
07:20
that when you have magnetic waves coming
07:22
from one direction there is a massive
07:24
change in your eeg spec so your brain
07:26
waves so that it does show that there is
07:28
something in your brain that is
07:29
responding to the direction of magnetic
07:31
fields you're exposed to which is really
07:32
interesting okay does it have any effect
07:35
on
07:36
not your thoughts but is it is it mind
07:39
control no it's not mind control but i'm
07:41
just trying to work out how that could
07:42
have been useful i think in the past
07:45
when we were maybe migrating over larger
07:46
distances it was something we could have
07:48
relied on but now we don't really need
07:50
it so maybe in the past we could sense
07:51
magnetism perhaps yeah well also the
07:53
cryptochromes we have in our eyes
07:54
because they're in our eyes which is the
07:56
same as with birds and other animals
07:58
suggests that at one point we did use it
08:01
to see magnetic fields okay and
08:03
basically what we're saying is loads of
08:04
animals can see magnetic fields and can
08:07
sense magnetic fields but we just can't
08:10
right yeah maybe do you know which
08:11
animal has
08:13
some magnetite in its tongue
08:15
it's a little mollusk isn't it it is
08:17
it's mollusk while it's mollusks have
08:20
magnetite capped teeth but when i say
08:22
teeth their tongue is made of teeth
08:25
gradually exactly yeah yeah so uh they
08:27
can do that and this is very cool there
08:29
are some bacteria which contain
08:30
magnetite in them and baker the
08:33
scientists were talking about i
08:35
see that him or another it's either him
08:37
or someone else there is a theory that
08:39
the very earliest bacteria were magnetic
08:42
but get this some bacteria are aligned
08:44
towards the north pole and some bacteria
08:46
in the southern hemisphere are aligned
08:48
towards the south pole do you know what
08:50
i found about bacteria actually looking
08:52
this up which i think is quite cool is
08:54
that um one of the things is when
08:55
bacteria multiply then they split in
08:57
half and they keep splitting in half and
08:59
when they're magnetic that's really hard
09:01
to do and the reason is that normally
09:03
the way they do that is by belt
09:04
tightening so literally when a bacteria
09:06
splits in half um it just spends a bit
09:09
less money that month or yeah absolutely
09:11
they just cut down until a bit of them
09:13
starves to death and it falls off
09:15
um no they literally around their middle
09:17
they squeeze
09:19
their membranes tighter and tighter and
09:22
tighter until it just kind of chops them
09:24
in half oh that's terrible because if a
09:25
bacterial family thinks oh we have too
09:27
many kids we're going to have to tighten
09:28
our bells then suddenly they've got
09:30
twice as many children all of a sudden
09:32
another animal that has magnets in it
09:34
very often
09:38
possibly also cows
09:41
so cows there's this problem that they
09:43
don't actually chew their food so what
09:45
are they doing when they're doing that
09:46
chewing thing that they do i think
09:48
they're chewing their previous meal
09:50
aren't they they're chewing a meal that
09:52
they've regurgitated i think yeah so
09:54
first time around don't chew and often
09:55
there's a little bit of barbed wire or
09:57
metal or nails in the grass until they
09:59
swallow them they end up in their
10:00
stomachs they usually go to their second
10:02
stomach their reticulum i think it is
10:04
and then that's really bad for them
10:05
because it can poke through the stomach
10:06
lining and damage them in various ways
10:08
and so you tend to have to feed a magnet
10:11
to a cow um and so this is very common a
10:14
lot of farmers give their cows magnets
10:15
when they've got what's called hardware
10:17
disease which is literally when they
10:19
swallowed a nail and you just literally
10:21
feed it to the cow in a little tube and
10:23
it sits in your second stomach and it
10:24
will attract all the metallic stuff to
10:27
it and then it stays there for the rest
10:28
of the cow's life and it stops so
10:30
doesn't it just don't you just end up
10:31
with a cow with a large lump of metal in
10:33
it a large lump of barbed wire and stuff
10:35
like that i guess it's not floating
10:36
around exactly but if it gets big enough
10:38
surely it would sort of form a blockage
10:40
yeah i think there comes a point where
10:42
that cow deserves to die once it's eaten
10:44
you know 100 coils of barbed wire in a
10:46
row
10:49
but the way they check as well that the
10:50
magnet's still in place is they use a
10:52
compass and then they can work out that
10:53
way whether there's a magnet in their
10:55
stomach so what we're saying is actually
10:56
quite a lot of cows are magnetic and you
10:59
could stick like children's drawings on
11:01
them
11:02
like a fridge right yeah absolutely
11:03
absolutely god why didn't we try that
11:06
and presumably if we actually could
11:07
sense magnetic fields we'd get
11:09
incredibly disturbed and disrupted by
11:11
large fields of magnetic cows yeah
11:12
whenever andy walked past a killed of
11:14
cows with his penis magnets
11:18
immediately arrested but i'd have a cast
11:21
iron case
11:23
but then you'd be attracted to that cast
11:24
iron case as well
11:27
[Music]
11:28
[Applause]
11:32
now on to fact number two that is my
11:35
fact and my fact is that the army has
11:38
tanks that carry fold-out bridges for
11:40
when they meet a river that they can't
11:41
cross
11:43
and i think this is so cool i saw this
11:45
on popular mechanics website this week
11:48
which is a great website and there's
11:50
been an exercise that's been done in
11:52
america
11:53
in california over the colorado river
11:55
where the armies built a temporary
11:57
bridge over the colorado river and i
11:59
didn't know that they did this and this
12:01
is a crucial part of being in the army
12:03
is that you have to have these
12:05
you have to get these tanks which don't
12:07
carry any weapons they just carry a
12:08
little foldable river and
12:11
and then another type carries a bridge
12:13
to go over that foldable river yeah
12:15
sorry they carry a foldable tank they
12:18
carry a bottle
12:19
inside that tank is another thing
12:20
they're actually russian tanks
12:24
inside them they have a foldable bridge
12:26
and when they get to a river then they
12:28
unfold the bridge pops out and they
12:31
cross it so when you cross over the
12:32
bridge that you've been carrying
12:34
then do you pick it up back up and put
12:36
it on top of your tank again or is it
12:37
there forever um it's not there forever
12:39
it's temporary so the last vehicle to
12:42
cross over the bridge is the one that
12:43
was carrying the bridge and that is
12:44
attached to the bridge and when it's
12:46
crossed over itself as it were it rolls
12:48
itself back up into its body and goes on
12:50
it's amazing it's really cool to watch
12:53
and the us army has one of the these
12:54
things that can make a bridge in what
12:56
was it they were saying 98 seconds
12:59
yeah and it can still travel at about 30
13:01
miles an hour it can't well the bridge
13:02
no yes
13:04
no it can't travel at 30 miles now while
13:05
it's doing it
13:06
but it is awesome it is and if you watch
13:08
you should watch the video on it because
13:10
it shows exactly how they do it so there
13:12
are lots of different types but this one
13:14
across the colorado river um a tank goes
13:17
up to the edge of it and these folded
13:20
lumps of bridge kind of spurt out of the
13:22
tank like a projectile they split into
13:24
the water and then they pop open um it's
13:26
like one of those blow up tent things it
13:28
like pops open in the river and then
13:29
boats hook onto the popped open bits of
13:31
bridge and then they tow them into the
13:33
right place and they slot together like
13:35
lego and then everyone slides over it so
13:38
wait they have boats why they're not
13:39
going over on the boats because they
13:41
need to carry like huge numbers of tanks
13:43
and like a whole battalion across that
13:45
was a problem with tanks for a long time
13:46
wasn't it they just kept getting stuck
13:48
in holes yeah it was like in the early
13:51
days of tanks in world war one you get
13:52
loads of pictures of them just stuck in
13:54
a trench
13:57
yeah you do
13:58
there was one that um was designed so
14:00
that it could go into a trench and then
14:02
it would spur little
14:04
why is everything spurting all the time
14:08
have you heard of hobart's funnies
14:12
no no good great um so these were tanks
14:15
that were used in d-day and there was
14:17
this whole range like a range of
14:19
superheroes basically they all each had
14:21
their own special superpower everyone's
14:23
rolling their eyes but it's true so
14:26
there was one called the swimming
14:27
sherman right this was an amphibious
14:29
tank which could operate in in water and
14:32
on land
14:33
it had a massive canvas screen all
14:34
around its middle like a skirt and it
14:36
would just inflate the skirt when it was
14:38
in water and that would boil it up
14:40
enough for it to go with the propeller
14:42
and then as it got out of the water it
14:43
would just drop its skirt to the ground
14:45
and then roll off onto land wow that's
14:48
really impressive it was very cool oh
14:49
there were loads there was the crab
14:51
there was the bobbin
14:52
so the crab could go sideways the crab
14:54
could not go sideways it was terrible
14:56
crab i had a massive flail on the end of
14:58
it it was used for clearing mines on
14:59
beaches and things like that oh like
15:01
crabs do yeah
15:02
exactly
15:03
they're all perfectly named right um
15:06
what about the bobbin what did that do
15:07
the bobbin
15:08
well it was a bit like this bridge one
15:10
in that it's got something on its front
15:12
um this massive rig on its front but it
15:14
instead of a bridge it's matting it's
15:16
like rush matting it sort of lays down a
15:18
path up the beach
15:20
the ground is too soft
15:22
sinking or something sinking you just
15:24
have this one track laying tank which
15:26
makes a road as it goes um i couldn't
15:28
find if they used it
15:30
um we'll see them so yeah
15:33
you wouldn't go to the expense of
15:34
building that and not use it even in
15:35
fact after the invasion was over you'd
15:37
probably still say can we just use that
15:39
to see if it works and the other thing
15:40
is you don't lose anything by using it
15:42
do you even if there's no sinking sand
15:44
at least you've got a nice little path
15:46
to drive it
15:47
um yeah he made he designed the
15:49
flamethrower one i think as well didn't
15:50
he the churchill crocodile flamethrower
15:52
again crocodiles don't throw flames
15:54
[Laughter]
15:56
so he wasn't great at naming things you
15:58
know that wasn't the focus in the second
16:00
world war no the flamethrower could fire
16:02
flames 100 meters over 100 meters and it
16:05
looks incredible it's like robot wars
16:08
yeah it genuinely is like a real life
16:10
robot wars yeah i can't believe it took
16:12
so long after this to make robot walls a
16:14
thing
16:16
you would have thought that the tv
16:17
commissioners who were watching the
16:18
normandy landings
16:20
but the imperial war museum has an
16:21
amazing page all about the various
16:23
different hobart's funnies and all about
16:25
the different weird things they could do
16:26
it's very cool
16:28
yeah um hey i read about another bridge
16:30
and no one seems to know about it except
16:32
beachcombing which is this like weird
16:34
blog but i mean literally no one else
16:36
has picked up on this thing they found
16:38
which is in 1850 there's an article that
16:42
i found it in the english civil engineer
16:44
and architects journal and it states
16:46
that the academy of sciences in france
16:49
was considering an idea for a suspension
16:51
bridge between england and france so
16:52
going from dover to calais and the idea
16:56
was that um it would be full barges
16:59
would be sunk at equal distances apart
17:01
across the channel um and then they'd
17:03
have chains going up from the barges to
17:05
the surface and then the chains would be
17:07
affixed to the bridge which would run
17:08
from england to france and then above
17:11
the bridge would be these huge balloons
17:14
uh it described them as giant balloons
17:15
of elliptical form and firmly secured
17:18
which would support in the air the
17:20
extremity of these chains and so it
17:22
would have these balloons floating in
17:24
the air attached to the chains and then
17:26
also attached to the
17:28
abutments at the end of the bridge that
17:30
would keep the bridge over the channel i
17:31
think i can see why no one else has
17:33
picked up on this because it's a pretty
17:34
stupid idea
17:36
do the balloons have to stay in the air
17:37
forever yeah of course they do there's
17:39
problem one yeah
17:40
why i think these are these puncture
17:42
safe balloons entropy that's a
17:44
problem that's what you always say james
17:47
whenever anyone proposes any idea
17:50
james well what's the point
17:52
only culled by the end of the universe
17:55
[Music]
17:56
[Applause]
18:00
okay moving on to fact number three and
18:04
that is james's fact okay my fact this
18:06
week is that a new law in oregon has
18:09
banned a game called big engine
18:12
there is no evidence anyone has played
18:14
big engine since the 1950s and no living
18:17
person appears to know the rules
18:20
sorry they have just banned this yeah
18:22
they banned it this year sorry i didn't
18:23
tweak that i just thought you were
18:24
saying that there's this crazy old law
18:26
that bans again that we don't know about
18:27
this year they have this yeah so this
18:28
year they had a new gambling um rule
18:31
that came in uh and they had a whole
18:34
list of things you're not allowed to
18:35
play including things like chinese
18:37
chukka luck
18:39
and
18:40
wheel of fortune shemin defer don't know
18:42
what that is uh pankwing qui red dog ac
18:46
juicy and one of them is this thing
18:48
which is called big engine and as far as
18:51
we can see no one has ever played this
18:53
in the last 50 years
18:54
and i found this in an article on
18:57
williamette week which seems to be a
18:59
local newspaper in america and they have
19:00
a column called doctor no and he looked
19:03
into it and he couldn't find any
19:04
evidence of it either well i mean it's
19:06
good to take the precaution isn't it
19:08
exactly so he says quite rightly in this
19:10
column if they did decide to get rid of
19:12
it then it's just going to set up a load
19:14
of big engine kind of
19:17
card games in the whole state and
19:19
everyone will just start gambling on it
19:20
won't they because there'll be a
19:22
loophole oh it'll be a loophole but we
19:24
don't know the rules yeah but they could
19:25
just make them up well can't you just
19:27
make up another game and
19:28
play for money on that yeah that's true
19:30
actually it does say any other gambling
19:32
based game is banned so i don't even
19:33
know why they did the whole one
19:35
why did they include charmander fair for
19:38
example
19:38
but do you remember at school when you
19:40
weren't allowed to play um british
19:42
bulldog anymore you would just give it
19:44
another name and play it i don't
19:45
remember that no no
19:47
we were always allowed to play it did
19:49
you always get a bit out of hand oh yeah
19:51
it's very violent game british bulldog
19:53
yeah i think they'd like us to pick each
19:55
other off sometimes
19:56
[Laughter]
19:58
keep the numbers down so where have they
20:00
got this these game names from so it
20:03
appears to be that they were in an old
20:05
very very old law maybe in nevada or
20:07
something like that and then they've
20:09
been picked up by the next law and
20:10
picked up by the next law and they just
20:12
basically copy-paste the rules from
20:14
another law okay
20:16
that's really slack
20:18
yeah i agree yeah i want bespoke artisan
20:21
laws
20:22
handcrafted by masters
20:25
just for you for the state game yeah
20:27
generally weren't allowed to gamble in
20:29
libraries until 2005 and we've just
20:32
re-legalized it are you really allowed
20:34
to now yeah we legalized gambling and
20:36
libraries we sure have to
20:37
bet on like what book is going to go out
20:40
next or what you can do whatever you
20:41
like james i mean that's a really good
20:44
idea
20:45
because the odds of you winning are
20:46
astronomical you could have a lottery
20:48
frankly at those odds well you would
20:50
just go for a popular one like 50 shades
20:52
of grey or something wouldn't you true
20:54
you wouldn't choose an extremely rare
20:56
book
20:57
if i got better odds i would would you
20:59
but then i'd try and game it somehow
21:00
it's too open to corruption james
21:02
because you could just ask your friend
21:03
to go in and get out you know a book
21:04
about the merovingian dynasty or
21:06
whatever i think you could clamp down on
21:08
that kind of thing and i'm sure they
21:09
have now that they've legalized it
21:10
that's you see a lot of armed guards
21:12
outside libraries these days but it was
21:14
banned in libraries in 1898 and when was
21:16
it legalized 2005.
21:18
you're not allowed to like put a casino
21:20
in a library
21:21
i don't think if you walked in dragging
21:22
a slot machine behind you
21:24
it's going to be more like just playing
21:26
cribbage or something is it i think it's
21:28
just poker yeah but if there were more
21:29
slot machines based on 19th century
21:32
novels i would certainly gamble more oh
21:34
you could have to get all three bronte
21:36
sisters in a row that would be fun um
21:38
and would you lose if you got brown well
21:40
yes you lose everything this is very
21:43
nice
21:45
bronte
21:47
um so on uh things being banned oh yeah
21:50
uh i was looking into computer games
21:52
being banners okay um
21:54
and there was a game in australia uh
21:56
called getting up and it was banned
21:58
for the reason that it glorified
21:59
graffiti
22:01
okay
22:02
because it was again involved graffiti
22:04
well it was
22:06
yeah it was it wasn't that a decision
22:08
but is it a bit like grand theft auto
22:10
for graffiti not really it's a really
22:12
wholesome graffiti game basically it's
22:14
about a youth who uses street art to
22:15
take down a corrupt mayor who murdered
22:17
his father wow and then the mayor
22:20
launches an anti-graffiti campaign to
22:21
try and cover up the uh the fact that he
22:23
killed this kid's father but the
22:26
authorities thought oh well this will
22:27
encourage tagging and graffiti so they
22:29
banned the game it's like street
22:31
pictionary they should call graffiti
22:33
actually and i think
22:34
people wouldn't get in so much trouble
22:37
is it uh and bulls yes
22:42
um south korea banned video games
22:44
between midnight and 6 a.m
22:47
it was a very short battle
22:49
they woke up and they immediately
22:50
repented
22:53
what are we thinking
22:56
get back to the chambers before before
22:58
anyone finds out
23:00
what was it midnight to 4 a.m midnight
23:02
to 6 a.m every day
23:05
every day you weren't allowed to play
23:06
video games from midnight or 6am and it
23:08
was to combat the video gaming problem
23:10
which is kind of a thing in south korea
23:12
because a lot of people are addicted to
23:13
it it's called the shutdown law and it
23:15
was under 16 so you couldn't do it
23:17
because they were staying up all night
23:18
and playing um but they've recently
23:21
sweetly uh they amended it in 2014 and
23:24
the law can be lifted as per request of
23:26
the children's parents
23:28
so i guess you call up the government
23:29
and you say look my kid's fine he just
23:31
he needs it to concentrate just hasn't
23:33
finished level four yet he needs to
23:35
finish it
23:36
yeah so i've got something here about uh
23:38
porn star ron jeremy says that nintendo
23:41
bought the rights to two adult film
23:43
parodies super horneo brothers and super
23:46
hornier brothers two in the hopes that
23:47
they would never see the light of screen
23:49
so they made the movies yeah and they
23:52
didn't make the movies well the movies
23:53
were made yeah this is what you can do
23:55
these exist but um but they were never
23:58
really people i do have the plot of
23:59
super hornier brothers and it's
24:00
shockingly unsexy i'm not gonna read out
24:02
the whole thing but basically it stars
24:05
um squeegee hornio who's rhonda emmy and
24:07
his brother ornio hornio um and they're
24:10
trying to save princess polina from king
24:12
pooper
24:13
so well my wife's called polina
24:16
my pet name is pooper what was it
24:20
king pooper king pooper
24:22
your love interest is ornio hornier
24:25
honey oh yeah yeah
24:26
um wow also on nintendo i learned that
24:29
nintendo was very close to releasing an
24:32
accessory and game that let players
24:34
create their own knitting patterns
24:35
during its market research period all
24:38
seven of the beta test volunteers died
24:40
of old age
24:44
[Applause]
24:48
okay on to the final fact and that is
24:51
andy's facts my fact is that african
24:54
wild dogs have a sneeze-based voting
24:56
system
24:59
i swear to god
25:01
it doesn't sound particularly true does
25:03
it it doesn't but researchers from uh
25:05
from brown university have looked into
25:06
this and so african wild dogs they're a
25:08
kind of dog they live any guesses
25:12
oh in the wild in rural uh they live in
25:15
uh they live in africa southern africa
25:17
and um they live in packs of between
25:20
about 10 and 40 animals and there are
25:21
not many left they're only about 1400
25:23
left in the wild and basically they have
25:24
these what they call rallies where they
25:26
just spend all day sorry what they the
25:28
dogs call rallies
25:31
they the dogs they call them
25:33
[Laughter]
25:35
they the dogs have what they the
25:37
researchers call rallies and it
25:40
basically just means they spend all day
25:41
sleeping next to each other but
25:43
um
25:44
they get up after a while and they sort
25:46
of say shall we go hunting and
25:49
they get up and sneeze and if
25:52
the more sneezes there are
25:54
the likelier it is that the pack will go
25:55
hunting
25:56
wow then basically voting to do it and
25:58
also different votes carried different
26:00
ways so every pack has an alpha pair who
26:03
are in charge if those two sneeze is
26:05
much likelier uh that the pack will go
26:08
off hunting than if two uh junior dogs
26:11
sneeze
26:12
that is so weird yeah do they know have
26:15
any idea why they do this
26:17
to decide whether to go home
26:20
yeah there are other ways of making
26:22
noise
26:23
i guess it's yeah your options are
26:25
limited when you're a dog
26:27
they can't bark actually can they can
26:29
they not oh there we go i don't think
26:30
they can kind of scream
26:32
[Laughter]
26:33
that would be a very upsetting voting
26:35
system imagine if you went into the
26:36
voting booth and you had to just scream
26:39
i always do that
26:41
oh god these guys are good especially
26:44
the recent elections it's been a tough
26:45
time i always thought that sneezing was
26:47
a thing that you did without doing it on
26:49
purpose
26:50
as in you can't make yourself sneeze you
26:53
have to have some kind of
26:55
input i think these guys can yeah yeah
26:58
that would make sense i guess so
26:59
otherwise just like a little bit of
27:01
pepper goes across the african plates
27:03
and suddenly they're all off somewhere
27:05
well it never goes across they all
27:06
starve to death yeah where's the pepper
27:08
guys
27:10
they're very cool animals they're
27:11
amazing yeah so they're they might be
27:13
the nicest animals that i've ever
27:15
studied
27:17
they're speaking someone who's not a
27:18
zebra
27:22
they're very altruistic aren't they so
27:25
the way they operate is that they really
27:28
care for each other so for instance if a
27:30
wild dog becomes ill or injured or gets
27:32
older the rest of the pack really cares
27:34
for them and will sacrifice a lot of
27:36
food for them um and similarly if there
27:38
are a lot of young wild dogs around
27:41
african wild dogs around then the older
27:43
members of the pack will bring them food
27:45
and sacrifice food for them and
27:46
sometimes that all the members of the
27:47
pack will die prematurely because
27:50
they've starved themselves in order that
27:52
younger members can thrive wow
27:55
and they regurgitate meat into each
27:56
other's mouths throughout so some
27:58
animals do this to their young they go
28:00
so when they do it they're altruistic
28:03
and yet when i do that i'm apparently a
28:05
really creepy boyfriend
28:10
your girlfriend's vegan actually
28:13
it really is unfair
28:16
um yeah so they'll go and hunt and then
28:18
they'll bring back some food in their
28:20
stomachs and then they'll vomit it up
28:21
into their fellow pack members mouths if
28:24
the other pack members were just too
28:25
lazy to hunt
28:27
we have previously mentioned i think
28:28
that a buffalo vote
28:30
oh yeah with a sort of standing up and
28:32
sitting down system yeah but loads of
28:35
animals votes
28:37
go on
28:38
cockroaches do they how do they vote
28:40
mostly lib
28:42
dab but at least someone votes for them
28:48
at least when the whole of the planet is
28:50
blown up by the nuclear war the lib dems
28:52
will be the the majority exactly finally
28:57
um
28:58
no though so they vote by movement and
29:00
there was a scientist uh called uh jose
29:02
hello from brussels and he did an
29:04
experiment with robot cockroaches
29:07
in 2007 and
29:09
he made robot cockroaches which were not
29:12
what you're thinking of robots with sort
29:13
of implants in them as they started
29:14
doing these days he just made little
29:17
machines which could move around they
29:19
just look like cockroaches they didn't
29:20
even look like cockroaches so why are
29:22
they called robot cockroaches because he
29:24
covered them in paper which was infused
29:26
with robot uh pheromone
29:30
favorite infused with cockroach
29:32
pheromones so they smelt like
29:33
cockroaches honestly they look nothing
29:35
like cockroaches they're just little
29:36
white boxes with wheels and then so he
29:38
infiltrated their society and got them
29:40
to be accepted by the cockroaches right
29:42
and then he
29:44
managed to screw the cockroach election
29:48
by moving all his robot cockroaches to
29:50
the wrong place where they were going to
29:52
build their home and they were all
29:54
voting to build a home over here even
29:56
though the actual cockroaches have
29:58
previously considered and rejected that

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:16
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden
00:21
my name is andrew hunter murray and i'm
00:23
sitting here with james harkin
00:25
anna tajinski and alex bell and once
00:27
again we have gathered around
00:29
these microphones to tell you our four
00:31
favorite facts from the last
00:33
seven days so in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with fact number one
00:39
and this week that is
00:40
james okay my fact this week is that
00:43
when a prince
00:44
in the byzantine empire was ready to
00:46
marry court officials would walk around
00:48
the land
00:49
with an imperial shoe that they used to
00:52
check the foot size of potential
00:53
princesses
00:55
that is amazing it's amazing i mean
00:58
isn't it
00:58
i can't really believe that no it sounds
01:00
very much like a fairy tale yeah it does
01:03
like um snow white or something yeah
01:05
yeah yeah
01:07
so does everyone do you think know what
01:10
the byzantine
01:11
empire was i did not until i started
01:14
researching this fact
01:15
so it is otherwise known as the eastern
01:17
roman empire and the roman empire kind
01:19
of split into two towards the end and
01:21
they had the western side and the
01:22
eastern side so this was around turkey
01:25
and around the balkans as they are today
01:27
yes in fact they never called themselves
01:29
byzantines did they or byzantines they
01:31
always called themselves
01:32
romans so um apparently what would
01:34
happen is when the prince wanted to
01:36
marry
01:37
court officials would go around not just
01:39
with this shoe but also with a painting
01:41
of
01:41
a perfect or ideal match what they
01:44
should look like
01:45
and they try and find the perfect woman
01:46
for him this is like a manual tinder
01:48
then i suppose but what if you're a
01:50
terrible artist for instance
01:52
and you you're not very good at faces
01:54
for example so you have the same problem
01:55
with tinder you've got people with the
01:56
instagram filters that completely
01:58
distort you know
01:58
it's so nice having a young person here
02:01
i'm the only single person
02:02
around this table yeah um and i read
02:04
this in
02:05
the oup blog so it's oxford university
02:08
press blog
02:08
and there was a whole thing about
02:10
amazing facts about byzantine empire
02:12
it is i'd never heard of this um their
02:15
wife shows weren't they
02:16
and they would you know put these women
02:19
on display so it sounds like they would
02:21
choose sometimes a sort of a lineup of
02:23
women so
02:23
the mother of the prince would dispatch
02:25
you know some emissaries to go around
02:26
the empire measuring up these women and
02:28
then pick
02:29
the favorite 13 and then bring them back
02:31
and then there'd be sort of a bride show
02:33
where
02:34
they'd all you know they'd all be behind
02:36
the podium and then
02:38
if they could press their buttons to
02:39
take themselves out of the game
02:41
i'm trying in a very labored way to
02:43
describe the show take me out which i've
02:44
never seen
02:45
and i i'll be honest i'm flailing i'd
02:46
say it's more like an episode of the
02:48
bachelor so the emperor theophilus had
02:50
the golden apple which he would then
02:51
give to
02:52
the winning bride it's i mean it's
02:54
literally the bachelor we're talking
02:55
about shows that i've never heard of
02:58
how similar was it to blind date quite
03:01
similar was it
03:02
yeah except the man behind the screen
03:04
has the power to kill you if he doesn't
03:05
like you
03:06
okay there's another thing about
03:08
byzantine wife
03:09
finding for royalty uh this is from a
03:12
book called a cabinet of byzantine
03:13
curiosities
03:15
and the finalists who were the potential
03:18
brides
03:18
selected for the emperor uh they were
03:20
sometimes examined nude in the bath by
03:22
the prince's mum
03:24
ah so that's a bit like that other show
03:26
where what is it
03:27
what's it called where everyone's naked
03:29
and you get attraction yeah yes
03:32
it is like that all channel 4 formats
03:34
are taken from the byzantine empire
03:37
um i think that was theophano wasn't it
03:39
i think it was just one mother who was
03:41
particularly
03:42
keen on getting the right woman so
03:44
embarrassing i know
03:45
she put the final three in the bath and
03:47
then she draped a golden robe around the
03:49
one whose body presumably she thought
03:51
was the most
03:52
suitable wait a minute wasn't there
03:53
another show where
03:55
someone went on a date and their parents
03:57
were watching the date and they got to
03:58
choose who had the date i think that
04:00
i think there's a bbc three format based
04:02
on that that's called some sex and
04:04
suspicious parents
04:05
no that's a slightly different one i
04:06
don't care i don't watch these i just
04:08
work in television
04:09
that's the one where the parents go on
04:10
holiday uh secretly observe their
04:13
children being raucous abroad and then
04:16
they confront them at the end i kind of
04:18
thought we'd be talking about a great
04:19
uh historic civilization and empire in
04:22
this podcast we are
04:23
chapter four but
04:26
that would be so fitting because it was
04:27
always the mum right
04:29
the sun had no choice in it it seemed
04:31
like it was always the mother who'd go
04:33
out and select the
04:34
she was very much the executive producer
04:35
of these math
04:37
i looked into whether byzantium was
04:40
byzantine
04:41
you know whether the word byzantine is
04:43
because it's complicated byzantine
04:44
you know that's what it means and they
04:46
they was it an especially complicated
04:48
place
04:49
it was quite complicated but only
04:50
compared with western europe
04:52
at the time where you just had a load of
04:53
feudal lords and things
04:55
and there were a lot of behavioral codes
04:57
about where you could sit at royal
04:58
banquets and what you could talk about
04:59
and
05:00
who you could talk to but actually
05:02
compared with modern for example
05:04
derivatives companies then it's actually
05:06
quite simple
05:08
it's complicated as also the facebook
05:09
stages of most of the
05:11
royal marriages given that yeah my
05:12
stepmother picked her out of the bath
05:14
for me
05:15
i read that byzantine in the way that we
05:16
use it in common parlance
05:18
uh has negative connotations obviously
05:20
and that that was partly because
05:22
the empire was portrayed not only as
05:24
complicated but as quite secretive and
05:26
lots of lascivious stuff was going on
05:28
and so one example of this was they were
05:30
into quite a lot of
05:31
sexual things that the west didn't
05:33
appreciate and
05:35
one of these things was recorded by a
05:37
historian who wrote a very famous book
05:38
at the time called the secret history
05:40
and it was about emperor justinian's
05:42
wife theodora
05:44
who used to dance around naked in this
05:46
huge atrium in front of lots of people
05:48
in this theater
05:49
and she'd just have a ribbon around her
05:50
waist because it was actually illegal to
05:51
be fully naked
05:53
ribbon around her waist and then she
05:54
would lie on the ground and have slaves
05:56
drop
05:57
grain on her torso and other parts from
05:59
above
06:00
and then she'd have a herd of geese fly
06:02
in and peck
06:03
the grain of her nude body
06:06
wow it would be a scheme of geese if it
06:09
was flying in
06:10
sorry oh yeah thanks for watching if
06:12
they landed as they walked over
06:14
they become a guy yeah you were really
06:17
focusing on the wrong aspects of the
06:18
story here you're a massive killer in a
06:20
strip club aren't you
06:22
so the the geese are pecking at her bits
06:24
are they i believe so yeah there's some
06:26
question mark over how true this account
06:28
is i think this guy has sort of fallen
06:30
out with her
06:30
and justin at this point you know when
06:32
you go to st james's park and you want
06:34
to feed the geese
06:36
and you throw bits of like bread there
06:38
not bread because they don't like bread
06:39
but you throw stuff at them and then
06:41
always the pigeons come in and eat it
06:42
don't they
06:43
do you reckon she was late there and the
06:45
pigeons just kept nibbling out of bits
06:47
instead
06:49
he doesn't record that but it can only
06:51
have been the case is that
06:52
sexy having pigeons for anyone no
06:56
even even the geese i would say geese
06:59
are very aggressive i would have thought
07:00
it would be very unpleasant swan would
07:02
be bad
07:03
yeah oh my god break your arm with his
07:05
wing
07:06
what's your arm doing down there
07:10
here's the thing about the byzantine
07:12
empire
07:13
it was around the same time as the
07:15
norman conquest um it was happening
07:17
and when the norman conquest happened a
07:19
load of anglo-saxons from britain
07:21
became refugees and left britain and
07:24
they traveled down
07:26
into europe and they got to the
07:27
byzantine empire
07:29
where they kind of became citizens
07:32
and they lived around the black sea
07:35
around crimea
07:36
which it is today and apparently they
07:38
called it new england
07:40
really so that's where the first new
07:41
england was yeah that's so cool
07:44
that is amazing it's interesting that
07:45
isn't it imagining basically the british
07:48
becoming refugees and
07:49
kind of going down to live in crimea
07:51
given all the modern day
07:53
yeah yeah wow and it would have been a
07:56
much more progressive place then than
07:58
old anglo-saxon just conquered england
08:00
which was a nightmare
08:01
i got a couple of facts about
08:02
matchmaking yeah so in 1924
08:06
there was a magazine called science
08:07
invention and it said that
08:09
to match a couple up properly one test
08:11
that you should conduct
08:12
was uh firing a gun in the air behind
08:15
them when
08:16
neither of them knew about it and it's
08:18
to test whether they're calm under
08:19
pressure
08:20
because apparently really in every
08:22
couple you want someone
08:24
who can remain calm under pressure and
08:25
if they both react nervously then they
08:27
shouldn't get married
08:28
that's interesting i thought it would be
08:31
that they
08:32
were like oh we're all gonna die and
08:33
then they kind of jump into each other's
08:35
arms kind of yeah
08:36
to see who jumps in front of them like
08:38
in friends when joey jumps in front of a
08:39
sandwich when a car backfires
08:41
yes yes um i would have thought it's
08:44
quite good survival instinct to
08:45
try and jump out of the way if you hear
08:47
a gun being fired though and i would say
08:48
you don't want two people in a couple
08:50
who just stand there and let the bullet
08:51
penetrate their bodies
08:55
loud noise really close by it's not you
08:57
don't have to fire a gun at anyone for
08:59
this
08:59
demonstration to work how many died in
09:01
this experiment
09:03
this would be another great channel for
09:04
all four matches
09:07
i have one fact about uh cinderella's
09:09
glass slippers oh yeah um which was that
09:11
in 2015 a scientific study
09:13
was published in the journal of physics
09:15
special topics
09:16
which worked out how practical the
09:18
slippers would have been and it based on
09:20
a weight of 55 kilograms of cinderella
09:23
and a size four foot um she only would
09:25
have been able to wear
09:26
the slippers if she'd stood completely
09:28
still because if she tried to run away
09:29
from the prince in them they would have
09:30
immediately
09:30
shattered but that's why they fell off
09:32
when she ran away and that's why
09:34
i
09:40
the only way it would have worked is if
09:41
um their heels were 1.15 centimeters
09:44
tall which is not
09:44
very high there's a italian version of
09:48
cinderella from the 19th century
09:49
well it's from earlier than that but it
09:51
was first recorded in a book about
09:53
cinderella stories from
09:54
the 1890s and that version has
09:57
cinderella being born inside a squash
10:00
like a butternut squash so her mother
10:02
gives birth to her but she thinks she's
10:03
just giving birth
10:04
to a squash and so she abandons her in
10:06
the woods
10:07
and then the prince walks by and by that
10:09
time cinderella inside the squash has
10:10
learned to talk so the prince walks past
10:12
and says oh it's weird it's a talking
10:14
pumpkin
10:14
and so then he takes it home with him
10:18
and um i would argue this is a different
10:20
story like there's
10:21
no detail so far that correlates well
10:24
there's the pumpkin thing
10:25
and then eventually she breaks out of
10:27
the squash and acts as his servant and
10:29
then
10:29
she goes to a ball he's holding dressed
10:31
up as a princess and he falls in love
10:33
with her
10:34
and they get married and it's called uh
10:36
the story is called
10:38
zuccatina as in zucchini oh really
10:41
you know related which one's zucchini
10:43
again courgette yeah also is
10:52
[Laughter]
10:55
[Applause]
10:59
okay it's time for fact number two and
11:01
that is anna
11:03
yes my fact this week is that china has
11:05
built an exact
11:06
replica of an austrian village so that
11:08
tourists don't have to fly all the way
11:09
to austria
11:11
so this is the based on the town of
11:13
halstadt
11:14
in austria and i think it's the oldest
11:16
village or the oldest town in austria
11:18
it's
11:18
really beautiful it's your ideal when
11:21
you picture an austrian village
11:23
it's kind of just really idyllic okay
11:25
i'm just picturing that
11:27
oh oh it's nice isn't it yeah oh sorry i
11:30
pictured a swiss one instead oh
11:32
god am i just full of chinese people
11:34
[Laughter]
11:36
so this development was started in china
11:38
in 2012 in
11:40
boluo county which is sort of in the
11:42
factory belt
11:43
and basically the bunch of chinese
11:46
architects were sent to the real town of
11:48
halshtat
11:48
incognito and they went round it and
11:50
they took lots of notes and they did
11:52
lots of sketches on what it looked like
11:53
or took some pictures
11:54
incognito as if they're like like don't
11:56
steal our town
11:58
why they could have just gone and
11:59
visited no one's gonna care well they
12:01
might raise suspicions
12:02
um then they went back to china and they
12:04
started copying it at very high speed
12:06
and it was built within about a year
12:07
and the mayor of the original town found
12:10
out about halfway through
12:11
and said he was a bit annoyed at first
12:13
he said they should have told us
12:15
but he's actually really impressed with
12:17
the town he says it is exactly the same
12:19
and he went to the official
12:20
welcoming ceremony there and everything
12:22
so happily ever after that's good
12:24
yeah another fairy tale yeah are they
12:26
twinned the towns that would be nice
12:27
they are twins yes yes
12:28
good why why did they do this uh because
12:31
save tourists
12:32
from traveling well i suppose china is
12:35
quite interested in western culture
12:36
and so they have quite a lot of replicas
12:38
of other western buildings
12:40
or you know western like enclaves whole
12:43
other towns they've got a replica of
12:44
paris they've got replica of swedish
12:45
town but the idea is that people can
12:47
live there as well you can move in so
12:48
there are a lot of people living in this
12:49
austrian town yeah and i think a lot of
12:51
them aren't that successful
12:52
and there's uh all the people there's
12:54
not very nice
12:55
well i guess um but um like the one the
12:58
massive one of paris that they built is
12:59
basically a ghost town now because it
13:01
didn't work out where this australia is
13:02
pretty successful i think people
13:03
are living there and it's like a big
13:05
gated community some people live there
13:06
yeah although it's mainly touristy but
13:08
the paris one i thought they yeah they
13:09
didn't quite finish did they although
13:10
they did build a huge eiffel tower yeah
13:12
which is the main
13:13
bit i just think if you're gonna build a
13:15
new town like we do that in the uk
13:16
sometimes
13:17
why not build it that looks like you
13:19
know new orleans or something why not
13:21
yeah we might as well yeah they've
13:23
they're tried and tested aren't yeah
13:24
exactly
13:26
and it's worked for halshtat this is
13:28
probably one of the reasons why the
13:29
mayor's okay with it because
13:30
visitors to the real house starts since
13:33
the town was built have gone from 50 to
13:34
1 000 per year
13:36
from china i seem to be the only one
13:38
who's not completely cool with this
13:39
wholesale town plagiarism
13:40
that's going on what why not because you
13:43
know things should be where they are and
13:45
nowhere else
13:46
they haven't removed do you think maybe
13:50
we should knock down blackpool tower
13:51
because that was just
13:52
a copy of the eiffel tower oh well i
13:54
james i had not had that brought to my
13:56
attention before and yes i do
13:58
i think future archaeologists are going
14:00
to be extremely confused when they come
14:02
across
14:03
you know the real paris and then the
14:04
fake paris and they're going to say well
14:05
this seems to be the main civilization
14:07
because
14:07
all of the stuff was here and then that
14:09
spread out around the world
14:10
i get worried about that actually
14:12
because you know how now obviously we
14:13
fetishize antique stuff and historical
14:15
stuff
14:16
and we build houses in old style and we
14:17
have antique furniture and i worry about
14:19
archaeologists a couple of thousand
14:20
years in the future
14:21
about confusing them you know going wait
14:23
i thought this house was from the 21st
14:25
century but there's a 16th century chair
14:27
in it
14:28
and they won't know what to do exactly
14:30
anyway
14:31
but china this is a kind of thing which
14:34
is
14:34
not unique to chinese culture but it is
14:36
more prevalent there so there was a
14:37
study which
14:38
found that um of the articles submitted
14:41
to the science journal at uh
14:42
jiang university 30 of them were
14:45
plagiarized
14:46
either partly or wholly and that's quite
14:47
a high proportion
14:49
and various people have theorized that
14:50
it's about the way you learn
14:52
chinese characters you have to learn
14:54
through copying a repetition and it's
14:55
seen completely differently there it's
14:56
not seen
14:57
as plagiarism to the same extent yeah i
15:00
read that apparently lots of
15:01
theorists think that it's as you say
15:03
because of the chinese characters and
15:04
it's because it's so difficult to learn
15:06
so many that there's not enough creative
15:08
space left over
15:10
in chinese brains for creativity which
15:12
seems like the most absurd reason you've
15:14
ever heard
15:15
first of all they invented almost
15:16
everything we had up until about the
15:18
16th century didn't they
15:19
yeah and um so we copied it and then we
15:22
copied it yeah
15:23
paper you shouldn't be allowed to use a
15:25
wheelbarrow because it was invented by
15:27
the chinese
15:29
that's really awkward because you're
15:30
sort of now claiming that as their
15:31
landmark invention which is
15:33
sort of insulting to some of the other
15:34
things they did you know what i think i
15:36
could get
15:37
by the rest of my life never using a
15:38
wheelbarrow this podcast has taken a
15:41
distinctly brexity favor
15:43
i didn't mean to but yeah they do and
15:46
it's
15:47
um it's kind of a form of flattery in a
15:49
way isn't it it's just that interest in
15:51
designs over the rest of the world i
15:52
think like imitation is the highest form
15:54
of flattery that's the difference
15:55
between wearing someone close to someone
15:57
and then getting plastic surgery so your
15:58
face looks exactly like them
16:00
i'd be flattered feel free alex but
16:02
massively waited out
16:04
have you heard about the replica noah's
16:06
ark no
16:08
so this was built in america in
16:11
oh when was it finished it was finished
16:12
a few years ago um but
16:14
this decade and lots of people keep
16:16
building replica in ozarks but this one
16:18
is
16:18
massive it's in kentucky and it cost 120
16:22
million dollars to build it's built by
16:25
this bible group called answers in
16:26
genesis
16:27
i think they're an online church it took
16:29
700 workers it's as long as
16:31
an american football field is massive
16:34
how long is that 100 yards 100 yards
16:36
um and it was built by a man called ken
16:38
ham
16:40
and ham was one of noah's side oh yeah
16:42
yeah
16:43
also the first chimpanzee in space yeah
16:46
i don't know which he was named after
16:49
if either but this is the they've got
16:51
this massive plan and no one knows what
16:52
nazar looked like either but they've
16:54
insisted it's a replica
16:55
we have in the bible it says how big it
16:57
is doesn't it says number of qubits by
16:59
the number of qubits
17:01
okay um but yeah an irving finkel did
17:03
that study didn't he
17:04
so he was curious at the british museum
17:06
and he did that study that decided it
17:07
was spherical he thinks he's a coracle
17:09
yeah but his design is based on
17:11
babylonian tablets
17:13
so not on the hebrew bible yeah so
17:16
clearly one's more massively reliable
17:17
there
17:20
he's working on another thing mr ham oh
17:21
yeah he's now working with his partners
17:23
on a 10-year plan to
17:25
build a biblical walled city in kentucky
17:28
which is also going to feature a ten
17:30
plagues of egypt to ride
17:32
that sounds good but then did they kill
17:35
your first bot at the end
17:37
that's the bit where the camera goes off
17:43
there's another boat replica boat in the
17:45
news at the moment actually which is a
17:47
replica of the
17:48
boat that james cook used to sail to
17:50
australia so that's the endeavour but
17:52
that is moving
17:53
to whitby so it's been in stockton on
17:56
teas
17:57
and it's just been bought by someone for
17:58
110 000 pounds
18:00
and it's going to cost them 250 000
18:02
pounds to move it 39 miles up the road i
18:05
was going to say it's not far from
18:06
whitby to stockton no it's not
18:07
it's certainly not britain to australia
18:10
but i think it's
18:10
it's i think it's the land a bit that's
18:12
the problem i mean if it was if you
18:13
could sail there oh is it going overland
18:15
it has to go over land again i think
18:16
that's
18:17
the difficulty it's it's oddly expensive
18:19
to move boats across the land for some
18:20
reason well they're not going to get to
18:21
australia like that
18:22
no no they will come across water at
18:24
some point are they going to resale it
18:25
to australia
18:26
no he's just going to literally move it
18:28
to whitby and keep it as a tourist
18:29
attraction there
18:30
and i wonder if he was told after he'd
18:32
made the initial purchase that it was
18:33
going to cost another 200
18:34
grand to move it from where it is on
18:38
other sort of replica model villages
18:40
that aren't quite real
18:41
places um in gravesend there's a whole
18:44
town that's fake and it's used by police
18:46
to simulate
18:46
pretty much any manner of crime so it's
18:49
got like financial fraud
18:51
can they do that so for fighting riots
18:54
for burglaries uh bank robberies hot
18:56
situations terrorist attacks so hang on
18:58
is this the most terrifying place to
18:59
accidentally get lost
19:01
well it deserves it most of the time but
19:02
then it'll suddenly be populated by
19:04
about 300 members of the met police
19:05
so wow they must have some stuff there
19:09
right because people are working there
19:10
all the time so they must have like a
19:12
microwave and it's probably a tv
19:14
and some you know safes and stuff like
19:16
that yeah you could just go and nick all
19:18
that stuff
19:19
and then when they arrest you you say oh
19:21
no no i'm part of the team i'm yeah i
19:23
think the response would be incredible
19:24
because you're literally in their
19:26
training ground and you've got like 400
19:27
policemen
19:28
really eager to press their senior
19:29
officers and prove themselves actually
19:31
i've never really felt like committing
19:33
crimes but i do kind of feel like going
19:35
there and trying to steal something
19:36
and apparently the one thing you want to
19:38
see is a microwave yeah
19:40
setting your size high aren't you lock
19:43
up your microwaves grace then
19:48
podcaster james harkin were tasered 80
19:50
times today
19:52
a single microwave he was without
19:54
clutching the microwave
19:57
and a steak bake
20:05
okay it's time for fact number three and
20:06
that is my fact my fact is that ants
20:09
have self-control so ants
20:12
are able to defer gratification
20:17
and put in more effort to get a bigger
20:18
treat later on
20:20
than a smaller treat now you offer it
20:23
one small dollop of sugar
20:24
uh let's say 60 centimeters from its
20:26
nest and then you put a bigger dollop of
20:28
sugar
20:29
120 centimeters away and then you show
20:32
the ant the one that's 120 centimeters
20:34
away it will walk out of its nest and
20:36
ignore the smaller dollop and go the
20:38
further distance
20:39
to get the big one why doesn't it get
20:41
both yeah
20:42
well i don't know okay i think maybe
20:45
they stop it from going back for the
20:47
smaller one later on okay and they
20:48
explain that to it before it starts
20:50
right i think they say you better choose
20:52
now
20:54
they show it to the the part they give a
20:56
little tour of the environment before it
20:58
starts yeah but
20:59
twice as many and deferred gratification
21:02
went to the big one than didn't and they
21:03
tested it later on to make sure the ants
21:05
weren't just
21:05
picking something they already knew
21:07
about they made the rewards the same
21:08
size in the experiment and in that case
21:10
83 chose the one that was actually
21:12
closer
21:13
so given equal amounts of food they'll
21:15
pick the closer one but anyway i think
21:17
it's a pretty amazing fact
21:18
it's really cool it's incredible because
21:20
they did a similar thing with ravens
21:22
who can understand the explaining stage
21:27
they can't understand english according
21:29
to science ravens are
21:30
so clever they can understand anything i
21:32
think they all understand the explaining
21:34
so that's why the experiment yields the
21:35
results it does
21:36
yes yeah yeah they do they don't
21:37
understand the briefing document
21:41
but yeah there's they obviously train
21:43
them to know that they won't get the
21:45
smaller bit of food
21:46
um if they go and eat the bigger bit of
21:48
food and when they did it to
21:49
ravens they gave ravens a treat that was
21:52
inside a box
21:53
so they'd show them putting the treat
21:54
inside a box and it's a puzzle box you
21:56
know like one of those japanese puzzle
21:57
boxes
21:58
and then the ravens worked out how to
22:00
open the box using a specific tool that
22:01
they used to open it
22:03
and then the scientists offered them
22:05
either a piece of food that had been
22:07
smaller than the piece of food that was
22:08
inside the box
22:09
or the tool needed to open the box
22:12
without showing them the box
22:13
and the ravens almost all of the time
22:16
chose the tool
22:17
and went to open the box with one caveat
22:19
so the study said that
22:20
one raven had to be excluded as it
22:22
worked out ways to open the puzzle box
22:24
without the tool
22:25
modifying bits of bark instead so i was
22:27
able to get involved
22:28
so this is like deal or no deal
22:32
except the box just has cake in it over
22:34
the box it's got a bit of sausage
22:35
it's true but then that is kind of
22:37
delayed gratification isn't it because
22:39
if you know there's a possible big prize
22:40
you might get in the future
22:42
yeah have we tried deal or no deal with
22:44
ants uh i don't think we have no
22:46
well and i would watch a version of deal
22:48
or no deal where
22:49
every box had different bits of food in
22:51
it would you have to eat the food at the
22:53
end though
22:54
on the show you'd have to right when it
22:56
gets to the end you have to eat
22:58
whatever's in the box
22:59
that you choose to open and that might
23:01
be something you're allergic to
23:03
but you have to eat it the worst box is
23:05
still 1p
23:07
oh yeah yeah um i was reading the study
23:10
and apparently this
23:11
self-control thing is supposed to be to
23:13
do with the
23:14
size of the brain of the animal so the
23:16
bigger the brain
23:18
in relation to its body the more
23:19
self-control it has
23:21
and so i was like okay does that make
23:22
sense so i went and looked at a list of
23:25
there's a really helpful wikipedia list
23:26
of brain-to-body ratios of all the
23:27
creatures in the world
23:28
and it's like so humans have about like
23:31
your brain is about the 50th to the size
23:32
of your body
23:33
and like cats and dogs it's they have
23:35
even smaller so it's like the brain is
23:36
100th the size of the body
23:38
um and your the brain is one seventh of
23:41
their body
23:41
which i just found insane i imagine if
23:43
your brain was a whole seventh of your
23:44
body
23:45
that's basically like your whole head
23:47
isn't it no it's bigger than that bigger
23:48
than your head i think it's like your
23:49
head and your arms
23:51
well the clever thing that ants do using
23:53
their massive brains
23:54
is they when given the chance will use
23:57
sponges
23:58
to soak up liquid food so this is really
24:01
clever
24:03
scientists gave them a pot of honey
24:06
that was kind of mixed up with some
24:07
water that they'd find really delicious
24:09
and then they gave them some tools that
24:10
they would find in nature like twigs and
24:12
pine needles and stuff like that
24:13
and then they gave them some different
24:14
tools that they wouldn't find in nature
24:16
like paper
24:17
and little bits of sponge allen key
24:19
[Laughter]
24:22
and the ants very quickly learned that
24:25
the best thing to do rather than take a
24:26
twig and go and dip it in the honey and
24:28
take it back to its mates
24:29
would pick the sponge because it
24:30
realized it was more absorbent and went
24:32
and dipped that in the honey
24:34
and then took it back to its mate and
24:36
even incredible yeah
24:37
so cool and then the next experiment
24:39
they gave them the choice of three
24:40
different types of kitchen towel and
24:41
they always look for the one the
24:42
flashlight because they always know that
24:43
it's way more absorbent than the other
24:44
leading ground
24:46
um have we talked about um sir john
24:48
lubbock and his 19th century ant
24:50
experiments
24:50
i believe not he wanted to test like
24:53
ant's friendship
24:54
so he he put this amount in little
24:57
environment which was sort of an
24:58
ant hill and there was some water nearby
25:01
and some you know little other mounds
25:02
and things
25:03
and firstly chloroformed some of the
25:05
ants he sort of kidnapped the ants some
25:07
ants out of the nest
25:08
chloroform them and then abandoned them
25:09
a short way from the house but the other
25:11
ants defined them so they sort of found
25:12
their friends
25:13
how do you chloroform an anger how do
25:15
you get your arm around it from behind
25:17
like very very tiny club um
25:20
then he would observe what the ants did
25:22
to either ants that were from their own
25:24
colony or ants from another colony
25:26
um but then he realized that ants don't
25:27
recover from a chloroform so he tried
25:29
the same thing but he got
25:30
he got ants drunk which he said was
25:32
really difficult he said i tried the
25:33
same experiment only instead of
25:35
chloroforming the ants i made him
25:36
intoxicated
25:37
it was rather more difficult experiment
25:39
no ant would voluntarily degrade herself
25:41
by getting drunk
25:42
it's not so easy in all cases to hit off
25:44
the requisite degree
25:45
of this compulsory intoxication so you
25:47
know he got these ants drunk
25:48
and what he found was that sober ants
25:50
would try and pick up and help
25:51
the drunk ants then the sobrants would
25:54
take them back to
25:55
the nest now if the ant was from the
25:58
same colony
25:59
it would kind of look after presumably
26:01
be inside like with a bucket and a towel
26:03
and they hold his antenna back this is
26:05
the creepy bit
26:07
this is the group if it wasn't from the
26:09
same colony it would bring the soberant
26:10
would bring the drunk
26:11
back out and just quietly throw it in
26:13
the water and drown it
26:16
which is horrendous but yeah isn't that
26:18
amazing
26:19
i thought that and for some reason i
26:21
thought that ants chewed each other's
26:22
legs off when they got drunk
26:24
um i think that might be bees oh you're
26:27
right
26:27
drunk bees will will have their legs
26:29
chewed off by their friends
26:31
really yeah what to kind of stop them
26:33
going out like kind of when i take my
26:34
mom's car keys away when she's drunk
26:42
[Laughter]
26:48
um so this thing about self-control is
26:50
related to the really famous experiment
26:52
of the marshmallow test yes
26:54
just done in the 1960s across the years
26:56
of the 1960s uh lots of them by the same
26:58
scientist
26:59
whose name was walter michelle and he
27:03
tested children he said you can have one
27:05
marshmallow now
27:06
or i'll come back in 15 minutes and you
27:08
can have a second marshmallow if you
27:10
haven't eaten the first one
27:11
but if you want to be the first one just
27:12
ring the bell and i'll come back and you
27:14
can eat it
27:14
some kids just immediately ate the
27:16
mushrooms without even ringing the bell
27:20
yeah but basically he found that
27:22
children who were able to defer
27:24
gratification
27:24
ended up doing better in later life they
27:27
got in less trouble with the law
27:28
they were healthier they paid more this
27:30
kind of thing
27:31
yeah see what i would have done is when
27:33
he left the room i would have hollowed
27:34
out the marshmallow and eat in the
27:35
middle so you get the maximum amount of
27:36
marshmallow but then you leave it on the
27:38
table so it looks like um
27:39
you are like the child who took an oreo
27:41
apart
27:42
licked the cream from the inside and
27:44
then put the oreo back together
27:46
that's what happened in one of the
27:47
experiments what happened to him he is
27:49
now
27:49
president of the united states um but
27:52
actually kids are getting better at this
27:54
aren't they
27:54
uh there's been some work done this year
27:56
or quite recently
27:58
which found that the children are
27:59
getting better by about
28:02
six seconds per year as in the average
28:05
of how long people will wait
28:07
and there was a guy who did this study
28:08
was called john protzko
28:10
and he asked a load of psychologists
28:12
what they thought and the load of
28:13
child behavioral experts what they
28:15
thought and only 16
28:17
thought that children's self-control had
28:19
improved since the experiments of the
28:20
60s
28:21
and um 52 was sure that children would
28:25
have been much worse at it but actually
28:26
they're better
28:27
wow because everyone thought like now
28:28
that everyone's just watching youtube
28:30
all the time
28:31
so does this mean that the intervals
28:32
between are we nearly there yet are
28:34
gonna get six seconds longer every year
28:36
the one yes so we are more nearly there
28:38
than we used to be
28:39
yeah do you know do you know who's also
28:43
good at it this experiment is
28:46
a cameroonian children they found out i
28:48
think this was this year in the last
28:50
couple of years
28:51
so they repeated the marshmallow
28:53
experiment with three to five year olds
28:54
from germany
28:55
and then three to five year olds from
28:56
cameroon from the nassau
28:59
tribe and they found that while 30
29:02
of the german kids managed to wait long
29:05
enough to get the second treat
29:07
70 of the cameroonian kids did and
29:09
they're not entirely sure why they think
29:10
it might be because from this particular
29:12
group of people have stricter parents
29:14
and so it makes them used to being
29:16
patient and waiting for stuff
29:18
but yeah they're really good at it in
29:20
that experiment
29:22
10 of the cameroonian children just fell
29:23
asleep waiting
29:25
yeah they didn't have they didn't bother
29:27
them at all
29:28
um and there's another theory about why
29:29
it might be maybe you're right it may be
29:31
that they've got stricter parents and
29:33
they're they're just told to be quiet
29:34
and
29:35
be patient more but also there's a thing
29:36
about how much you trust that you're
29:38
going to get the
29:39
second marshmallow at the end yeah i was
29:40
thinking that actually when you first
29:42
said the experiment there were a few
29:43
things like that for instance
29:44
one you might not be that hungry you
29:47
might think you know what i only really
29:48
want one marshmallow and two would be a
29:50
bit much so i'm just gonna have this one
29:52
a good scientist would starve the
29:53
children beforehand
29:54
yes well what do you mean by good in
29:56
this room
29:58
yeah or you might not like marshmallows
30:00
yeah i want to bother you at all so you
30:01
might wait not because you've got
30:02
self-control
30:03
hey can i give you something more about
30:04
ants sure
30:06
so scientists have started putting
30:08
barcodes on ants in order to monitor
30:10
their behavior
30:11
and they just look really cool um
30:14
so this was said in passing in an
30:16
experiment as to how ants respond to
30:18
loneliness which is a bit sad actually
30:19
they don't like it at all
30:20
so um scientists plucked a few ants out
30:23
of their colonies and they put them on
30:24
their own and they fed them and
30:26
everything
30:26
but they still died ten times sooner
30:28
than they would have otherwise
30:29
ten times sooner they're terrible they
30:31
hate me on their own because they don't
30:33
live for long anyway do they
30:34
they don't i don't suppose they do
30:36
actually i don't really know someone's
30:38
queen ants can live to 20 years
30:39
which i thought was quite amazing that's
30:41
incredible that's true
30:43
queen ants are the only ants who can
30:44
legally drink the alcohol in this
30:45
experiment
30:49
anyway to monitor ants then scientists
30:50
have started putting these tiny barcode
30:52
backpacks on them
30:53
and they glue them on and this means
30:56
they can just monitor all of their
30:57
behavior so now we can really get
30:58
detailed impressions of ant movement and
31:00
everything because
31:01
we've got computers locked onto every
31:03
barcode but we're only going to learn
31:05
about ants that carry backpacks around
31:07
do you think their behavior might change
31:09
when you put a backpack on yeah they'll
31:10
probably think they're on that gap year
31:14
they'll probably just go cleaning their
31:16
chakras or whatever
31:18
we've learned that ants really find
31:20
themselves
31:23
there's an ant expert called clint
31:25
penick who says he can identify
31:27
different ants by their pheromones just
31:29
by smelling them
31:30
he's lying well he did it successfully
31:33
for his mate who had none infestation
31:35
and he went and sniffed them and those
31:37
ants were the ones that smelled like
31:38
blue cheese
31:39
what does he do he says oh that one's
31:40
derek and that one's
31:42
arthur and that one's look he doesn't
31:44
know all the individual ants by now
31:45
okay but he does know different types of
31:47
ants and he says some smell like
31:48
chocolate but you have to crush their
31:50
heads in order to smell it so that's a
31:51
bit of a shame
31:54
hello i brought my uh my new pet ant i
31:57
wonder if you can tell me which kind of
31:58
this place yes of course
32:00
trash i'm afraid
32:03
was not one of the ones whose head
32:05
smells like chocolate
32:08
[Applause]
32:12
okay it's time for our final fact and
32:14
that is alex my fact this week is that
32:16
when filming the famous hill scene at
32:18
the beginning of the sound of music
32:19
the helicopter downdraft would knock
32:21
julie andrews over after each take
32:24
i really want to see this b-roll that's
32:27
incredible and she said this herself
32:29
right yeah in some interview
32:31
uh in a sort of behind the scenes
32:32
documentary or i think it was actually
32:34
documentary by sue perkins um
32:35
that she made about the sound of music
32:38
and the town where it was filmed because
32:39
i filmed in a town in austria
32:40
and it's not a big film there and most
32:43
of the people who live there they know
32:44
it exists but they've never seen it and
32:46
they're kind of a bit baffled by why
32:48
tourists so many tourists from the it's
32:50
actually in germany as well
32:51
it's in germany the hill scene is filmed
32:52
in germany which i think is a cruel
32:54
irony given the plotline
32:55
of the film well the other cruel irony
32:57
is that they only had enough budget
32:59
for one day of helicopter shooting so
33:00
they had the they hired the helicopter
33:02
for
33:03
one one day um they filmed the very
33:06
first scene of the
33:07
movie with julie andrew spinning around
33:08
on the hill a few times and then the
33:10
helicopter immediately flew off over the
33:12
mountains to film the very end of the
33:13
film the last scene
33:14
which is the von trapp family walking
33:16
over spoilers yes
33:18
which is someone in the film walking
33:21
over the mountain
33:22
but the story is based on a real life
33:24
family in real life they escape
33:26
the whatever it was they're running from
33:28
by train they escape the nazis
33:31
out of music i actually haven't seen
33:33
this is that
33:34
this much of a spoiler i mean no i did
33:36
know that the nazis didn't win the war
33:38
so they escaped
33:39
they escaped they might have won this
33:40
battle
33:44
um in real life the von trapp family
33:46
escaped the nazis via train but in the
33:48
film they had them escaping by foot over
33:50
the mountains and they filmed them
33:52
going over the mountains straight in the
33:54
direction of hitler's private chalet
33:56
so they would have bumped into hitler if
33:58
you carried on watching the film after
33:59
the credits
34:00
like the post-credits scene is when they
34:02
reveal the villain like in the marvel
34:03
films
34:04
the eagle's nest yes yeah yes um
34:08
was the name of the project the eagle's
34:10
nest would be a great the sound of music
34:12
too
34:16
so she fell over because i was watching
34:19
a myth busters
34:20
uh because they were testing exactly the
34:22
strength of a helicopter downdraft and
34:23
they made this model head and then they
34:25
made a helicopter hover above it and
34:26
they tested the force that was coming
34:28
down on it
34:29
and it's very small so i do it was like
34:31
50 grams of force
34:33
and then it went up to about 100 grams
34:35
once as it accelerated upwards
34:37
it's pretty windy if you go near a
34:38
helicopter
34:40
and it came down very apparently it came
34:42
down dangerously low because it was
34:44
pre-health and safety and there was one
34:45
point at which judaism was like i
34:46
thought i was going to lose my head
34:48
i just think she maybe was a bit weak
34:50
well she probably was very slight and
34:52
you know if she was a movie star was she
34:53
wearing a big dress she was big flowy
34:55
dress and she was on a
34:56
quite a steep mountain and it was
34:58
probably already windy i'm just gonna
35:00
you know
35:00
but apparently they did ten takes of
35:02
this and she started screaming okay
35:04
that's enough i've had enough now
35:05
but the helicopter pilot couldn't hear
35:06
her so he took it to mean yeah let's go
35:08
around for another take so he just kept
35:10
going
35:10
wow it's weird that because yeah she
35:12
said the helicopter pilot thought i was
35:14
just saying yeah
35:15
fine keep going but you would have
35:16
thought as a helicopter pilot if you've
35:18
watched yourself knock this woman flat
35:20
on her face five times
35:21
you'd assume she was complaining about
35:23
it by that point yeah
35:24
i think the downwash is quite strong
35:26
yeah maybe mythbusters didn't
35:28
didn't crack the formula for a strong
35:29
downdraft i guess it depends on the
35:31
helicopter
35:31
definitely um and it depends on a load
35:34
of other things but
35:35
there is amazing footage online of a
35:38
helicopter taking off and as it goes it
35:39
just knocks over an entire row of
35:41
portaloos
35:42
and it sends them all over the place and
35:45
there are huge
35:45
ribbons of blue paper flying off into
35:47
the sky is brilliant
35:50
yeah there was a guy in manchester who
35:52
was playing golf this year
35:54
and his ball was on the side of the
35:56
green and a helicopter went past and
35:58
blew his golf ball into the hole
36:00
[Laughter]
36:02
does that count it doesn't no but his
36:05
mates didn't know that at the time
36:06
but they suspected it and he said that
36:08
they didn't pay up the 50p each they
36:10
would have owed him for getting a bernie
36:13
he said they accused me of colluding
36:15
with a pilot i'm now known as chopper
36:17
henderson
36:19
just on golf courses and helicopters
36:23
there was a really good cracked article
36:26
that was written by
36:27
a helicopter pilot who was talking about
36:28
the ridiculous task he's been given as
36:30
one
36:30
and he was once hired by some people who
36:32
wanted to play golf
36:34
to fly his helicopter across for about
36:36
two grand an hour
36:37
over the golf course to dry the greens
36:39
because it had rained the night before
36:41
yeah farmers use that method to dry
36:44
their crops
36:45
so for example cherry farmers fly a
36:48
helicopter really low
36:49
because cherry's got a lot of moisture
36:51
on the outside right yeah it rains well
36:52
you can just blow the water off yeah
36:54
yeah but and because if it soaks in then
36:56
the cherries will split
36:57
after a certain point they can't absorb
36:58
that much water and then if it splits
37:00
there's a much higher chance it'll rot
37:01
so you just get a chopper to fly over a
37:03
few times
37:04
dry cherries yeah there's a hotel in
37:07
sussex made of a converted helicopter
37:09
and it's called the helicopter
37:13
isn't that funny because of holiday yeah
37:17
i thought because it like had holly the
37:19
plant on it or it was like hollywood or
37:21
no it's funnier when you see it written
37:22
down although it's still it's still
37:24
pretty funny when you say it out loud
37:25
i love it i think it's great dragon is a
37:27
person called holly copter somewhere
37:28
probably no yes no discounts on her
37:32
contour isn't the surname though is it
37:34
must be somewhere
37:36
sounds like a medieval job well the
37:38
thing is copter
37:39
in helicopter is not the suffix the
37:42
suffix is pater
37:43
it's my favorite etymology of all time
37:44
always has been yeah it's helicopter
37:48
which is
37:54
pterodactyl which means sarah's wing
37:56
wing yeah
37:57
yeah and helico helix so what the the
38:00
blade spins around yeah yeah
38:02
um do you know when the helicopter the
38:03
first functioning helicopter was
38:04
invented
38:05
and flown um
38:07
[Music]
38:08
19 20. nice
38:12
1784. wow what i got the team bit
38:16
you did very well uh so in 1784 there
38:19
were these two french inventors called
38:21
law noi and bienvenue and they
38:26
i mean that's that's me trying to write
38:28
a french character i can't think of
38:30
anyone
38:35
it was his real name he was a very
38:36
welcoming man and he
38:38
made a toy helicopter but it had a
38:41
rotary wing
38:42
and the because they didn't have motors
38:43
at that point the power was provided by
38:46
a spring mechanism
38:47
and they made it fly up in the air and
38:49
it was only a year after the first
38:51
successful balloon flight
38:52
which feels like a big step in the right
38:54
direction so that was the first
38:56
helicopter
38:57
wow we talked i think we talked about on
38:59
qi this
39:00
year or in the coming series how um the
39:03
bbc
39:04
plan for the cold war was to broadcast
39:06
the sound of music on repeat
39:08
in the event of a nuclear strike really
39:11
you know because
39:12
everything else would be pretty awful oh
39:14
and what we wouldn't find it awful
39:15
having the sound of music under a peach
39:17
but all of us
39:18
good news is me and andy haven't seen it
39:20

[Music]
01:27
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:30
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:33
coming to you this week from the stand
01:35
in newcastle
01:37
[Applause]
01:41
i am sitting here with anna chazinski
01:43
james harkin and andrew hunter murray
01:46
and once again we have gathered around
01:47
the microphones to share our four
01:49
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:51
and now it is time for fact number one
01:53
and that is james
01:56
okay my fact this week is that mo farah
01:59
has only one guinness world record
02:02
and it is in the 100 meter sack race
02:11
when is it like a school sports day here
02:13
was that
02:14
i don't know why he did it but he did it
02:16
um
02:17
i read an article and it said mo farah
02:19
needs a world record to seal his place
02:21
among the old-time greats
02:23
and i thought i'll check if he has one
02:24
and he does
02:25
he has one he has one other one which is
02:28
the two-mile indoor run but that's not
02:30
in the guinness book of records but this
02:31
in the guinness book of records this is
02:33
the only one and
02:35
he's about to lose it
02:36
what really oh yeah and there's a guy
02:39
called stephen wildis uh from rotten and
02:42
mo farah got
02:44
39.91 seconds for his 100 meters and
02:47
stephen wildis has already got 28
02:49
seconds
02:50
okay but unfortunately two weeks after
02:53
he did it he got a letter from guinness
02:55
saying that to get the world record he
02:57
needed a 50 kilogram sack and his sack
02:59
was only 30 kilograms
03:02
i thought for a second you meant the
03:03
sack had to weigh 50 kilograms and i am
03:06
amazed anyone finishes it
03:09
um so anyway i got in touch with stephen
03:11
wildish and he's going to repeat his
03:14
attempt next week
03:16
and he's really confident that he's
03:18
definitely gonna do it and so that means
03:20
that by probably the week after this
03:23
goes out mo farah will have no guinness
03:25
world records oh so we snuck in right
03:28
this definitely needs to go out this
03:29
friday james
03:30
what's the speed that he managed to
03:32
clock in for the record so stephen
03:34
managed to do it at 28 seconds for the
03:36
100 meters so a normal 100 meters from
03:39
usain bolt would be just under 10
03:40
seconds
03:41
you know it's not that fast but it's
03:43
quite fast yeah and i asked him why i
03:45
asked stephen why he was so much better
03:47
at the sack race than mo farah
03:49
uh and he says
03:51
he says unlike mo i have little legs but
03:53
large calf muscles
03:55
and um i asked him if he has any
03:57
inspirational words for the people of
03:59
newcastle
04:00
uh and he said inspirational words
04:03
always check your sack
04:04
[Laughter]
04:08
very good
04:09
wise man
04:10
so mo farah you're saying has the
04:13
guinness world record for the sack race
04:14
but he also has but he does have a world
04:17
record he just has one other world
04:18
record but it's not uh
04:20
a special guinness one it's just like
04:22
just the iaf or something yeah but it's
04:24
a world it's a world record i don't
04:26
think like when usain bolt gets an
04:28
olympic world record they're going yeah
04:30
it's not a guinness world record
04:33
surely that's more i see what you mean
04:35
but it is i mean it's the two mile
04:36
indoor run
04:38
yeah i mean i'm not putting him down but
04:40
why is that any different than an
04:42
outdoor run it's more impressive really
04:43
to have a two mile long building frankly
04:46
[Laughter]
04:51
it's true
04:53
it's weird though because on the
04:54
guinness record page for running records
04:56
they've they've really bumped him up
04:58
haven't they like and he's in the top
04:59
four i think his fourth one down is the
05:01
sack race so like number one is fastest
05:04
male marathon number two as fast as
05:05
female number three is first you get
05:07
three records at the olympics and number
05:09
four sneaks in there with a sacrifice
05:11
and i don't wanna put down guinness book
05:14
of records but when they said that
05:16
stephen wildish's sack was too small
05:18
i kind of think they're a bit upset
05:20
about mulfara losing this record yeah
05:22
they do no but they do have rules about
05:24
um how big your sack is they actually do
05:26
they have one thing which is if the sack
05:29
is too big
05:31
they notice that people as opposed is
05:32
like 100 meters long for instance
05:40
but that's that's the main issue really
05:42
because obviously in a sack race you're
05:43
hopping everywhere um if you have a
05:45
slightly larger sack people actually run
05:48
inside the sack in order to get there
05:49
and that builds up speed and you can
05:52
kind of run you can put your feet into
05:54
little corners and do a little kind of
05:55
wiggly run but the thing is um it used
05:58
to be in the 19th century in america
06:01
that each college would have their
06:03
athletics team so they'd have a javelin
06:05
thrower and a 100 meters runner but they
06:07
would all also have a sack race guy and
06:10
this was quite a big deal and they would
06:11
train and they would really try and be
06:13
awesome at the sack race and some of
06:15
them would hop and some of them would
06:16
run with the feet in the corners and the
06:18
hoppers were usually better uh and the
06:20
thing is that they came up with a
06:22
technique of really hopping as like as
06:25
far as they could and it was quite
06:26
ungainly and sometimes they'd fall over
06:29
okay but they were so good that when
06:31
they fell over they sort of did a little
06:33
somersault and could get back on their
06:35
feet immediately and they virtually lost
06:37
no time whatsoever oh wow like andy's
06:40
anal thing that he was talking about
06:44
so for the people listening to this
06:45
podcast on friday
06:57
there's a new robot
06:59
we don't have time for this we don't
07:01
have time no no we don't have time no no
07:04
people can just imagine what you were
07:05
thinking about
07:07
okay
07:08
um do you know there's a hundred meters
07:10
on all fours world record is there
07:13
and it's
07:15
seven 15.71 seconds that's fine
07:17
they are unbelievably fast the guys who
07:19
do it it's so good um so it's the same
07:22
man who's broken the record four times
07:24
since 2008 uh he's a japanese guy and uh
07:27
to practice he mops flaws on all fours
07:32
which is fun to say as well as to do
07:35
how does that help him practice i think
07:37
he just gets habituated to being on all
07:39
fours all the time and moving around and
07:41
you know he he's less likely but it's
07:42
misrepresentative of the actual purchase
07:44
you can get on the ground he that would
07:45
be more useful if he was ice skating
07:47
because then you have the clip
07:49
it's like training at altitude isn't it
07:51
because if you can do it on a slippy
07:53
floor and then you get on a proper road
07:55
yeah
07:56
he's not wrong yeah he's right he's
07:58
right these stupid sports like sports
08:00
day sports used to be more difficult uh
08:02
stupid sports you know sports for the
08:05
people who aren't supportive we've all
08:06
got a list and i had pole vaults on my
08:09
whole votes are stupid stupid sport i'm
08:12
thinking more egg and spoon the
08:13
three-legged all that kind of stuff but
08:15
i was looking them up in the british
08:17
newspaper archive to see you know what
08:18
people used to do in the olden days
08:20
about them um and it turns out that the
08:22
egg and spoon race for instance used to
08:24
be done while punting um so there was
08:27
there was a reference uh this is
08:29
in fact this is the earliest usage in
08:31
the oed of egg and spoon is in 1894 and
08:35
it said the gentleman had a turn in the
08:36
egg and spoon race in which competitors
08:38
had to punt with one hand and balance an
08:40
egg and spoon with another so that is
08:43
actually much harder you know punting
08:44
for people who aren't from oxford or
08:46
cambridge is where you are on a boat
08:47
standing up and you drop a stick in and
08:49
you have to power your boat along at the
08:51
same time as carrying an egg and spoon
08:53
wow yeah i thought you meant punting as
08:54
in putting a bet on with the horses
08:57
no no that was strictly forbidden
08:59
actually
09:00
and the wheelbarrow race was blindfolded
09:02
um this was in the 19th century at uh so
09:05
for instance
09:09
exactly
09:11
it's just more realistic
09:13
i think you're both blindfolded so this
09:15
is for queen victoria's jubilee there
09:16
was a huge wheelbarrow race and she
09:18
didn't she didn't participate sorry the
09:20
wheelbarrow are we talking
09:22
we're talking where you're carrying
09:24
someone's legs and they're moving on
09:25
their hands
09:26
not a wheelbarrow wheelbarrow no no
09:29
there are two people one of them is
09:30
pretending to be a wheelbarrow yeah yeah
09:32
yeah you have to be blindfolded which
09:34
makes it a lot more difficult both of
09:35
you
09:36
that's nuts yeah hey you know that um uh
09:39
mo farah does the mobot oh yeah uh it
09:42
turns out that he's actually being the m
09:44
from ymca
09:47
as in are you saying that's where he
09:49
came up with it or just no they came so
09:51
he does that thing
09:53
he does his mobot and the inspiration
09:55
from that was he was on a tv show claire
09:57
bolding and james corden were trying to
09:59
work out what he should do to celebrate
10:01
the win and claire balding was the one
10:03
who invented it james corden called it
10:05
the mobot but she said it's the m from
10:07
ymca if you had um someone who'd just
10:10
done a vault in the gymnastics stood
10:12
next to him you only need a c and an a
10:14
and you've got the whole thing
10:16
but wait i that's not it stands for the
10:19
m of his name i think claire bolding was
10:21
just trying to explain what it looked
10:22
like to uh people if they weren't
10:24
watching the tv right he doesn't do it
10:26
as a tribute to the ymca
10:29
i don't think no he's stop he's
10:30
plagiarized one of the greatest dancers
10:33
mr farah's lawyers are listening to big
10:35
claims it's not one we all support on
10:36
this show
10:39
do you know something mo farah did do
10:40
which uh is not that cool actually he's
10:43
there's a he has a fellow runner called
10:44
chris thompson and they're good friends
10:46
and chris thompson won a silver medal in
10:48
barcelona when moe won gold a few years
10:51
ago i don't know why i'm calling him mo
10:52
i don't know him when mo farah won gold
10:54
a few years ago but the first time they
10:57
ran a race together mo farah said was
10:59
encouraging him and said how about we'll
11:01
run this race we're going to win it uh
11:03
we'll both run it we'll hold hands as we
11:05
run and then we can cross the finish
11:07
line at the same time and so they did it
11:09
and they held hands for the full race um
11:11
and then with 10 meters to go
11:13
have been pushing aside and sprinted
11:15
ahead to the way
11:17
so um the 100 meter record for egg and
11:19
spoon race yeah uh is
11:22
do you think it's more or less than
11:24
stephen wildish's um
11:28
[Music]
11:31
it is quicker yeah um it's 16.59 seconds
11:34
but it was set by sally pearson who is a
11:37
professional 100 meter runner or she's a
11:40
hurdler but she's quite famous
11:42
and she beat a guy called ashrita
11:44
fuhrman
11:45
who you guys might recognize we've
11:46
mentioned him before he has more than
11:48
100 world records mostly in what anna
11:51
might call the stupid sports
11:54
um triple jump
11:57
i've got loads
12:00
i can't think of many non-stupid sports
12:04
well um he i reckon he must have been
12:05
pretty a knight of lost his 100 meter
12:07
egg and spoon race because the very next
12:10
month he then broke the 100 meters
12:13
carrying an egg and spoon in the mouth
12:15
record
12:18
didn't even know that was a sport i
12:20
suspect it probably wasn't
12:21
[Laughter]
12:23
do you know that school sports days a
12:25
regular feature of them used to be the
12:26
pillow fight
12:27
and now that's a sport
12:30
how do you win the telephone i don't
12:32
know it didn't actually say i just i
12:33
read this article when it was just
12:35
announced we used to play in australia
12:37
for sports um you would sit on a big
12:39
wooden pole and you'd each have a pillow
12:41
and you'd try and whack each other off
12:48
i wasn't aware you had such a
12:49
traditional education then
12:52
okay it is time for fact number two
12:56
and that is andy my fact is that the
12:59
inside of a kitkat is made of more
13:01
kit-kats
13:02
[Laughter]
13:04
kit-kats are an infinite recursive loop
13:06
is what i'm trying to say
13:08
this is so cool i mean it's it can't be
13:10
true right because where did the first
13:13
kit kat insides come from nobody knows
13:17
yeah this is like a chicken and egg
13:18
situation isn't it kind of yeah so
13:20
except that eggs are not made of mashed
13:22
up
13:23
chickens
13:30
yeah
13:31
it's kind of it's kind of like that
13:33
so basically during the production
13:34
process of kitkat some of them don't
13:36
meet the very strict criteria for a
13:38
proper kitkat either the wrong
13:40
shape or they got too many fingers
13:44
i don't know
13:45
but anyway they're wrong and they are
13:48
they are rejected and they are ground up
13:50
and they are the filling layer between
13:53
the wafer bits in a kitkat
13:55
is made of those plus a couple of other
13:57
things as well more sugar um
13:59
so yeah this hit the headlines earlier
14:01
this year which i'd never hit the
14:02
headlines sure it was a slow news day
14:04
wasn't it
14:06
i'd never noticed until you said this
14:08
match i looked into it there was a layer
14:10
between the wafer and a kitkat i just
14:11
thought it was chocolate around the
14:12
outside and way from the inside
14:14
sometimes you get one which is all
14:15
chocolate
14:16
wow that is a thing it's a good day that
14:18
i say when you go have you had one of
14:20
those oh yeah has anyone else
14:23
about half the room okay cool
14:26
wow
14:28
okay you really honestly andy wait till
14:30
it happens to you it's a real life
14:31
changer
14:33
but kit kats i i've only realized
14:36
looking into this what they mean in
14:38
japan
14:39
which is a lot everything everything so
14:42
japanese people just love kit kats and
14:45
they've gotten way more nuts than we
14:46
have so um apparently kitto katsu is a
14:50
japanese expression that means surely
14:51
win so it basically means good luck and
14:53
so because of this coincidence they're
14:55
super popular in japan and they've got
14:58
loads of flavors so they've got more
14:59
than 300 different kitkat flavors in
15:02
japan um nestle have just built a
15:04
factory there specifically to make the
15:06
weird-ass flavors that they have so they
15:08
have like wasabi flavored kitkats they
15:10
have soy sauce flavor they have sushi
15:12
flavored kitkats
15:14
guys you haven't tried it don't knock it
15:16
until you try it
15:17
they they have in japan made a kitkat
15:20
which doubles up as a postcard
15:22
and you can just put it in the post to
15:23
someone because every year about half
15:26
the children doing their exams get sent
15:27
a kit kat for good luck because of that
15:29
surely win thing so kit kat invented a
15:31
one that's a postcard
15:33
you could just send it to someone just
15:35
put a kitkat into the letterbox you did
15:36
that you'd be arrested
15:37
[Laughter]
15:39
we're only one envelope away from that
15:44
yeah but
15:46
you know that um kitkat started out as
15:48
mutton pies
15:50
[Music]
15:53
this is true it um so there was a club
15:56
in london called the kit the kit
15:59
the clip
16:01
the kids cat club and um and it was it
16:04
was run by an innkeeper called
16:06
christopher cat who was called kitkat
16:09
and every all the literary figures of
16:11
the time used to go there and he would
16:13
serve them mutton pies which they called
16:15
a kitkat and so the idea is that that
16:17
just became a name of a popular food
16:20
source and then eventually it turned
16:22
into kitkat no one has acknowledged that
16:24
this is true um
16:27
but no they have they're definitely
16:29
the kick-out club is definitely true
16:31
it's definitely true and it's a
16:32
socialist class yeah yeah so the
16:33
original kitkat definitely was mutton
16:34
pies but get this the ceilings were so
16:37
low in the kitkat club that they were
16:40
beautiful establishments so what they
16:42
what they did was have paintings all
16:44
over the club but because the ceilings
16:46
were so low they needed to get paintings
16:48
that were longer on the uh well on
16:51
landscape rather than portrait and
16:53
there's a theory that the reason that
16:55
kit kats are shaped like they are
16:57
is because they're paying tribute to the
17:00
squatty paintings of the kitkat club in
17:02
london sorry i didn't realize when he
17:04
said no one's acknowledged this is true
17:06
you were talking about the thing you
17:07
were about to say
17:08
[Laughter]
17:12
you know the kitkat slogan i only have a
17:16
break have a break
17:17
i only got that yesterday
17:19
that's a that's a pun
17:23
i didn't realize it was a reference to
17:24
kitkat's breaking i thought it was just
17:26
like you know yeah breaker what i didn't
17:28
get the other meaning and it only did
17:30
everyone get some
17:37
it's not as if the slogan rider's gonna
17:39
be at a time going finally
17:42
oh was it too obtuse what was i doing
17:44
that was wrong sorry can i can i join
17:45
anna's club of people who did you're
17:47
kidding me sorry i'm sorry
17:49
it's
17:51
in the in the advert they break it as
17:53
they say have a break i didn't i know
17:56
i know i know
17:58
we know all the clues were there james
18:00
sometimes
18:01
and it only came about in the 50s when
18:03
they toughened up the materials that
18:04
they made kitkats from and they were
18:06
very proud of the new snapping sound
18:08
that it made and so actually the crucial
18:10
thing about it is the breaking sound
18:12
look who's suddenly the expert on the uh
18:15
etymology and understanding of the
18:17
slogan i have a fact about chocolate
18:19
okay okay the average chocolate bar is
18:21
about 20 to 25 fat 40 to 50 sugar right
18:25
so it's one gram of fat to two grams of
18:26
sugar okay now it's very unusual in
18:29
nature to find those ratios of sugar and
18:31
fat together so if you have nuts they
18:34
have lots of fat but not no sugar if you
18:35
have fruit loads of sugar but no fat
18:38
there is a theory that the reason we
18:39
like chocolate is because the place you
18:42
find that same ratio one gram fat two
18:44
grams sugar is
18:46
breast milk
18:48
no way yeah four percent fat eight
18:50
percent sugar so it may be that we are
18:52
trying to recreate
19:01
that's what's happening why do you think
19:03
that terry's chocolate orange is so
19:04
successful
19:08
i don't know why
19:10
because you were breastfed by an oompa
19:12
loompa and
19:17
you're trying to get back to that
19:19
wait done the terry still got orange
19:21
isn't orange you know you have to take
19:22
the wrapping off
19:25
i found a really cool thing i was
19:27
looking into how they test um chocolate
19:29
and it led me down a little road that
19:31
got me to um mcvitties and and all sorts
19:34
of just how they they for candies and
19:36
biscuits and chocolate biscuits and
19:37
stuff and um there's a dummy that tests
19:41
crumb
19:42
uh lusage once you're biting into so
19:45
it's a robot dummy that just bites got
19:48
plastic teeth it's called a crumb test
19:50
dummy and the idea is that mcvities have
19:53
a laboratory where they put it into its
19:55
mouth and it just goes up and the
19:58
the advantage is that it never stops
20:01
doing that uh because it doesn't need to
20:03
breathe because andy what is it the
20:05
robot yes
20:07
it's a bit like that anal thing you were
20:08
talking about
20:13
do we need to move on to the next fact
20:14
yeah we do actually we do need to move
20:16
on to the next fact um
20:18
uh sorry andy to cut you off again
20:20
[Music]
20:21
try to get to it before the end of the
20:22
show um
20:24
and now it is time for fact number three
20:26
and that is czechinski yeah my fact this
20:29
week is that the first hamsters to come
20:31
to the uk arrived in a coat pocket
20:35
oh i know
20:39
so sweet the story of hamsters is really
20:42
interesting so um basically there was a
20:44
scientist called
20:46
don't be skeptical
20:48
there was a scientist called sul adler
20:50
back in the 1920s 1930s and he decided
20:53
that hamsters would be similar were
20:54
similar enough to humans that they might
20:57
serve as useful lab animals for obvious
20:59
reasons that i don't need to go into
21:00
hamsters humans basically the same um
21:03
and you know he specifically wanted to
21:06
try out stuff that might cure parasitic
21:07
diseases on them and so he brought three
21:10
hamsters back from syria in 1931 so all
21:13
the pet hamsters that you have had in
21:16
your childhoods and that you've ever
21:17
seen are all descended um from the this
21:20
tiny batch of syrian hamsters that these
21:22
guys found in the 1930s and yeah he
21:25
smuggled these guys back in his coat
21:26
pocket and didn't he smuggle them i
21:29
might be thinking of a different person
21:30
but didn't he smuggle them back in the
21:32
coat pocket because they ate their way
21:34
out of the
21:35
box that they were in yes
21:37
it's a really exciting story yeah yeah
21:40
it is
21:42
no they got they got a dozen didn't they
21:44
just yeah they had 11 and a mother and
21:45
then
21:46
the mother started the mother killed one
21:48
of the babies so then they had 10 less
21:49
okay fine and then half of them escaped
21:52
and had to be recaptured and then they
21:53
put them in a wooden box and they chewed
21:54
through that and then
21:56
were recaptured it's like the great
21:58
escape but with hamsters
22:00
and that was with the guy was called
22:02
israel aharoni wasn't he who he was the
22:04
guy who was determined that he'd get
22:05
these hamsters and it sounds like his
22:07
life depended on it um when when these
22:10
five escaped he was absolutely
22:12
devastated he said he was shaken to his
22:13
depths and imagine yeah when the mother
22:16
ate her children and then he had three
22:18
left and then
22:19
i think uh oh no yeah one la one sibling
22:22
ate another and then he had to make the
22:24
brother and sister didn't he that was
22:25
yes
22:26
so they're all products of incest no
22:28
it's all your childhood hamsters
22:30
yeah incest that's actually one of
22:33
all of them that's one of the reasons
22:34
they're so useful uh because their
22:36
similarity to humans is genuinely
22:38
because they're very susceptible to
22:40
heart disease hamsters um as susceptible
22:42
as humans are so that's why they're
22:43
quite good to study and the reason
22:44
that's susceptible is because they're
22:46
all very inbred
22:47
really yeah yeah apparently so wow the
22:50
thing is about um hamsters is it's
22:52
really weird why they become popular
22:55
pets really because they only live for a
22:57
couple of years tick yeah
23:02
there's a certain comfort james and
23:04
knowing this is a short-term contract
23:07
well they don't like being handled
23:10
you know
23:11
and they're nocturnal so during the day
23:13
they don't do anything
23:15
are they nocturnal i read that they well
23:17
in the wild they're definitely nocturnal
23:19
both of mine as a child were
23:21
they just don't want to hang out with
23:22
you man
23:24
i read as well that's because i kept
23:26
pointing them and saying incest
23:29
you should be ashamed
23:31
clock's ticking boys
23:33
you got two months left i've had mobile
23:35
phone contracts longer than you
23:36
[Laughter]
23:39
i've read that you can uh that they are
23:42
able to drink alcohol because they hold
23:45
they hold things
23:47
what is it they hold stuff in their
23:48
cheeks for so long and then they hoard
23:50
them
23:51
and they don't eat them till much later
23:52
but then it ferments and it turns into
23:54
alcohol and so they've had to turn their
23:55
digestive system into one that can just
23:57
down booze really quickly
24:00
and not die which a lot of animals can't
24:01
do and these little
24:04
[Laughter]
24:08
the pouches are amazing though they
24:10
their cheeks stretch back to their hips
24:11
when they need them to what yeah they
24:13
basically go and run down the whole
24:15
length of their body and they they
24:16
switch off their saliva glands to stop
24:19
themselves accidentally metabolizing the
24:21
food that they want to store so they
24:22
stop making saliva um until they feel
24:25
hungry and then they start making again
24:26
i read one thing that said that they um
24:28
can put enough stuff in their cheeks
24:30
that will make their heads triple in
24:32
size
24:34
what
24:35
well i looked at the the size of the
24:36
hamster's head and did a bit of working
24:38
out and basically it's the equivalent of
24:40
me fitting a large tin of paint
24:42
in my mouth
24:46
ladies and gentlemen
24:47
for our finale tonight
24:49
[Laughter]
24:52
i think that's why they were called
24:54
saddlebags right so when they first went
24:56
to syria to find them they realized the
24:58
arabic word for them translated as mr
25:00
saddlebags
25:01
that's what they called hamsters well
25:03
i'm not sure why but i assume that must
25:05
be it i think that is it yeah have you
25:06
heard of america's hamster king
25:09
no no he's cool he's a great guy he's
25:11
the guy who popularized the hamster
25:12
across the whole of the usa uh he was a
25:15
guy from mobile alabama and his name was
25:17
albert f marsh and so i think in the
25:20
early 50s but i might be wrong might be
25:22
40s um he he took one hamster on as a
25:26
payment of a one dollar gambling debt
25:28
that was how the debt to him was paid
25:30
off in a hamster right and he must have
25:32
got another one from somewhere because
25:33
he then bred them
25:36
um but within three years he was making
25:38
the equivalent of 1.8 million dollars a
25:40
year just from sending hamsters out to
25:42
people and the way he built this
25:44
business it was a huge business he he
25:46
can't have been making that much money
25:47
how much was he charging he made him
25:49
i think he charged about a million nine
25:51
dollars no it was about nine dollars
25:53
which would have been a lot more then um
25:54
but this is incredible so he did the he
25:56
built the business up and he made it
25:57
absolutely massive really quickly and
25:59
his shipping method was to send a
26:01
hamster to the address uh you wanted it
26:04
sent to in a coffee can with a potato
26:08
the potato was for it to eat and drink
26:10
along the way
26:11
and it would arrive and you would have a
26:13
hamster and then no potato in a coffee
26:15
tin that is worse than ryanair food i
26:18
gotta say
26:21
one potato come on
26:24
um i was reading that uh so the idea of
26:27
him bringing this uh hamst these bunch
26:29
of hamsters into his coat pocket um i
26:32
suddenly thought that's you know the
26:33
idea of like smuggling things in i think
26:35
i slightly misread the fact thinking it
26:37
was smuggling in but um so i looked up
26:39
smuggling and that's where we're going
26:40
now um
26:42
but i i was a story that happened just
26:44
this year and i'm so upset that it's not
26:46
made it into the book uh because it
26:48
would have been perfect um a woman was
26:50
arrested uh in venezuela after several
26:53
guards caught her trying to break her
26:55
boyfriend out of jail by smuggling him
26:58
out in the suitcase that she brought in
27:00
with her
27:01
so she went in with her daughter and she
27:03
just had oh i've just got my suitcase
27:05
with me and during the visit while the
27:07
guards were away she opened it up he got
27:09
inside they zipped him up and then she
27:11
tried to just walk out again with him
27:12
and she got quite far but then she
27:14
started struggling with the suitcase and
27:17
so they laid it down and they opened it
27:19
up and inside was a squished boyfriend
27:21
who um
27:22
yeah
27:23
that is not the only person in suitcase
27:26
crime story from this year from this
27:28
year no yes
27:30
in the news last week there was a guy
27:32
i think in india who was arrested
27:34
because he had been committing crime by
27:37
getting himself loaded into luggage
27:39
holds in a bag
27:41
and then he would get out of the bag rob
27:43
all the other bags in the luggage hold
27:45
and then get back into his bag no yes
27:49
great how how could he fit everything in
27:51
his bag with him i think he might he
27:53
might have just left at that point i'm
27:55
not sure
27:56
well he might have just stolen small
27:57
things but imagine on that carousel if
27:59
you accidentally pick up the wrong back
28:02
there's a small indian man is this mine
28:05
no that's not mine
28:08
all right let's move on to our final
28:09
fact uh okay it's time for a final fact
28:12
of the show and that is my fact my fact
28:14
this week is that an effective way to
28:16
treat snoring is to regularly play the
28:19
didgeridoo
28:21
this is been done it's been proven by
28:23
scientists to work um no less annoying
28:26
for the partner is it when you come home
28:27
you're like darling i've got fantastic
28:29
news i found a cure i'm just going to
28:31
constantly play the didgeridoo for the
28:32
rest of our relationship
28:34
instead of sleeping i will be in bed
28:36
next to you playing the didgeridoo you
28:38
won't even notice any snoring
28:40
yeah they did this um as a test they had
28:42
25 patients who all suffer from chronic
28:44
snoring um they're 18 years old um
28:47
onwards so they usually snoring affects
28:50
people much older but they wanted to
28:51
start at a younger age
28:53
and they had them all practice a
28:55
didgeridoo for 5.9 days per week that's
28:58
how it worked out um for 25.3 minutes
29:01
per uh session
29:03
and they found a remarkable um recovery
29:06
process of the the nasal passage for
29:09
when you're sleeping that you no longer
29:11
were snoring either as intensely or at
29:13
all so if anyone here in the audience is
29:16
a snorer um
29:17
get yourself to australia it's a bit
29:19
expensive that's
29:20
that's where they sell them and yeah
29:22
start playing so i found out about this
29:25
a few years ago i went on to the qi
29:26
forums which is where we do the research
29:28
for the tv show and i look for
29:30
didgeridoo and it turns out i posted
29:31
about this in 2006 which is when the
29:34
report came out yeah and um i suggested
29:36
a question for qi which was how does
29:38
rolf harris sleep at night
29:41
[Laughter]
29:48
oh
29:50
we touched the bullet there right
29:52
oh my god wow i actually own a
29:55
didgeridoo no you don't promise i was
29:57
giving it as a present for my 16th
29:59
birthday can you play it no
30:01
it's very hard to play yeah you can only
30:03
get one note out of it
30:05
and you need a circular breathing the
30:07
whole way through which i can't do and i
30:09
read that when the way that they get
30:11
different sounds it's all to do with the
30:13
way that you shape your lip once it's
30:14
inside so in the way that if you were
30:16
saying words like hello hello how long
30:19
that that would be like
30:21
and then if you're like wow wow wait do
30:22
you put your lips inside i think your
30:24
lips go inside the dish i see now
30:28
[Laughter]
30:32
because it stretches the mouth
30:33
unbelievably
30:36
how do these guys do it
30:41
this explains my short-lived trumpet
30:42
career as well
30:47
but it is a circular breathing right
30:49
that means it can cure snoring is that
30:51
the idea i'm guessing
30:53
it also just seems to strengthen your
30:55
whole uh respiratory tract you know it
30:57
just makes everything stronger in the
30:59
whole yeah
31:00
yeah and snoring is very problematic
31:02
apparently a third of relate people in
31:04
relationships sight snoring is a problem
31:06
in their relationship
31:08
in finland maybe they small
31:09
[Music]
31:11
i have snoring um bad i have bad snoring
31:16
i'm talking yeah
31:21
and i talked to my wife about it every
31:22
morning because i'm like was it bad last
31:24
night with my snoring and was it bad for
31:26
you last night
31:27
[Laughter]
31:29
and she she's always she's like no i
31:31
really like it it's really um
31:34
god you're a lucky man
31:36
or i've married a freak i don't know
31:38
what's going on but she um she says
31:41
because it's consistent you know it has
31:42
a rhythm it's it feels like you know
31:45
you're out at sea or you know there's a
31:48
i think i have a very pleasurable snore
31:51
um did you know that she is suffering
31:53
more than you are probably so when
31:54
snoring is cured people's partner's
31:56
quality of life improves more than the
31:59
snorers quality of life and apparently
32:01
the partners of snorers wake up on
32:03
average 21 times an hour what
32:07
night yeah like a little bit you know
32:09
like you send me wake up and then you
32:11
fall back to sleep
32:17
[Laughter]
32:22
um this is just a story that was in the
32:24
bbc uh news website it's from a few
32:27
years ago it's from 2004 and the story
32:29
is a thameslink train driver caused two
32:31
terror alerts when he mistook a
32:32
didgeridoo for a grenade launcher
32:39
he's a train driver in london and he
32:41
reported that he had seen a man carrying
32:42
a grenade launcher um
32:45
other passengers said the man fitting
32:47
the driver's description of the suspect
32:48
had been there but only had a didgeridoo
32:51
right that happened in the morning then
32:53
later the same day
32:54
the same driver reported seeing the man
32:57
taking aim at loughborough junction
33:00
and the terror police said this time we
33:03
found the man with the didgeridoo he
33:05
added the driver was quite right to
33:06
inform us about what he genuinely
33:08
thought was a terrorist threat on both
33:10
occasions which is you can't really say
33:12
anything else can you
33:14
if you're an idiot
33:16
don't phone in you can't say that he
33:18
must have been so annoying the second
33:20
time calling saying i can't believe you
33:21
guys are irresponsible enough not to
33:22
catch him the first time round and i'm
33:25
having to tell you again the traditional
33:27
mouth-launched grenade launcher
33:29
[Laughter]
33:31
i was trying to work out actually
33:32
because didgeridoos obviously very long
33:34
very wide
33:36
how they hollow out the inside of a
33:38
didgeridoo so that you get a whole so i
33:40
started googling it and couldn't find
33:42
anything oh it's right yeah uh termites
33:44
do it
33:45
really yeah they train termites
33:50
no they're kind of naturally occurring
33:52
aren't they so you get a big bit of
33:53
eucalyptus and the termites live inside
33:56
and they eat all the inside bit and then
33:57
you can cut it off and you've gotten
33:58
naturally occurring so you have to wait
34:00
for a didgeridoo to naturally occur
34:02
before
34:03
yeah but it's not like a long way it's
34:05
like people buy like filled in planks of
34:07
wood and then they sit there staring at
34:09
it they're just in the wild no that's
34:11
what but i mean it's like we're just
34:12
we're taking in wild instruments and
34:15
bringing them
34:17
like we're not even making them we're
34:18
just finding them in the wild taking
34:20
them from their habitat and then
34:23
sticking our mouth right around the rim
34:25
of them
34:26
hey we're gonna have to wrap up in a sec
34:28
if you guys got anything more before we
34:30
do there's a bed you can buy it's like a
34:32
robotic bed
34:34
oh
34:35
like my um radar thing yeah yeah yeah
34:38
we don't have time handy
34:41
but anyway it this is amazing it has
34:43
sensors in it and it can tell when
34:46
you're snoring and then it kind of just
34:48
moves you very slowly into a better
34:50
position so you won't snore ah
34:52
isn't that incredible and it also will
34:54
warm up your feet
34:58
so it'll tell if you've got cold feet
34:59
and it'll go oh no that's gonna work
35:00
incredible
35:02
they're clever robots aren't they
35:06
mate they're doing somersaults inside
35:08
you they are
35:10
that's the robot for listeners it's a

00:23
[Music]
00:25
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:28
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:31
this week coming to you from the
00:32
cheltenham literature festival
00:37
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:39
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:41
murray and james harkin and once again
00:43
we have gathered around the microphones
00:44
with our four favorite facts from the
00:46
last seven days and in no particular
00:48
order here we go starting with you
00:51
chazinski
00:53
my fact this week is that this year the
00:55
phrase make america great again adorned
00:58
half a million hats and one anus
01:06
that is legally contentious
01:08
as a way of describing the president
01:13
so this is of course the the maggot caps
01:16
um if you weren't living in a cave uh
01:18
the maga appeared on lots of caps that
01:21
were sold throughout america uh but also
01:23
lgbtq performance artist abel as kona
01:27
had himself
01:29
tattooed stenciled on the bottom with
01:32
make america great again with the magga
01:34
and
01:35
he said it was an a subversive action so
01:39
he said the anus is a land of pleasure
01:41
and a terrarium of empowerment for many
01:43
i didn't a terrarium terrarium it's very
01:46
angry i thought the terrarium was where
01:48
you kept ants
01:50
oh that's a formicarium a terrarium is
01:53
where you keep like snakes and things
01:55
like that oh right okay
01:56
so that's much better right
01:59
is it where you keep surely it's just a
02:00
place that's full of earth
02:02
yeah i mean
02:04
already it's vexed is the point
02:08
so he concluded that writing a fascist
02:10
political motto like that his words not
02:12
mine in my anus um is a clearly critical
02:15
and subversive action and so that's was
02:17
it in the anus is what you're saying oh
02:19
my god i think it
02:20
was it was important to know this andy
02:23
it wasn't like it'd be surrounding yeah
02:25
that's what i would yeah as well he did
02:27
say he did say in but i think it's it's
02:29
on the edge inside no come on you don't
02:32
write the word polo inside the mint you
02:34
write it around
02:37
so what's interesting about this guy is
02:39
that he's done it but he doesn't regret
02:41
it and we read a story last year about a
02:43
guy called joshua who'd done a similar
02:46
thing
02:47
he was a big fan of bernie sanders but
02:49
he did regret his tattoo which was a
02:51
tattoo on his penis which said feel the
02:53
burn
02:56
and then he did that in the primaries
02:57
and then hillary got in he was like oh
02:58
oh i have made a terrible
03:01
it's still 20 20 isn't there that's true
03:04
so do you know make america great again
03:07
um was actually ronald reagan's campaign
03:09
slogan or he his was not exactly the
03:12
same his was let's make america great
03:14
again
03:15
and also his next um phrase he's already
03:18
worked out what it'll be in 2020 really
03:21
yeah he's going to go for
03:22
keep america great exclamation point
03:25
that's what he says
03:27
but unfortunately that's already taken
03:28
by a horror movie
03:30
it's in purge election year which is a
03:32
movie that came out last year wow
03:35
so he's not allowed to use it well i
03:37
think he will anyway
03:39
could he put maybe a question mark on
03:41
the end instead or something
03:42
yeah
03:45
he did really specifically say the
03:46
exclamation point when they asked him
03:48
about it did he well he said the words
03:50
exclamation point or he just said it
03:51
like he says stuff i mean
03:53
it's such three years is such a long
03:55
time in politics isn't it i think we can
03:57
you know we don't know if that'll be the
03:59
slogan he might change it to something
04:01
realistic like let us fight the
04:02
cockroaches among the radioactive
04:04
brewers
04:09
he did get he got in another um legal
04:11
copyright dispute uh i mean he has a lot
04:14
of lawsuits all the time but there was
04:15
one lawsuit that trump got involved in
04:18
uh which was over an
04:19
app for the iphone and the app was
04:22
called i trump okay so it was and it was
04:26
against a a trumpet teacher uh
04:29
an amateur musician he's a 40 year old
04:31
guy called thomas scharfeld and they had
04:34
this i think a six year legal battle
04:35
where schaffler represented himself in
04:37
court against all of trump's lawyers and
04:39
he won
04:40
so the i trump now belongs to this
04:42
trumpet guy awesome yeah have you ever
04:44
heard of eddie trump no this i don't
04:46
heard of this guy but so there's this
04:48
pair of brothers real estate developers
04:50
um called the trump brothers one of
04:51
them's eddie trump in 2013 abc news had
04:55
a list of the top 50 most influential
04:58
ultra high net worth individuals there
05:00
was one trump on it it was eddie trump
05:03
bizarrely but in the 1980s they had this
05:06
real estate company and donald trump
05:08
found out about it when he received a
05:10
letter accidentally sent to him which
05:12
was meant for eddie trump and so he
05:14
spent the next many years trying to sue
05:16
them for using the trump name his own
05:18
name on their business despite them
05:20
being called the trumps and he lost that
05:21
case that's amazing similar one of my
05:24
favorite trump stories from this year
05:26
and it's made it into the book under uh
05:29
the title protests comma non-dirty
05:32
because we have a dirty protests section
05:36
is that a u.s cabinet member who's
05:38
wilbur ross um praised donald trump's
05:40
trip to saudi arabia saying it was so
05:43
successful that there wasn't a single
05:45
protester
05:46
failing to recognize that protesting is
05:48
illegal in saudi arabia
05:51
and he was on a tv show talking about it
05:53
saying it was fascinating there was not
05:55
one bad guy with a bad placard standing
05:57
there doing anything and when the
05:58
reporter said yeah but that's because he
06:00
would go to jail for up to 15 years if
06:02
he was standing doing that he went in
06:04
theory that could be true yeah yeah but
06:06
really it was amazing just no one was
06:08
there it was
06:10
well he's not had the best time abroad
06:12
has he trump um he went to the g20 and
06:15
he was sat next to at one of the dinners
06:16
the first lady of japan
06:18
and he said it was quite tough to sit
06:20
next to her because she didn't speak any
06:21
english the problem is if you go on the
06:23
internet you can look at videos of her
06:25
and she speaks perfect english
06:30
so she's completely faked amazing
06:34
there was one line of his which i think
06:36
encapsulated a lot of the whole uh
06:38
presidency so far uh this was something
06:41
that dan found it's he said uh he was
06:43
interviewed and he said i think we've
06:45
had the most successful 13 weeks in the
06:47
history of the presidency
06:50
unfortunately he said that only 11 weeks
06:52
into his presidency
06:56
actually we did um we wrote an article
06:58
in the book on the inauguration and we
07:00
did it in numbers because that was
07:01
obviously the big thing where he said
07:03
biggest inauguration ever period and
07:05
andy did this whole article about the
07:08
the many little numbers that didn't get
07:10
reported do you have any examples
07:12
oh what was that so the crowd was meant
07:14
to be 1.5 million and actually it was
07:16
worked out at three to six hundred
07:18
thousand which is still a lot of people
07:20
um what do you mean three hundred
07:22
thousand to six hundred thousand sorry i
07:23
don't mean minimum three maximum six
07:29
um hundred else was there there were
07:30
there were oh uh things the number of
07:33
cans of ravioli ravioli that were
07:35
confiscated by security for being a
07:37
potential risk to presidential security
07:39
which that was two to two yeah what was
07:41
the thing about um dons john's oh yeah
07:44
all the uh all the portaloos for the for
07:46
the crowds who turned up were brought by
07:48
a company which is genuinely called dons
07:50
john's and
07:52
uh they feared that people might make
07:54
jokes about this so they covered all the
07:55
labels up with blue tape on the day yeah
07:57
it's got a thin skin and they also
07:59
confiscated from people coming into the
08:01
inauguration um bananas so if you had a
08:05
banana it wasn't allowed in unless it
08:07
was sliced so they would say may i see
08:09
your lunch box i'm sorry that banana's
08:11
in full form we're gonna have to
08:13
so another thing that uh trump said that
08:15
people called into question this year
08:17
was that he invented the phrase priming
08:19
the pump uh do people remember that so
08:22
he used the phrase prime the pump and
08:24
then he said uh have you heard that
08:26
expression before because i haven't
08:28
heard it i mean i just made it up a
08:29
couple of days ago that's just the kind
08:31
of thing i have to do um and of course
08:33
he didn't make it up it dates back to
08:35
1819 i think
08:37
in a walter scott story which that i
08:39
ended up reading in preparation for this
08:41
it's great um but walter scott's
08:43
actually talking about a woman who comes
08:45
up to him at a party and says to him i
08:47
really loved your latest book but he'd
08:49
written it under a pseudonym so she was
08:51
actually bragging to him and saying haha
08:53
i've got you i know it's you and so he's
08:55
talking about how annoyed he is that
08:57
she's trying to prime the pump with
08:58
flattery
09:00
but yeah he also claimed this week i
09:01
think or last week to have invented fake
09:03
news
09:04
i think i think i'd give him
09:08
no it was even just the word fake
09:10
because he didn't get to news so i think
09:11
he did meet mean fake news but he's
09:14
sitting next to pence in it and that's
09:15
the best bit because he says
09:17
not many people know i invented the word
09:19
fake and pence is like yep he did
09:22
he's such a good best friend he's so
09:24
good it's not done too much so for
09:26
example since the election at least two
09:29
babies in iraq have been named trump
09:32
hmm so he's got that that's a ah
09:35
takeaway they're going to go through
09:36
life answering questions about that
09:39
here's an interesting thing in um i went
09:41
to kosovo uh quite a few years ago and i
09:44
was told while i was out there that a
09:45
popular name that was uh happening
09:47
amongst boys in kosovo new names was
09:49
tonnabler
09:51
t-o-n-b-l-r
09:52
and it's a tribute to tony blair because
09:55
of the uh the i think there's a bill
09:57
clinton boulevard
09:58
christina clinton in christina there's
10:00
clinton up on buildings everywhere you
10:03
went there was uh pictures of clinton
10:05
and tonabler is a name in kosovo now but
10:07
the problem is with donald is no one's
10:09
being called donald anymore oh that's
10:11
true i think there are only something
10:12
like two babies called donald in
10:15
scotland even last year
10:24
and apparently they did an interview
10:26
with a guy who was called donald and he
10:27
said he had to apologize every time he
10:29
went to starbucks
10:32
but that's because he took a poo on
10:34
their account
10:36
why did he apologize just because they
10:37
say what's your name and he goes donald
10:39
sorry
10:41
um so he's saying about scotland
10:43
donald trump has some golf courses in
10:45
scotland and for one of those he wanted
10:47
to have a crest
10:49
for his family so what he did was he
10:51
took an english crest and stole it and
10:54
put the word trump at the bottom in
10:56
place of the word that was there before
10:58
that which was integrity
11:03
we're gonna have to move on to our
11:05
second fact because we're running on a
11:06
tighter podcast schedule tonight so
11:08
we're gonna move on to our second fact
11:10
now and that is james okay my fact this
11:13
week is that eastenders star adam
11:15
woodyatt was beaten in the london
11:18
marathon this year by a man in a
11:20
sleeping bag a woman in a full body
11:22
dinosaur suit and a man carrying a
11:25
tumble dryer
11:30
so he did the course in seven hours and
11:33
four minutes which is is that slow it's
11:36
quite slow yeah okay they reckon one of
11:38
the reasons might have been because he
11:39
was doing so many selfies on the way
11:40
okay um but yeah there were 73 world
11:43
records attempted at the this year's
11:45
london marathon and 39 were broken uh so
11:49
this sleeping bag was broken the
11:50
dinosaur was broken um the fastest
11:53
marathon ever run by someone dressed as
11:55
a witch was broken
11:57
that was by nicola nuttall from pendle
12:00
and she thought she'd broken the record
12:02
last year but they nullified her results
12:04
because her skirt was too short
12:08
yeah apparently witches have to have a
12:10
certain length of skirt
12:12
did not know that how sure was adam
12:14
woodyat's skirt
12:16
he's i bet i mean are there any
12:18
eastenders fans in here except me
12:20
no wow not a single one
12:23
no overlap between shelton literary
12:24
festival and eastenders they all look
12:26
like emmerdale fans to me yeah you're
12:28
right well he's always doing
12:29
embarrassing stuff in eastenders so this
12:31
just fits with his character maybe it
12:32
was a bit of method acting um no i've
12:34
never really heard of adam wood yet
12:36
before this but he still feels like he's
12:38
flushed his head down the toilet okay
12:39
yeah he did oh my god i have a question
12:41
about the sleeping bag person yes did
12:42
the sleeping bag person run it with the
12:44
sleeping bag on
12:46
this way
12:47
or this way oh sorry i should clarify
12:49
for people listening to this because
12:50
it's an audio thing
12:53
the thing is how many ways are there you
12:55
said it this way obviously
12:58
yeah no one's uh no one's at home going
12:59
well there's at least six ways
13:02
sorry okay i reckon and i don't know
13:04
this but i reckon it must have been like
13:06
this way oh i see
13:09
yeah thinking about it that makes most
13:11
sense you're right yeah i think like one
13:13
of those sack races yeah but yeah i
13:15
think i would run faster if i unzipped
13:17
it a bit the legs and headed on over my
13:18
head with some eye holes
13:20
but you can't have eye holes it's world
13:22
record oh sorry
13:24
is that cheating i think so it
13:26
compromised the sleeping bag i guess
13:28
yeah and some other records beaten uh
13:30
the fastest marathon as someone dressed
13:32
as a swimmer a star a crustacean an elf
13:36
a fast food item and a toilet roll
13:39
dressed as a swimmer
13:41
that was the least effort i've ever
13:43
heard anyone put into a costume
13:45
it'd be great when he passed the
13:46
starfish in the crustacean because he
13:47
could just make it look like you're
13:48
taking underwater
13:50
yeah did he have to act out like he was
13:52
swimming no he just wore trunks
13:54
right
13:55
yeah that's not if anything that should
13:57
be faster than the runners because he's
13:58
got less air resistant he should have
14:00
won the actual marathon
14:02
what's amazing as well is none of these
14:04
are set new records these are all broke
14:06
existing records
14:08
so there must be a massive list
14:09
somewhere where people are going i
14:11
really want a record what do i need to
14:12
do oh i can dress as a as a giant hot
14:14
dog okay i'll go and i'll try and smash
14:16
that one this year so that's all they've
14:18
done right yeah i guess you're right um
14:20
what about this tumble dryer guy oh well
14:23
he was i can't remember his name it's in
14:24
the book um he basically decided he
14:27
wanted to carry an item of kitchen
14:30
equipment and it was allowed to be any
14:31
of them but he tried originally with a
14:34
fridge i think see i would i would have
14:36
gone spatula i would have immediately
14:39
he tried with a fridge and then decided
14:42
it wasn't really working because it was
14:43
too big and then went with the tumble
14:45
dryer and apparently in his hometown he
14:47
was practicing and he kept being stopped
14:49
by the police he thought he was the
14:51
world's most brazen thief
14:56
the great one is the uh the the gorilla
14:58
hmm i'm sure did you guys see the guy
15:00
who did the marathon as a gorilla he was
15:01
a policeman was he yeah yeah that's
15:03
right so he completed it uh by walking
15:06
as a gorilla and it took him uh how many
15:09
times he didn't walk as a gorilla did he
15:10
he was like on his hands and knees he
15:12
was on his hands and knees he was quoted
15:14
because he was stopped halfway through
15:15
the race or along the race asking any
15:17
advice for anyone who wants to travel as
15:19
a gorilla in a marathon in future and uh
15:21
his quote is get a bit more training in
15:23
we only did about four crawling sessions
15:25
beforehand i'd also recommend
15:27
painkillers and bloody mindedness anyway
15:30
i'd better get crawling
15:32
even once for him then confiscated his
15:33
bananas at the entrance
15:38
he was even slower than adam would yet
15:40
wasn't he he was like was it six days it
15:42
took six six days and eight six and a
15:45
half days yeah that's a lot slower than
15:47
adam would yet have somebody else's
15:48
defense he wasn't there for a week no
15:50
you're right but i think in order to get
15:52
a medal you need to do it in something
15:54
like six hours so use only six days out
15:58
again
15:59
but there is a lot of um spot in this
16:01
book isn't it there is i was going to
16:03
say can i quickly read out my favorite
16:05
sport fact from this book this is a fact
16:07
that was found from james found by james
16:10
uh and that is a non-league footballer
16:12
in aberdeen missed the goal so badly
16:15
that they found the ball 1 800
16:18
kilometers away
16:20
in norway
16:22
so his shot went past the goal it went
16:24
into the river d and uh it just went
16:26
into the north sea and it just floated
16:28
away
16:29
and then ages later um because for the
16:32
fact that they had the name of their
16:34
team on the ball they got an email from
16:36
a small island off the coast of norway
16:38
called vanna who said we've got your
16:40
ball
16:44
and so they returned it and they have
16:46
the ball back again that's so sweet yeah
16:48
there was actually this week there was a
16:50
fifth league football match in romania
16:52
that had to be cooled off before it
16:53
finished because all of the spare bulls
16:56
ended up in the river so they had like a
16:58
dozen spare balls and then they had to
16:59
finish it it was something like the 58th
17:00
minute or something they had to end the
17:02
match because they didn't know any balls
17:03
left
17:04
so these things happen stop playing by
17:06
rivers and c's
17:09
um we should move on to our next fact
17:11
again
17:12
so we're going to move on to fact number
17:14
three and that is andy my fact is that
17:18
the queen's nickname is gary
17:22
is that your personal nickname for her
17:24
no it's even better it's a family
17:26
nickname for the queen um
17:29
so this this was something we found out
17:30
this year and it's something that prince
17:32
william
17:33
called her
17:34
when he was a child because he was
17:36
unable to pronounce grammy so he would
17:38
call her gary instead
17:42
i just think that's very sweet
17:45
apparently prince philip calls her
17:46
cabbage oh okay yeah do we know why he
17:49
can't pronounce elizabeth
17:54
she comes out like that he retired this
17:56
year didn't he that's in the book
17:58
oh yeah we wrote about that so he
17:59
retired this year and it's been a huge
18:02
disappointment to this one small island
18:04
at vanuatu an island called tana
18:07
because the people who revere him as a
18:09
god have been waiting five decades for
18:11
him to come and he's now no longer
18:13
coming so they're devastated it's really
18:15
really bad news over there i mean they
18:17
must have seen it coming when they when
18:18
the clock ticked over on the fourth
18:20
decade
18:21
because yeah he's a god he's a god yes
18:24
don't retire do they
18:25
i guess not no apparently one of the
18:27
things about that is um if he and the
18:30
queen ever went to this island and the
18:32
queen ever witnessed him publicly
18:34
drinking carver the local drink then
18:37
local etiquette dictates that she would
18:39
have to be instantly executed by a
18:42
single blow to the head with a vegetable
18:44
[Laughter]
18:47
we found out another uh nickname whose
18:50
nickname was it oh come on camilla
18:51
parker bowles who's that's right the
18:53
duchess of
18:56
the duchess of cornwall she said that
18:58
her nickname at school was the growler
19:01
because
19:09
i expected more from you
19:12
because she was so bad at singing is the
19:14
reason sean spicer uh was once called
19:17
sean sphincter i think he was called
19:19
that in uh was it when he was at uni and
19:21
one of the university magazine called
19:23
him sean sphincter and then he got very
19:25
very upset and they said it was just
19:27
totally innocent also correct but
19:31
i don't think autocorrect could have
19:32
existed when spicer was at university no
19:34
and also spicer is a word isn't it
19:40
this is a great one there is a this was
19:42
a scientific paper published this year
19:44
this is just to do with names um there
19:45
was a paper published about the
19:47
evolution of the horse hoof talking
19:50
about the number of toes it used to have
19:51
because it now has one toe and it used
19:53
to have more the lead writer of that
19:55
paper is called brianna mchorse
19:59
mccourse is a surname she sounds like
20:01
she was named by the internet doesn't
20:02
she yes she does she's a bodhi mukbo
20:05
horse she's yeah
20:07
yeah it's true this is like so canada
20:09
got a new national bird this is in the
20:11
books i think it was last year uh so
20:13
canada's new national bird is the grey j
20:15
but the person who set up the campaign
20:17
for them to get a new national bird was
20:18
called professor david bird
20:22
that's good that reminds me um there's a
20:24
tennis player who's currently playing um
20:26
he's a tennis player from tennessee
20:28
and he's called tennis
20:31
no he's called tennis
20:33
okay
20:34
and on wikipedia it says although tennis
20:37
sandgrun is a tennis player from
20:39
tennessee he is actually named after his
20:42
great grandfather who did not play
20:44
tennis and was not from tennessee
20:50
um james you found out about the names
20:52
of the year oh i love those guys yeah
20:55
yeah there's a there's an online
20:56
competition every year to find the best
20:59
named person and it's all real people
21:00
from all over the world and it's done by
21:02
an online vote and i'm sure you have
21:05
some of them well i know that the winner
21:07
was boat's boats yep
21:10
have you just said to james you found
21:11
out about the names of the year and then
21:12
relied on him i've got them here well
21:16
let me say the people who boats boats
21:18
beat to um to get to the final he beat
21:21
eliza fox teats
21:24
bird love god
21:26
aphrodite body comb
21:28
quindarius monday and andy brandy casa
21:32
grundy
21:37
but we've actually as we were writing
21:39
this book we've come across loads of
21:40
better names even than those haven't we
21:42
yeah yeah i really like this is one
21:44
that's under the entry kinky um
21:47
this is further down but just for for
21:49
the sake of knowing uh europe opened its
21:51
first sex doll brothel this year um
21:54
and it has a staff of four dolls and uh
21:58
stuff just letting you know it's in the
22:00
book um but in that article in the kinky
22:02
article i found this here that there's a
22:04
cop in america who was suspended from
22:07
the force after it was discovered that
22:09
her previous occupation was a dominatrix
22:11
and that's what she did and um her name
22:13
is officer hyman that's her name
22:16
and um she was told she could stay on on
22:18
the condition that she passed a
22:19
psychiatric exam to prove she wasn't
22:21
prone to using excessive force
22:26
did you guys see tatler released a list
22:28
of poshest baby names in the last couple
22:30
of weeks it was bizarre so it really it
22:33
shows weird self-awareness of tatler to
22:36
say these are the possessed names we
22:37
know about this if we know about
22:38
anything and um it said for girls they
22:41
said these are real names we promise
22:43
with no evidence to back that up but i
22:45
said for girls best names you can name
22:47
your kid are scar zaza figgy or monovine
22:51
and then for boys you could call your
22:54
son barkley
22:55
mao which probably presumably ironically
22:59
i guess so well you wouldn't call him
23:00
chairman would you
23:03
um other names they recommend for a boy
23:05
wig boot
23:06
a wig
23:08
yeah so maybe rethink your um axorious
23:11
quail and peter but starting with an n
23:14
but the n is silent
23:20
um i've got another one which is that um
23:22
this is under the entry northern lights
23:24
in the book and we found this amazing
23:26
thing it was found uh in the middle of
23:28
last year but it's been debated about
23:30
since last year up until this year and
23:32
they finally announced that they finally
23:34
know what it is so they thought that
23:36
this was a part of the aurora borealis
23:38
for years it was a light phenomenon that
23:40
was happening in the sky thought it was
23:41
just part of the northern light and
23:43
there's a facebook group of aurora
23:44
spotters who kept looking at it going
23:46
i'm not sure that this is the aurora
23:48
borealis and it turns out they were
23:49
right that it was this amazing new light
23:52
phenomenon that's been there since you
23:54
know since we've had eyes and seen
23:56
things and maybe even before that maybe
23:58
even before but actually that's a good
24:00
point yeah
24:01
yeah
24:03
so just like two days before we had eyes
24:07
that started
24:08
and so that's incredible unfortunately
24:10
it has been named by the public so it's
24:12
now called steve
24:17
you've got some beautiful steves yeah
24:19
come on and they tried to backtrack it
24:21
to say oh that it has a real scientific
24:23
name so what they said that it might
24:24
stand for is strong thermal emission
24:26
velocity enhancement but actually it's
24:29
named after a cartoon called over the
24:32
hedge uh which is a a sort of animation
24:34
for kids uh and it's a talking squirrel
24:37
who names a hedge steve and that's
24:39
that's why it's got its name i think
24:40
just don't ask the public to name things
24:43
yeah there was a um an orangutan with
24:47
white fur it was um that was found this
24:50
year in borneo and they asked the public
24:52
to name that it's the first albino
24:54
orangutan that these guys have ever
24:55
found
24:56
and the public actually came up with a
24:58
decent name which was alba meaning white
25:00
which is quite good
25:02
they sensibly ignored other suggestions
25:05
such as meringue utam
25:11
i
25:12
i stand by my decision to submit this
25:15
and
25:16
a rank no tab
25:21
which is really good
25:24
all right we're gonna have to move on to
25:25
our final fact of the show
25:28
this is my fact and this is under
25:30
queensland
25:32
australian queensland police
25:33
successfully lowered crime rates this
25:35
year by asking victims to stop reporting
25:40
crimes so this was discovered in a
25:43
report that's been carried out i believe
25:44
from 2011 to 2016.
25:47
they noticed that the crime rates have
25:48
gone down they thought this is going
25:50
great but then they noticed that there
25:51
were all these things that were leading
25:52
to the fact that no crimes were being
25:54
reported amongst them were things like
25:56
they didn't say that something was a
25:58
crime they would say it was an unfounded
26:00
thing they would write to the people who
26:02
had reported crimes and say just want to
26:04
check that you actually did want to
26:06
report that crime uh let us know in the
26:08
next seven days if you if we don't hear
26:09
back from you we'll just assume you
26:10
didn't want to report that crime and so
26:12
as a result they lowered it by a huge
26:14
amount it was um they discovered 22 of
26:17
all the cases that were logged in the
26:18
police force were using this method to
26:20
stop it from uh being reported as a
26:23
crime and the reason being is they were
26:24
getting mounting pressure from the
26:26
government saying your crime rates are
26:27
so high we need you to get them down and
26:29
they went well there's a very quick way
26:30
that we can do it
26:32
but did you see the other way they tried
26:34
to brisbane's in uh queensland right
26:36
yeah okay so this is another way they
26:38
tried to cut down on anti-social
26:39
behavior brisbane launched a don't be a
26:42
campaign oh yes yeah
26:45
apparently queensland fortitude valley's
26:48
um police guy simon turner
26:50
said is a term that means your
26:52
behavior is unacceptable oh what you're
26:56
either a decent bloke or a
26:58
well this casts a very new life on my
27:00
school days i must say
27:04
yeah
27:05
and while this was happening um there
27:07
was a queensland banana farm worker
27:10
called lee de pao and he tried to
27:12
impress a girl by jumping into a river
27:14
after drinking about 10 cups of goon
27:17
which is like why not goona's boxed wine
27:20
that comes in a what looks like um alien
27:23
tinfoil okay with a little thing and
27:25
then you press it with a box outside it
27:27
yeah but then you can yeah fit it in
27:29
your bag if you use that's the important
27:31
part
27:36
what you can do is when you finish it if
27:37
you're very drunk which i've done as i'm
27:39
australian um you'll be out in a park on
27:41
your own and you'll be like i'm really
27:43
tired and i've just finished my goon you
27:45
can actually blow into the goon and blow
27:47
it up like a pillow and then fall asleep
27:49
on the
27:50
so it's a really practical drink
27:52
actually you can't do that on an empty
27:54
bottle for example and they've never
27:56
thought of that in their marketing and i
27:58
think they definitely should very good
27:59
point well he could have blown it up and
28:01
used it as like water wings or something
28:03
because he jumped into this river to
28:05
impress a girl and was immediately
28:07
mauled by a three meter long crocodile
28:10
i don't think water wings stop
28:12
crocodiles
28:14
well he managed to fight it off uh but
28:16
the lady he was trying to impress sophie
28:18
patterson said being attacked by animals
28:20
doesn't really do it for me
28:23
yeah she's a weird one well she did say
28:26
i'd have to be quite twisted to be
28:27
impressed by that
28:30
one of my favorite criminals of the year
28:32
uh was he was in the balloon section and
28:36
he was a man who was fined this year by
28:38
a court in canada
28:40
for flying up in a chair with lots of
28:42
helium balloons attached to it it's the
28:44
real thing he was inspired by the film
28:46
up and he did it to promote his cleaning
28:48
company another cartoon another cartoon
28:50
he was trying to fly high enough to see
28:52
steve
28:52
[Laughter]
28:54
and and he he flew up he flew up four
28:57
thousand feet
28:59
four kilometers sorry four thousand four
29:01
thousand meters and yeah two commercial
29:03
airliners flew underneath him while he
29:05
was up in his chair he landed safely he
29:08
injured his ankle slightly on landing
29:09
but he was otherwise fine and the court
29:11
fined him they said he had been what was
29:12
it unconscionably stupid yeah
29:16
but you can't agree with the court i
29:18
mean you just read that story and you go
29:20
what an absolute hero
29:22
yeah look i know i should disapprove but
29:24
my god that's cool this was my favorite
29:27
crime story from the year a used car
29:29
dealership in fort worth in dallas was
29:31
being robbed so many times just
29:33
constantly getting robbed the police
29:34
weren't able to stop it that the guy who
29:36
ran it the owner bought a guard dog so
29:39
he was like great guard dog here stop
29:40
the robbers did not stop the robbers
29:42
robbers came back robbed the place again
29:44
then as they were leaving stole the
29:45
guard dog with them
29:48
poor guy there was also a good uh
29:51
similarly fitting crime it was a news
29:53
crew had gone to cover the problem of
29:55
urban crime in albuquerque and uh the
29:59
as they left their van where they had
30:01
all their filming equipment and they
30:02
went to film about urban crime and they
30:04
came back and they were found with all
30:05
their stuff and had been stolen um and
30:07
so michelle donaldson who was the news
30:09
director said i have one rule that you
30:11
should never be the lead story in your
30:13
own newscast
30:15
this has violated that rule
30:17
andy you went on a
30:19
trek on the internet to find as many
30:21
bandits as you could didn't you yeah so
30:23
you get people nicknamed the such and
30:24
such bandit because they robbed you know
30:26
a particular kind of place so one
30:28
example is the coast to coast bandit who
30:31
only robbed banks in new york and los
30:32
angeles yes and there was what was there
30:35
there was the lunchtime bandit who only
30:38
uh robbed banks between noon and 1pm
30:41
and the bag trick bandit who kept
30:43
putting his hand in his pocket and
30:44
pretending to have a gun but he didn't
30:46
have a gun that was his clever
30:48
trick the spelling bee bandit spelling
30:51
bee bandit oh spelling bee bandit he
30:53
would pass a note to the cashier in the
30:54
bank saying this is a robbery
30:56
[Laughter]
31:00
and this one probably doesn't need
31:01
explaining but it's the texas butthole
31:03
tickling bandit
31:07
i knew he was from texas i think that's
31:09
like
31:10
i knew you were gonna read that one
31:13
i liked one of my favorite criminals was
31:15
in north carolina and uh so this was
31:17
this year when a 500 million dollar
31:20
opium growing operation was busted uh
31:22
and it was when an investigator visited
31:24
someone on a completely unrelated matter
31:27
knocked on this guy's door he was a
31:28
farmer knocked on his door and he opened
31:30
the door and said i guess you'll hear
31:31
about the opm
31:36
but i am now
31:38
i really like this one so when we when
31:41
we decided that we were going to write
31:42
this book we started this document
31:45
between us and every week we started
31:47
putting in sort of our favorite
31:49
headlines or or little facts that we
31:51
found and to begin with we didn't know
31:53
if this would work as a book because
31:54
we'd never done it before we'd never
31:55
tried and i saw this one fact which was
31:58
sent by james you put this into the
32:00
document and i thought oh this might
32:02
actually work and it was an arrest and
32:04
it's under in the book arrest comma
32:05
human
32:06
surprisingly we have an entry which is
32:08
arrest common non-human
32:10
um a man in india this year was arrested
32:12
for trying to create a fake id card
32:14
using the name osama bin laden so he
32:17
thought this will work i'll just put
32:18
osama bin laden's name on this not only
32:20
that he uploaded a blurred picture of
32:23
osama bin laden as the picture of his id
32:26
card so the police investigated and they
32:28
arrested the man the man it turns out
32:31
his real name is sudam hussein
32:39
extraordinary
32:42

00:49
and no particular order
00:51
here we go starting with you andy my
00:54
fact this week
00:55
is that britain exports over 50 000
00:57
boomerangs
00:58
every year to australia
01:04
and then imports them again presumably
01:09
um yeah this is uh this is just
01:12
something that happens this is uh
01:13
who who knew that the the post-brexit uh
01:15
britain is going to be
01:17
boomerangs to australia yes hold to
01:19
newcastle is this a recent thing
01:21
um oh by the way the phrase colton
01:22
newcastle is that well known here
01:25
yeah yeah because we tried it on some
01:26
people in london like young people and
01:27
they'd never heard of it yeah
01:29
that's true actually anyone under the
01:30
age of about 25 in london haven't heard
01:32
of it maybe 30 even
01:33
but actually um they import coal in
01:35
newcastle don't they
01:36
oh don't you well do you
01:41
yes you do great
01:45
in 2013 uh newcastle imported 4.9
01:48
million tons of coal
01:50
uh the second most in the uk after
01:52
somewhere it's like wow
01:54
no way what are they doing with it
01:58
do you want to get some is that i think
02:01
um yeah then it's sent around the
02:02
country for people to
02:04
learn that's what you do with cop now i
02:07
know
02:07
what you do with cole i just didn't know
02:09
what newcastle was doing with cole what
02:11
do you what special thing do you think
02:12
newcastle does with coal
02:14
well apparently they just send it back
02:16
out again
02:17
it's like the boomerang the thing is
02:19
done right the uk is an island yeah and
02:22
when we bring stuff in it has to go into
02:23
a port and newcastle is one of the best
02:25
parts we have
02:25
now i get it i thought you meant like
02:27
manchester was sending coal to
02:30
i thought newport was just collecting
02:31
coal and then when
02:33
now you can have it back newport is
02:35
somewhere else
02:37
[Music]
02:44
wait so what what's happened oh my god
02:48
can we recap what's don't worry i think
02:51
you've trodden on enough toes it's a
02:52
good thing james just said they've got
02:54
the best port
02:54
kiss us so we've won a few people over
02:58
with that
02:59
anyway my fact this week is that britain
03:01
exports over 50 000 boomerangs a year to
03:03
australia
03:04
i looked at these boomerangs and they
03:06
don't look very boomerang-like
03:08
well wait till they hit you in the back
03:10
of the head james um
03:12
no well the the toy boomerangs yeah they
03:13
got three um
03:15
three sticky outfits that's true yeah
03:17
are you sure that's like fidget spinners
03:18
right yeah they look like fidget
03:19
spinners yeah big ones
03:21
they're absolutely dude but they're
03:22
called sports boomerangs or something
03:24
yeah yeah
03:24
and they basically fly for miles and
03:26
they do come back yeah and the really
03:28
cool thing is the guy
03:29
who runs the company which sells them
03:30
his name is david strang
03:32
okay and he moved from scotland to
03:35
australia at the age of eight
03:36
and then at the age of 20 he came back
03:45
can i just ask just some bugs did we all
03:48
just exclusively look for facts where
03:50
something went away and came back
03:53
um he's so it's it's just him isn't it
03:55
it's just this one guy this one company
03:57
that's making them and exporting them is
03:59
that right yeah so you know the song my
04:01
boomerang won't come back
04:02
yeah right no
04:06
it's a song a comedy song from the
04:08
comedy song oh yeah
04:09
50s my boomerang won't come back
04:12
everyone else knows it right because you
04:14
guys know it
04:15
it's really famous like six people are
04:17
saying yeah how many
04:19
how many people don't know it
04:22
i mean that's huge yeah all right
04:25
minority do you know who produced that
04:27
song
04:28
a certain george martin who
04:31
went on to produce more famous songs by
04:33
the beatles
04:36
who wrote game of thrones
04:40
i did not that was his big break my
04:43
boomerang won't come back and then he
04:44
went on to make the beatles yeah in the
04:46
course of researching this i actually
04:47
listened to that song on repeat for
04:48
about
04:49
two days now did you yeah it's very good
04:52
it's good
04:52
these days it's a bit culturally
04:53
insensitive so yeah i i'm not going to
04:56
phrase it
05:00
do you know do you know who else owned
05:02
boomerangs
05:03
tootin car moon oh yes it's full of
05:07
boomerangs
05:07
no
05:13
[Laughter]
05:22
i'm sorry so do you know what is the
05:24
world record
05:26
longest time a boomerang has been in the
05:28
air no
05:29
uh do you want to have a guess in
05:30
minutes minutes um
05:34
three minutes 37 minutes
05:39
what do you think a bird flew off with
05:40
it
05:43
well the answer is um one thousand four
05:46
hundred and forty minutes
05:48
and nine seconds ah don't
05:53
for listeners at home dan's wagging his
05:55
finger at me like and then i told you so
05:56
hey can you explain it i can and
06:00
you're not gonna like it it's it's space
06:02
right
06:03
it's a guy called jay perritt and he was
06:05
at the south pole
06:07
and he threw it so it went through all
06:09
of the different time zones so
06:10
technically went around 24 hours
06:14
that's awesome i'm not the only one who
06:16
didn't like it
06:19
i i actually have um the world the
06:22
guinness world record
06:23
for the longest distance of you
06:31
congratulations
06:33
you hide your talent under a bottle then
06:37
imagine if that was true this was the
06:39
first time we'd ever heard it
06:41
i like to brag um yeah no i uh
06:44
2005 the guinness world record was set
06:46
for the longest throw of a boomerang
06:48
and do you want to have a guess of how
06:50
far that was oh
06:52
like 80 000 miles
06:57
if you could take my question seriously
06:58
mate
07:00
james you wanna guess um well let's say
07:03
i think it would be about
07:05
300 400 yards i've got it written down
07:08
here sir
07:09
okay great so why don't you have a guess
07:11
anyway anna
07:13
is it only has 420
07:16
eight seven meters
07:19
well i've got it in feet so i don't know
07:21
what that is
07:25
so yeah you might be right fill me in
07:27
feet and i'll convert it for you one
07:29
thousand four hundred and one
07:30
427 meters
07:35
so anna was closest um
07:39
so this was set in queensland in
07:41
australia
07:42
and um it was set by a guy called mr
07:45
shumi
07:46
and mr shumi when he was asked about it
07:48
uh he said
07:50
it wasn't really a boomerang throw
07:53
admitted shumi as it didn't come back
07:58
but weirdly the guinness world records
08:00
thought we'll just succeed because the
08:01
record should be zero meters
08:03
exactly exactly well the record for a
08:06
returning one which i think is the one
08:07
that should really stand
08:09
is a swiss guy actually who threw it 238
08:13
meters out and then 238 meters back
08:16
uh which is further all together than mr
08:19
shimmy isn't it i again you've thrown
08:22
numbers that i don't understand
08:25
it is
08:32
we need to move on to our second fact um
08:35
okay so it is time for
08:36
fact number two and that is james okay
08:38
my fact this week is that the catalan
08:41
region
08:41
does regular checks of websites that end
08:44
with
08:44
dot cat to check that they're about
08:47
catalonia
08:48
and not about cats
08:57
um are they the only two options
09:00
uh well no but it seems basically they
09:02
want all of the websites that dot cats
09:04
because that's the catalan um
09:06
domain name they want them to all be
09:08
about catalonia
09:09
but actually everyone else wants to put
09:11
cats on the internet
09:12
and when you put cats on the internet
09:14
what you're going to do you're going to
09:15
put
09:16
cat right and so people do it all the
09:18
time and
09:19
every now and then they have to do an
09:21
audit and they give people six months to
09:23
shut the down their website
09:25
or add a translation tool to translate
09:28
their website into catalan
09:31
so there is um a website called is it
09:33
nyan on nyam
09:35
does anyone know nian so it's nian you
09:37
all know about it it's like a little
09:38
cartoon
09:39
um cat that's got like a rainbow on it
09:40
and it's a stupid song that
09:42
happens and that was nyan.cat and they
09:45
were told they had to take it down
09:47
until they put a translation tool and so
09:49
now you can watch nyan cat
09:51
in catalan wow thank
09:54
god yeah but it's really like for them
09:59
like for the catalan uh people it's
10:01
really important obviously a lot in the
10:02
news at the moment but i think they were
10:04
the first
10:05
um sort of group of people rather than a
10:07
country to have their own top level
10:09
internet domain name
10:10
yeah there were only eight they only
10:11
only eight top level domains were
10:13
allowed and then the catalonia people
10:14
said no we want a knight we want it to
10:16
be
10:17
our own space and it was because one of
10:18
the guys who organized it was catalan
10:21
so that kind of helped yeah he was
10:23
called amadou
10:24
abril e abrael and he was a lawyer and
10:27
he was kind of part of the top level
10:29
internet
10:29
thing but he was catalan so he kind of
10:32
managed to
10:33
pull a few strings they are very active
10:36
internet users though apparently um
10:41
it's them that are posting all these
10:42
pictures of themselves um the
10:44
catalonians too though so in 2013
10:46
catalan was the eighth most used
10:48
language on blogs online
10:50
which is kind of extraordinary given
10:52
that there are
10:54
like eight million eight to ten million
10:56
catalan speakers
10:58
they love the internet so it'll never
11:01
catch on
11:03
i think i heard that um blogging is
11:05
massive yeah i'm sorry
11:08
yes it is dad yeah and i have this thing
11:11
it's called myspace
11:14
and and you you go on um no it's because
11:17
the
11:17
you know obviously they want to be
11:18
independent from spain a lot of people
11:20
in catalonia so they blog
11:21
and they have message boards which are
11:22
all about catalonian issues and it's a
11:25
very sort of
11:26
adhesive identity basically yes
11:29
did you read about the guy though who
11:31
has started
11:32
a cat-based internet thing that is
11:35
really cool he started stalking cats
11:38
around the world
11:39
and then he started posting up where
11:42
they live
11:43
online so what happens is if you post a
11:45
picture of your cat on
11:47
flickr or like what are the other ones
11:50
instagram um
11:53
ask jeeves if you put a cat on the fuse
11:56
you can put a cat on ask jeeves
11:58
and he'll take the cat and he'll scrape
12:00
all the data from behind
12:01
all the messages who is this pervert why
12:05
are you telling us about him he's not a
12:06
pervert he's someone who's trying to
12:07
highlight the security problems online
12:09
with posting your pictures up because
12:10
you often accidentally geotag yourself
12:12
when you put pictures up
12:13
and so he's created this map of the
12:15
world and you can see all the cats that
12:17
live in certain places so if you've ever
12:19
posted a picture of your cat
12:20
up then you can go to where you live and
12:22
your cat may well be there
12:24
or you might go to near where you live
12:26
and see your cat and then you'll know
12:28
that it's cheating on you
12:29
and someone else has been posting
12:31
pictures of your cat
12:33
but that's clever right so he's not
12:34
posting pictures of actual people
12:36
because that would be a bit creepy but
12:37
he's just posting pictures of their cats
12:39
wasn't it the case that one of the
12:40
greatest hackers that the internet has
12:42
ever seen
12:43
was caught and they tried to break into
12:45
his system to work out
12:46
uh just to get into his computer see
12:48
what he'd done and they're like oh he's
12:49
gonna have the most intense pass
12:50
whatever
12:51
and it turned out his password was his
12:53
cat's name and one two three four
12:56
yeah scientists in japan have studied
12:59
cats recently
13:00
and they found that they do recognize
13:03
their owners voices
13:04
but they then choose to ignore them
13:06
[Laughter]
13:08
so they test it they they played the cat
13:11
a recording of
13:11
the owner shouting the cat's name and
13:13
then they played another recording of a
13:15
stranger shouting the same cat's name
13:16
they found that the cats have a much
13:18
greater response to the owner
13:20
shouting their name than to a stranger
13:21
but they still do not get up
13:23
[Laughter]
13:28
but dogs are catching up online right in
13:30
the last couple of years i think dogs
13:32
have become
13:33
as prevalent online whereas cats used to
13:35
be much better and i think the idea is
13:37
that um
13:38
the age of the smartphone has meant that
13:41
is more friendly to dogs because
13:42
smartphones
13:43
i am told are good at videos and
13:46
streaming them and dogs are a bit more
13:47
video friendly
13:48
so cats are very image friendly because
13:50
they are still for 99.9
13:52
of the day but now we can actually do
13:55
the video thing and post that up easily
13:57
and watch it then dogs work better and
13:58
so now it's about 50 50 in terms of how
14:00
how many are being posted respectively
14:02
i did not know that was the reason
14:04
that's interesting it's a theory
14:06
there is that place where you can feed a
14:08
cat that's four thousand miles away
14:09
can't you
14:10
oh yeah oh that site yeah you guys might
14:12
have heard of this there's a webcam set
14:14
up for a cat sanctuary in
14:16
i want to say russia and you can move a
14:18
toy remotely
14:19
and you have to wait for ages in a queue
14:21
while other people get to move the toy
14:23
around remotely
14:25
we did it at the office we're not there
14:26
that day i was yeah yeah that was
14:28
a very long afternoon um so i was
14:32
looking into all these
14:33
dot something sites uh as we say like
14:36
dot cat things get misappropriated for
14:39
the country that they're meant to
14:40
represent
14:41
so obviously.xxx is for
14:44
um porno websites and that one is not a
14:47
country
14:47
obviously um or if it is
14:51
i wanna go there sometime i don't know
14:53
married have a kid
14:56
but uh xxx is one that is allowed
14:59
because what they want to do is try and
15:00
separate the porn so that you can
15:01
actually identify it the problem is no
15:03
one's using it because then people can
15:05
say you're definitely using porn
15:06
as opposed to a dot com you could just
15:08
say oh no i thought it was for people
15:09
who are
15:10
30. and
15:14
roman that's
15:17
that's true so uh anyway but there's
15:20
other ones dot ac
15:22
is the ascension islands they have a
15:24
population of 806
15:26
and that's used largely for academic
15:28
websites.hc
15:29
it's also used for and i had no idea
15:31
this was a big thing
15:33
air conditioning industries they it's a
15:35
huge
15:36
thing air conditioning industries and
15:37
they they use ac
15:39
dot l a is for lao or laos
15:42
um and that's being properly marketed as
15:45
for los angeles
15:46
to use that um and then i found dot tv
15:49
and i remember dot tv is a famous one
15:50
because it's tuvalu so i looked at
15:52
there's a list you can see the most
15:53
famous
15:54
dot tv websites that you can get and i
15:56
found last night and i was up because
15:58
i've got i've just had a son so i was up
16:00
at um about 3 a.m after feeding him
16:02
uh with a bottle and my wife was asleep
16:04
and i was doing research for tonight's
16:05
show
16:06
and i found right there up on the list
16:09
there's all these different
16:10
tvs hamsterporn.tv oh daniel
16:15
and i saw it and i thought there's no
16:17
way i'm not clicking that
16:18
so so i clicked on
16:22
it and i was brought to hamster porn tv
16:25
and annoyingly it was just a regular
16:28
human
16:29
porn site there were just a bunch of uh
16:31
must have been really annoying it was
16:33
super annoying
16:33
so it's all these just screen grabs of
16:36
videos of humans
16:37
um doing porn and as i was looking
16:40
through it and just slightly upset
16:42
my wife woke up
16:43
[Laughter]
16:46
and she looked up and she saw the screen
16:48
and she looked at me and went
16:50
what are you doing are you looking at
16:52
porn and i said
16:53
no honey sorry i thought it was going to
16:55
be a sign of hamster porn
17:02
and she literally said nothing and
17:05
turned around in the bed and went back
17:07
to sleep
17:08
i can't believe you have roped us all
17:10
into your lie here dan
17:13
a week on friday you're gonna make your
17:15
wife listen to it and go see
17:18
the new top level domains though just to
17:20
get nerdy that's a new thing so the dot
17:22
xxx is a new thing
17:23
um and so it used to only be your
17:25
country the dot coms the dot co dot uk's
17:28
but now we can register stuff
17:30
at things like there's a big long list
17:31
you can read but dot hair
17:33

18:33
to see you need to see me to see you
18:36
thank you james yes we should move on
18:39
um it is time for fact number three
18:43
and that is chozinski yeah my fact this
18:46
week is that
18:46
when walmart opened in germany it
18:49
scrapped its policy of making employees
18:52
smile at customers because the germans
18:54
found it too weird
18:59
this is a genuine problem so walmart
19:01
started opening up stores in germany in
19:03
1998 and they ended up in 95 stores
19:05
opening and it was just a disaster
19:07
really and
19:08
germany didn't really get along with
19:09
walmart very well and one of the main
19:11
reasons
19:11
was this these golden walmart rules that
19:14
they have in america
19:15
and they are if a customer comes within
19:17
10 feet of you you have to smile
19:19
sweetly and offer help and this is known
19:21
as the 10-foot rule
19:23
and other things like if a shopper made
19:26
a complaint it needs to be dealt with by
19:27
sundown that's called the sundown rule
19:30
and customers bags have to be packed at
19:32
checkout
19:33
and it turned out they did this in
19:34
germany um and they did various like
19:36
studies researchers looked at how it was
19:38
playing and it was playing badly
19:40
so smiling was interpreted as flirting
19:42
or creepy
19:44
and um the head of the walmart trade
19:46
union
19:47
said in germany just said germans don't
19:49
behave that way
19:50
we don't we don't do the smiling and
19:52
then the biggest german research
19:54
institute said
19:55
in germany if people try putting stuff
19:57
in a bag for you
19:58
the customer will just think hey i just
20:00
paid for that that's mine what are you
20:01
doing putting it in a bag
20:03
um so it didn't work and it was just
20:05
very interesting so they had to cancel
20:06
the
20:07
the policy just because it's very
20:09
different customer service
20:10
in america to outside of america it
20:12
turned out amazing
20:14
i don't think of germany as being
20:15
unsmiley though yeah i think it's that
20:16
america is very smiley
20:18
yeah the 10-foot rule thing yeah does
20:21
that apply even if there's a
20:22
like a shelf in between you
20:25
and the customer oh yeah yeah you have
20:28
to run all the way around
20:31
yeah and so walmart's not in germany
20:33
anymore is it no
20:34
they all closed down um i read one other
20:36
thing that they thought
20:37
maybe was one reason why it didn't work
20:40
and that is because walmart employees
20:41
are required every morning to stand in
20:43
formation and chant
20:45
wal-mart yeah
20:48
and they thought maybe the germans
20:50
didn't really like standing in a row
20:52
chanting things for obvious reasons
20:56
they also they would always make them do
20:58
the charm which was like give me a w
21:00
w give me an a a um and apparently lots
21:04
of staff used to just hide in the
21:05
toilets for that part as
21:06
i think a lot of us would um if you were
21:09
forced to do that every day
21:10
and also they had to chant every morning
21:12
at the morning meeting at the end of
21:14
every meeting the boss would say
21:15
who is number one and all the staff
21:17
would have to chant the customer of
21:18
course
21:20
so i think staff spent a lot of time in
21:21
the bathrooms
21:23
imagine going to work and just chanting
21:26
no such thing as a
21:30
[Laughter]
21:34
in fact that goes for all three of you
21:36
may i say
21:39
so in some countries i read the new york
21:40
times said the the
21:42
they've had trouble in various places uh
21:45
in korea
21:46
apparently they ran into trouble because
21:48
they had taller racks than those of
21:50
local rivals
21:51
and so it was just a bit harder to reach
21:53
this stuff and customers would have to
21:55
get on ladders
21:56
so i was like oh maybe the average
21:57
height and career is a bit shorter i
21:59
looked it up
21:59
koreans are exactly the same average
22:01
height as british people so
22:03
it just apparently they slightly
22:04
overshot the shelf height in walmart
22:06
yeah but walmart's ladder sales went
22:09
hugely through the road
22:11
it is like a cult though i was reading a
22:13
um a blog by
22:14
a guy called uh sorry andy a blog is
22:17
where
22:19
people just put thoughts and stuff yeah
22:21
i was reading a blog by an ex walmart
22:23
employee who was saying that they get
22:24
really obsessed with box cutters
22:26
so they get given a box cutter when they
22:28
join as a member of staff
22:29
this is in america and he said staff go
22:31
ape for these box cutters
22:33
um and every uh staff meetings they
22:36
would have sam walton
22:37
trivia contest now sam walton is the guy
22:39
who founded walmart
22:41
i don't know how much trivia that is
22:42
about sam walton but apparently enough
22:44
to have a trivia quiz on him
22:45
every staff meeting and where the answer
22:47
is always sam welton
22:50
yeah is sam walton the best person ever
22:52
yes correct
22:54
walmart and then the winner of that quiz
22:58
who clocked onto that would get a
23:00
slightly better box cutter
23:02
and then this member of staff said they
23:04
used to taunt
23:05
the other staff with their slightly
23:06
better box cutters but that's quite
23:08
aggressive yeah with a knife
23:10
[Laughter]
23:12
oh my mom
23:15
so i was looking at um like smiling
23:18
around the world happiness with
23:19
different countries
23:21
you always get these things where all
23:22
the countries are ordered by how happy
23:24
they are don't you and usually the same
23:26
people in like costa rica or something
23:28
um but denmark has won it for the last
23:30
few years and this year they were beaten
23:32
by norway
23:33
into second place but actually the guy
23:37
in charge of happiness in denmark said
23:39
he was he was
23:40
very happy for them
23:45
lying bastard he said we don't have a
23:48
monopoly on happiness wow
23:50
that's i mean but that's the ultimate
23:53
happy sentence to lose the happiness
23:54
competition
23:55
that's almost we're gonna have to take
23:57
the prize off you that guy just went
23:59
uber happy
24:00
that since yeah and that's obviously why
24:02
he did it the cynical bastard
24:04
he said he said that and then he went
24:05
are we back at the top spot yeah
24:07
great um in um
24:10
where mcdonald's opened in russia in
24:12
fact where um
24:13
you know the service industry has
24:16
slightly different cultural norms
24:17
um staff were taught how to smile the
24:19
russian staff were told how to smile
24:20
because it's not a particularly normal
24:22
thing
24:22
and actually there was a study that was
24:24
done looking at how different countries
24:25
view smiling
24:26
and in russia most people view someone
24:29
who smiles a lot as quite stupid
24:31
whereas in america and actually in
24:33
britain we view them as a bit more
24:35
intelligent in fact if someone smiles at
24:36
you and they engage with you
24:38
um it all depends i would say on context
24:42
if there's someone smiling at you on the
24:44
bus
24:46
and they won't stop it is true though
24:50
actually in russia because my wife's
24:51
russians so i go to russia occasionally
24:53
and they just
24:54
don't smiling photographs um they do a
24:57
bit now but in the olden days they
24:58
really wouldn't smile in photographs
25:00
and it was very much frowned upon
25:04
oh i'm sorry
25:08
i i almost bottled out of that joke
25:11
and i thought there's nowhere to go with
25:12
it but it is actually true it is
25:14
um yeah if you see old pictures of
25:16
russians from the even from the 80s and
25:18
90s they're just very
25:20
yeah american americans used to be
25:21
really serious they used to have a
25:23
reputation for being serious until the
25:24
mid 19th century
25:25
really yeah well didn't so i was just
25:27
thinking of the very old photos that
25:29
used to get taken when nobody's smiling
25:31
and
25:31
um you often read that and the reason
25:33
that no one's smiling is because they
25:35
uh that just was the thing you just
25:37
don't smile i didn't realize it's
25:39
because of the long exposure of the
25:40
photo
25:41
so it takes so long for the photo to be
25:44
taken
25:44
and you don't know exactly what point
25:46
it's going to be you just had to keep a
25:48
normal face i mean not in the 1980s
25:51
camera technology had come quite long
25:52
yeah no i mean the you know the super
25:54
old school um
25:56
uh we're talking like i guess uh the you
25:58
know bc
26:00
yeah before cameras yeah
26:05
but so because yeah it was just the
26:07
exposure was too long so to hold a smile
26:09
to
26:10
hold the cheese it would be so long that
26:12
you would just look
26:13
pained and it would be yeah i have read
26:15
a debunk of that actually just for the
26:17
record that maybe the exposure wasn't
26:19
quite as long as we thought maybe it was
26:20
only about 30 seconds and anyone can
26:22
hold a smile for 30 seconds but i don't
26:23
know
26:24
no but they were just getting used to
26:25
smiles back then so it would have felt a
26:26
lot longer
26:28
yeah um they could have had a happiness
26:30
hat this was something in the news a few
26:31
years ago
26:32
and the happiness that was a hat
26:34
obviously and it was made of metal
26:37
and it had like these kind of metal bits
26:39
coming down the side and then it had a
26:40
metal spike
26:41
and whenever it sensed that you were
26:43
frowning it would stab you in the head
26:45
with a spike
26:46
i remind you to smile oh god really
26:49
sorry
26:49
which shopping chain was this
26:53
where was this uh it was just one guy
26:56
who invented it already
26:58
but he hit the news yeah wow
27:01
um should we move on to our final play
27:02
yeah we should okay it is time for our
27:04
final fact of the show
27:06
and that is my fact my fact this week is
27:08
that
27:09
it is really easy to beat chimpanzees
27:13
at the game rock paper scissors
27:17
yeah they're it it's chimpanzees
27:20
have recently
27:21
been taught to play stone paper scissors
27:23
rock paper scissors rush ambo whatever
27:25
you call the game
27:26
and um they actually i
27:29
you know the flip side is they actually
27:31
know how to play stone paper scissors
27:33
it's amazing
27:34
and they can learn it to the level of
27:36
what a four-year-old would learn it
27:38
so you could actually at the moment
27:39
they've only been playing with computer
27:41
simulations so playing against a
27:42
computer or an ipad
27:44
but if you were to play them you could
27:46
actually have a genuine game
27:48
with the movements of rock paper
27:49
scissors and beat them the reason you
27:51
can beat them is
27:52
they're really bad at learning from
27:53
their mistakes so whereas four-year-olds
27:55
will make a mistake and go i need to
27:57
adjust chimpanzees will be like
27:59
i'll use paper again and and then
28:02
afterwards when they're beaten again
28:03
they'll be like i'll go for paper this
28:05
time
28:07
and then when you beat them again like
28:08
ah he's not going to see what's coming
28:10
next
28:11
good old trusty paper and
28:14
then if i was playing against them i
28:16
might think they're not going to be
28:17
stupid enough to go for paper again
28:20
so i would probably lose you're still
28:22
sore about the match you lost a couple
28:24
weeks ago
28:25
actually they're a lot better than you'd
28:26
think then
28:28
it's interesting because it took them a
28:30
hundred the chimpanzees to learn they
28:32
tried i think on seven chimpanzees and
28:33
five of them managed to master it
28:35
uh it did take them a hundred days to
28:37
learn it
28:38
yeah so it's a very very long time for
28:40
them to learn their ideas it's a simple
28:42
game
28:43
i mean i i don't want to brag but i got
28:44
it in about 30.
28:46
anyway but the really tricky thing that
28:48
the uh the chimpanzees didn't get was
28:50
the circular nature of it
28:51
so they understood rock beats scissors
28:54
and then they understood okay scissors
28:55
beat paper but they found it hard to get
28:57
their head around
28:57
paper then beats rock really that makes
29:00
it even more weird that they went for
29:01
paper every time
29:06
but actually i'm with them why does
29:08
paper beat rock i mean i know it covers
29:09
it
29:10
you wrap is it
29:13
i mean scissors is actually demolishing
29:16
the paper isn't it
29:17
yeah and then rock is demolishing the
29:19
scissors yeah but if you hide a rock in
29:21
some paper you can smuggle it into a
29:23
recycling bin
29:28
got it yeah in japan it's a
29:31
tiger a village chief and the village
29:34
chief's mother
29:35
what right and that's that circular
29:38
thing so the village chief's mother
29:39
kills the village chief because she's
29:40
angry with him
29:41
um the british chief kills the tiger and
29:43
the tiger kills the village chief's
29:44
mother
29:45
um do you know the indonesian version
29:48
ant
29:48
human elephant so the human
29:51
tramples the elephant uh the
29:58
those tiny elephants they have in
30:00
indonesia
30:01
i think i got confused between ant and
30:04
elf
30:05
and yeah and it it me sorry
30:08
the human tramples the ant the human
30:11
tramples the end
30:12
then the elephant squashes the human but
30:14
then the ant beats the elephant
30:17
tramples it yeah
30:20
is that the um the ant gets into the
30:22
elephant's ear and it tickles it
30:26
really i read that the ant crawls up the
30:28
elephant's trunk and eats its brain
30:30
maybe i have sick i had parental guide
30:33
lock
30:34
on
30:37
it's so i am very confused by the chimp
30:39
fact i didn't realize they were less
30:40
good than us because there's no such
30:41
thing as being good at rock paper
30:42
scissors
30:43
there is no strategy you can't learn
30:45
from your mistakes because
30:46
we all basically make the same mistakes
30:48
and we can't really predict each other
30:50
particularly i mean if you're really a
30:53
pro
30:54
if you maybe you've obviously not been
30:55
on the rock paper scissors website
30:57
they have a lot of tactics on that one
31:00
thing is
31:01
if your opponent pays scissors in the
31:03
first go you can tell by how
31:04
wide their scissor is what they're going
31:06
to do in the next go no
31:09
well no you can't i mean they say you
31:12
can
31:13
they have another apparently this is a
31:15
trendy strategy
31:16
it's the exclusion strategy okay so you
31:20
never play say rock
31:21
and you keep doing different ones you
31:22
keep doing paper or scissors and your
31:24
opponent just gets obsessed by the fact
31:27
that you've never played rock and
31:28
it just with their mind that's
31:31
great that's a good idea right dude
31:32
that's the trendy strategy it's a trendy
31:34
one that's how to be cool
31:36
as someone who subscribes to
31:37
rockpaperscissors.com
31:39
you don't actually have to subscribe to
31:41
a website you can just
31:44
you can just go there and then go away
31:47
some of them you do like hamsterporn.com
31:52
uh children are very hard to play at
31:53
rock paper scissors
31:55
they're very good at playing it because
31:56
their choices are genuinely random
31:58
yeah they haven't yet mastered the
32:02
gambits that james is discussing so
32:04
they're much likely
32:05
just to go with whatever and that makes
32:07
them quite hard to beat right yeah that
32:09
makes a lot of sense
32:10
yeah you don't want to overthink it hey
32:12
i found a cool thing out
32:13
about chimpanzees um chimpanzees could
32:15
recognize each other by face
32:17
uh like like we do um but
32:21
if they're just walking along and a
32:22
chimpanzee's facing the other way
32:24
and the butt is showing they'll see the
32:27
butt and be like
32:28
greg they they have an understanding of
32:31
of
32:32
bums that they can just if you put like
32:35
a lineup of
32:36
bums in front of them they'd be like
32:38
mark sonia
32:41
chimp alice are is it like were any of
32:44
these people the people who pickpocketed
32:46
you the other day
32:47
mrs chimp and then she's like that that
32:49
bum there
32:50
yeah yeah it's good because once you've
32:51
robbed someone you run away don't you so
32:53
you're likely to see the back
32:55
yes exactly oh there was i heard an
32:57
amazing
32:58
uh burglary burl grower
33:03
burgle robbery robbery
33:07
we did the audio book the other day for
33:09
the book that we've done
33:10
and it took forever for me to say basic
33:12
words like that
33:13
the best one was when you misread
33:15
february as january
33:17
it was truly bizarre yeah yeah so um
33:21
there was this fact that we got we found
33:22
the other day which is that
33:24
a burglar is always most likely going to
33:27
knock on your door before they burgle
33:29
you
33:30
isn't that weird is that so they can
33:32
check if someone's in yeah yeah
33:33
basically yeah
33:34
you're gonna get robbed they're just
33:35
always gonna knock first like in a
33:37
polite
33:38
fashion as opposed to just breaking a
33:40
window or whatever yeah i don't think
33:41
it's not a politeness that they're doing
33:42
it but yeah
33:45
is that so have you read the thing about
33:47
chimps that they according to the new
33:49
york times
33:50
have the ability to cook if only someone
33:53
would give them an oven
33:55
this is what scientists i'm like that
33:59
this is something that scientists have
34:00
just concluded and they did this in a
34:02
study where the researcher involved said
34:04
we invented a magic cooking device
34:07
to test it on the chimps uh as he
34:09
explained it it's two plastic bowls
34:11
and the chimp puts a raw potato in one
34:13
of the plastic bowls
34:14
and then in the other one there's a
34:16
cooked potato and you maneuver the bowls
34:18
to make the chimps think that
34:20
his raw potato has been cooked why this
34:22
guy didn't just use the already existing
34:25
oven that we have i don't know but it
34:27
turns out that chimps do prefer
34:30
if you give them a bit of raw potato
34:31
they prefer to put it in the plastic
34:33
bowl that will then magically cook the
34:34
potato
34:35
and then to eat the cooked potato than
34:37
just to eat it raw
34:38
and so that kind of shows that chimps
34:40
have self-control
34:41
like they're willing to postpone the
34:43
potato to make it taste nicer
34:45
and also according to the scientists who
34:47
did the experiment said
34:48
it shows they have the causal
34:50
understanding to make the leap to
34:51
cooking
34:52
which i would argue believing that
34:53
you're putting a raw potato into a
34:55
plastic bowl
34:56
and then leaving it for 10 seconds
34:57
before getting a cooked one
34:59
is not having the causal understanding
35:01
yeah that's true i didn't know they
35:02
preferred cooked food
35:03
yeah i needed to die there you go but i
35:05
don't know how my microwave works
35:07
if you told me that some scientists just
35:09
replace it with a risotto
35:13
i'll buy it okay should we wrap up
35:16
okay that is it that is all our facts
35:18

00:09
came out last thursday
00:11
it's called the book of the year the
00:12
weirder side of 2017
00:14
and it was a very exciting day last
00:16
thursday we saw it rise up in the charts
00:18
in amazon and that's all down to you
00:19
guys and it was incredible seeing all
00:21
the tweets of pictures and so on of
00:23
everyone with their copy
00:24
we've been working on it for this entire
00:26
year and it was really an amazing day
00:28
yeah we basically spent the whole day
00:29
refreshing amazon once after another
00:31
just seeing it
00:32
go up and then down a bit and then up
00:33
again and then down a bit yeah james is
00:35
right because it has gone down a bit
00:37
it's gone down quite a lot it's gone
00:38
down too far for our liking
00:39
if you could help it get back up just
00:41
right back to like say like number five
00:44
or four in the charts we would love you
00:46
forever
00:47
yeah we're not that greedy are we we
00:48
like jamie oliver
00:50
has written a great book great book
00:52
that's fine he can have number one
00:53
that's fine yeah we don't need number
00:54
one david williams
00:56
written some really great books if he
00:57
wants to be number two that is
00:58
absolutely fine
00:59
go for it but then three i refuse to let
01:02
nigella once again dominate number three
01:06
um and yeah and if you haven't bought it
01:08
yet and you do
01:09
think you might like to buy it please do
01:11
it this week even you know
01:12
it gives us a chance of actually hitting
01:14
the charts and a podcast book hitting
01:16
the charts would be something amazing
01:18
and
01:18
not really ever seen before so if we
01:20
could ask you once again to mobilize and
01:22
get out there
01:23
or get just on your computer and go to
01:25
amazon it's six pounds only
01:27
that's that's nothing that's six pounds
01:30
yeah that's a lot okay um that's too
01:33
much
01:34
i got another option you might be the
01:36
kind of person who doesn't like books
01:38
i doubt it because why would you be
01:39
listening to us but you might not you
01:41
might not be able to read
01:42
if you can't do that then maybe you want
01:44
to get our audio book
01:45
that is called the audio book of the
01:47
year and it is
01:49
exactly what it sounds like it is the
01:50
book of the year but in audio
01:52
and then it's got loads of extra jokes
01:54
that we made and we spent three days in
01:56
the studio just basically messing around
01:57
didn't we
01:58
yeah it's 10 hours of podcast and you'll
02:00
notice that
02:01
i cannot speak properly in sentences in
02:04
it
02:04
and actually we probably mispronounce
02:06
pretty much every foreign word
02:08
in there yes we did our best we did our
02:09
best yeah but get the book and you don't
02:12
have to hear
02:12
our linguistic mess-ups yeah you can
02:14
imagine our voices in your head when
02:16
you're reading it yes
02:17
and if you have bought it you can do as
02:19
one more favor and that is go onto
02:20
amazon and leave a review
02:22
yes yeah there's a five-star option we
02:24
we're not gonna say you should
02:25
definitely
02:26
use that one but it's it's a popular
02:28
option uh
02:29
in our office okay i'm with the podcast
02:36
[Music]
02:42
[Applause]
02:45
[Music]
02:47
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:50
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
02:52
this week coming to you from the comedia
02:54
in
02:55
bath
03:00
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
03:02
here with anna chazinski
03:04
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
03:06
and once again we have gathered around
03:07
the microphones with our four favorite
03:09
facts from the last seven days
03:11
and in no particular order here we go
03:13
starting with you
03:15
james harkin okay my fact this week is
03:18
that it's easier to speak
03:19
dutch if you're drunk
03:23
as in if you're a non-native speaker
03:25
yeah if you're dutch
03:28
you tend not to have too many problems
03:30
in general if you're dutch yeah
03:32
and you can't be absolutely hammered you
03:34
have to be very slightly one
03:36
pint kind of drunk and this is a study
03:38
that's been done recently
03:40
um they got 50 native german speakers to
03:43
talk to a dutch person in dutch and then
03:46
they recorded it and they asked some
03:48
dutch people afterwards how did they do
03:50
and the drunk people did a little bit
03:51
better but unfortunately i did read on
03:54
reddit someone posted on reddit
03:56
that dutch is basically like a german
03:58
got drunk and can't speak properly
04:00
anymore
04:02
there's a lot of there's a lot of
04:04
slurred sounds in this fleshly or
04:06
leisure
04:08
i didn't know you speak and you're not
04:09
even drinking
04:11
does anyone here speak dutch
04:14
wow have another drink and then see
04:19
because i wonder if it's slightly by
04:21
accident that when you're drunk you're
04:22
just a bit more confident and you you're
04:24
saying
04:25
work because they've had words that are
04:26
actually quite similar to english so
04:29
the the word for apple is apple
04:32
um the word for pear is pear
04:36
wait someone does speak it down there
04:38
who's who's saying as i said are you
04:39
you've gotten what i'm doing now he just
04:41
owns a
04:42
he owns a green grocers in antwerp
04:45
i think that person has just understood
04:46
the admittedly complex joke that you're
04:48
doing
04:48
yeah i know but yeah it wasn't
04:52
so much remembering the words as much as
04:54
they had better fluency and better
04:56
pronunciation
04:57
that's what people said and weirdly the
04:59
people themselves didn't think that they
05:00
were doing any better you would think if
05:02
you're drunk you have a bit more bravado
05:03
but they didn't really have that
05:05
the people themselves thought i'm doing
05:07
okay but actually the dutch people and
05:09
that's amazing
05:10
but dutch people are so english
05:13
proficient
05:13
yeah about 90 of people in the
05:15
netherlands speak really good english
05:17
so it's quite hard to get conversations
05:20
with people
05:20
in dutch i went there earlier this year
05:22
and as soon as you open your mouth and
05:23
try
05:24
to say hello or something i was you know
05:26
apple
05:27
yeah you spotted a mile off and they
05:30
immediately say
05:31
oh hello how are you doing what would
05:32
you like you want an apple do you want a
05:34
pink lady or a russet and it's very hard
05:35
to
05:37
but actually this study was um it was
05:40
german speaking dutch
05:41
but actually there was a 1972 study
05:44
which showed that americans could speak
05:46
thai a bit better if they were a bit
05:48
drunk really yeah
05:50
i speak mandarin much better when i'm
05:52
drunk and i speak i do speak mandarin i
05:55
grew up in hong kong
05:56
um and yeah i do notice that when i'm
05:58
drunk i'm just i'm
05:59
awesome at it there's no anecdote with
06:02
that i just want to sort of big up
06:04
my language speaking ability has anyone
06:06
else ever noticed that about you or is
06:08
it just that you think
06:09
no i just tell it to people who don't
06:10
speak bad to it i'm like whoa i am
06:11
kicking ass right now in my mandarin
06:13
but i couldn't know because i was really
06:15
bad as a kid i was the only kid in my
06:17
year that when i went back to school
06:18
had forgotten his name in chinese
06:23
so is that your name in chinese oh
06:26
yeah no that was my big name at school
06:28
this is so bad i was called so my name's
06:30
dan
06:30
obviously i was called dan dan at school
06:32
and i thought that was a really cool
06:33
nickname
06:34
because everyone knew my nickname and i
06:35
was like wow that's so cool
06:37
they'd be like older kids hey dan dan
06:39
and i only found out it was about six
06:41
years ago i was living in
06:42
england i was in my late 20s and um
06:45
someone on
06:45
i put on facebook saying dan dan just
06:48
won a game against an old hong kong
06:49
friend and someone wrote haha dan dan
06:51
you know that means testicles in chinese
06:53
right
06:55
and i had no idea no one told me i wrote
06:58
to my friends at
06:59
school but my old school friends i was
07:01
like did you know it's called balls this
07:02
whole time
07:03
and they're like yeah did you not know
07:07
it's a whole childhood i thought i was
07:09
cool it was just a boy called
07:10
balls and a boy called bowls who forgot
07:13
his name every holiday
07:14
yeah and genuinely i would sit in class
07:17
and i would be sweating because they'd
07:18
be doing the roll call and i'm just
07:19
saying
07:20
i have no idea what my name is and when
07:22
it gets to it and then there was one
07:23
time that i thought my name was sierra
07:25
boar but i thought it was uh
07:26
lorebor which is radish so then i just
07:29
got called radish balls or something i
07:31
guess
07:31
[Laughter]
07:33
so it's hard so i'm very proud when i
07:35
get drunk and remember my mandarin
07:37
i think we say remember your name i'm
07:40
always impressed by that
07:42
but getting drunk can improve your
07:44
skills in various ways can't it
07:46
so the uh uh snooker player bill
07:49
verbaniuk um how how do you know nick
07:53
nick verbenk like who's counting um
07:59
[Laughter]
08:02
um he used to get really drunk so he
08:04
used to have six to eight pints before a
08:06
match
08:07
and then he would have won during each
08:09
frame during
08:10
the match and that made him play better
08:12
and everyone does always think that they
08:13
play a bit better after a
08:14
few points after a few maybe but not
08:17
after how many do you say
08:18
six to eight before a game and then
08:20
during the game how many frames are
08:21
there i presume there must be only about
08:22
three well in the
08:23
um in the world championship final which
08:25
he never reached i don't think that i
08:26
think there's like 34 or something
08:28
okay i can see why he never reached
08:31
that stage um
08:34
but also the world anti-doping agency
08:38
bans alcohol from just five sports so it
08:40
bounces
08:41
from five sports motor racing
08:44
motor racing is one of them yes uh so
08:47
motor racing power boating
08:48
air sports uh auto racing
08:52
motorcycle racing so you can see why it
08:54
bands drinking in those it's a bit
08:55
dangerous and archery
08:57
and actually the reason it bans archery
08:59
is that there was a study done in 1985
09:01
that found that drinking a little bit
09:02
makes you slightly better at archery and
09:04
it's considered cheating
09:06
yeah so that's why that strongbow guy's
09:09
so good isn't it
09:13
um so in 2008 um the dutch
09:16
voted the word of the year now all
09:18
countries do this a lot of countries do
09:20
this every year
09:20
but in 2008 the word of the year in
09:23
dutch was
09:24
swaffalen okay and according to
09:26
wikipedia swathland means
09:28
to hit one's penis often repeatedly
09:31
against an object
09:35
didn't they start doing that there was a
09:37
trend for swafflin in the netherlands i
09:39
think
09:39
there was in april it started in april
09:41
2008 when a dutch student committed the
09:43
act on the taj mahal
09:46
yeah now that i mean that's not cool is
09:50
it i don't know
09:51
i don't think it is
09:55
i've never known what's cool but
09:58
i've given a list that'll be low down it
10:00
um they've got
10:02
the words in dutch are so amazing and
10:04
they they do similar to germa which has
10:06
a lot of these compound words you know
10:07
we just strap words together like a
10:09
glove is a hand shoe
10:10
um which which i think is cool
10:15
um so porcini mushrooms and i'm going to
10:18
mispronounce this
10:18
are ichurnya's brood which literally
10:21
means little squirrel's bread
10:23
yeah sweet um peanut butter is
10:26
pindercus or peanut cheese
10:29
slightly less appealing um and oh
10:32
see if you can guess this is a mule pier
10:35
a mouth pair
10:36
do you mean pear as in two or something
10:38
no i mean pear is in dan's
10:41
it's a slap in the face yeah as it was
10:44
for you guys just now when you realize
10:45
what it meant
10:47
wow you know the uh little squirrel
10:49
bread thing though
10:50
so i think that's pronounced acorn
10:53
and it's good that we don't have any
10:54
dutch speaks in the audience so you
10:56
can't correct me
10:57
um but which is very confusing
10:58
apparently because it's pronounced the
10:59
same as acorn so the word for squirrel
11:02
in dutch is pronounced the same as the
11:04
word for acorn in english
11:06
yeah that must be hard for cannibal
11:08
squirrels
11:10
well they don't get caught i suppose
11:12
because they just say i'm going out to
11:13
eat an ankle
11:14
and their mates go yeah fair enough and
11:15
then they eat their brother
11:18
i found the word it's um it's finnish
11:20
but this is just a
11:22
great description of um a word that
11:24
means a lot and it's a
11:25
finnish word about being drunk
11:30
that is the feeling when you're going to
11:31
get drunk home alone in your underwear
11:33
with no intention of going out
11:37
wow so you just go i'm just gonna have a
11:39
culturally on it
11:40
tonight guys yeah it does make it sound
11:42
like a choice which is nice
11:46
true did you know i mean this is so off
11:49
topic but
11:50
i read a study this week that said that
11:53
if you refer to yourself in the third
11:54
person is a great way to de-stress
11:57
so if you're stressed out instead of
12:00
going oh my god i'm really
12:01
really scared about this show i've got
12:03
to do tonight in bath where i haven't
12:04
done any prep for it
12:06
then all you need is like
12:09
random example all you need to do is you
12:11
step back and you go
12:12
anna's really worried about a show she
12:14
has to do to sorry james is really
12:16
worried about a show he has to do
12:17
tonight
12:18
and if you talk to yourself in the third
12:19
person it destresses you
12:21
and it genuinely works i do that quite a
12:23
lot you do
12:24
i've heard you do it yeah you always go
12:26
ah james yeah
12:28
yeah you sound very stressed when you're
12:29
doing it you're always like oh james you
12:31
idiot
12:32
that's what i do yeah james is going to
12:34
lock you in the
12:36
cupboard it's i'll be honest
12:38
it's pretty messed up
12:43
i'm not stressed though you're not
12:46
james isn't stressed that's what you say
12:49
i'll say what i want
12:54
daniel is scared so
12:57
um here's the thing about the dutch
12:58
language oh yeah and there was a guy
13:00
called johannes goropius bikanus
13:03
and he thought that dutch was the
13:05
original language in the whole world
13:08
okay and his logic behind this was that
13:11
the word
13:11
adam sounds a bit like the dutch words
13:14
heart
13:14
damn which means damn and hate
13:18
okay and eve sounds a bit like you
13:21
that meaning the eternal barrel okay
13:25
and he thought that these two names were
13:28
originally dutch and therefore
13:29
dutch was the language of the garden of
13:31
eden and therefore dutch is the original
13:33
word and then everyone just kind of
13:34
stole words from them
13:36
wow that is a desperate man who has too
13:38
much time on his hands
13:40
he also thought that antwerp was founded
13:42
by noah's
13:43
kids after the big flood they decided to
13:46
go to this place which is basically
13:48
below sea level
13:50
[Laughter]
13:52
but on noah's ark there would have been
13:54
some ant so maybe
13:56
they said oh we'll name the city after
13:57
whatever gets off first and then the
13:59
ants got off first
14:00
sure i mean i i sounded i'm reaching
14:03
here as well
14:04
i read a i read a great fact about adam
14:06
and eve the other day
14:07
um which is that they they weren't
14:10
really humans
14:11
because they were prototype humans so
14:13
they were actually garden vegetables
14:15
both of them so if you look at old
14:20
if you look at old drawings of them um
14:23
they're like
14:23
they're like um groove in um in
14:26
guardians of the galaxy like tree-like
14:28
characters dan can i
14:30
can i just take you back to the
14:31
beginning of this
14:33
bit of yours where you said i've read a
14:35
great fact
14:36
yeah but no no it's because it's like
14:40
it's a fact that someone
14:42
and and and myself believe that that is
14:46
and so check this out as well because
14:47
they were because they were root
14:49
vegetables and they were like
14:50
they they didn't they didn't have sex
14:52
with each other but they had to
14:54
procreate and secret societies are
14:56
looking for what is known as a lost word
14:58
because this it's a lost word and
15:00
they're searching it for it because
15:02
it's said to be so powerful that if said
15:05
to the face of a woman
15:06
it would instantly impregnate her
15:11
that was the worst minute of my life
15:15
my god so i was reading some real facts
15:18
about language learning um
15:21
no the economist did this thing where
15:23
they went in search for the hardest
15:24
language to learn and it's really
15:27
interesting it tells you loads of cool
15:28
stuff about various languages
15:29
but they concluded that the hardest
15:31
language to learn is this language
15:32
called
15:33
tu yuca which is spoken in the the
15:35
eastern amazon i think
15:37
and the hard thing about that which i
15:38
think would be a particular problem for
15:40
us
15:40
and for you is that it the verb
15:43
endings on statements require you to
15:46
show
15:47
how you know something so if you state a
15:49
fact
15:51
in the verb ending you have to say how
15:54
you've known it
15:55
so like the way this is there is there
15:57
an ending for according to secret
16:00
societies
16:03
i think they'll add that so there's no
16:06
to yucca full citation needed
16:08
doesn't they don't need it that's so
16:10
cool yeah so so like the the phrase for
16:13
the boy
16:13
played soccer i know because i saw him
16:16
play soccer
16:17
is the played would be a different word
16:19
too the boy played soccer
16:20
i know because i read about it in a book
16:22
or on wikipedia
16:24
or from a mad person on the street
16:29
all right it is time for fact number two
16:31
and that is my fact
16:32
oh god yeah and
16:35
and the word facts is brought to you
16:37
very loosely today
16:40
uh so my fact is that american president
16:44
calvin coolidge used to ride a robot
16:47
horse
16:47
inside the white house three times every
16:50
day
16:53
isn't that extraordinary and how did you
16:55
learn this
16:58
i was talking to a root vegetable who uh
17:02
so calvin coolidge 30th president of the
17:05
united states of america
17:06
rode horses there's a surprising amount
17:08
of presidents who ride horses but calvin
17:10
coolidge was allergic to horses
17:12
so he was built this mechanical horse
17:15
that sat inside the white house and he
17:18
thought it was a joke that it was being
17:20
given to him but he tried it out and he
17:21
really loved it
17:22
and it had two different options of it
17:24
one was gallop and one was cantor
17:26
and he used to dress up as a cowboy
17:28
every time he got onto it
17:30
um sometimes just the hat and totally
17:32
naked um no
17:33
yeah yeah you like being naked a lot
17:35
calvin coolidge um and
17:37
get this check this out chew on this
17:39
murray the
17:42
the the horse was invented
17:46
by john kellogg who invented kellogg's
17:48
cornflakes
17:50
yeah he was outside of kellogg's
17:52
cornflakes he invented a lot of
17:54
things the the mechanical horse he
17:56
invented this really cool thing for if
17:58
you're getting too
17:59
hot in bed it was a tent just for your
18:02
head
18:02
that led to a sort of tent pipe that
18:04
went outside your window
18:06
so it just and you can see you can see
18:08
pictures of it online yeah you know how
18:10
like there's
18:11
sometimes windows just have a fan that
18:13
like sends out that little yeah it was
18:14
exactly like that
18:16
and so you see pictures of people laying
18:17
in bed with just the tent
18:19
door open so they haven't zipped up and
18:21
um just getting cooled
18:22
i like that idea yeah he invented the
18:24
mechanical horse as you say he also
18:26
invented a mechanical camel
18:28
uh which was pretty much the same
18:30
actually it was just had a hump
18:33
uh he invented a kneading machine in
18:36
which you would lie on it and mallets
18:37
would pummel your bladder and intestines
18:41
and a colonic machine for enemas and
18:43
they would fire gallons of water up your
18:45
rectum
18:46
gallons yep gallons
18:49
no no followed by eight ounces of yogurt
18:53
afterwards that's quite a lot of yogurt
18:55
as well shy it's not gallons
18:57
no no no no um and i've seen a picture
18:59
of it and they have multiple
19:01
kind of bits coming out so it was for
19:03
more than one person at once
19:04
no yeah so you know how you don't like
19:06
to sit even with us on a train
19:08
the yes yeah imagine if we had to hang
19:11
out while we were all having eight
19:13
gallon enemas
19:14
[Laughter]
19:15
my imagination was shut down but horse
19:19
machines were quite a big deal because
19:20
horse riding everyone did it before the
19:21
motor car so there were lots of horse
19:23
riding exercise machines and then when
19:25
bikes came along in the 19th century
19:27
then cycling machines became a big thing
19:29
and i found an article on
19:31
timeline which is a really great website
19:33
by the way and it's from a magazine
19:35
called the rambler in 1897
19:37
and it's this description of something
19:39
that had been invented which was
19:41
a stationary bike so it's a bicycle that
19:43
has all the delights of outdoor cycling
19:45
enjoyed at home
19:46
and it was invented by a painter and
19:48
what he'd done is he painted
19:50
an enormous roll of outdoor scenery and
19:54
he'd rigged it up to his cycling machine
19:56
and he's he's attached the canvas to
19:58
rollers and as he cycled
19:59
the scenery rushes past him that's
20:01
amazing wow exciting outside
20:04
because you can buy cycling machines now
20:06
where you can see on a video like
20:08
the tour de france or whatever wherever
20:09
you're going so this is basically that
20:11
this is that that's very cool i found a
20:13
really similar thing okay so i think the
20:15
the treadmill one of its first uses was
20:18
for horses
20:19
as in they were they were four horses to
20:21
exercise before they were for people to
20:22
exercise
20:23
really yeah um so case in point the
20:26
queen
20:26
last year bought a treadmill for all of
20:29
all the queen's horses but not all the
20:32
queen's men
20:34
um she's got a treadmill that 18 horses
20:36
can
20:37
walk or run on at the same time and i
20:40
think the big question is
20:41
could they put humpty together again
20:44
um but there were there were theatrical
20:46
shows in london
20:47
where they they would have live horses
20:49
on stage
20:50
in theaters in drury lane so they would
20:53
have a massive stage obviously and then
20:55
they did a huge spectacular show in 1902
20:57
which was
20:58
i think it was ben hur it was a biblical
21:00
epic and they had a massive
21:02
treadmill and they had about a dozen
21:04
horses on stage
21:05
running galloping on a treadmill wow
21:09
yeah
21:09
while they wound a massive panorama
21:11
beside
21:12
like a chariot race wow very cool
21:15
yeah that's insane that is really good
21:17
the exercise horse
21:18
since we're in bath i should say that
21:20
the exercise horse is mentioned in jane
21:22
austen
21:23
um yeah is it yeah it sure is it's in
21:26
sanderson the novel that she didn't
21:28
finish
21:28
um but yeah she mentioned an exercise
21:30
horse and basically in her day what it
21:32
was was a chair which had a lot of the
21:33
springs on it
21:34
and so you bounced up and down on it
21:37
like a trampoline it was a trampoline
21:38
chair
21:39
i found out a couple of facts about
21:40
calvin coolidge oh yeah oh yeah so he
21:42
was famously a very quiet
21:44
man and he became even quieter and i
21:45
have one anecdote about him here so this
21:47
is during the presidential campaign in
21:49
1924
21:50
he was found found out by a reporter who
21:53
said to him
21:54
mr president what do you think of
21:56
prohibition coolidge said
21:58
no comment will you say something about
22:00
unemployment
22:01
no the reporter pressed on he said will
22:04
you tell us your views about the world
22:06
situation
22:07
no about your message to congress
22:10
no and the reporter just started to
22:12
leave and then coolidge said
22:14
wait and the man turns around and called
22:16
and says don't quote me
22:20
that's good apparently he would always
22:23
he wouldn't let his
22:24
children eat dinner unless they were in
22:26
full tuxedo
22:28
what yeah apparently and one night his
22:31
son came
22:31
home a little bit late he'd been out
22:32
playing and he was a little bit late for
22:34
dinner
22:34
and he said oh why do i really need to
22:37
dress up can i not just go and eat
22:38
dinner in this and they said young man
22:40
tonight you are having dinner with the
22:42
president
22:44
we've mentioned him haven't we a few
22:46
times on the podcast he um
22:47
he used to like to play little pranks so
22:49
he used to do a thing where when he was
22:51
in the oval office
22:52
he used to press an emergency buzzer
22:54
that meant the secret service would rush
22:56
in because there was an emergency
22:57
but he would press it and quickly hide
22:59
underneath the desk
23:01
and they'd come in looking for the
23:02
president and be like oh jesus he's gone
23:04
and uh yeah well he loves to sleep so
23:06
maybe he was just taking a nap
23:08
uh one other famous thing about him was
23:09
that he slept 11 hours a night and then
23:11
he took
23:12
frequent naps and long naps during the
23:14
day and there's something people knew
23:15
about him
23:16
so he said nothing and also he was
23:17
unconscious most of the time
23:19
and one of my favorite people ever
23:22
dorothy parker
23:23
the you know excellent witty literary
23:26
figure
23:26
of his time said when she heard about
23:29
his death when someone told her he had
23:31
died
23:32
she just said how could they tell
23:35
that's what he was famous for when he
23:36
was awake he was a bastard i have to say
23:38
this
23:38
um when he went fishing he went fishing
23:40
a lot when he was awake and
23:42
he insisted that his secret service men
23:43
bait his hook for him
23:45
okay fine i mean it's it's a bit
23:48
hoity-toity but whatever but then
23:50
as the secret service guys were baiting
23:52
the hook he would jerk the fishing rod
23:54
and try and spear them in the finger
23:56
with the hook
23:57
and he really enjoyed it he told people
23:58
how much fun it is to do that does sound
24:01
like
24:01
fun oh do you think
24:04
like when it's how long ago was college
24:06
100 years or so
24:08
20s yeah so like now we kind of hear all
24:12
the fun stories of the things that he
24:13
did do you think we'll hear fun stories
24:15
in 100 years time about the current
24:17
president
24:18
we're hearing them now
24:19
[Laughter]
24:21
um he it's quite sweet his relationship
24:22
with his wife who was famously
24:25
a really outgoing gregarious person
24:27
she's called grace
24:28
and so he was the absolute opposite of
24:30
her and the way they met
24:32
was when uh she was reading law and
24:35
she saw him shaving in his house so he
24:37
was in his bathroom having his shave
24:38
and his window was facing out into the
24:40
street and he was wearing just his
24:41
underwear with his suspenders around his
24:44
waist
24:44
you know like braces not female
24:46
suspenders um
24:47
suspenders around his waist and he was
24:49
wearing a bowler hat
24:51
and so she saw him and laughed as he
24:54
would
24:54
and he looked round out of his window
24:56
saw her tipped his hat
24:57
and went back to shaving and that was a
24:59
starter relationship
25:01
yeah i was looking at other historical
25:03
ways of
25:04
exercising and losing weight yeah and i
25:07
found one online called the hallelujah
25:09
diet
25:10
and apparently for the hallelujah diet
25:12
you have to ask yourself what would
25:13
jesus
25:14
eat okay
25:17
and so the idea behind this is that
25:19
jesus if he was around now
25:21
would probably be a vegetarian probably
25:24
wouldn't drink
25:25
you know he'd have quite a good diet and
25:26
they stress on their website it's not
25:28
about saying what people
25:29
actually at in the time of jesus because
25:32
according to them
25:33
they obviously didn't have a great diet
25:35
as jesus was constantly healing the sick
25:40
you know that um jesus has a house
25:42
waiting for him if he does come back in
25:44
bedford
25:47
so there's the um the garden of eden is
25:50
said to be in bedford it's not eden
25:52
again
25:54
this is why this is by a thing called
25:55
the panacea society and they believed
25:57
that the garden of eden was in bedford
26:00
and so they set up the society to make
26:03
sure because if jesus came back for some
26:04
reason he would go back to bedford
26:06
and they bought a house for him which
26:07
was a sort of semi-detached i think
26:09
um not even a detached house maybe it
26:11
was a detachment no it's nice
26:14
humble son of a carpenter wouldn't live
26:15
in a detached house would he
26:17
i've seen this place and it's a it's an
26:19
end terrace in fairness but it's a town
26:21
right okay yeah i would say that's
26:22
semi-detached and end terrace
26:24
oh yeah okay but i also think that's why
26:26
he's not coming back he keeps on going
26:28
what kind of property have you got lined
26:29
up for me
26:30
it's still the old terrace house in
26:31
bedford i'll stay up here
26:34
yeah i think they rented out to families
26:36
but if he does come back i think there's
26:38
a policy that he
26:41
i don't know if they know that imagine
26:43
the family receiving the phone call
26:45
hello yeah mr sanderson you are not
26:47
going to believe this
26:48
but it's hard to believe that jesus
26:51
would turf out a family from the house
26:54
well he turned out the pharisees from
26:55
the temple
26:57
he was a turner router anyway we need to
27:00
move on guys
27:01
all right it is time for fact number
27:04
three
27:05
and that is chozinski
27:09
my fact this week is that a member of
27:11
iceland's pirate party
27:13
just injured her eye and had to appear
27:16
on tv
27:17
wearing an eye patch
27:20
this is the nicest of all pirate related
27:22
stories because it would be harrowing to
27:23
hear she'd lost her lower leg and had to
27:25
have a peg leg
27:27
that's true it would have been awkward
27:28
if you guys had laughed at that but
27:30
fortunately it's just a kind of
27:31
innocuous injury
27:32
um her one-year-old child scratched her
27:35
in the eye
27:36
so she had an injured eye she wore an
27:38
eye patch in this debate
27:39
and she clarified that it was not an old
27:40
sea injury because the icelandic pirate
27:43
party
27:43
are not about old sea pirates they're
27:46
about more modern stuff
27:47
yeah they're quite popular aren't they
27:49
yeah they are popular there was a time a
27:50
couple of years ago where they were the
27:51
most popular party in iceland i think
27:53
and now they're the third biggest yeah i
27:56
think in the last elections they might
27:57
have got about 14
27:58
yeah yeah wow um but yeah icelandic
28:02
elections
28:03
they're really into them so the last
28:05
election was last year
28:06
and the government keeps collapsing
28:09
it's like it's like saying that we're
28:10
really into referendums
28:13
it's not that they have a lot it's just
28:15
that they like them when they happen
28:17
so in 2016 the turnout was 76 percent
28:20
which is the lowest turnout ever an
28:22
icelandic election
28:24
wow which is quite impressive um and
28:26
that was despite 10 percent of the
28:27
country in iceland was away watching the
28:29
euros
28:30
in the last election i think um when it
28:33
happened
28:34
yes so i was reading an ama on reddit by
28:37
the pirate party
28:38
and they were asked about piracy and
28:40
basically their idea is
28:42
they think that everyone should be
28:44
allowed to do whatever they want on the
28:45
internet like just copy whatever they
28:46
want
28:47
and all that kind of thing and they
28:48
don't think that should be copyright
28:49
rules and they were asked on this reddit
28:51
ama whether they think they'd be
28:53
actually able to do anything
28:55
uh because other countries like the us
28:57
or the uk
28:58
have their copyright rules and surely
29:00
iceland wouldn't be able to do anything
29:02
about that
29:02
and they admitted yeah okay maybe we
29:05
won't be able to do anything about it
29:06
they said no country is an island in a
29:08
globalized world
29:09
not even iceland which really is an
29:11
island
29:14
um i was confused about this fact when i
29:16
read it because i thought oh that's so
29:18
ironic
29:19
when i read it and then so a member of
29:21
iceland's pirate party
29:23
yeah and then i thought hang on is it
29:25
ironic and
29:26
i couldn't work it out and i was too
29:28
embarrassed to ask anyone um
29:30
so i googled if it was ironic and
29:33
i found a website which if anyone else
29:35
suffers from not knowing if things are
29:37
ironic
29:38
you can now go to is it ironic.com
29:42
and it's just anna going no no
29:46
and then dan and alanis morissette
29:48
constantly submitting requests
29:54
resubmitting saying isn't it though
29:56
[Laughter]
29:57
yeah so you just it's just lists of
29:59
things where people are going
30:01
is is this or is this not ironic just a
30:03
couple and i and i put your fact up as
30:05
well to see
30:06
and it's got 50 50 at the moment so the
30:09
people vote on it yeah people vote on it
30:11
so
30:11
um katniss from the hunger games is
30:13
injured by getting burnt after becoming
30:15
dubbed
30:16
the girl on fire is it ironic 75
30:20
say it is not ironic yes torch tower in
30:22
dubai
30:23
caught fire i think all of these things
30:27
are ironic
30:27
but different there are different
30:29
meanings of ironic guns won't be allowed
30:31
come on there's situational irony
30:33
there's dramatic irony
30:36
yeah go on give it give us another one
30:39
no uh guns won't be allowed at trump's
30:41
nra speech
30:43
that is ironic yes 63 agree with you the
30:46
people are with me guys
30:48
that's not ironic that's a sensible
30:50
precaution
30:50
[Laughter]
30:52
just on uh iceland quickly um iceland
30:56
has so many as you say scandals
30:58
political scandals so the
30:59
the last prime minister had to resign
31:01
because his
31:02
uh he was caught up in the panama papers
31:05
which meant he'd basically been hiding
31:06
an enormous amount of money offshore
31:08
um which you'd think the pirate party
31:10
would be fond of but
31:13
[Music]
31:17
they weren't happy
31:20
but basically when that came out when
31:23
that story broke
31:24
the number of people who protested was
31:25
nearly 10 of the entire population
31:28
as in 10 of the entire country in
31:30
basically one square
31:32
wow yeah was it the same 10 who went to
31:34
the euros i think it must have been yeah
31:36
they just love to travel yeah um it's
31:39
big pirate news
31:40
this week i think or certainly in the
31:42
last two weeks uh the pirate party just
31:44
came third in the czech
31:45
elections and they got their most votes
31:48
um that any pirate party has ever got in
31:50
any election
31:51
so it's big news that um they've been a
31:54
party for less than 10 years so they're
31:56
doing really well
31:58
and as part of their campaign they
31:59
kick-started a solar-powered pirate boat
32:02
to do all their campaigning um despite
32:05
the fact that the czech republic is
32:06
landlocked
32:08
is that ironic anna it's funny i'll take
32:12
it
32:14
in taiwan the pirate party wasn't
32:16
allowed i think
32:18
so um in 2012 there was an application
32:21
to
32:21
name a political party the pirate party
32:24
um and it was rejected by the ministry
32:26
of interior
32:27
due to bad connotations um because
32:30
pirates
32:30
aren't known as good people well there's
32:33
a lot of pirates in the
32:35
straits around indonesia and
32:36
singaporeans yeah and
32:38
so the ministry of interior said that we
32:40
think there might be confusion and
32:41
people might
32:42
think that you are real pirates so they
32:44
were told not to do it
32:46
but do you guys know so you know the
32:48
pirate accent
32:51
yes thanks to them what's up with these
32:54
guys um
32:56
do you know where that comes from the
33:00
uh somerset everyone everyone went from
33:02
some set in devon ran away to see
33:03
that's exactly what it is it's not what
33:05
it is it was popularized in the 1950s by
33:07
a guy called robert guy newton who was a
33:09
hollywood actor at the time
33:10
and he was the person who was in pirates
33:13
of penzance i think and he
33:15
played pirates in a few films and he was
33:17
from devon and he just decided i'll just
33:19
really up my devin accent
33:21
and so he did that being a pirate and
33:23
then people decided that
33:25
that was what pirate sounded like that's
33:27
where it comes from that'd be a damned
33:28
lie
33:31
but actually pirates they came from all
33:33
over the place didn't they and
33:34
apparently i read an article that says
33:36
the most number came from london
33:38
so really the more correct uh pirate
33:41
accent would be kind of a
33:42
cockney-ish accent with a load of vows
33:45
and these and
33:46
isn't that what johnny depp has in uh
33:49
what does he have it's a keith richards
33:51
accent is that yeah is that cockney yes
33:53
yeah i think so
33:54
yeah that's good yeah it's kind of
33:56
extremely accurate movie
33:58
and i met uh the lady who does the
34:00
costumes for pirates of the caribbean
34:02
last year
34:02
and she says they always bring a um some
34:05
wire wool
34:06
to make all of the costumes old because
34:09
you can't buy old clothes
34:11
well you can you can buy your clothes
34:13
wow
34:14
james that is a very elitist thing to
34:17
think
34:19
wow i mean have you seen what i'm
34:21
wearing i obviously don't believe it
34:23
um yeah no but as in um 17th century
34:27
kind of well-worn those those have
34:29
mostly run out
34:30
in the shops now i currently do that to
34:33
most charity shops do not have a long
34:35
17th century line
34:38
yeah someone's grandpa's grandpa's
34:40
grandpa's grandpa's grandpa died
34:42
and this is in their attic um
34:45
so can you think of a pirate who went to
34:47
eaton
34:49
um not a trick question oh gosh
34:52
i'll tell you so teddy captain hook did
34:55
he captain hook isn't
34:56
he's an altertonian no there were really
34:58
yeah in the first ever play of peter pan
35:01
uh is made very clear that um he's he's
35:04
we went to eaton
35:05
that's what so that's what jm barry says
35:06
that's what james barry says in the
35:08
original play in the actual
35:09
play of peter pan captain hook's final
35:11
words are floriat etona
35:13
which is the school motto
35:19
and so there was a letter to the times
35:21
in the 1930s
35:22
and it said sir i see that the term
35:25
pirate is being applied to the class of
35:27
person who owns a wireless set
35:29
without paying for a license is this not
35:32
a misnomer of a too flattering nature
35:35
unlawful though it might be piracy has
35:37
at least the merit of some romance
35:39
and has in the past called forth
35:41
qualities of courage and even courtesy
35:44
the person especially in these hard
35:46
times who listens without paying for a
35:48
license
35:49
displays none of the daredevil virtues
35:52
of a pirate
35:54
he is a sneaker and the term wireless
35:58
sneak would be more appropriate
36:00
that's amazing signed james hook eaton
36:03
college
36:07
um last year the largest salmon caught
36:10
in iceland was called by eric clapton
36:12
ah sorry i i knew we were way off
36:16
the iceland thing i know but i just had
36:18
to mention that
36:19
hang on clapton the eric clapton i'm
36:22
sorry to say but i actually called
36:24
the lake that that happened at and
36:27
it turns out that it was the biggest
36:28
salmon at the specific lake
36:30
but not for all of us who'd have thought
36:33
that dam would be the arbiter of what
36:35
was true
36:39
how do you phone a lake
36:43
they've got one of those novelty shell
36:45
phones
36:49
that is great fact-checking that's
36:51
pretty empty fact-checking that's the
36:52
most fact checky i've ever had
36:54
in my life all right we need to move on
36:57
to our final fact of the show
36:59
and that is andy my fact is that the man
37:02
who invented email
37:03
later changed career to become a sheep
37:05
semen importer
37:09
which one of those two things has taken
37:11
off
37:12
um yeah who is this he was called ray
37:14
tomlinson and he's the man who invented
37:16
email
37:17
i mean he later became a miniature sheep
37:19
breeder but that involved the
37:20
importation of a lot of
37:22
uh of sheep he wasn't just randomly
37:23
imparting it just
37:26
sorry when you say a managed sheep
37:27
breeder was he very small no he was
37:28
massive
37:29
he was muscular he was just he was a
37:31
human
37:33
he was a normal man so but he was a
37:36
great man because he invented email
37:38
and he is the guy who picked the at sign
37:40
uh
37:41
for the email address yeah and it was
37:43
very very clever because
37:44
it basically meant you could send an
37:46
email to
37:47
any computer and it was it was outside
37:50
a network basically so we know what
37:53
email is mate
37:55
but this is before the world wide web
37:57
isn't it yeah exactly
37:58
so you've got yeah you don't have a way
38:00
of doing it and um
38:02
it's very weird because until he
38:04
invented email
38:05
basically the previous means of doing it
38:07
was you had to leave a message on the
38:08
same computer
38:10
and then someone else had to log in to
38:11
see what the message was
38:13
and that was email before him yeah which
38:15
is not a convenient thing obviously
38:17
so you would you would write the email
38:19
on your computer
38:20
yeah mail your computer to the person
38:25
dear amazon i would like to buy a pair
38:26
of your socks yeah and then you'd have
38:28
to
38:28
send a computer yeah they would yeah
38:30
okay do you know how um brian blessed
38:32
tweets
38:35
very loudly in capitals he has his
38:39
tweets
38:39
facts to him so and then he receives his
38:43
tweets by fax
38:44
he reads through them he calls his agent
38:47
he
38:47
answers it over the phone and his agent
38:49
takes a note of it
38:51
and then types out all the tweets at the
38:53
end of the day
38:54
to send back out um so the app symbol
38:57
seems to be the thing that ray tomlinson
38:58
gets asked about
38:59
the most right and i think it's weird
39:02
that we don't have a name for the at
39:03
symbol in this really we call it the
39:05
amphora
39:06
uh but no well we all call it the app
39:09
yeah
39:10
show of hands who calls it the amphora
39:14
i've never seen fewer hands go off in a
39:16
room
39:17
but you can get me on podcast amphora
39:19
qi.com that's what i would say
39:21
but no all of the countries call it
39:22
something interesting so i think in um
39:25
is it in spain or is there chocola which
39:27
is a little snail
39:28
in russia it's the word for dog uh in
39:31
norway
39:32
it's called the sign of the meow which
39:34
maybe is to do with the tail
39:36
it looks like a cat curled up with its
39:37
tail there's a cat curled up
39:39
um so the um at the moment the movement
39:42
of semen the import and export in the uk
39:44
uh is sorted out by the eu
39:47
by the ballet directive imagine sorting
39:50
that out
39:51
no i mean i just mean the rules
39:55
uh yeah the rules for literally for
39:57
listeners at home daniel's doing some
39:58
really gross miming
40:01
but i don't think anyone's talking about
40:03
how this is going to affect it after
40:05
brexit
40:05
are they i'm just talking i'm not but
40:08
this is really important because you
40:10
need to import semen from different
40:12
countries
40:12
otherwise all of your livestock is in
40:14
bread yeah yeah
40:15
um because like for instance in america
40:17
they're importing a lot of b seamen
40:19
at the moment because they're sorry b b
40:23
yeah so their bees are really struggling
40:26
they're all dying and they need
40:27
a new bit of um genetic material
40:30
and so they get the b seeming in from
40:32
other countries and then they inseminate
40:34
them into the bees but
40:36
it's quite difficult if you get it
40:37
through customs because they don't often
40:39
see b semen coming through
40:41
you're looking at me like i'm making
40:43
this up how do you i didn't know bee had
40:45
bees had semen
40:46
they do so each male produces one
40:49
microliter
40:50
to put that into some kind of
40:51
perspective a single drop of water
40:54
is 100 microliters so you need a hundred
40:57
bees to produce enough semen to be like
40:59
the one drop of water
41:01
what's the purpose of that that fact i
41:03
don't know what's the purpose of getting
41:04
the hundred bees together
41:06
and ah yeah
41:09
imagine being invited to that party
41:12
as a bee is it i wanna know how they
41:14
collect it because the ways of
41:16
collecting semen as a farmer
41:17
are they're quite interesting there's
41:19
one guy
41:21
basically one man one man
41:24
with tiny fingers is it
41:27
is it donald trump
41:29
[Laughter]
41:32
no it's michael weight 53 from scotland
41:36
okay uh he's one of the few beekeepers
41:38
who is
41:39
uh inseminating queen bees by milking
41:42
the bees and
41:43
i've seen a footage of it you just have
41:44
to squeeze the abdomen very gently
41:48
what comes out because in um so in
41:50
farming of larger animals then they have
41:52
dummies don't they so they have dummies
41:54
of use so
41:55
for instance bull semen it fertilizes 75
41:59
of the cows in this country i think uh
42:01
because it's just much easier it's more
42:02
complicated you mean it's important
42:05
what fertilizes the other 25 percent of
42:07
cows
42:10
there's a special word that you say
42:16
sorry importable semen
42:19
imported bull semen that comes in vials
42:22
uh
42:22
fertilizes dairy cows um but you need to
42:24
be able to
42:25
collect it um and so you sell dummies
42:28
and you can look up
42:29
you know dummies online and you can buy
42:31
dummy sows for instance that you can get
42:33
pigs to mount because you need
42:35
artificial you need pig semen to be
42:37
imported as well
42:38
and it's really hard to collect because
42:42
you have to get literally in there so
42:44
you've got the dummy sow
42:46
but you have to swoop in there at the
42:47
last minute with your cup to collect it
42:50
and that's why it's much more convenient
42:51
to use a dummy because with a natural
42:53
sour it moves around the pen quite a lot
42:55
and so you have to chase it around
42:56
because of the dummy it stays still at
42:58
least but this is how a lot of farm
43:00
animals
43:00
are inseminated yeah there is another
43:02
method which is that
43:04
some males then mount other males and
43:07
the other males are called teasers
43:09
okay and then they're interrupted at the
43:11
last minute by a man with a rubber tube
43:14
oh my god who volunteers for that job i
43:17
don't think i think it's paid
43:23
um guys we need to wrap up in a sec have
43:26
you got anything before we do
43:27
i have something on sheep breeding oh
43:29
yeah uh alexander graham bell
43:31
was into sheep reading um he noticed
43:34
that some sheep had more nipples than
43:36
others
43:37
and he tried to systematically breed
43:40
sheep with each other to get
43:41
more nippled sheep and he
43:44
wrote a paper in science in 1904 called
43:48
the multi-nippled sheep of ben
43:50
bray okay and he managed to eventually
43:53
they don't talk about this when they're
43:55
talking about the phone
43:56
do they he eventually yielded five and
43:58
six nippled sheep
44:00
uh and he thought that by if they have
44:02
more nipples they'd be
44:03
um more fertile uh but he was wrong
44:06
about that
44:07
they just had more nipples
44:11
everyone knows the first phone
44:12
conversation don't they you know dr
44:14
watson come here i want you but no one
44:16

44:17

01:53
[Applause]
01:55
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:59
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
02:01
this week coming to you from the glee
02:03
comedy club in cardiff
02:08
uh my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
02:10
here with anna chazinski
02:12
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
02:14
and once again we have gathered around
02:16
the microphones with our four
02:17
favorite facts from the last seven days
02:19
and in no particular order
02:21
here we go starting with you james
02:24
okay my fact this week is the oldest
02:26
surviving suttie puppet has just been
02:28
bought at auction
02:29
and it was bought by sotty
02:33
no yeah it was by the new guy richard
02:36
cadell who's in charge of suttie at the
02:38
moment
02:38
and he um whenever he bidded for it he
02:41
bitted it with suttie on his hand
02:45
wow that is great that's very cool
02:49
so it's like sooty's emancipated himself
02:53
yeah cool it's actually more like he
02:55
sold himself back into slavery
02:59
oh yeah okay
03:03
get this when they were on television
03:04
together [ __ ] and sue were never
03:06
allowed to touch each other
03:07
in case things got too steamy
03:14
uh yeah so this is this is true city and
03:16
sue when sue was introduced
03:18
there was a worry at the bbc that this
03:21
would introduce a sexual element
03:23
and too much sexual tension to the show
03:25
and so she was only allowed in on
03:27
sufferance
03:28
that she never touched him and that he
03:29
never touched her they didn't speak to
03:31
her beforehand and then go this is what
03:33
you're not allowed to do right
03:34
well no for international listeners
03:36
they're both glove puppet bears so
03:37
like it's it's easy to enforce but
03:40
actually sue is a panda and pandas
03:42
aren't bears
03:44
oh so there's a certain amount of
03:47
inter-species stuff going on there yeah
03:49
true wow
03:50
oh no wasn't she
03:54
was she voiced by the wife of the person
03:57
who did susie yeah harry corbett's wife
04:00
played her but then harry corbett's son
04:03
took over the role but his mum
04:05
stayed playing the girlfriend
04:09
but it was it was an unusual setup yeah
04:12
i think he actually replaced her didn't
04:13
he his daughter replaced her
04:15
quite quickly um and said he didn't want
04:18
her playing sue anymore maybe because of
04:20
that
04:20
and also apparently the person who took
04:22
over playing sue said
04:23
she was getting a little bit older and
04:25
she was finding it a little bit harder
04:27
to read a script watch a monitor
04:29
work a puppet and smoke a cigarette all
04:31
at the same time
04:35
very uncomfortable for parole too but
04:38
this the the
04:39
sort of worry about sexuality this was
04:40
in 1964 just so you know and
04:42
that got so serious that the director
04:45
general of the bbc
04:46
intervened personally this went all the
04:48
way to his desk
04:49
and he he called the host in and said
04:51
i'm allowing it but then two years
04:53
later they canceled the show and it went
04:54
to itv who didn't care
04:58
did they touch each other uh well then
05:00
they went to channel 4 and it got
05:01
extremely stingy
05:02
[Laughter]
05:06
so did actually once have a pregnancy
05:08
scare
05:11
she had a pregnancy to get although it
05:12
turned out she just had a cushion up her
05:13
jumper so
05:16
simpler times imagine if you went to
05:19
your gynecologist and said
05:21
i think i'm pregnant and they
05:29
what the [ __ ] are you doing here and
05:32
then i took my feet out of the stirrups
05:33
and i've been a good day
05:37
but the um the team america guys got in
05:39
trouble for their puppet sex scene
05:41
properly didn't they um so they had to
05:43
re-edit the sex
05:45
scene in team america nine times and
05:47
resubmit it to the motion picture
05:48
association of america
05:50
to say is is this okay yet because the
05:53
you know film association was saying we
05:54
can only classify team america as
05:57
um in america i think it's uh nc 17
06:00
which is the rating that means that no
06:02
under 18 year olds are allowed to go and
06:03
see it
06:03
just because these two puppets have sex
06:06
um
06:06
which and as as i think trey parker
06:09
pointed out
06:10
it doesn't make any sense our characters
06:11
are made of wood and have no genitals
06:14
and yet it is a very it's a very rude
06:17
scene
06:17
yes yeah did you have to go with your
06:20
mom
06:24
this is like watching the study show all
06:26
over again
06:31
mighty morphin power rangers got banned
06:33
in malaysia
06:34
because the morphine bit sounded too
06:36
much like morphine
06:39
they were famously sluggish weren't they
06:45
yeah were you guys in the uk you had
06:47
ninja turtles
06:48
um which is what i call them yeah you
06:51
called them hero turtles didn't you oh
06:53
yeah
06:53
yeah because they thought that you
06:56
weren't able to
06:56
deal with nunchucks basically but they
06:59
still had the nunchucks
07:00
no no they just i looked at a picture
07:02
today because i had no idea that this
07:04
was the case so michelangelo instead of
07:05
having nunchucks
07:09
he just has a nice cup of tea yeah he's
07:11
like that guy looks like he needs a hug
07:13
from the hug turtle
07:16
yeah it was really he hit no he had i
07:18
mean
07:19
i mean that really they did yeah really
07:20
they changed it so he just had a
07:21
grappling hook
07:22
so my memory is him having nunchucks no
07:26
in the opening scenes there's a couple
07:28
of seconds of nunchucks and then if you
07:30
look at the pictures maybe it was only
07:31
for a few episodes maybe they brought it
07:32
back but he has
07:33
a grappling hook well you can do a lot
07:35
more damage with a grappling hook
07:36
i know it's got spikes on the end yeah
07:38
yeah so um
07:40
peppa pig uh this year i think or quite
07:42
recently was banned in australia
07:44
uh just one episode it was and it was
07:47
the episode where peppa is taught that
07:48
spiders are very small and can't hurt
07:51
you
07:54
it gets loads of complaints peppa pig
07:56
though for being a bad influence on
07:57
children
07:58
and some of the things that parents have
08:00
said about it have written and said a
08:01
father
08:02
wrote in to the people who make it and
08:03
complained that his son has started
08:05
splashing in muddy puddles on the way to
08:08
school
08:08
i know but no apparently that's bad and
08:11
another mother wrote in and said she'd
08:13
ask her daughter what she wanted for
08:14
breakfast and she said chocolate cake
08:16
and another said his son has stopped
08:18
eating cucumber and tomato sandwiches
08:20
and these results are like terrible
08:22
parents
08:24
yeah hey we need to move on to our
08:25
second fact it is time for fact number
08:27
two and that
08:28
is andy my fact is that mountains are
08:31
partly shaped by
08:32
salmon wow what
08:36
wow this is true this is absolutely true
08:38
salmon played a significant role in the
08:40
shape of mountains
08:41
it happens over a long period of time
08:44
obviously but
08:45
uh so salmon swim up a stream to spawn
08:48
and then
08:48
as they do so the female kind of stirs
08:50
up the mud and the sediment at the
08:52
bottom
08:52
when she's making a kind of nest in the
08:54
water and um
08:55
that means that the river channels erode
08:57
faster and it means they are downstream
08:59
faster
09:00
and over hundreds of thousands of years
09:01
a landscape where salmon
09:03
spawn could be up to 30 percent lower
09:06
than a landscape with no salmon wow yeah
09:09
that's
09:09
amazing um there's a thing that one of
09:12
uh our friends at qi mentioned the other
09:13
day actually which is that they're
09:15
paint thinking of painting mountains
09:17
white so
09:19
this is yeah have you seen this it's in
09:20
the peruvian mountains this is a guy
09:22
who's going around painting them white
09:24
yeah to combat global warming not just
09:26
one guy with one paintbrush though
09:29
it's pretty much slightly and to begin
09:31
with i mean because to begin with
09:32
everyone thought he was nuts and he said
09:34
because all the ice and all the snow had
09:36
gone off it and so it just was bare
09:38
mountains and he went oh i'll save the
09:40
ice and snow by painting it white again
09:42
to look like it has ice and snow that's
09:44
not why he's doing it that's not what
09:45
he's doing i stopped reading the article
09:46
there
09:47
okay so he's not gone i'll save these
09:49
mountains from not being covered in the
09:51
snow by making it look like they've got
09:52
snow on them maybe that'll convince them
09:54
it's um too it's so that it keeps the
09:58
surface cooler because uh if you've got
10:00
a white surface then it keeps the flux
10:02
yeah so i think uh the average rock cut
10:04
that's covered in white paint is like
10:06
17 degrees cooler than um if it's got
10:09
black paint and then the idea is that
10:10
the ice will stay on it for longer and
10:12
then it can
10:13
give everyone water in nearby villages
10:14
and keep the vegetation growing
10:16
yeah mountain painting didn't he win a
10:17
nobel prize for that
10:19
um i don't know maybe he did read the
10:22
article then
10:23
no i definitely should have thought yeah
10:26
he got some kind of a like maybe like a
10:28
nickelodeon or kids award or something
10:30
like that
10:30
[Laughter]
10:31
yeah and the tallest mountain in
10:34
colorado
10:35
okay is called mount albert and
10:38
it's next to another mountain called
10:40
mount massive
10:41
um and mount massive is 12 feet
10:45
shorter than mount albert okay i think
10:48
they're the third and fourth or the
10:50
second and third biggest mountains in
10:51
the whole of america
10:53
but they're next to each other and a lot
10:55
of there are a lot of fans of mount
10:57
massive
10:57
and what they like to do is go to the
10:59
top of mount massive and put a big pile
11:01
of stones on the top so that it becomes
11:03
the biggest oh but then mount helbert
11:06
has quite a few fans as well and they
11:07
keep going up
11:08
and taking all the rocks down
11:12
wow wow that's so cool colorado is
11:16
boring
11:19
here's another fact mountains can suffer
11:22
from tired mountain syndrome
11:24
um so this has happened around the world
11:26
in lots of different places but at the
11:27
moment it's happening in north korea
11:30
and they have a mountain called mount
11:31
mantap and due to all of the
11:34
nuclear tests there basically there's a
11:36
load of geological damage
11:37
and the rock mass inside the mountain
11:40
just isn't kind of integral anymore
11:42
did you say it's called mount mantap yes
11:45
i heard that that sounds like how kim
11:46
jong-un refers to his penis doesn't it
11:48
[Laughter]
11:50
[Music]
11:54
this made me think about other syndromes
11:56
there might be
11:57
so this is um tired mountain syndrome
11:59
just a few that i found online
12:01
floppy trunk syndrome that's the thing
12:04
that elephants can get
12:05
these are all very sad by the way these
12:07
are you know this is not like a happy
12:09
flop
12:11
which is another kim jong-un derived
12:13
term
12:15
um berserk llama syndrome that's the
12:18
thing
12:19
if you're um if you human raise a llama
12:21
they go crazy and they attack the humans
12:24
uh wobbly hedgehog syndrome
12:28
again it's not a very nice thing if
12:29
you're the hedgehog but it is if you're
12:31
reading the words on the internet
12:34
and there's a guy who was diagnosed with
12:35
chronic lateness syndrome
12:38
this is incredible this is a real thing
12:40
apparently it's a bit like adhd and it
12:42
means that he can't properly gauge how
12:43
long things take
12:44
so he's late for absolutely everything
12:46
kidding come on
12:48
i've used this excuse so many times and
12:51
no
12:51
it is it is a real thing it's very funny
12:53
you mentioned that james i because i
12:54
found out about chronic related syndrome
12:55
and it's weird he lives near here and
12:56
i've invited him to be at the show
12:58
tonight and i just wonder
13:01
are you oh
13:06
in 1945 when people first started
13:08
testing atomic weapons
13:10
kodak found out about it before anyone
13:13
else and i had no idea about this but
13:15
this is because
13:16
film camera film is really sensitive to
13:18
radiation
13:19
and they got loads of complaints from
13:21
people in america saying our camera film
13:23
is fogging up and so a scientist who is
13:25
working at kodak looked into it and did
13:26
some 1940s googling
13:28
and he deduced that they must be testing
13:33
atomic bombs
13:34
um and he stayed quiet for a little
13:36
while because he thought i better i just
13:37
won't get involved with that that's fine
13:38
and they put some atomic proof filters
13:40
around their factory
13:41
and they just didn't mention it and then
13:43
eventually they kept on damaging their
13:45
films this radiation
13:46
and so they tried to sue the american
13:48
government in 1951
13:50
for doing all these nuclear tests that
13:51
was the worst thing about them
13:52
apparently was that they were screwing
13:53
up kodak's film
13:55
and the american government uh agreed to
13:58
give them
13:59
all the maps and the schedule of all
14:01
future nuclear tests on the grounds that
14:03
they didn't talk about this to anyone
14:05
anymore yeah that's amazing i know
14:09
just quickly kodak and mountains there's
14:11
a interesting connection
14:13
when george mallory and irving the
14:15
original
14:16
um supposedly almost might have made it
14:19
to the top of everest before
14:20
hillary did when mallory and irving
14:22
disappeared and there's been a big
14:24
mystery ever since did they make or did
14:25
they not
14:26
there's been hunts that have been going
14:28
on to find them and the one thing
14:29
they're looking for is the camera that
14:30
was had by
14:31
mallory and irving because because of
14:33
the cold nature of the mountain
14:35
the film is preserved and kodak say if
14:38
we find the camera
14:40
we'll still be able to develop it at
14:41
this point so they do searches so
14:44
one thing was when hillary went to the
14:46
top of the mountain he did a very basic
14:48
search for mallory he was looking for
14:50
two things the camera and the other
14:51
thing was a picture of mallory's wife
14:53
because
14:54
mallory said he was going to bury a
14:56
picture of his wife on the top of the
14:57
mountain
14:58
so hillary got up there didn't find it
15:00
then in 1989
15:01
people went out to look for the camera
15:03
and suddenly
15:05
perfectly preserved on the snow was
15:07
mallory the body of mallory and they
15:09
found
15:10
everything on him they had his goggles
15:12
perfect condition
15:13
his uh ice pick they had his wallet they
15:16
had everything the one thing they didn't
15:18
have was his camera
15:19
so it must be on irving but they were so
15:21
close to finding out and check this out
15:23
another thing they didn't find inside
15:25
the wallet
15:26
was the picture of his wife
15:27
[Music]
15:29
but then again if i was dying i would
15:30
quickly throw away the photo of my wife
15:32
[Laughter]
15:34
so you wouldn't like be looking at it
15:36
with your dying breath
15:37
you'd be like oh [ __ ] i i'd want her to
15:40
be remembered
15:41
as as you know the wife of the man who
15:43
first climbed everest and
15:44
to successfully do that you have
15:46
sometimes you have to cut some strings
15:49
i'm sorry if that sounds harsh she would
15:51
have understood i think have understood
15:54
um do you know how tall the uh the
15:56
smallest unclimbed mountain
15:57
in japan is i'll give you a clue it's in
16:00
osaka
16:01
i'm going to go for 12
16:05
000 feet okay
16:08
that's high i only work in meters so i'm
16:10
gonna go for
16:12
uh the tallest unclimbed smallest
16:15
smallest smallest unclimbed the smallest
16:18
mountain that no one has bothered to
16:19
climb
16:20
this is the most ridiculous question
16:21
i've ever been asked i'm going to go for
16:22
1 600 meters
16:24
okay i'm gonna go for four meters yeah
16:27
hasn't grasped the metric system yet so
16:30
what's four meters in feet
16:31
um that's like three feet uh no no
16:35
no no
16:38
like a meter it's longer than a foot
16:40
okay it's got big feet
16:42
that's good you know what they say about
16:44
men with big feet
16:45
big manta
16:50
almost like no one cares how tall
16:53
no amazingly dan is almost absolutely
16:56
bang on it is 15 feet above sea level oh
16:59
yes it's not a mountain it is a mountain
17:01
the japanese
17:02
geospatial information authority are
17:04
very relaxed about what qualifies as a
17:06
manager
17:09
i'm not kidding it's um yeah it's called
17:11
mount tempo and it's basically a pile of
17:13
dirt which was
17:14
dredged out of the harbor in 1832 to
17:16
allow vessels to sail in to the port
17:19
and that is not even the highest point
17:21
in the park it is in
17:23
but the japan's national tourist
17:25
organization have said that they do have
17:27
a mountain rescue unit in case anyone
17:29
gets lost on the slopes
17:32
um okay should we move on to fact number
17:33
three okay it is time for fact number
17:35
three and that is
17:36
zyzinski yes my fact is that when
17:39
king george vi married the queen mother
17:42
the archbishop of canterbury wouldn't
17:43
let them broadcast the ceremony on the
17:45
radio
17:46
in case people listened in the pub
17:48
without removing their hats
17:52
um this was the bbc really wanted to
17:54
broadcast it was 1923
17:56
and bbc had just set up this radio
17:58
station they wanted something to
17:59
broadcast the royal wedding seemed like
18:00
the right thing
18:01
uh he wasn't george vi at the time this
18:03
was before he was king
18:04
but they asked if they could broadcast
18:06
it and uh the abbey chapter said
18:08
absolutely not
18:08
veto because people will listen in the
18:11
pubs and worse they may listen with
18:12
their hats
18:13
still on and it might be received in an
18:16
irreverent
18:16
manner so did people just used to just
18:19
keep wearing their hats inside the pub
18:20
generally no i think just like if you
18:23
were really
18:24
a complete layabout you know if you're
18:27
really a bad person
18:29
if you're a drunk then you might forget
18:31
to take you might be wearing a baseball
18:32
cap or something
18:34
what in 1923 i don't know if it was
18:37
baseball caps you had in mind
18:39
but what i'm saying is that people do
18:41
sometimes wear hats and
18:42
yeah clubs yeah so but this was the
18:44
thing so you were supposed to take off
18:45
your hat
18:46
inside if you were doing something like
18:48
watching a very respectable ceremony
18:50
well you were always supposed to really
18:51
weren't you was it not an etiquette of
18:53
always taking your hat off when you're
18:55
inside i was reading something out again
18:56
it was actually
18:57
really complicated so i think on some
18:59
inside moments you wouldn't like for
19:01
instance you see pictures of bars in the
19:02
1920s where men kept their hats on
19:04
and that was apparently because they
19:06
couldn't rely on them not being stolen
19:07
if they took them off
19:09
um yeah i think the idea is if you're in
19:11
a place which is
19:12
akin to a public street so it could be a
19:15
corridor or it could be
19:17
a lobby of a hotel and i guess you could
19:19
probably say that pub is a bit like that
19:21
maybe
19:22
so what then you can leave your hat on
19:23
yeah okay where's the song came from
19:28
yeah that's the chorus but then there's
19:30
a big long list of things that you're
19:31
allowed to
19:33
if you're in a corridor if you're in a
19:35
lobby
19:36
anywhere like the public street cool
19:40
you don't know that song do you actually
19:45
and then had to take off their hats when
19:48
the national anthem was being played
19:50
in the olden days in etiquette and it's
19:51
really supposed to now as well
19:53
um but women are allowed to unless it's
19:55
a unisex hat
19:56
so if it's a hat that anyone i mean
19:58
anyone could wear any hats i'm not
20:00
judging
20:01
but let's say it is a baseball cap that
20:03
is a unisex hat then
20:04
the women have to take the hat off as
20:06
well so it's the hat which is
20:08
you know god i can really imagine
20:09
panicking as to what gender my hat was
20:11
and what the right thing to do was at
20:13
that moment
20:13
[Laughter]
20:15
i found out a really amazing thing about
20:17
george vi
20:18
um in 1926 and as far as i can tell he's
20:22
the only british
20:23
monarch to have done this so this is
20:26
prior to him being uh
20:27
king he competed in the doubles
20:31
at wimbledon as a tennis player really
20:34
i don't know how did he do he lost the
20:36
first match and he was out for the rest
20:38
of it um
20:39
but that's extraordinary that suddenly
20:41
the prince of
20:42
of the uk was suddenly there right
20:46
imagine prince charles at the snooker
20:49
you'd watch wouldn't you well we have
20:50
that one who rides the horses
20:52
uh sarah phillips oh yeah yeah exactly
20:55
but they all ride the horses
20:57
professionally
20:59
um yeah he was he was amazing so he they
21:02
got married only after him trying really
21:04
hard to marry
21:05
the queen mother for a long time he
21:07
proposed twice in the past
21:09
and so it's so weird that she was known
21:11
as the queen mother all the way through
21:14
her life it's like she was destined for
21:17
the job she should have known
21:19
[Laughter]
21:21
he was called albert at the time weirdly
21:23
and uh
21:24
she was called elizabeth at the time and
21:26
she refused his first proposal because
21:28
we kind of all remember the queen mother
21:29
she's quite a spunky kind of character
21:31
and at the time she refused because she
21:33
didn't want to feel like she wasn't able
21:35
to be free to think speak and act
21:37
as she felt she ought to so he said i'm
21:40
only going to marry this woman i really
21:41
love her
21:42
so his mum albert's mum invited her up
21:45
to her house and had
21:46
some really really sharp words being
21:48
like okay well you have to marry my son
21:49
and then he proposed again and she said
21:51
no again so good on her
21:54
and then he beat her down the third time
21:55
like metaphorically
21:57
she was the first commoner to be married
22:00
to a member of the royal family for 200
22:01
years i think
22:02
wow um but she was a commoner but she
22:05
was the daughter of the earl of
22:06
strathmore
22:07
and she grew up in glams castle yeah so
22:10
it's stretching commoner a little bit
22:12
isn't it
22:14
and this is a really good fact i liked
22:15
about george v during the indo-pakistani
22:18
war of
22:19
1947 he technically was at war with
22:22
himself
22:23
because he was the monarch of both those
22:24
places wow that's
22:26
amazing why are you hitting yourself
22:32
and here's another fact when he died
22:34
there were more than 300 000 people
22:36
who queued up to see his body and that
22:39
is just
22:40
about the same as the population of
22:42
cardiff wow
22:43
why did they all go down to do that have
22:45
you ever got like a
22:47
weird connection to them they don't have
22:49
much entertainment on here
22:52
next week at the glee club they're
22:53
bringing in the uh
22:55
the body of king george let's say
22:59
just on royal weddings there was a thing
23:01
where prince william and kate middleton
23:03
got married uh
23:04
another uh quite posh commoner marrying
23:07
into the royal family
23:08
but when they got married that was in
23:09
2011 i think new zealand released an
23:12
official stamp to commemorate the
23:13
occasion
23:14
except what they did was they released
23:15
the official stamp which had a
23:16
perforation
23:18
down the middle between william and kate
23:20
oh
23:21
so you could tear them apart and get two
23:24
stamps
23:25
guys did they do that on purpose i don't
23:28
i don't know are they apologized
23:30
wow i can't work out whether it would
23:32
have been better or worse for the
23:33
perforation to go horizontally and cut
23:35
their heads off
23:38
they made the right choice this year it
23:40
was pippa middleton's wedding
23:42
wasn't it and in our book we have a
23:44
little bit about that yeah um
23:45
600 people were invited to pippa
23:48
middleton's wedding
23:49
300 guests and 300 members of the public
23:52
who were allowed to stand in a pen
23:54
outside the venue did they have a trough
23:58
at the very least
23:59
or a nosebag each maybe what was the
24:02
well they didn't say exactly why it was
24:05
well i guess officially it was kind of
24:06
just so that the local village can kind
24:08
of
24:09
be part of it or whatever but a lot of
24:11
people thought that maybe it was to stop
24:12
the paparazzi game there or whatever
24:14
because there's so many people
24:15
but no one really knows but it was crazy
24:17
there were more than 20
24:18
000 canapes 20 000.
24:22
there would have been 10 000 fewer
24:24
within five minutes
24:26
um so some royal weddings in the past
24:28
have gone really badly
24:30
um and they're really fun to read about
24:31
but so george iv for instance he met his
24:34
future wife carolina brunswick in 1795
24:36
and it was the age when it was just
24:37
arranged
24:38
she was not flown over she was brought
24:40
over to the uk
24:42
um and at the moment he set eyes on her
24:44
his first words were i am not well get
24:46
me a glass of brandy
24:47
and and he proceeded to spend the next
24:50
24 hours in a drunken stupor
24:52
and the wedding night lying on the floor
24:54
in a drunken stupor
24:56
he arrived late to that wedding and
24:58
stumbled up the aisle completely drunk
25:00
and then he refused to say any of his
25:01
vows until his father ordered him to
25:03
behave himself
25:04
and they separated quite soon after that
25:07
wow
25:08
i read that he only got married because
25:09
parliament said we will pay off your
25:12
debts but only if you marry this woman
25:14
yeah so that's the sole motivation he
25:15
had he seems like the kind of person who
25:17
would have racked up a lot of debts
25:18
doesn't he yeah
25:19
and i think did he did he stare at his
25:21
mistress who was in the front row
25:22
throughout the ceremony
25:24
poor woman yeah there was another one in
25:26
1736
25:28
there was a german princess augusta
25:30
arrived in london she was 17 years old
25:32
and she had to marry the heir to the
25:33
throne who was
25:34
frederick who didn't end up becoming
25:35
king but she was told by her mum look
25:38
they all speak german there it's fine
25:39
because she spoke no english
25:40
she got there nobody spoke any german
25:42
she didn't speak any english
25:44
she was absolutely terrified she was
25:46
ushered down the aisles she was sobbing
25:47
she was clinging to her mom's coattails
25:49
apparently saying please don't make me
25:50
do this
25:51
the groom frederick apparently just
25:53
shouted the vows in her ear that she had
25:55
to repeat
25:56
verbatim um and then immediately after
25:58
that she vomited all down her dress and
26:00
all over the skirt of her new
26:01
mother-in-law
26:03
and that was the start of what turned
26:05
out to be quite a happy marriage
26:06
actually
26:09
oh we have to move on uh shortly um if
26:11
you guys have anything
26:12
before we do oh i've got one thing um
26:14
the movie the king's speech that was
26:15
about
26:16
george's thick he had a stutter
26:20
deliberately
26:23
it just came out i did it are you
26:24
auditioning for the sequel
26:25
[Laughter]
26:28
um he uh so colin firth played him in
26:31
the movie
26:32
and in order to do it obviously he
26:33
taught himself to do a stutter for the
26:35
movie
26:35
then the movie finished and colin firth
26:37
found himself not being able to get rid
26:39
of the stutter
26:41
so then he himself had to be treated no
26:44
for artificially manufactured stutter
26:47
isn't that great way way love that on
26:52
the dan's wikipedia if
26:54
it ever existed you'd look for the
26:55
citation another bottom or just a row of
26:57
numbers
26:58
way way
27:05
also i've got a quite nice hat little
27:07
thing so the the politeness of the
27:08
british with the hat back in the day um
27:10
michael bond passed away this year who
27:12
was the
27:13
author of paddington bear and paddington
27:15
bear was largely based on his father and
27:17
his father apparently was so polite and
27:19
nice that when he used to go swimming
27:21
he would wear into the ocean his trunks
27:24
and also his hat
27:25
just in case he passed someone as he was
27:27
swimming so he could say oh
27:31
i'd tip his hat to them is that lovely
27:33
yeah
27:34
did you know that on a hat etiquette the
27:36
reason we have cloak rooms today
27:38
where you put your hat and your coat in
27:40
a cloak room is because of hats in the
27:42
olden days so when everyone was wearing
27:43
hats up until the early
27:45
1900s they took up half the space in
27:48
restaurants
27:48
because as we said earlier men had to
27:50
take off their top hats when they went
27:52
inside into a restaurant for instance
27:53
but then
27:54
you didn't want to you know leave it
27:55
under the table because it couldn't
27:56
really fit so it would take up a second
27:58
chair and there was a guy this guy
28:01
called um
28:02
aj liebling uh at one point said you
28:05
know our restaurants are 50
28:06
occupied by hats who don't eat anything
28:09
[Laughter]
28:10
we should really invent a cloak room to
28:12
store these and that's
28:13
lovely if there was a smaller hat table
28:15
with you know yeah
28:16
and a hat's menu
28:18
[Laughter]
28:20
you're right well they all got to hang
28:21
out together yeah
28:23
um okay should we move on to our final
28:25
fact okay it is time for our final fact
28:27
of the show and that is my fact my fact
28:30
this week
28:30
is that the brazilian frog known as the
28:33
pumpkin toadlet
28:35
has a mating call that can be heard by
28:37
every animal out there
28:39
except for one other pumpkin toadlets
28:46
it turns out they're deaf
28:51
they do these croaks to get their
28:53
attention and they keep getting eaten
28:55
they're probably going why am i
28:56
exposing myself so much um and
28:59
it turns out it must be an evolutionary
29:01
thing where they did used to be able to
29:02
hear and somewhere along the line they
29:04
they went deaf the entire
29:05
species um i think there's subspecies
29:07
within the pumpkin totally so there's a
29:09
there's two species specifically that
29:11
are death
29:12
and um what they think is uh is that
29:14
when they're doing the call the way it
29:15
moves
29:16
their neck another pumpkin totally
29:18
female pumpkin total it sees the moves
29:20
of like the shakes or whatever of the
29:22
toad and they're like oh that's a that
29:24
looks like he might be saying something
29:25
i have no idea
29:27
but it looks hot so i'll go over and um
29:30
but what what usually would happen in uh
29:33
evolution purposes is that you would
29:34
lose the call because you would protect
29:36
yourself from predators but they haven't
29:38
and it's the first case that we've ever
29:39
found
29:40
of an animal that hasn't lost uh the
29:43
call when it's redundant
29:45
and exposes it to predators but it will
29:47
be getting there presumably we're always
29:48
surprised when we find animals that
29:50
you know haven't evolved into this
29:52
perfect being but presumably in a few
29:54
million years it's there we're just in
29:55
the [ __ ] phase
29:57
yeah you're right we're in the burning
29:59
phase when you're in the ship phase you
30:01
do often die out you get extinct don't
30:03
you
30:03
yeah that is a risk for the total
30:06
apparently they
30:06
they do little waves as well yeah like
30:09
this
30:12
well i i can understand why the females
30:14
come flocking
30:18
i must admit that isn't great podcast
30:20
material is it yeah yeah
30:23
what james was doing is he he was making
30:25
a gesture that made it seem like he was
30:26
trying to
30:27
like work out somebody's height it's
30:28
like you have a child and you're going
30:30
it's about four foot five foot four
30:32
point five yeah
30:34
what's that like four meters three
30:35
minutes
30:38
five or six meters okay yeah so um
30:40
unfortunately
30:41
for the frog it happens uh to be the
30:44
case that and it's like a bright orange
30:46
color
30:47
they're really tiny aren't they they're
30:48
really tiny like the size of your
30:50
thumbnail almost they're
30:51
really super small yeah and they're and
30:53
their call is quite soft as a result
30:55
um but they still can be heard by the
30:56
predecessors but um
30:58
they are incredibly toxic so if they do
31:02
get eaten they might end up killing the
31:03
predator anyway
31:04
so they're probably just actually just
31:06
being really cocky
31:08
and they're just going hey i'm here i'm
31:10
here what are you gonna do what are you
31:11
gonna do
31:11
nothing do you know that there's a type
31:14
of frog called a cocky frog
31:16
no really um i it's in
31:20
i think i can't remember where they're
31:22
from they're from an island somewhere
31:23
but they're now
31:24
on hawaii uh which is also an island but
31:26
it's a different island where they're
31:27
from
31:28
um but they're on hawaii and they make a
31:30
hell of a racket they're really really
31:32
loud
31:33
and the load of people in hawaii are
31:34
really hating this because it keeps them
31:36
awake at night when they're mating
31:37
you just get loads of horny frogs just
31:39
making loads and loads of noise yeah
31:41
that's like there's a there's something
31:43
called the i was looking at um
31:45
other sounds that animals could make
31:48
and i was wondering do fish make mating
31:50
calls
31:51
um and they they make really loud ones
31:54
so there's
31:54
a fish called the plainfish midshipman
31:57
fish which is in the toad fish family
31:59
so it's got toad relations and it
32:02
it hums um to attract mate so it makes
32:05
this hum which sounds like a guitar
32:07
amplifier
32:08
or um it sounds like a flock of flock of
32:11
bees
32:11
block of b sure a flock of peas yeah um
32:15
and they it turns out that they make so
32:18
much noise that
32:19
they live in california and they're
32:20
constant complaints to
32:22
the police for the noise that they make
32:23
because they're disrupting people's
32:24
sleep and drowning out people's
32:26
conversations
32:27
and they growl and they grunt as well to
32:29
keep out intruders
32:30
and they didn't know what it was for a
32:31
long time so people were calling the
32:32
police saying someone's keeping me awake
32:34
all night
32:35
and it's them and the person who
32:36
eventually found out about this
32:39
weird noise that they make is a
32:40
researcher called andrew
32:42
bass um b-a-s
32:45
which is the first case of double
32:47
nominative determinism i've ever found
32:50
as in bubble it's a fish and it's the
32:53
bassy noise that the fish make i thought
32:56
i thought there was a fish species
32:58
called andrew
33:02
that makes more sense the andrew fish
33:06
yeah yeah did you guys know some frogs
33:08
call
33:09
so much and so vociferously for a mate
33:12
that once
33:12
they've got a mate they're too tired to
33:15
follow through
33:16
and have sex with the female the female
33:18
arrives and they say i'm sorry i can't
33:20
i'm no good to you now
33:21
they lose loads of weight don't they
33:23
they they can't eat they can't sleep and
33:25
they're so weak that they're just a
33:26
floppy mess
33:27
and it feels like
33:28
[Laughter]
33:31
everyone's had a night like that i mean
33:32
that is
33:35
i've overdone it i found a really cool
33:37
one there's a frog in taiwan
33:40
it's an urban city frog and it does a
33:42
mating call but it's worked out how to
33:45
make their mating call better
33:46
it goes to storm drains and it uses it
33:49
as a megaphone
33:52
so it gets to the top of a soren dream
33:53
and it literally is just
33:55
whatever it's your i'm super horny
34:02
and they found that the female frog goes
34:04
to the edge of the uh
34:06
the storm drain so it works for them but
34:08
do the females know that it's not a
34:10
because it must sound like a massive
34:11
frog
34:12
oh that sounds like a super frog you're
34:14
right yeah
34:16
do you know the biggest frog that's ever
34:18
lived it was about the size of a beach
34:19
ball
34:20
and it at dinosaurs wow not like t-rexes
34:24
though
34:24
no like baby dinosaurs yeah um
34:27
so the common toad the um latin name for
34:30
that is bufo bufo
34:31
uh and this frog it was known as or is
34:34
known as bielsa buffo
34:36
nice very soon that's his official name
34:39
as well
34:40
but it was the size of a beach bowl and
34:42
they worked out how strong its um
34:44
bite was and its bite was about 2 200
34:47
newtons
34:48
which is about the same as a lions bite
34:51
wow do you know how uh porcupines
34:55
attract each other or how male
34:56
porcupines attract females
34:58
really like really awesome spikes um it
35:02
is actually
35:02
that's in a way yeah um they stand up on
35:05
their hind legs
35:06
and they move they shuffle towards the
35:09
female just with their
35:10
penis fully erect and that's how they do
35:14
it
35:15
it's a it's an uncompromisingly direct
35:17
flirting method
35:20
it's good there's no question over what
35:22
he's after we like that
35:24
um or sometimes and you can see pictures
35:26
of this
35:27
they hop they lift one arm their front
35:30
paw off the ground and they hop
35:31
on the other one whilst clutching their
35:33
crotch with the one that's off the
35:35
ground
35:35
they do um and this attracts the women
35:38
and if the woman
35:39
or the female porcupine likes that
35:41
enough the crotch dance
35:42
then she'll allow them to have sex with
35:44
her and usually if she's not up for sex
35:47
then a male porcupine can't get in there
35:48
because she's so spiny
35:50
and then the way you know that she likes
35:51
you is she puts her tail up
35:53
and it covers all of her spines which
35:55
means that you will not be impaled
35:57
which is a very good freaking system um
36:00
do you know that some frogs change
36:02
color to make their life easier when
36:04
they're in orgies
36:08
really if you've been an orgy your life
36:10
doesn't get much easier
36:12
yeah you've made it you're fine well it
36:15
does if you're a frog you see because
36:18
there there's a lot of them there's
36:20
loads and loads of frogs all get
36:21
together
36:22
might be a particularly nice puddle or
36:23
something but these are in some species
36:25
they all get together
36:26
and they'll just shag anything uh male
36:29
female tennis ball whatever um there
36:32
are some pictures of tennis balls
36:34
landing into this orgy of frogs and all
36:36
the
36:37
frogs just go for it what what happens
36:40
to the match
36:41
[Laughter]
36:45
george's six going damn you yeah
36:48
so that's what happens and but there are
36:50
some species a lot of these species who
36:52
do this kind of
36:53
group mating they also changed color and
36:55
no one was really sure why and it seems
36:57
that the reason they do it is to say
36:59
i'm a man or i'm a woman you know keep
37:01
off me oh wow it's like when you go to
37:03
those parties at uni and you have to
37:04
wear a traffic light color depending on
37:06
how available you are yeah
37:08
exactly but the problem is at the start
37:09
they're all green
37:13
um have you heard of this thing so when
37:16
when frogs have it's called explosive
37:18
breeding isn't it they do this thing
37:19
called explosive breeding which is
37:20
instead of mating all year round they
37:22
have one session you know every year
37:24
and all the mating happens then so some
37:26
females because
37:28
there's a horrible crush of bodies some
37:30
females are crushed to death
37:32
in these uh things unfortunately it's
37:35
already unfortunate
37:37
yeah let me rephrase put the corner in a
37:39
different place
37:40
some females cross to death
37:41
unfortunately but
37:44
but the male frogs will still mate with
37:47
them
37:48
successfully successfully okay
37:52
so so it's all about the mating happens
37:54
outside the body because the female uh
37:55
gets uh produces eggs the male produces
37:57
sperm and they they meet outside the
37:59
body
37:59
so the males sort of go up and squeeze
38:02
the females and they squeeze
38:05
it's just nature guys it's just nature
38:07
it can't be gross if it's just nature
38:12
no that's not a defense for anything
38:17
um yeah and they squeeze the eggs out of
38:19
their body and then mate with them
38:20
amazing
38:21
yeah it is messed up sorry so seahorses
38:25
don't boo the frogs it's their instincts
38:28
i don't think the frogs are the ones
38:29
being food
38:34
[Laughter]
38:40
um so sea horses have the best mating
38:42
rituals the best way of attracting each
38:44
other which
38:45
people might have seen but it's so great
38:47
so they change color as well
38:49
to attract mates and then when they've
38:51
got something that they think they fancy
38:53
they swim for hours and hours together
38:55
and they get their tails intertwined and
38:56
they go snap to snout and they
38:58
spin around and they do this incredible
39:00
dance but another thing they do is when
39:01
they're in the flirting period
39:03
they meet up every morning and they hang
39:05
out together for a couple of hours and
39:07
then they part ways again they
39:09
they date each other i know it's so
39:11
sweet
39:12
and so they do this sort of pre-dawn
39:13
dance where they meet up they do that
39:15
and then
39:16
once they're ready on like the fourth or
39:18
fifth date or whenever you think
39:20
is appropriate then they do the full
39:23
eight-hour courtship dance that ends in
39:25
pregnancy
39:26
and that's you see andy this is how you
39:28
tell a story about animal mating
39:32
yeah there's no booing going on there
39:38
does does the seahorse then die and then
39:40
they they just
39:41
punches it in their head until the the
39:44
eggs come out is
39:45
yeah is that the that's the romantic
39:47
climax right
39:51
sorry
39:54
i didn't think it was interesting and i
39:57
realized it's just horrible
39:59
i'm sorry david attenborough doesn't get
40:01
this [ __ ] does he
40:04
necro with david adam
40:07
he picks his targets carefully
40:14

[Music]
01:48
[Applause]
01:52
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:54
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:57
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:59
covent garden
02:00
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
02:02
here with anna chazinski
02:04
james harkin and andrew hunter murray
02:06
and once again we have gathered around
02:08
the microphones with our four
02:09
favorite facts from the last seven days
02:11
and in no particular order
02:13
here we go starting with you james
02:16
harkin
02:17
okay my fact this week is that it used
02:19
to be thought that you couldn't testify
02:21
in court
02:22
if you'd seen a crime through a window
02:25
this is such an amazing fact this is
02:27
incredible but it used to be thought but
02:29
it wasn't the case
02:30
well it certainly wasn't the case in the
02:32
late 19th early 20th century
02:35
when these news reports which were sent
02:37
to me by a guy on twitter called richard
02:39
tisdale
02:40
at richie t 1892. um
02:44
i think people often put the date they
02:45
were born as their number don't they but
02:47
i don't think he was born in 1892. this
02:49
would explain why he knows about court
02:50
cases from the late 20s
02:53
that's true but he sent me a few
02:54
different articles one for instance was
02:57
an article entitled extraordinary belief
02:59
in shrewsbury
03:00
and it was a 1928 report
03:04
about this person in shrewsbury who
03:06
thought they'd seen a crime
03:07
but they thought they couldn't really be
03:09
sure that they'd definitely seen it
03:10
because it was through a window
03:12
and he sent me some others there was one
03:14
in wolverhampton one in lincolnshire one
03:16
in ireland
03:17
and the irish one gives a bit of extra
03:19
material that it might be that this is
03:20
because
03:21
old glass used in windows was often
03:23
warped or blurred so maybe in the olden
03:24
days you couldn't really see through a
03:26
window very well
03:27
but then kind of folklore carried on and
03:30
people actually thought if you saw a
03:31
crime through a window you couldn't be
03:33
a reliable witness so always carry out
03:35
your murders in a greenhouse
03:39
so these people are just people who saw
03:41
crimes and didn't report them because
03:42
they were like well my testimony will be
03:44
useless
03:45
or there were people who were in court
03:47
and the um the
03:48
judge said so did you see the crime and
03:50
they said well i kind of saw it
03:52
it was through a window so it might not
03:54
be true this completely invalidates the
03:56
film rear window
03:57
as a plotline yeah
04:00
what would have happened to me because i
04:01
wear glasses i've got two windows on my
04:03
face you can't see anything you think
04:05
you can
04:05
yeah okay wow so all those crimes but
04:08
they're not so it's not the windows
04:10
were hard to see through because
04:12
obviously in the very olden days and up
04:14
until probably about tudor times then
04:15
yeah as you say
04:16
glass would warp and you couldn't really
04:19
see probably through a window
04:20
and i think in ancient rome when they
04:22
started making windows out of glass
04:24
then it wasn't to illuminate a room and
04:27
it wasn't so that you could see through
04:28
it it was just for
04:29
decoration and insulation because the
04:31
glass was so
04:32
opaque basically maybe it was because of
04:35
stained glass
04:36
so people were sort of reporting jesus's
04:38
crucifixion
04:40
and then realizing oh no hang on that's
04:42
just that's part of the window
04:44
i'm not going to fall for that again
04:45
when they see an actual crime yeah
04:48
i don't know yeah i mean yeah
04:51
it's a theory isn't it we've mentioned
04:53
before that the inuit
04:55
peoples used to use walrus penis
04:57
membrane as a window
04:59
they did and actually i would be quite
05:00
annoyed if i was successfully prosecuted
05:02
for crime i committed
05:04
through a walrus penis membrane because
05:06
we've seen pictures of these walrus
05:08
penis membranes
05:09
and they're not fully um transparent
05:12
they're not
05:12
i would say they're not even slightly no
05:14
transparent
05:15
they also made windows out of oyster
05:17
shells which again are not transparent
05:19
at all yeah
05:20
but they kind of let a little bit of
05:22
light through yeah same with the
05:23
membrane actually
05:25
it's hard to know when something stops
05:26
being a wall and starts being a window
05:28
isn't it and
05:31
for me oyster shells are just on the
05:33
wrong side of the divide
05:34
but it's there this is my beautiful new
05:36
brick window
05:40
did you ever get told off by your
05:41
parents with the phrase you make a
05:43
better door than a window
05:45
no oh that's and you're standing in the
05:46
way basically when i was
05:48
uh young and standing in front of the
05:50
telly in between my parents and the
05:51
television they would say you make a
05:52
better door than a window meaning you
05:54
are opaque but apparently this doesn't
05:55
now
05:56
prohibit me from being a window if i
05:57
choose to be um
05:59
why were you standing in front of the tv
06:01
were you like look at me
06:03
look at me guys stop looking at the tv
06:07
[Laughter]
06:15
um windows back in the day and i'm
06:17
talking specifically the year
06:19
1590 were very very uh
06:22
sort of treasured and and they were just
06:25
for that one year
06:26
one year 1590 was the big window here
06:29
um basically if you had windows you
06:32
treated them almost as a separate object
06:33
to your entire house
06:35
so for example there's accounts of
06:37
people in their wills
06:38
leaving the house to say the wife but
06:41
the windows to the sun
06:45
and there's a castle called anik castle
06:48
and
06:49
again 1590 this is roughly the time this
06:51
was reported
06:52
when the residents of that castle went
06:54
on holidays or were just going out for a
06:56
long time
06:56
they would take the windows off and
06:58
store them so that nothing would happen
07:00
to them while they were gone it's so
07:01
funny ridiculous
07:02
so they can't get stolen but i think
07:05
yeah yeah exactly but then everything
07:07
else in the building can get stolen
07:08
because there's nothing in the windows
07:10
empty with their friends you might you
07:12
might know this dan yeah do you know
07:14
why annette castle is famous no it's
07:16
where they filmed the first series of
07:17
black adder
07:19
they also filmed some of harry potter
07:20
there did they know
07:22
but i think it had been famous for quite
07:24
a few centuries before
07:26
even black adder that's probably why
07:27
they chose to film there as opposed to
07:30
no one had ever heard of it it doesn't
07:32
make any sense yeah how would they find
07:33
out
07:34
do you think that would cause family
07:35
attention if you inherited the windows
07:37
and the other person inherited the house
07:39
yes yeah 100 you'd be like
07:42
yeah stop looking through my windows
07:44
yeah stop living in my house
07:46
what do you do with them if you don't
07:47
have a house to attach them i think you
07:49
just brag to your mum that she's cold
07:50
all the time and there's nothing she can
07:52
do about it
07:53
yeah i got some stuff on witnesses and
07:55
oh yeah
07:57
um in burma or as it was
08:00
now myanmar um in the old days you had
08:02
to do an oath if you were
08:04
in court you probably still do but the
08:05
old days it was 370 words long
08:09
and it was like i will speak the truth
08:12
if i speak not the truth
08:13
may it be that when i and my relations
08:15
are on land
08:16
land animals such as tigers elephants
08:18
buffalos poisonous serpents scorpions
08:21
etc
08:21
shall seize crush and bite us so that we
08:24
will certainly die
08:26
let the calamities occasioned by fire
08:28
water rulers thieves and enemies oppress
08:31
and destroy us
08:32
till we perish and come to utter
08:33
destruction may we be seized with
08:36
madness doneness blindness deafness
08:38
leprosy and rabies
08:40
and may we be struck with thunderbolts
08:42
and lightning and come to a sudden death
08:44
wow i mean that's worse than swearing on
08:47
a bible
08:48
yeah really were they more honest in the
08:52
olden days do you think because
08:53
they really hit home how bad it was
08:55
going to be if they weren't i think so
08:57
i mean that's pretty bad if you tell a
08:59
lie and all that stuff happens to you
09:00
and your family yeah but then i mean
09:03
it's very easy to refute as soon as one
09:04
person hasn't had all of those things
09:06
happen to them and you would have heard
09:07
about it wherever you were
09:08
if they did then you go well this
09:10
thing's obviously bollocks
09:12
yeah but i guess what that means is that
09:13
people always must have told the truth
09:15
right
09:16
right they always do what it means in
09:18
the in the olden days with the bible
09:20
uh used to in ireland you'd have to kiss
09:22
the bible but people would just slip
09:24
their thumb
09:25
in the way so they kiss their thumb
09:26
instead of the bible because they were
09:28
scared obviously if they kissed the
09:29
bible and told the lie that something
09:31
bad would happen to them
09:32
i still think something bad will happen
09:34
to you i think something bad will happen
09:35
if you
09:36
if you believe in it and you also then
09:38
get out of it by kissing your thumb do
09:40
you think so
09:40
yeah yeah but if you believe in
09:42
something you can make
09:44
other rules up right um like people
09:47
like if you have your fingers crossed
09:48
behind your like which is the pivotal
09:50
scene in the truman show
09:52
like she didn't get married to truman by
09:55
crossing her fingers behind her back
09:56
technically that's what she believes
09:57
does that have legal basis
10:01
he's a lawyer in that film so he would
10:02
know and i think yeah is he a lawyer
10:04
you're thinking am i a liar i'm thinking
10:09
but in lie a liar he had his fingers
10:11
crossed all the way through so it
10:12
shouldn't really be called liar that's
10:16
true
10:21
okay it's time for fact number two and
10:23
that is my fact
10:24
my fact this week is that american
10:27
pioneering explorers
10:29
lewis and clark have been tracked via
10:32
their poo
10:35
i mean we tracked them already via their
10:37
extremely detailed journals that they
10:38
wrote at the time
10:40
but what was that journal written
10:44
so this this is uh very interesting if
10:47
by
10:48
a chance you don't happen to know who
10:50
lewis and clark are
10:51
they were explorers who in 1804 were
10:54
trying to find
10:55
a source from the missouri river to the
10:56
pacific so they went on this big track
10:58
it was a 28
10:59
month 28 month long track and
11:02
um along the way and it's a historic
11:05
trek in america and they know many of
11:06
them of the spots that they went to
11:08
but they don't know exact locations and
11:10
they've always wanted to find out
11:11
exact locations many people have gone
11:13
out and seen where trees have been
11:14
chopped down
11:15
where uh old bits of camp have been left
11:18
but many people have explored since then
11:20
and so there's no
11:20
identifiable way of saying for sure that
11:22
that is lewis and clark some 200 years
11:24
ago
11:25
so what they have realized though is
11:27
that lewis and clark when they went on
11:29
this expedition their whole team was
11:30
taking this special little
11:32
pill called calamel which was used to
11:35
treat syphilis but also constipation
11:37
because while they were out on these
11:38
missions they were eating such raw weird
11:40
food
11:41
they needed to blitz their body of all
11:43
this stuff in one foul swoop and so they
11:45
use these
11:46
and they would take a day to sort of dig
11:48
a latrine and the entire camp would flow
11:50
into the day it's a little
11:51
tree yeah wonder it took them 28 months
11:53
they're constantly digging toilets
11:54
i like the way you said i don't know if
11:56
you actually said this but it sounded
11:57
like you said one foul swoop
11:59
it did yeah yeah the saying is one fell
12:01
swoop but actually when it's diarrhea
12:04
it is one false that was the pun that i
12:06
definitely was making so
12:08
yeah thanks for picking that up but i'm
12:10
missing the main point of this
12:11
fact which is inside this pill was
12:15
mercury and it was mercury that was
12:17
flushing them out and mercury doesn't
12:19
degrade
12:19
so what they've been doing is going
12:21
along the tracks and looking for high
12:22
levels of mercury in the ground
12:24
of these latrines and they've been
12:26
finding them and now they know the exact
12:28
locations of where they were pit
12:29
stopping along the way some 200 years
12:31
later their poo
12:33
mercury is still sitting there in the
12:34
ground so cool
12:36
is it or is that the trace you want to
12:38
leave on earth of yourself it's not the
12:40
only trace they've left as you say
12:41
they're left incredibly detailed yes
12:43
heroic exploits and stories and things
12:45
but syphilis was a massive problem on
12:47
that trip wasn't it
12:48
because in fact stds generally because
12:51
it was lewis and clark and then they had
12:52
this big expedition of people with them
12:54
and there was loads of shagging
12:55
so all the men except lewis um
12:59
slept with lots of the native americans
13:01
that they found loads of the tribal
13:02
women
13:03
and so there was a lot of exchange of
13:04
stds and syphilis
13:06
came to europeans from native americans
13:09
and then i'm sure we in return
13:11
gave native americans smallpox smallpox
13:14
yeah
13:15
and hundreds of other things how do we
13:16
know that lewis didn't sleep with anyone
13:19
uh because the other people who are on
13:20
the expedition commented on the fact
13:21
that he was really
13:23
like a bit he left extremely detailed
13:25
reports of not having sex with yes
13:27
yeah that's what i was gonna say it
13:29
sounds like he was in charge of the
13:30
diary
13:31
i think dear wife
13:32
[Laughter]
13:37
these pills were called thunderclappers
13:39
yeah because they were so big and so
13:41
violent in the effects they produced on
13:43
your stomach yeah their official name
13:44
was dr rush's bilius pills
13:46
wow but they were known as thunder
13:48
clappers and they were big they were
13:50
like
13:50
four times bigger than a normal pill
13:52
that you might take an aspirin or
13:53
anything like that
13:54
wow i guess you just break it in four
13:56
and then you're okay but even so that
13:58
would look frightening
14:00
coming coming at you but it was it was
14:03
weird because
14:04
they were sent off by jefferson weren't
14:06
they yes
14:07
he was behind it and he thought they
14:09
were going to find enormous
14:10
woolly mammoths and giant sloths
14:13
effectively they were on a big foot hunt
14:15
they were looking for cryptids they were
14:17
looking for mythical well they were
14:18
looking for the pacific
14:20
yeah were they because it sounds like
14:22
they were looking for woolly mammoths
14:23
he said you might find some william alex
14:25
on your way to the pacific
14:26
and if you do please make notes and he
14:28
said there would be there was
14:30
another theory that jefferson had they
14:31
they might meet a race of welsh-speaking
14:33
native americans
14:34
oh yes they did not but they did meet
14:37
some native americans who
14:38
could swear in english because they'd
14:39
met traders and one of them ran up and
14:41
just said
14:42
son of a really yeah
14:45
that was how they knew they were close
14:46
to the pacific in fact wasn't it so yeah
14:48
because they were
14:49
really worried they were so lost america
14:51
was much bigger than they'd realized and
14:52
they weren't getting to the pacific
14:54
and then suddenly they started noticing
14:55
that the tribes people who up until that
14:58
point had never seen a white person
14:59
before
14:59
were suddenly wearing kind of british
15:01
sailors outfits
15:02
and like sailing hats and yeah all the
15:04
phrases they knew were
15:06
yeah son of a and all majorities
15:08
and musket
15:09
and damned rascal and stuff like that
15:12
and selling t-shirts that said my dad
15:13
went to the pacific
15:16
t-shirt exactly because that's obviously
15:18
the only way that they could have come
15:19
across um
15:20
any any white people yeah also they were
15:23
basically
15:23
covered in mosquitoes all the time the
15:25
mosquito clouds were so thick around
15:27
them
15:27
that all their meals they had to eat
15:29
over the smoke of a fire because
15:31
obviously mosquitoes don't really like
15:32
that
15:32
and even then as they were eating their
15:34
meat dozens of mosquitoes got in the way
15:36
as they took each bite so they were
15:38
constantly eating mosquitoes
15:40
and lewis i spent a third of his budget
15:43
on
15:43
anti-mosquito devices and other things
15:45
like that and also hog lard
15:47
they were smeared in hoglar for the
15:48
whole journey because that keeps
15:49
mosquitoes off your skin
15:51
does it or was that what they thought
15:52
then a bit like they thought if you ate
15:54
loads of mercury there would be no
15:55
problem with that
15:57
no i suppose that anything that stops
15:59
the mosquito being able to puncture your
16:01
skin
16:01
might work yeah i just that hog lard to
16:04
me sounds quite delicious and i wonder
16:05
if it sounds delicious to a mosquito
16:07
maybe especially if you're sat really
16:09
really close to a fire the whole time
16:10
you're just going to smell like bacon
16:12
oh my god they just put pork crackling
16:14
on themselves and expected to deter
16:16
animals so
16:19
one sort of possible justification of
16:22
lewis having not
16:23
been sleeping around is the fact that he
16:25
was massively in love with
16:27
a lady who eventually became his future
16:29
wife and her name
16:31
was judith hancock and he partially
16:33
wooed her
16:34
by naming a river after her while he was
16:37
out there so when he came back he said
16:39
i've named
16:39
river judith uh yeah current actually
16:42
hancock right it must be hancock
16:44
actually that's the second uh item of uh
16:47
geography that they've named with the
16:49
word in it because they also named
16:50
something cockrock
16:52
and it was this big rock that looked
16:54
like a
16:55
and not the the fowl and i used fowl
16:58
properly that time
17:01
yeah it looked like a big penis and so
17:02
they called it cockrock really
17:04
yeah i didn't know that yeah because i
17:06
know that everyone on the exhibition got
17:07
something named after them including the
17:09
dog
17:09
really it's nice but didn't they just
17:11
eat a load of dogs all the way through
17:13
they only ate one dog i believe they had
17:15
lots of dogs
17:21
dear wife we've definitely only eaten
17:22
one dog
17:24
who just remembered they lots of dogs
17:26
except the one dog that was
17:28
their labrador companion along the way
17:30
so they
17:33
it's a different story isn't it 201
17:35
dalmatians
17:38
um lewis got shot on the expedition by
17:41
one of his own
17:42
men and it was because they were out elk
17:43
hunting and he was out hunting with his
17:46
mate who was blind in one eye and very
17:48
short-sighted in the other
17:49
and mistook him for an elk and so fired
17:52
a musket shot straight through his
17:54
buttock
17:55
and so he couldn't sit down with the
17:56
rest of the trip apparently he had to
17:57
spend the rest of the expedition lying
17:59
face
18:00
down in the boat because he couldn't let
18:01
his ass touch the ground it's
18:03
it's you have to be very short-sighted
18:05
to mistake a man for an elk
18:07
you do yeah yeah it's true but
18:10
they wore um you know sort of skins and
18:12
stuff for animal skins
18:14
so he was dressed as an elk he was
18:16
dressed like he was dressed up as an elk
18:17
maybe he saw an elk and shouted elk and
18:19
the guy who shot him thought he was an
18:20
elk
18:21
who knew his old name yeah
18:26
i have some stuff on laxatives
18:29
um do you know in bingo they say
18:32
doctor's orders
18:33
number nine i don't know that you know
18:36
yeah she's a bingo huge bingo fan that's
18:39
because during world war ii number nine
18:41
was the name of a laxative handed out by
18:43
medics
18:45
which i didn't know and did you know
18:47
ketchup was originally sold in pill form
18:50
and they thought it would cure illnesses
18:52
such as diarrhea jaundice and
18:54
indigestion
18:55
but actually they ended up like
18:57
fraudulently making them and instead of
18:59
putting tomato in them
19:00
tomato extract in them they just put
19:02
laxatives in them
19:04
so basically just so it wasn't actually
19:07
curing
19:08
no it was just making people
19:09
themselves and for people who are
19:11
already suffering from diarrhea that
19:13
must have been oh god
19:16
so this wasn't ketchup as a food
19:17
supplement you wouldn't have your chips
19:19
and then you'd stab the chest on the
19:21
pill catcher no it was in the old days
19:24
when they had these thing called patent
19:25
medicines
19:26
okay you know things like 7up used to be
19:28
one of those coca-cola kind of was one
19:29
as well
19:30
and ghost pepper all these things were
19:32
and ketchup pills were one of these
19:33
things that people used to take for just
19:35
their general illnesses yeah that's so
19:38
cool
19:39
and according to herodotus um egyptians
19:42
used to spend three days in every month
19:46
three successive days in every month
19:48
taking laxatives
19:49
no that's what herodotus says oh
19:51
herodotus
19:53
it wasn't either bloke who said there
19:54
were ants the size of foxes
19:56
yeah he couldn't be right about
19:57
everything yeah i reckon about this one
19:59
but they it kind of makes sense because
20:01
they feel like they're flushing you out
20:03
which actually we've learned is not a
20:04
good thing it just means it's just
20:05
another way of saying it massively
20:06
dehydrates you
20:07
but you can imagine in the olden days
20:09
they would have thought this looks like
20:10
bad stuff that's coming out
20:11
that's good yeah yes yeah definitely
20:14
there used to be reusable
20:15
laxatives so one of the most popular
20:18
laxatives was called antimony
20:20
and which is a chemical element and it
20:24
worked and it was used in the 1700s
20:26
and it's been used for loads of stuff so
20:28
i think the egyptians used it as
20:29
eyeliner but yeah it became a really
20:31
popular laxative well after it's been
20:32
used
20:36
you can wash it off rinse it in the nail
20:38
i yeah
20:40
but the good thing about this is that it
20:43
would stay completely intact through
20:44
your system so it totally flushes out
20:46
your system
20:47
then comes out on your poo and then you
20:48
pick it out and reuse it later wow
20:50
and apparently according to the source i
20:52
was reading
20:53
uh which was from university somewhere
20:56
it said some
20:56
lucky families passed down antimony
20:59
laxatives from one generation to the
21:01
next to my wife i leave the house to my
21:03
son
21:03
i leave the windows and to my other son
21:08
i leave my well used
21:16
[Music]
21:17
all right it is time for fact number
21:19
three and that
21:20
is anna my fact this week is that the
21:23
authors
21:24
thomas hardy roger kipling and joseph
21:27
conrad
21:27
have all written books the size of
21:29
postage stamps
21:31
this was for queen mary's doll's house
21:33
which is just so cool and if you haven't
21:35
seen it you showed it's a windsor castle
21:37
now
21:38
but it was commissioned in the 1920s and
21:41
it was finished in 1924
21:43
and it was built for queen mary who was
21:45
the wife of george v
21:47
and it was the idea was her cousin's
21:50
idea and her cousin princess mary louise
21:52
contacted 171 authors to write
21:56
miniature books for it so authors who
21:58
did write books for it were
22:00
j.m barry chesterton conan doyle robert
22:03
graves
22:03
huxley a.a milne edith wharton it was
22:07
every big writer of the time wrote a
22:09
small original novel for it
22:11
and they were about the size of a stamp
22:12
about three centimeters by one
22:14
centimeter
22:15
and the only refusal was from george
22:16
bernard shaw i think i think there are a
22:18
few
22:18
refusals i think virginia woolf refused
22:20
as well
22:21
i think oh well she's she's oh accounts
22:25
differ
22:25
yeah do they well no i don't clearly i
22:28
thought she wasn't asked she was
22:29
actually so she
22:30
her girlfriend at the time or lover was
22:33
vita sackville west
22:35
who was asked and who did write
22:36
something and the way i found out about
22:38
this is that they're just publishing the
22:40
thing that she wrote for the first time
22:42
in full size and they've realized that
22:45
the
22:45
novel that she wrote for this doll's
22:46
house is basically exactly the same as
22:49
orlando which was a virginia wolf's most
22:51
well one of her most famous novels and
22:53
which virginia woolf said
22:54
she was inspired to write orlando by
22:56
vitus aqua west but we've only just
22:58
realized
22:58
she literally was inspired by this idea
23:00
that hang on did she
23:02
virginia woolf plagiarize an existing
23:04
novel but we just didn't know about it
23:05
because too tiny
23:07
uh it's the same general idea as there's
23:09
an in-flight person who travels through
23:10
lots of fairy tale landscapes
23:12
discovering stuff but is most definitely
23:14
they were very very in love
23:15
um and orlando was like this whole love
23:17
letter to
23:18
jenny wolf's lover and so she was open
23:21
that she was inspired by her
23:22
but it turns out this book is lit
23:24
imagine what have we read all the other
23:25
books just to find out if there are any
23:26
other
23:27
great books that we don't know about no
23:29
i mean they do have to be quite
23:30
short because how long are they they're
23:32
about 30 words because i could come up
23:33
with you know a nymph like creature
23:35
travels through fantastical worlds and
23:36
then there's something right half the
23:37
words right there isn't it
23:38
yeah yeah but if someone wrote another
23:39
book off the back of that i wouldn't
23:41
feel too hard done by
23:42
because they've really put the hours in
23:44
yeah weirdly they got about 20 words on
23:46
a page which i think is
23:47
really impressive they have to write
23:49
very small okay me and andy are gonna
23:51
write some stickers here
23:53
i'm trying to come up with a box that's
23:54
three by one centimeter at once
23:57
i think hers was three point nine by one
23:59
point five centimeters maybe yeah see
24:01
james
24:01
i've just written once upon a time i
24:03
know it's a bit of a hack opening but
24:04
i've just written it anyway
24:05
do you know i've written exactly the
24:07
same opening
24:08
it's plagiarism you can see how this
24:11
orlando situation happens i mean we are
24:13
wildly in love with each other yeah
24:16
yeah i think i could i'd be surprised if
24:19
i could get 20 on there but maybe about
24:21
12. but you've seen i've seen photos and
24:23
they do cram on a lot more in fact they
24:24
even cram detailed drawings um a few
24:26
have been
24:27
reproduced already uh back in 2012 there
24:30
was an author's book who was made
24:34
you've double spaced yours that's the
24:35
problem there yeah
24:37
what did you tell the story would you go
24:39
for it would you go after once upon a
24:40
time once upon a time there was a tiny
24:42
pony with a nice haircut but then i've
24:43
run out of ideas oh so what have you got
24:47
james well mine didn't have quite as
24:48
nice a haircut
24:50
but it's really a love letter to you so
24:52
i think that's great
24:55
um this is an amazing doll house it's
24:57
incredible so all the stories about the
24:58
rest of the house and it was built by
25:00
was it edwin lutchins yeah the like the
25:03
biggest architect probably of the 20th
25:04
century in britain and he spent half his
25:06
time during the construction of this
25:08
house building
25:08
the city of new delhi which was 80
25:10
square miles and he spent the other half
25:12
working on a single doll's house which
25:13
was five feet high
25:14
yeah that's mad yeah so cool it was cool
25:17
wasn't it like it had
25:18
the toilets had working plumbing it had
25:20
electricity it had lifts
25:22
that worked the functional lifts yeah um
25:25
it had a cellar with 200 bottles of
25:27
chateau lafitte 1875.
25:30
no it's so incredible so
25:33
dunhill the cigarette manufacturer at
25:34
the time he donated
25:36
uh tiny cigarettes and cigars to the
25:38
house
25:39
you know all these people basically it
25:40
was a huge national project
25:43
because it was going to be the
25:43
centerpiece of the british empire
25:45
exhibition of arts and manufacturing
25:46
it's a bit like the millennium dome it
25:49
is isn't it it really is yeah but it is
25:50
it is a bit smaller than that
25:52
but aside from that it is the same yeah
25:55
but you know the one thing that wasn't
25:56
in it
25:57
any dolls really yeah there were no
26:00
dolls in this dollhouse because if you
26:02
put them in it would
26:03
grotesquely dispel the enchantment wow
26:07
so is it really a doll's house good call
26:09
yeah yeah it's just an uninhabited one
26:12
it's just it's still on the market yeah
26:13
right a house doesn't stop being a house
26:15
as soon as i leave for the day
26:17
there's a very solipsistic way of living
26:19
in the world
26:21
i like the fact that it also contains as
26:23
part of its library
26:24
a stamp album yeah so the stamps are
26:28
1 12 the size of actual stamps whereas
26:31
the books are the size of stacks
26:33
um by the way if you want to like see
26:35
all of this stuff and there's so much
26:36
more
26:37
really do go to the royal collection
26:39
trust website because it just has every
26:41
single item on there
26:42
in miniature descriptions of where it's
26:44
come from castle or go to windsor is it
26:46
on view to the public well i when i went
26:48
i saw it
26:49
years ago when i was a kid yeah the
26:50
weird thing about this place is
26:52
it was for queen mary and she was an
26:54
adult at the time it wasn't it wasn't
26:56
created for a child
26:57
and doll's houses weren't originally for
27:00
children
27:01
really oh they were markers of status so
27:03
they would the first one was made for
27:05
the duke of bavaria in 1557 who was not
27:07
a child
27:08
and then and then later on about a
27:11
century or two later
27:12
there were things called nuremberg
27:13
kitchens and these were dolls houses
27:15
right they had all kinds of stuff in
27:16
them they were full of all the household
27:17
items
27:18
but they were designed to show uh young
27:21
women
27:21
how to become the lady of the house so
27:24
it was like that you know those little
27:25
military
27:25
maps that you push little tanks around
27:27
at the soldiers yeah this is like a
27:29
domestic version of that you say right
27:30
this is how
27:31
you run the house this is how you
27:32
instruct the servants to move around it
27:34
this is how
27:34
you need to run things on a day by day
27:36
basis clean here this
27:37
that that was the purpose of the doll's
27:40
house in the 17th century
27:42
amazing it's amazing that they thought
27:44
that no one would be able to work out
27:45
how to
27:46
live in a house to tell them how to do
27:49
it
27:50
i know come on our houses were way more
27:52
complex if you lived in downton abbey or
27:54
something you had to know which scullery
27:55
you'd find which made to deal with which
27:58
pan
27:59
it was very complex um you know the game
28:01
the sims
28:02
one of the biggest games of all the time
28:04
love it right yeah awesome game
28:06
that started as a doll's house really a
28:08
real
28:09
a physical door's house a virtual doll's
28:11
house it still is a virtual door's house
28:13
yeah
28:13
but so it started as a meant to go on
28:16
yeah no this is very interesting will
28:18
wright the
28:20
creator of the sims he created a virtual
28:23
doll's house of his house
28:25
which he lost during a firestorm in 1991
28:29
and he was so upset about losing the
28:31
memories of his house that he created a
28:33
virtual
28:34
miniature version of his house on a
28:36
computer
28:37
where he just literally replicated all
28:39
the rooms so he could have a memory of
28:40
what he once had
28:42
yeah and then he saw that and thought
28:43
actually this this might be something
28:46
big and he pitched it to the people who
28:47
made
28:48
sim city and wow that's how we got to it
28:50
he called it his virtual
28:52
doll's house and did people whenever
28:53
they asked him his name
28:55
and he said we'll write did they always
28:56
say no you can just tell us don't worry
28:58
about it
29:00
some stuff on small books yeah
29:03
the smallest book according to the
29:05
guinness book of world records
29:07
is called teeny ted from turnip town and
29:10
it was made in 2007 by robert chaplin
29:13
and it's 0.97 millimeters by 0.1
29:17
millimeters and it tells the story of
29:20
teeny ted's victory in the turnip
29:22
contest at the annual county fair
29:24
spoiler alert sorry sorry 0.7
29:28
millimeters yeah i mean how is that
29:29
even well it's just small it's um
29:32
carved into micro tablets on a
29:35
polished piece of single crystalline
29:38
silicon
29:39
using a focused gallium iron beam
29:42
and now it kind of helps i don't know
29:45
science is involved how are we supposed
29:48
to read it
29:49
well i'll just tell you what happens
29:51
well he did he did a kickstarter
29:54
project or one of those crowdfunding
29:56
projects and they've printed a
29:57
large print edition but yeah since then
30:00
um
30:00
a russian guy called vladimir anitzkin
30:03
has made a book which is 0.07
30:05
millimeters the same
30:06
by 0.09 millimeters so it's
30:10
0.01 millimeters shorter
30:13
and that is a story about a fleas shoes
30:16
really yeah and he placed the finished
30:20
pages
30:20
into half of a poppy seed wow
30:23
that's how small that is because it
30:25
would rattle around in a full poppy seed
30:28
yeah and the smallest book i think you
30:30
can buy on amazon
30:32
not the best book that you can buy on
30:33
amazon are there other books available
30:36
but the smallest book is called the
30:38
smallest book in the world
30:40
and it was um from the first of
30:42
september 2001 and it measures 2.4
30:44
millimeters by 2.9 millimeters
30:46
and there is one used copy for 700
30:49
pounds
30:51
that's so good is the picture of it just
30:55
unbelievably tiny when you see the cover
30:57
art um there is a little kind of picture
31:00
and there's a picture of a matchstick
31:01
next to it
31:02
and then it says it's the size of this
31:04
matched head and there's a tiny god the
31:05
author signings must be an absolute
31:07
bastard
31:09
i'm afraid i'll need a gallium ion
31:15
[Applause]
31:16
cannon
31:19
okay it is time for our final fact of
31:21
the show and that is
31:22
andy my fact is that army and nests are
31:25
made of other army ants
31:28
so this is like a doll's house made of
31:30
dolls if you can blind your with science
31:32
or a human house made of humans
31:33
terrifying exactly yeah so they have
31:37
these weird phases of
31:38
uh living in uh one place they live in
31:40
one place while they love it growing and
31:42
then
31:43
they go on the road for a bit like a
31:44
band they tour to a different place
31:46
every night
31:47
well like a band that marches through a
31:49
jungle eating everything in its path
31:51
yeah exactly yeah so like aerosmith for
31:54
example
31:54
um so they have these three week long
31:56
roaming phases and during the roaming
31:58
phase every night they form a living
31:59
colony
32:00
and a load of the ants link together and
32:02
create a ball around the queen
32:04
and it's got tunnels and it's got
32:05
chambers but all the columns and pillars
32:08
and walls are made of army ants
32:10
so cool it's really weird they're all
32:13
alive yeah
32:14
um and they have hooks on their feet
32:16
which allow them to create these
32:17
bivouacs as they get cold i wonder do
32:20
they have
32:21
because ants are very specialized in
32:22
their roles aren't they but i wonder if
32:23
they get to be different parts of the
32:24
house like some are sofa ants
32:27
and some are shower ants
32:30
and there are about a half a million in
32:32
the colony and they lost these rating
32:33
parties about 200 000 which just pan out
32:35
and then march
32:36
as you say eating everything in their
32:37
path yeah those guys are absolutely
32:39
incredible
32:40
there's like stories of them um eating
32:43
drunk people who've passed out in the
32:44
middle of the jungle
32:45
but i never found any evidence and
32:47
that's actually true but they will eat
32:49
stuff if you know if an animal is
32:50
injured they'll just go over it and eat
32:52
it and they'll just be bones by the end
32:53
of it
32:54
yeah there are apparently 557
32:57
um associates to an army ant march
33:01
by which i mean animals that kind of
33:03
feed off them
33:04
or are helped by them so you've got
33:07
mites who live on the ants you've got
33:09
birds who
33:10
eat any insects that are running away
33:12
from the army ants
33:13
you've got butterflies who follow them
33:15
eating their droppings
33:17
um yeah more than 500 different species
33:20
are following these army ants around
33:21
living off them
33:22
there's actually a um new species that's
33:25
been found that is one of these 500 i
33:27
guess which is a new species of beetle
33:29
that's been found in costa rica
33:31
and it bites onto an army ant's bum
33:34
and pretends to be a second bum and
33:37
hitch is a ride and that's how it gets
33:38
that's how it travels and so you look at
33:40
this army and scientists looked at this
33:42
army and well it's got two asses what a
33:44
weird species of ant
33:45
and it's actually just this guy who's
33:46
got his teeth embedded in his bottom
33:48
yeah but surely it's not convincing to
33:51
pretend to be a second bum
33:52
why not because i don't know anyone
33:54
who's got two bumps
33:57
no i guess not and also ants i suppose
34:00
they can't really turn around and look
34:02
at their own bums
34:03
no no so they're just going to think
34:05
they put on a bit of weight down there
34:07
yeah that's true yeah and they're also
34:08
really polite so if they say does my bum
34:10
look okay in this they all just tell
34:11
each other yeah it looks great
34:13
which one
34:14
[Laughter]
34:18
um here's another weird thing that they
34:20
do this is army ants
34:21
have you guys heard of an ant mill i'd
34:23
never heard of this before
34:25
okay this is when army ants um are in a
34:28
big group of army ants are going out and
34:30
it's to do with what it said is um when
34:33
they're blind
34:34
and so i don't know how they're all
34:35
blind ah okay right so they're all blind
34:38
thank you that makes so much sense to
34:39
this now it's what is they lose the
34:40
pheromone track of where they're on
34:42
so one of them leads them astray and
34:44
they all head off and then suddenly
34:46
they're lost as a pack
34:47
but then what they start to do is follow
34:49
one another and it eventually turns into
34:51
a circle
34:52
and they just walk in a circle till they
34:54
die of starvation basically it's just a
34:56
continuous circle where they think
34:57
they're walking back it's like being in
34:59
a conga but the back of the conga joins
35:01
the front of the conga
35:02
yeah and you just conquer until you all
35:03
die exactly yeah very sad way to go
35:06
to do it i mean it's not a sad way to go
35:09
it's the happiest i think it's a sad way
35:11
i think i wouldn't want to go to that
35:12
wedding people always say what's the
35:14
best way of dying
35:16
you know like some people say there are
35:17
some ways of dying where you have like
35:19
euphoria just before you die isn't there
35:21
do you think that you're saying the
35:22
death conga is like
35:24
it's the happiest it's pretty well it's
35:26
quite happy is it how you would want to
35:27
go
35:28
absolutely or death by you know that
35:32
one where you sit down on the dance
35:33
floor and pretend you're rowing a boat
35:36
oh that's a great move maybe oops upside
35:38
your head oh yeah that would be a good
35:39
way to go because you're doing the conga
35:41
thing but you're also sat down i feel a
35:42
bit more comfortable
35:44
yeah the ants don't do that one though
35:47
and they don't have even the music for
35:49
the conga line
35:49
i do think it's quite a bad way to go
35:51
that's a real tragedy actually
35:53
a tragedy now that dance would be a good
35:55
one yes
35:57
now um ants do sometimes make noises
36:00
though
36:00
not music and not 90s pop heads but they
36:03
don't make noises
36:05
you listen closely they're going hey
36:08
pivot there's an ant ness beetle which
36:10
can speak
36:11
three different dialects of ants
36:13
depending on which nest it goes into
36:16
so they do it by stridulation which
36:18
means you're kind of rubbing one body
36:20
part on the other but they know
36:21
three different dialects and they'll go
36:23
into a nest and pretend to be that ant
36:25
but if they get that accent slightly
36:27
wrong the other ants kill them and eat
36:28
them
36:30
because that's like kind of going to a
36:32
bar in newcastle and speaking with a
36:33
geordie accent
36:35
and they realize it's not a jordy accent
36:37
and then they kill you and eat you
36:38
so actually i mean it's a different
36:40
language it's like going to a bar in
36:41
france and speaking with the wrong
36:42
french accent
36:43
terrifying yeah they're weirdly just so
36:46
that was a beetle that speaks these
36:47
different accents right
36:49
so there are other beatles who have
36:51
evolved
36:52
to look like army ants so they can sneak
36:54
in to the to the army and nests
36:56
and they have developed a gland which
36:59
can squirt
37:00
a chemical at the ants and blast them
37:02
out of the way so which
37:03
it allows them to make their escape if
37:04
they're ever rumbled by the ants
37:06
but these beetles spend their whole
37:08
lives living in the colony
37:10
you spent your whole life surrounded by
37:12
a hostile species and it looks
37:13
ridiculous
37:14
right because because they're blind so
37:16
they don't know but to us when you see
37:18
pictures of it it's just like that's
37:19
obviously not one of you guys i actually
37:21
didn't realize they were blind i just
37:22
thought the answer was stupid
37:24
i didn't know that but actually that
37:25
explains why they couldn't see that they
37:27
had two bumps
37:29
yes it does god that one little detail
37:31
has revealed
37:32
so much about this we've collected does
37:34
my bum look good in this
37:35
i don't know i'm blind
37:38
they do have when they find meat they
37:40
transport it to what they call a booty
37:42
cash
37:43
so that kind of fits the baby they don't
37:44
call it that yeah that's a good point
37:46
yeah
37:47
they something they can do with their
37:48
bodies which is really clever um
37:50
is that they plug any holes in the
37:52
ground or any obstacles
37:54
and this speeds up their progress
37:55
anywhere but they're really smart about
37:57
it so as they're going along in these
37:59
you know big troops of hundreds of
38:00
thousands of ants
38:01
they'll come across a little hole or a
38:03
tiny little bump
38:04
that maybe we couldn't even see and they
38:08
measure up their bodies as they go past
38:10
to see which of them is the right size
38:11
for the hole
38:12
and then the right size ant will splay
38:14
out over that hole
38:15
and spend hours while the other ants
38:17
just go back and forth over him if
38:19
they're collect
38:19
foraging or anything and scientists have
38:21
literally they've drilled slightly
38:23
different sized holes in a plank of wood
38:25
and they watch the ants go and they
38:26
measure themselves up against the hole
38:27
they're like no i'm too big for that one
38:29
barry you're on this and the different
38:31
size ants go
38:32
and then spend hours spread out over
38:33
these things like lemmings the game
38:35
isn't it
38:36
do you remember that game yeah and you
38:38
would have holes and they all
38:39
did different things to get you past
38:41
those holes but then everyone would just
38:42
keep marching over you and stuff
38:43
yeah just like that yeah maybe they
38:46
based it on them but do you think they
38:47
like it
38:48
i think or do you think they get to a
38:50
whole negative that's the same size as
38:51
me
38:52
yeah i think it's that they try they
38:53
sound tiptoes and go no i'm definitely
38:54
too tall for this one
38:57
but they do they do
39:00
[Laughter]
39:05
so can i just say not all army ants are
39:08
blind
39:08
oh no there are lots of different
39:09
species of them and the ones that have
39:12
the ant mills are blind
39:13
right but not all species are yeah is
39:16
there
39:16
is there sometimes a big hole that the
39:17
beetle has to get into
39:21
the way yeah
39:25
it's very cool though because if you're
39:28
sitting in the hole
39:29
you don't get to get any of the food
39:31
that the ants are finding you don't get
39:33
any prey but
39:33
they save you some when you get home
39:36
they get a meal when they get back
39:37
because for the work they've done for
39:39
the colony that is the least they can do
39:41
i think
39:43
um so some ant nests these are not army
39:45
ants now but these are this is a
39:46
different species of ant
39:47
it's actually called the hairy northern
39:49
wood and um
39:51
some of the ant nests have essentially
39:52
listed building status
39:55
really in the uk the british forestry
39:58
commission have
39:58
mapped and said these must be preserved
40:01
and it's a little skyscraper city of ant
40:03
nests up to two meters high
40:05
made by ants which is bigger relative to
40:09
the empire state building is to a human
40:11
yeah
40:12
and they're all made of pine needles and
40:13
there are 69 of them which have been
40:15
found and plotted
40:16
and they are basically preserved because
40:18
the british forestry commission have
40:20
said
40:21
you have to uh look after these so you
40:22
can't build a conservatory on it or
40:24
anything no you can't
40:25
no but who's going to stop an ant if it
40:27
wants to make a conservatory that's true
40:29
they're not going to get planning
40:30
permission but actually conservative
40:32
would be really good for them
40:33
because they need no it would because
40:36
they
40:36
need heat right and the way that the
40:38
ants get heat is
40:40
some of the workarounds will go outside
40:41
sunbathe for a bit soak up heat and then
40:43
quickly go back in and release the heat
40:45
into the nest
40:46
and that's their method of warming up
40:47
their nest so a conservatory would be
40:49
much better for them
40:51
yeah well and they're farmers aren't
40:53
they a lot of ants are farmers so a
40:54
conservatory would be great for growing
40:55
their food
40:56
there are a lot of ants that can't bite
40:58
into seeds because their teeth aren't
41:00
strong enough their animals aren't
41:00
strong enough
41:01
and so instead what they do is which is
41:03
a really long-winded way of getting a
41:04
meal
41:04
is that they plant the seeds they
41:06
fertilize them with their own feces they
41:08
wait for them to grow
41:09
germinate and split for the husk to
41:10
split and then they can eat the stuff
41:12
inside
41:13
which is quite a long time to wait if
41:14
you're really hungry but it is yeah
41:16
you've got to plan your dinner parties
41:17
well in advance
41:19
and did you guys know that uh ants
41:21
mandelbills used to be used and still
41:23
are used i think in bits of east africa
41:25
to stitch up wounds they get an ant and
41:28
the mandibles are just the right size of
41:29
certain ants to
41:30
uh heal up a wound and then they make
41:33
they'll make an ant
41:34
bite into the sides of a wound of a cut
41:37
and then it'll the sort of little teeth
41:39
will pull the skin together
41:41
and then they cut the ant's body away
41:43
and the teeth just sit there
41:44
healing up the wound so they decapitate
41:47
the end once it's
41:48
acted as a stitch it's actually more
41:49
like de-body-tating than i think
41:51
because yeah you're chopping the body
41:53
off the effect is much the same
41:55
yeah that's just semantics great news
41:59
don't worry we've managed to get your
42:00
sentence commuted from decapitation
42:03
to debation um andy
42:07
do you have a relative in north carolina
42:10
called
42:10
joan not that i know okay i was reading
42:13
the story a lady called joan murray in
42:16
america
42:17
she went parachuting skydiving and
42:21
this is extraordinary her parachute
42:22
didn't open so she plummeted
42:25
to the earth she approached the ground
42:27
at 80 miles an hour
42:28
and as she landed she landed on a mound
42:31
of fire ants
42:33
and doctors reckon i got this off
42:35
wikipedia doctors
42:36
reckon that the shock of having been
42:38
stung over 200 times by the ants as she
42:41
landed on them
42:42
released a surge of adrenaline in her
42:44
that kept her heart beating
42:46
so that when the emergency services got
42:48
there and she's still alive to this day
42:50
wow wow i wouldn't have thought
42:53
hitting into the ground after your
42:55
parachute not opening i wouldn't thought
42:56
the thing that killed you would be a
42:57
heart
42:58
attack i would have thought it'd be the
43:00
crunching up of all of your bodily bones
43:02
and organs
43:04
but if you landed on a mound yeah and
43:06
then they repaired all your wounds with
43:08
their mandibles yes
43:10
they stitch you as you land do you think
43:12
they all basically caught her maybe
43:14
yeah effectively i guess you do have
43:16
accounts of people falling on
43:17
i don't know trees and hay bales and
43:19
stuff like that and managing to survive
43:21
so supposedly she did her heart stopped
43:24
and then
43:24
she got bit so many times she just got
43:26
it stories like this that the phrase
43:28
citation needed was it
43:33
no i i do believe that they do actually
43:34
say don't they that often if you're
43:36
falling out of a building or something
43:37
that what
43:42
ants are so strong relative to their
43:44
body size
43:48
from this height all those people look
43:49
like us
43:51
oh no i'm one foot away from the floor
43:57
they don't say any of that they just say
44:00
that you have a heart attack on the way
44:01
down often that kills you
44:03
do they oh yeah yeah i think they do so
44:06
it is plausible wow not such a stupid
44:08
fact
44:09
if you guys weren't so busy mocking what
44:11
i said before
44:12
i might have stepped in to save you
44:13
earlier
44:20
okay that's it that is all of our facts
44:22

01:54
okay on with the podcast
02:10
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:13
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
02:16
this week coming to you from northern
02:25
my name is dan schreiber and i am
02:27
sitting here with anna chazinski
02:29
drew hunter murray and james harkin
02:32
and once again we have gathered round
02:34
the microphones with our four favorite
02:36
facts from the last seven days and in no
02:38
particular order
02:40
here we go starting with you james
02:43
harkin
02:43
okay my fact this week is that in 1766
02:48
there was a cheese riot in nottingham
02:52
where the mayor of nottingham was
02:53
knocked over by a large
02:55
cheese
02:55
[Laughter]
02:59
so was was the cheese rioting
03:04
how did that work so what it was is i
03:06
mean i'm preaching to people who know
03:08
all about this in nottingham i'm sure
03:10
but this was a goose fair you all know
03:12
what the goose fare is right
03:14
um and basically things became tense
03:17
when some
03:18
rude lads engaged several
03:21
lincolnshire traders who had purchased
03:24
up to 600 of
03:25
cheese these aren't my words by the way
03:28
i'm reading
03:30
and basically what they didn't want to
03:32
happen is that those nasty people from
03:34
lincoln should come and get all the
03:35
cheese and then there's no cheese for
03:37
people from
03:37
nottingham so then that kind of started
03:40
a bit of a riot and then suddenly there
03:41
were
03:42
crowds running around they were grabbing
03:44
cheeses and rolling them down the
03:45
streets
03:46
so these they're not like little baby
03:48
bells or slices of cheese like you get
03:50
now they're big wheels of cheese right
03:52
although if you if you released a lot of
03:53
baby bells that could knock someone over
03:55
underfoot
03:55
by making the ground slippery yeah i
03:58
haven't thought about this before but
04:00
i feel as if i have and basically after
04:04
that everything kind of kicked off so
04:06
um a load of people went down the river
04:08
trench to search for warehouses looking
04:10
for more cheese
04:13
um the next day a guy was shot by a
04:15
soldier
04:16
uh he was trying to defend his cheese
04:19
come on i still think too soon actually
04:21
for that
04:23
um but actually the soldiers were on his
04:24
side it was like a friendly fire thing
04:27
uh and then the whole thing came to an
04:29
end when the mob tried and failed to
04:30
burn down a windmill
04:32
ah and the mayor himself achieved what
04:36
rolled towards him
04:37
well he was coming to try and calm
04:39
things down and basically someone
04:40
chucked a cheese at him
04:42
[Music]
04:44
okay cool but and it knocked him over
04:46
knocked him over mate
04:47
was he quite a small man sounds like he
04:50
was a small man
04:50
i i don't know how big he was it was the
04:52
olden days they were all small
04:54
yeah so maybe baby bells were massive to
04:57
them
04:59
it is an amazing bit of history really
05:02
i've never heard of before
05:03
yeah yeah did you guys already know
05:05
about the cheese riot
05:07
yeah wait wait did anyone not know about
05:09
the cheese riot
05:12
and the cheese right guys were lying i
05:14
think um
05:15
nottingham's got some cool food history
05:18
so did you know that you guys have
05:19
the uh bramley apple grand great
05:22
grandfather
05:23
and a bunch of japanese tourists i think
05:25
came to nottingham about five years ago
05:27
to visit it didn't they
05:28
because so this is the one bramley apple
05:30
tree in nottingham from which
05:32
every single bramley apple comes and
05:35
it's so
05:35
popular now that variety of apple in
05:37
japan that the
05:39
mayor of a town in japan and all the
05:41
people from his town
05:42
flew over and visited it
05:46
they chartered 60 planes
05:51
a percentage of the people um i have a
05:54
couple of cheese facts oh yeah just
05:56
historical cheese facts so the first
05:59
euro vision
06:00
was a cheese competition in a sense and
06:04
the phrase in a sense is doing a lot of
06:05
work in that sentence but there was a
06:07
there was a massive after napoleon was
06:09
defeated in 1815 there was a massive
06:11
uh you know uh congress it was called
06:13
the congress of vienna
06:14
and it was working out the terms for all
06:16
the nations in europe and the terms of
06:17
france's surrender
06:18
and talirand one of the ministers there
06:21
he said
06:21
why don't we lighten things up a bit
06:23
with a cheese competition and every
06:25
nation submitted their own cheeses
06:26
who won they all voted for their own
06:28
cheeses
06:29
[Laughter]
06:31
so that's how it was like eurovision
06:33
right they didn't give france a special
06:35
award for the brie
06:36
but they basically all said we think it
06:38
got cheese is best i think if
06:40
nottingham's anything is that cheese
06:41
contests don't lighten things up
06:43
they actually made things turn pretty
06:45
ugly
06:46
um i always there's a sort of famous
06:48
fact that the dutch once killed and ate
06:51
their prime minister in a riot
06:52
um so this is my favorite riot this is
06:55
sorry this famous fact is famous
06:56
amongst people like us isn't it yeah
06:59
maybe it's not famous outside of this
07:00
stage
07:01
yeah there's a fact that my favorite
07:03
riot is that the dutch once killed and
07:05
ate their prime minister
07:06
and this is in the 1600s wasn't it and i
07:09
always
07:10
like that they ate their prime minister
07:12
in order to replace him
07:14
with an orange so this is when the
07:16
orange dynasty came in
07:19
right not an actual orange yeah sorry
07:21
because that would have been so crazy
07:22
because they should have just eaten the
07:23
orange
07:23
exactly yeah but that's kind of what it
07:25
implies anyway eat william of orange and
07:27
leave paul johan dewitt who doesn't even
07:29
have a name who sounds like food
07:30
to rule the country just quickly this is
07:32
the first time i've been to nottingham
07:34
uh i was unbelievably excited to
07:37
discover that you guys have a sheriff
07:39
still
07:40
i mean that is that's so cool and i
07:42
didn't know this looking into
07:44
him he was born on robin hood street
07:48
yeah the current sheriff of nottingham
07:49
was born on robin hood street
07:52
another nottingham fact you have a lot
07:53
of caves here
07:59
[Laughter]
08:02
there are over 700 caves under the
08:04
streets of nottingham
08:05
and the man who's in charge of
08:07
cataloging them um he had to have
08:09
confined
08:09
space training before he could do his
08:11
job and his name is mr dave
08:13
strange walker awesome
08:17
i have another fact about trees and
08:18
caves no yes
08:20
genuinely so in the 1980s um america
08:24
had a 30 million pound stockpile of
08:27
cheese in a cave
08:28
there was a massive cheese surplus in
08:30
america because they they had over
08:32
produced it and they stored it all in
08:34
caves in missouri it was worth by 1983
08:36
it was worth 4 billion
08:38
dollars and the thing is it's still
08:41
happening it's still a massive dairy
08:42
surplus in america
08:43
and there's this shadowy body called
08:45
dairy management which is desperate
08:48
to get are they big cheeses
08:55
they genuinely are because so for
08:57
example they're constantly trying to
08:58
push more cheese onto people
09:00
um so for example they they helped
09:02
domino's the pizza company
09:04
develop a line of pizzas which had 40
09:06
more cheese
09:07
and then they lobbied mcdonald's they
09:08
said when you put some more cheese on
09:09
the cheeseburgers go on
09:11
wow that's amazing the first time the
09:13
word mammoth was used
09:15
to describe something big was about a
09:16
cheese really was it
09:18
yeah prior to the actual mammoth it was
09:21
a description
09:22
of a cheese well actually they called
09:24
the mammoths mammoths whether they were
09:25
big or not
09:27
so even if you had a small mama if it
09:28
was still called the mouth yeah yeah
09:30
they never before had referred to a
09:32
mammoth mammoth until they referred to a
09:34
mammoth cheese is what james is saying
09:35
so the word mammoth meaning oh this is
09:37
massive
09:38
yeah that was a cheese first that was a
09:40
cheese first yeah and then they saw a
09:41
mammoth and they're like that's like
09:42
that cheese we saw
09:47
you've sort of got the idea
09:51
um it was a famous cheese you know about
09:52
it anna don't you yeah
09:54
it was the presidential cheese right
09:56
which resident was it that it was given
09:57
to it was jefferson that was given to
09:59
yeah and um what it was is at the time
10:01
they just found mastodon
10:03
skeletons in america in the far
10:06
west and they didn't know they thought
10:08
maybe there were massive mammoths living
10:10
over there so it was a big kind of
10:11
mammoth
10:12
frenzy in america at the time and then
10:14
they also gave him this cheese and
10:15
thought what does that remind us of
10:17
those things that don't exist of course
10:20
i have a favorite animal related riot
10:23
okay
10:24
um do you guys know about the eel
10:26
pulling riot no
10:27
no this is in 1886 in amsterdam
10:31
and um there there used to be this uh
10:34
tradition where you'd hang an eel i
10:36
don't even know what it was suspended of
10:37
above but you'd hang an eel above the
10:39
canals in amsterdam and it would be a
10:40
live eel and be riding around and the
10:42
point was you had to sail
10:43
under it on your boat or motor not motor
10:46
on it under it probably but go under it
10:47
on your boat and you had to jump up and
10:49
try and catch the eel
10:51
and most people fell in the water and it
10:53
was quite comical and it sounds quite
10:55
fun
10:55
and it was banned because it was deemed
10:57
cruel to animals which is very forward
10:59
thinking for the 1886
11:00
people and people were so angry about
11:03
the crackdown because they loved eel
11:05
pulling so much that they completely
11:07
rioted and 26 people were killed in 1886
11:09
in amsterdam
11:11
because they demanded to have their eel
11:13
pulling but the eel survived apparently
11:15
that's incredible
11:16
have you guys heard about the police
11:17
riots this is the thing that happened in
11:18
new york in the 1850s these are so cool
11:21
there was a time in the 1850s in new
11:23
york where there were two
11:24
rival police forces in new york
11:27
what could go wrong everything
11:29
everything went wrong the state had
11:30
created a police force and that was an
11:32
official one but the mayor who was from
11:33
the other political party had his own
11:35
police force already established and the
11:37
state was trying to take over it and
11:39
what they started doing the two forces
11:40
they started stealing criminals from
11:42
each other
11:44
so they would arrest someone and then
11:46
the other police would turn up and say
11:47
we're having him and then the police
11:48
would start beating each other up to try
11:50
and arrest the criminal
11:51
well but then presumably they have to
11:52
arrest each other for beating each other
11:56
the whole thing eventually ended up in a
11:57
massive brawl between 850 police
11:59
officers
12:00
all the way through all the way through
12:02
the city hall wow yeah
12:04
you know toronto was shaped by toronto
12:07
policing
12:08
was shaped by a riot between clowns and
12:11
firemen
12:12
so well there was this riot in 1855 when
12:15
clowns were a bit more hardcore
12:17
um and it uh it took place in a brothel
12:20
as i think quite a lot of riots did what
12:22
the clowns in the brothel
12:23
uh they were they were all in the
12:24
brothel it was awesome
12:26
they'd taken their noses off it was they
12:28
weren't on the job at the time
12:30
they were on a job but they were not
12:34
and they i'm afraid it'll be extra to
12:36
smell your flower sir
12:42
oh big feet you know what they say
12:47
[Applause]
12:49
so that that happened then the
12:50
firefighters turned up and then
12:53
this fight broke out um i can't i don't
12:55
know what was a rivalry over but the
12:57
firefighters just started on the clowns
12:58
maybe the clowns the clowns had just
12:59
come to town so they were using their
13:01
prostitutes maybe
13:02
and this huge fight broke out and a
13:04
policeman came to break up the whole
13:06
malay
13:07
and it ended up with a lot of people
13:09
being really badly injured
13:10
and i think actually they went and met
13:12
again a couple of days later so they
13:14
established this rivalry like the jets
13:15
and the sharks and west side story
13:17
and so they agreed to meet a couple of
13:19
days later and the clowns and the
13:21
firemen met again
13:22
and then a fight started because a
13:24
fireman knocked a hat off a clown's head
13:27
and everyone got wounded and
13:30
because of that the police force was
13:32
regulated
13:33
and rules were introduced as to how you
13:34
put down a riot and how you don't let
13:36
things get out of hand
13:38
and those rules still remain today do
13:39
you know the good thing about arresting
13:41
a bunch of clowns is you don't need as
13:43
many police cars because you can
13:47
at least 20 into each okay time for fact
13:50
number two and that is
13:51
andrew hunter murray my fact is that
13:53
baby robins sometimes eats so many
13:55
caterpillars they turn
13:56
green this happens um
14:00
there's there's a new book out called
14:02
the robin a biography it's by a guy
14:03
called steven moss
14:05
appropriate ish they turn green
14:08
oh yeah yeah yeah boss is green
14:12
[Laughter]
14:14
it can be like brown sometimes yeah
14:19
well uh they turn green uh because they
14:21
eat a lot of caterpillars and the
14:22
caterpillars are green
14:24
and so they just change color not all
14:25
caterpillars are green do they term
14:27
whatever color the caterpillar is this
14:28
fact has been patented
14:30
[Laughter]
14:32
i'll bring you a good fact about robin's
14:34
turning green is it um
14:36
is it just the breast that goes green or
14:38
is it the whole robin i don't know
14:42
wait you didn't even look at a photo of
14:44
your face it's very hard to find a photo
14:45
of a green robin
14:46
suspicious very suspicious although baby
14:49
robbins don't have red breasts do they
14:51
uh i don't know so red breasts are the
14:53
sign that you're ready to fight
14:54
so i think robins are really famous for
14:56
being very pugnacious aren't they they
14:58
you know anyone comes near their
14:59
territory
15:00
they sing that beautiful song which
15:01
means get the out of here and they
15:03
have that big red breast which means get
15:05
the out of here
15:06
and so baby robins for their first sort
15:08
of year they don't have red breasts
15:10
because that's sort of an invitation to
15:11
fight
15:12
um it's something you display when
15:13
you're ready to you know get in the
15:15
boxing ring yeah it's true because
15:16
robins will attack anything that's red
15:18
won't they
15:18
if you just give them a little bit of
15:19
red cloth or something like a tiger's
15:21
bull fighter
15:22
so cool do they
15:26
really yeah they do
15:30
they do they they they do die so much
15:33
they murder each other a lot they
15:34
they'll peck each other at the base of
15:36
the skull to break each other's spinal
15:38
cords
15:38
they're vicious bastards yeah they are i
15:41
didn't know this um
15:42
red breast robin redbreast redbreast is
15:45
their surname
15:47
well explain yourself
15:50
so okay in the 16th century in the end
15:54
in the 15th century in the 15th century
15:55
they used to give human names
15:56
to familiar species so it was a red
15:59
breast but then they would be like
16:00
robin how are you doing it's a robin red
16:02
breast so red breast was a surname
16:04
and red breast it shouldn't be red
16:06
breast it should be raw and
16:07
orange breast because they have orange
16:09
breasts but wait you haven't
16:11
sorry you just befuddled us with
16:13
changing red to orange and going down
16:15
that line yeah so
16:16
are you saying that they used to call
16:18
birds
16:20
that's true actually like i think one of
16:22
them's mavis isn't it like a is it a
16:23
thrush or something they call maybe
16:25
something
16:25
really yeah and robin is the only
16:28
christian human name that's stuck around
16:30
in the species i think that's right
16:31
rather than red breasts yeah maybe
16:33
thrush that was how but then
16:36
what you're saying actually the other
16:38
bit is quite true as well which is that
16:40
they
16:40
they don't have red breasts today right
16:42
they they have orange breasts but
16:43
back then in the 15th century we didn't
16:45
have the word
16:46
red amazingly we just didn't have the
16:49
words so
16:50
they said that's that's orange because
16:51
that's what they associated as
16:53
they lumped into we didn't have the word
16:55
orange
16:58
that's why we called them red because
17:02
we did have the word red
17:05
i usually i can save that in the edit
17:07
but i think it might have been
17:09
yeah no so the opposite of what i said
17:11
is true
17:14
you know they they measure the size of
17:16
the red
17:18
orange part of robin's breast because uh
17:20
scientists wanted to know whether they
17:21
grow or shrink or whether they're
17:23
particularly big when they're trying to
17:24
mate
17:24
and you know how they do this it's kind
17:27
of sweet um so
17:28
this is a study in spain that was done a
17:30
couple of years ago and they catch the
17:31
robins and
17:32
the in the study report it said we
17:35
placed it gently on its back on a table
17:38
um and i imagine then tied it down
17:40
because i don't think a robin lies on
17:41
its back on a table unless you do
17:43
um and then they get a bit of tracing
17:45
paper and they just put it around the
17:47
front of the robin and they trace around
17:49
the red bit through it
17:50
and then they measured all the bits and
17:52
they deduce the male red breasts get
17:54
bigger with age and females don't
17:56
so that's that's basic science you could
17:58
do that in science class
18:00
that's really cool yeah and you know
18:03
robins go through puberty every year
18:05
every year every year imagine that wow
18:08
so towards the summer when the days get
18:10
longer their brains get flooded with
18:12
hormones
18:14
the gonads grow and the males start
18:16
learning songs to kind of attract women
18:19
not women sorry i was going back to my
18:23
own previous economics
18:27
and then in the winter they they go back
18:29
down again they're going to shrink and
18:31
their hormones
18:31
flush out their system and then every
18:33
summer they they get this puberty
18:35
god it's amazing that isn't it i mean
18:37
women get that once a month so
18:39
my sympathy doesn't extend too far but
18:42
they'll nest anywhere apparently so they
18:44
um they
18:45
they'll pick any nesting site and i was
18:47
reading a bit of a review of a book in
18:50
the telegraph about robbins
18:51
that listed a series of nesting sites uh
18:53
that they'd made
18:55
so plant pots a pigeon hole in a desk
18:58
the engine of a world war ii plane in
19:00
the body of a dead cat
19:02
um well that took a real turn anna
19:07
that was really sweet right till the end
19:11
sweet revenge i think and then there was
19:14
one that made its nest on an unmade bed
19:16
while the bed's owner was downstairs
19:18
having breakfast and the owner came
19:19
upstairs again and thought
19:21
that sweet and allowed it to nest there
19:23
and incubate its eggs
19:24
and it didn't tell me this article what
19:26
the owner slept on for the subsequent
19:28
however long it takes
19:29
i think he slept in a dead cat
19:34
um i was looking at what would happen
19:37
whether caterpillars can change colour
19:38
from eating things
19:40
okay i just thought there might be
19:41
something out there and i found the
19:42
paper on the internet
19:44
called the effect of blue dye in the
19:46
food of caterpillar species
19:48
vanessa carduli i couldn't quite find
19:50
out which paper this was from but it's
19:52
genuinely there
19:53
and they said our experiment had lots of
19:55
problems
19:56
first we did not record all our results
19:58
correctly
20:00
[Laughter]
20:05
so what they wanted to do they wanted to
20:06
check whether the caterpillars um when
20:09
they had the blue dye whether they'd be
20:10
blue when they became butterflies
20:12
so first they did not record all of
20:14
those results correctly
20:15
next we miscalculated the number of dead
20:17
butterflies in each group
20:19
then we mixed up all the labels
20:21
[Laughter]
20:25
next some of our butterflies fell off
20:27
their cups
20:29
and then one of our group members
20:31
knocked over the bin for the control
20:32
group
20:36
and then it said all of these mistakes
20:38
affected our results in some way
20:42
um i read about a animal it's a really
20:44
odd thing it's a
20:45
cave dwelling crocodile which crocodiles
20:48
don't
20:49
dwell in caves so this was quite a big
20:51
finding and they were studying them for
20:52
ages because they couldn't work out why
20:54
they were doing it and the thing that
20:55
really stuck out about them was that
20:56
they were bright orange
20:58
and crocodiles are not bright orange so
21:00
they were they were like oh that's
21:02
two things we need to look at now and
21:04
the orange thing that they couldn't work
21:05
out for ages it turns out
21:07
that there were bats living inside the
21:08
cave and they would poo
21:10
into the cave water where the crocodiles
21:12
were
21:13
and these crocodiles were being dyed
21:15
orange
21:16
by bat poo but it was like in the water
21:19
and then the water was dying it was like
21:20
going into like a
21:21
one of those t-shirt tie-dye things and
21:23
it was just yeah it just
21:24
dyed them and so for a while we had this
21:27
mysterious orange crocodile
21:29
but it turns out they're just covered in
21:30
21:32
have you guys seen waxwing birds like
21:34
cedar wax wings so they're these birds
21:36
that
21:37
they have really brightly colored yellow
21:40
tips on their tails
21:41
and on some of their feathers and so
21:44
they've had this forever and ever as
21:45
long as we know and then there's a cedar
21:47
wax wing that lives in north america
21:49
which has this really bright yellow tip
21:51
of its tail
21:52
and in the last 50 years it's suddenly
21:55
been turning red
21:56
and this is because a bunch of asian
21:59
honeysuckle has been brought into north
22:01
america and it has these bright red
22:02
berries
22:03
and they eat these really really red
22:05
berries and it's changing the color of
22:06
them so the cedar wax swing is changing
22:08
color as a species
22:10
because it's eating all these red
22:12
berries that is
22:13
amazing imagine well the lauren didn't
22:17
do anything for you no
22:18
no it was good i was just imagining if
22:20
humans all started
22:22
drinking sunny delight or something yes
22:23
exciting it happens it does happen
22:26
so babies sometimes turn orange if they
22:28
have too much um
22:29
is it carotene in the system i need yeah
22:31
two too many carrots too much orange
22:33
juice and your baby will turn orange
22:34
yeah i've just had a baby
22:41
i just know what the report's gonna read
22:43
like afterwards firstly we mixed up all
22:45
the babies
22:45
[Laughter]
22:49
um okay it is time for fact number three
22:51
and that is my fact
22:53
my fact this week is that the russian
22:55
communist leader
22:56
vladimir lenin spoke with an irish
22:59
accent
23:02
okay oh the russian communist leader
23:04
vladimir lenin
23:06
so um i i think we need to specify that
23:09
this is not him speaking russian in an
23:11
irish language no
23:12
no it's when he spoke english he was
23:14
taught by an irish tutor
23:16
and the way that he spoke he just
23:17
carried so whenever people how do we how
23:20
do we know that this
23:21
is true like is there a recording of him
23:23
no singing danny boy or something
23:26
the russians have admitted to it they
23:28
said that this is it's not a crime to
23:29
speak with an irish accent dan
23:31
it's weird because the russians admit to
23:33
so little and yeah they are willing to
23:34
give this away
23:36
yeah i was a terrible investigative
23:38
journalist when i was going did you do
23:39
the hacking no
23:40
okay the accent thing yes great
23:44
i'm out of here no um he was taught we
23:46
also know it because h.g wells met him
23:48
and they they had a conversation and he
23:50
came away going that was the weirdest
23:52
conversation because i was talking to an
23:53
irishman but it was
23:55
russian communist leader vladimir
23:58
uh what's his name well apparently lenin
24:02
spoke with what's called a rathmines
24:04
accent and rathmines apparently i've
24:06
never heard of it is a particular
24:08
area of dublin and he had an accent from
24:10
this area
24:11
and it meant that not only would people
24:13
in england have struggled to understand
24:14
him but people in ireland would have
24:16
struggled to understand
24:18
yeah did you guys know that the um posh
24:22
you you know the posh american accent
24:24
that's in all the hollywood films of the
24:26
20s and 30s like the katherine hepburn
24:28
classic i can't impersonate it but i
24:31
imagine catherine hurban in a film or
24:33
bette davis or someone that
24:35
posh-american accent
24:36
is not an accent so no one real had that
24:40
accent
24:40
that was an accent that was created for
24:42
hollywood so that kind of american
24:44
english
24:45
hybrid of the 20s 30s 40s and then it
24:48
was suddenly phased out in the 50s when
24:50
they thought it was a bit weird
24:52
was they got accent coaches in to train
24:54
people to speak like that
24:56
and they thought it would make them
24:57
sound more educated because it had that
24:58
english vibe and the only people who
25:01
spoke with that voice were hollywood
25:02
actresses and actors
25:03
that is amazing that's weird this is
25:06
really weird yeah
25:07
is that so as in when you then heard
25:10
their real voice
25:11
in real life it was completely different
25:13
yeah i mean i think they got voice
25:15
coaches to teach them how to just speak
25:17
like that
25:18
rightly but yeah i read eva green do you
25:21
remember
25:21
she was the um she was in the casino
25:24
royale reboot with daniel craig
25:26
james bond um she's french and when she
25:29
did all the interviews and i didn't know
25:30
that when i saw the movie because she
25:32
she did it with a british accent but in
25:34
the interviews
25:35
she thought that people are just going
25:37
to be so bothered by the fact that i
25:38
have a french accent she did
25:40
all her publicity in the english accent
25:42
that she was really really convincing
25:44
yeah you wouldn't know what did you
25:46
notice him no i was the same with dick
25:47
van dyke actually
25:50
yeah poor dick venture
25:54
last year he apologized for the accident
25:56
for the first time ever
25:58
oh i'm terribly sorry
25:59
[Laughter]
26:02
he by the way he was in the news a few
26:03
years ago because he loved dick van dyke
26:05
yeah and he fell asleep on his surfboard
26:07
and he got carried out into the ocean
26:10
yeah that is a relaxed surfer
26:14
yeah and he woke up and he was in the
26:15
middle of the ocean and he was being
26:17
carried by currents and he didn't know
26:18
where he was and he said a bunch of
26:20
porpoises came up
26:21
and they guided him back to shore and
26:24
otherwise we would have no more dick van
26:25
dyke he would have gone off into the
26:26
ocean
26:27
guys on accents do you know
26:30
you know paddy ashdown former lib dem
26:32
leader
26:34
do you know what his name was uh ashdown
26:37
yeah so his name is not a funny name his
26:39
name is jeremy um but
26:41
he was irish and the reason we call him
26:44
paddy ashdown
26:45
is that he went to boarding school in
26:46
england and everyone called him paddy
26:48
because he had an irish accent
26:51
and he said i just feel comfortable with
26:52
honey now
26:54
isn't that bizarre and he you know
26:56
openly embraced it
26:58
and i suppose it was a different time
27:00
but how much town is jeremy ashdown
27:02
were it not for xenophobia wow
27:07
um well on that so there was a study in
27:10
2015
27:11
on um the way people perceive different
27:12
accents because obviously there are
27:13
dozens of accidents all over the uk
27:15
and they have different you know
27:16
perceptions that come with them there
27:18
was a study uh that found
27:20
uh of perceived intelligence that found
27:23
that the birmingham accent
27:24
this is very unfair but it found that
27:26
the birmingham accent was so low rated
27:28
in the study
27:29
that it ranked worse than staying
27:31
completely silent
27:34
[Applause]
27:36
[Laughter]
27:40
remember how this fact was about lenin
27:43
yeah
27:44
did you know you know london's body is
27:46
still hanging around and bombed looking
27:47
exactly like he does
27:49
um so lenin's body is there but he was
27:51
sort of the first instance of that kind
27:53
of
27:53
embalming to make bodies you know look
27:55
exactly like they have look for everyone
27:58
um yes yeah yeah pre all of those and so
28:02
now all other countries who want to
28:03
embalm their great
28:05
leaders uh like uh ho chi minh for
28:08
instance
28:09
uh and in north korea kim kim il-sung
28:12
and kim jong-il
28:13
they they've all been embalmed and they
28:14
get sent to russia
28:16
periodically in order to be
28:18
professionally maintained you're kidding
28:19
they're so good at it they don't bring
28:21
the people there they physically
28:22
apparently they get sent to russia
28:24
so i certainly know that the ho chi minh
28:27
is sent to russia every few years to get
28:29
maintained
28:30
because they're so good at keeping i
28:31
mean imagine the christmas party at that
28:33
place
28:34
when you've got ho chi minh there lenin
28:36
here
28:37
there's a lot of good instagram photos
28:39
that's all i'm saying yeah
28:40
it's time to move on to our final fact
28:42
of the evening and that is anna
28:44
chazinski
28:45
yes my fact is that in japan if you make
28:48
a mistake
28:48
at work you can hire someone to get told
28:51
off by your boss
28:52
so you don't have to
28:56
this is so weird i read this in
28:59
this incredible article in the atlantic
29:01
and it was interviewing someone who
29:04
works for a company called family
29:05
romance and the idea is that you
29:07
fill the gaps in people's lives people's
29:10
personal lives people's lives generally
29:11
that
29:12
need filling and so in this instance uh
29:14
he said he
29:15
sometimes gets hired out to people who
29:18
uh salarymen
29:19
and in japan that's quite a big thing
29:22
people work for big corporations
29:24
it's quite faceless sometimes they don't
29:26
necessarily know their bosses
29:27
and then they make a massive mistake and
29:29
they're sent to the boss to get told off
29:30
and the boss doesn't know who they are
29:32
and at this point this man gets hired
29:34
and he has to go into the boss instead
29:36
and say i'm so sorry
29:37
i did that how embarrassing and he says
29:40
in this article he says you know
29:41
do you know how we apologize we have to
29:43
get down on our hands and knees on the
29:45
floor
29:45
and really say i'm so so sorry while the
29:47
boss holds abuse at us
29:49
and he's paid to do this so the other
29:51
person doesn't have to is there ever a
29:52
scenario where like five
29:54
people are being told off but that one
29:55
guy's been hired for every single
29:58
and so he's like crap get out of here
30:00
send the next guy in
30:02
same guy comes back in a series of
30:04
novelty hats
30:06
sending the guy with a sombrero outside
30:08
i'm furious
30:10
um that interview is unbelievable this
30:13
firm family romance so
30:15
the man who founded the company uh his
30:17
name is ishii uichi
30:18
and he is acting his first success was
30:21
playing a father
30:22
for a girl who had a single mother and
30:23
the mother wanted the girl to grow up
30:25
with a father figure in her life
30:27
so he has been playing the father of
30:30
this girl for eight years
30:31
she doesn't know it she doesn't know
30:34
that this man is
30:35
not her father and he says if the client
30:37
never reveals the truth i must continue
30:38
the role indefinitely
30:39
if the daughter gets married i have to
30:41
be a father in the wedding and then i
30:42
have to be the grandfather
30:44
and he he this is it's a it's a gig for
30:46
life he's got now
30:47
he's committed to the job you've got to
30:49
say that him it is amazing i
30:51
like you yeah andy and i have read it
30:53
and do read it
30:54
but one other thing he does that i think
30:56
is quite funny
30:58
is that he is hired by
31:01
wives to apologize to their husbands for
31:03
having an affair with the wife when the
31:05
real person who had an affair with the
31:07
wife has run away
31:08
um so when the husband finds out that
31:11
the wife's having an affair
31:12
quite often the man the other guy says
31:15
okay well i'm out of here
31:16
and so she'll hire someone to go and
31:19
apologize to him and he says his tactic
31:21
there
31:21
is that he goes pretending to be this
31:23
man he's been shagging
31:24
the wife and he goes and he meets the
31:26
husband and he bows very deeply and he
31:29
apologizes very profusely but also
31:32
he dresses and acts like a yakuza uh as
31:34
in
31:35
a japanese gangster and so he says
31:38
the husband accepts the apology quite
31:40
quickly because
31:43
otherwise he may kill him that's the
31:45
technique there
31:47
but don't yakuza only have four fingers
31:49
he's a good actor
31:51
he can act only having four fingers so
31:54
there's another thing in japan um
31:56
christian weddings are really popular as
31:57
in uh sort of
31:59
uh white weddings as we know them in
32:00
britain and 99 of the christian weddings
32:03
that they have there are fake
32:05
so if you're a westerner in japan it's
32:07
often an easy acting gig
32:09
to pretend to be a priest for a couple
32:11
of hours conduct a wedding ceremony
32:13
you're not a priest
32:14
you don't you don't know any clerical
32:16
rituals or anything like that they
32:17
happen in a fake chapel
32:18
and it's just it's often just english
32:20
teachers from the west making a bit of
32:21
money on the side
32:22
everyone kind of knows it's fake but
32:24
everyone goes along with it because they
32:25
like the ritual
32:26
wait so people are getting married in
32:27
the ceremony it's not legally binding
32:29
it's but it is what people do for their
32:31
wedding
32:32
so you would also have the kind of
32:34
registry officers they have a registered
32:35
thing but the actual
32:36
yeah they sort of big ceremonial bit one
32:38
account from one of these guys who
32:40
conducted i think he said he conducted
32:41
about 900 weddings
32:42
over the decade i know um he uh
32:45
he recorded his first ever wedding
32:48
rehearsal that he'd done
32:49
and he showed it to his wife who i think
32:51
was japanese
32:52
and she looked at him conducting a
32:54
ceremony and speaking in japanese to the
32:56
couple and she said
32:57
well it was good but you made one big
32:59
mistake instead of saying
33:00
you may now exchange rings you said put
33:03
the ring in her crotch
33:09
and so if you can't afford um this guy
33:12
to
33:12
um when you're at work to be told off
33:14
for you yeah and there's a cheaper
33:16
version
33:16
for about 65 equivalent uh you can hire
33:20
in japan an attractive man to come to
33:22
your workplace and gently brush away
33:24
your tears while you weep
33:28
the company is called handsome weeping
33:30
boys
33:32
and also in china there's a big thing at
33:34
the moment with like the uber economy
33:36
kind of thing so
33:38
you can kind of get part-time use of
33:41
washing machines basketballs
33:44
umbrellas there was an umbrella sharing
33:46
company in fact that's in our book isn't
33:48
it yeah
33:49
they lost all 300 000 umbrellas straight
33:52
away
33:53
when they rented them out and forgot to
33:54
put a tracking system on them
33:56
and no one returned actually in china
33:59
there
34:00
was the case this year of a man who
34:03
got married had his wedding and then was
34:05
arrested because it turned out he'd
34:07
hired 200 guests to pretend to be his
34:09
friends at his wedding
34:11
and apparently the bride and her family
34:13
became suspicious when none of them
34:15
could explain how they knew him
34:17
so they were obviously on a very low
34:19
wage i think they were being paid the
34:20
equivalent of nine pounds each
34:22
so they hadn't been given a backstory or
34:24
anything so the bride just came up and
34:25
said how do you know this guy and they
34:26
said
34:27
i'm being paid to do this but
34:30
yeah that when he was arrested and the
34:32
happy ending to that story is that he
34:34
claimed he was 27
34:36
and it turned out he was 20 and in china
34:40
i didn't realize this the minimum age at
34:41
which you can legally marry as a man is
34:43
22.
34:44
really and yeah i know i have no idea
34:47
yeah so yeah
34:48
not valid um we're gonna have to wrap up
34:50
in a second so anything before we do
34:52
um a japanese thing there's a japanese
34:55
word called nuhara
34:57
which means noodle harassment
35:01
uh and that refers to the hassle that
35:02
some people get for slurping their
35:04
noodles too loudly
35:06
this is a big thing in japan at the
35:08
moment apparently according to the
35:09
internet
35:11
and someone has managed to deal with it
35:13
by inventing a musical spoon
35:15
so basically you have a musical spoon it
35:17
plays loads of music and no one can hear
35:19
you slurping your noodles
35:20
oh no that sounds much more annoying
35:24
yeah what does it sing
35:32
well okay speaking of our theme tune we
35:34
must wrap up uh
35:35

00:12
what it's called the weirder side of
00:14
2017
00:15
and it's basically all the weirdest
00:16
stuff we could find out in the news this
00:18
year and it's laid out like an a to z
00:20
format so we can give you some examples
00:23
to just quest your appetite
00:24
that's right so you're going to find out
00:26
under the entry aardvarks
00:28
that this year a zookeeper performed
00:29
mouth to snout on an aardvark for an
00:31
hour
00:32
saved his life that's good do you want
00:33
to be entry yeah let's do a b entry okay
00:35
blink 182 comma lead singers of
00:39
is one of our entries yeah there's an
00:41
amazing amount of blink 182 news
00:43
for the one who was named ufo researcher
00:45
of the year see aliens
00:47
and for the one who believes he
00:48
successfully cursed a music festival
00:50
see witchcraft and then in the l section
00:54
we we have this thing where we have
00:55
leaks comma information
00:57
and that's because we also have an entry
00:59
that's under leaks comma
01:00
water right very clever you see what
01:02
we've done there the leaks information
01:04
is that the world learned this year that
01:06
the cia
01:07
has hacking programs called panda poke
01:10
panda flight and panda sneeze
01:14
and then under leaks comma water it's
01:16
the fact that a hotel called the niagara
01:18
had to close
01:18
because it was flooded um so the book
01:21
ends with
01:22
zizever and if you want to find out why
01:24
the very final entry
01:26
is zizeva starting with a double zed and
01:28

01:35

01:54
[Applause]
01:59
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:02
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
02:04
this week coming to you live
02:06
from manchester
02:08
[Applause]
02:17
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
02:20
here with anacizinski andrew hunter
02:22
murray and james harkin
02:24
and once again we have gathered around
02:26
the microphones with our four favorite
02:27
facts from the last seven days
02:29
and in no particular order here we go
02:32
starting with you james harkin okay my
02:35
fact this week is that the first
02:37
loop the loop roller coaster closed
02:39
because so many riders were passing out
02:42
[Laughter]
02:46
that's the end of the show
02:49
they were passing out they were passing
02:51
out this was so it was on coney island
02:53
it was in 1901
02:54
and what it was it was a loop the loop i
02:56
don't know if you would notice this
02:57
today if you look at a loop the loop
02:58
they're not circular they're kind of
03:00
like elliptical things
03:02
and the reason is if you have a circular
03:04
loop it basically kills you
03:07
really yeah this one is called the koni
03:09
flip flap
03:10
and it was giving people it was
03:14
is that rude in manchester i know so the
03:17
coney flip flap
03:18
produced 12 g's of gravitational force
03:22
how how what is that that's i think
03:26
it's about 9g is like the maximum that
03:29
like air
03:29
jet pilots fighter pilots ever go up to
03:32
oh my god exactly so
03:33
the biggest the craziest uh roller
03:35
coaster today i think is 6g
03:37
and this was 12g i mean it just
03:41
basically you went on it and more often
03:43
than not you passed out or you got
03:44
whiplash or whatever
03:46
and they made more money charging
03:48
spectators to watch the frightened
03:50
riders
03:54
you just put on someone you don't like
03:56
oh no i bought you the ticket go on mate
03:58
you take it i'll see you in a bit
04:00
it's so funny right i actually read and
04:03
i've only just noticed this is the case
04:05
looking at the year in my notes but
04:07
there was a roller coaster in france in
04:10
1846
04:11
that did have a loop but it was just a
04:13
cart on a track
04:15
but it went fast enough to have a loop
04:16
there and there were lots of reports
04:18
about it but people who operated like
04:20
fairgrounds or the equivalent then were
04:22
prone to exaggeration so
04:23
first of all all the news stories at the
04:25
time reported it as going at 150 miles
04:28
per hour
04:29
which is as fast as the fastest roller
04:30
coaster today so
04:32
that's impressive um they tested it at
04:34
the time using
04:35
sandbags eggs and monkeys and
04:38
but yeah apparently they had loops up to
04:41
12
04:42
meters high i read in a book called the
04:44
incredible scream machine
04:45
but the book also points out that the
04:47
makers were prone to massive
04:48
exaggeration they could snap ryder's
04:52
necks
04:53
that is bad you don't want the
04:56
um photo to be going off just at that
04:58
moment that your next steps do you
05:01
i think embarrassment is the least of
05:03
your worries at that moment
05:05
um this and those i think the french
05:07
ones it was just it was a one person
05:09
loop the loop so it was just you in the
05:11
sled you go down the thing
05:12
loop the loop your neck breaks and then
05:15
the next person comes in the next person
05:17
still gets on
05:20
this is a really cool thing okay so
05:21
coney island they had a load of roller
05:22
coasters
05:23
and uh one of the first ever ones i
05:25
think it was called the switchback and
05:26
it was founded by
05:27
a women's underwear magnate called
05:29
lamarcus thompson oh yeah and it was a
05:31
moral
05:32
mission because coney island was full of
05:34
you know alcohol
05:35
and and other you know uh
05:38
immoral attractions i really struggled
05:41
not to say the word prostitutes there
05:42
didn't i but
05:44
it's great that you avoided it though
05:48
and he made a a roller coaster um
05:51
but the thing about it was it went at 10
05:53
miles an hour which is not especially
05:54
first
05:55
and it had to be hand pushed so
05:58
you would get workers would push it to
05:59
the top of the first hill everyone gets
06:01
on
06:01
it then goes down a big slide and then
06:03
slides along a bit then stops everyone
06:05
gets off
06:05
workers have to push it to the top of
06:07
the next hill everyone gets back on
06:08
again
06:09
oh wow did you say it was an underwear
06:11
magnate though
06:12
yeah and it was a moral mission because
06:14
i would have thought that actually
06:15
setting up a roller coaster is an
06:16
extremely good way to advertise your
06:17
underwear isn't it
06:18
because the way it works often it's on
06:21
display
06:22
so i don't think i've i don't think i i
06:25
think i missed that one at thorpe park
06:26
anna
06:28
what where have you been taken i just
06:31
my mom used to dangle me out the window
06:33
by my ankles and then tell me
06:34
[Music]
06:35
yeah um this guy lamarcus thompson is
06:38
his name he was the inventor of it and
06:40
as andy's saying um it was about morals
06:41
but specifically he invented it to stop
06:44
people from being tempted by satan
06:47
specifically
06:48
so he was worried that satan would get
06:50
people and he thought this roller
06:52
coaster would bring them back to jesus
06:53
that was genuinely
06:55
the idea behind the invention of the
06:57
coney island roller coasters
06:58
that's cool so another licentious kind
07:01
of
07:02
theme park this one hasn't actually
07:04
opened yet there was
07:05
they were hoping to open it this year in
07:07
brazil but they haven't opened it
07:09
because of the political problems there
07:10
and financial problems
07:12
but it is a sex-themed amusement park
07:14
called erotica land
07:16
okay it had penis-shaped dodgeons oh
07:20
but one should be a penis shape and one
07:21
should be a vagina shape right
07:23
so when you crash it's like oh that's
07:25
sexy
07:25
[Laughter]
07:27
is that sexy james at erotica land
07:31
everything is sexy
07:33
um and the locals were really worried
07:35
and they thought that maybe um
07:36
like all of the people going to this
07:38
theme park would just end up having sex
07:39
all the time
07:40
uh but the guy who was behind the
07:42
project moro morata
07:44
said that no one would be having sex in
07:46
this theme park
07:47
but if attendees do want to take things
07:49
to another level they can go to a nearby
07:51
motel
07:52
which we will operate do you know the
07:56
sort of king of roller coasters the
07:58
great lord of roller coaster design is a
08:00
guy called ron toomer
08:01
he died a couple of years ago i think in
08:03
2011 but he
08:05
couldn't go on roller coasters himself
08:07
so he
08:08
got extreme motion sickness but he's the
08:10
person who's pioneered every roller
08:12
coaster design you know
08:13
any kind of spin the loops all that kind
08:16
of stuff
08:17
and he himself said riding roller
08:19
coasters never really appealed to me
08:21
um i rode once or twice and that was
08:24
enough for me to get a general idea of
08:25
what it felt
08:26
like wow then he designed like 93 roller
08:29
coasters and he also designed the heat
08:31
shields for the apollo
08:32
spacecraft missions no yeah i sure did
08:35
wow wow
08:35
have you heard of a guy called richard
08:37
rodriguez no
08:38
he's so cool so he has spent his whole
08:40
life pretty much on roller coasters
08:42
ie in 2007 he spent 17
08:46
consecutive days and nights in blackpool
08:48
on a roller coaster
08:50
17 days he slept on there he ate on
08:53
there um he took a five minute break
08:54
every hour just to shower or go to the
08:56
loo
08:57
um he he throw up presumably but he's
09:00
been doing this since 1977
09:02
wow and he keeps on breaking his own
09:03
record in 1977 he did four days in coney
09:06
island and he trained himself
09:08
by sticking his head out of a car window
09:10
for hours on end
09:13
like a dog do you know what the oldest
09:16
operating roller coaster is the oldest
09:18
continually operating one
09:19
no is and the only reason i mentioned
09:21
this is that i used to live in melbourne
09:23
and i went on this with my mum and we
09:25
went on it and we came off and said that
09:27
is the most painful uncomfortable
09:28
experience of either of our lives
09:30
and it's because it's a rollercoaster
09:31
that's over 100 years old and no one's
09:33
ever done anything to it
09:34
it's in luna park in melbourne oh yeah
09:36
and it's been continuously running since
09:38
i think about 1905.
09:40
but it's a horrible experience because
09:42
your skirt was out the entire time
09:45
in a few years ago thorpe park they
09:47
asked the public for donations
09:49
of their own urine to help make an
09:50
authentic smell for their new
09:52
horror movie themed ride
09:55
[Laughter]
09:57
and if you have strong feelings about
09:59
that you can just send your own donation
10:01
to the park management
10:04
were they just going to spray it in the
10:05
air to give it a sense i don't know i
10:06
think it was a publicity stunt to be
10:08
honest
10:08
there must be rules about that although
10:11
who would write the rules
10:13
who would think of pastor yes somewhere
10:16
going i know it seems really far-fetched
10:18
but i just want to write this rule
10:19
because i reckon
10:20
just possibly someone's going to ask the
10:22
public's urine for roller coasters i
10:24
know it seems niche i don't know why
10:25
can we put it in the big rule book is
10:28
there a big rule book yes
10:31
and so just going back to this uh loop
10:33
the loop yeah um so it was did i say 12g
10:36
i think it was 12g
10:37
and that is pretty much as much as you
10:39
can manage as a human or that's what
10:41
people
10:41
thought but then there was a guy called
10:43
john stapp
10:44
who decided to make himself a sled which
10:48
basically went really really really fast
10:49
and then just stopped
10:51
and he wanted to see how much g-force
10:53
the human body would be able to stand
10:56
and this was important and it was in the
10:57
1940s it was important because new
10:59
aeroplanes were coming and they needed
11:00
to know what people would do
11:01
and they thought that actually most
11:03
people would maybe kind of die
11:05
around sort of 12 to 15 something like
11:08
that
11:08
but he managed to do 46.2 g
11:11
no whoa for one instant
11:14
his body weighed seven thousand seven
11:17
hundred pounds
11:19
what yeah wow do you know how you do it
11:22
though
11:23
if you ever do need to withstand huge
11:24
amounts of gravity
11:26
um you so i was reading this
11:29
uh in a uh article about how jet pilots
11:32
prepare for it and the way they get
11:33
prepared is they're put in this chamber
11:35
at the end of a really long
11:37
arm that's spinning round and round and
11:39
they're trained on how to deal with it
11:41
and what you do is you have to strain
11:44
like you're doing a poo
11:45
and you make sort of a hick sound so
11:47
you've got to sort of
11:49
and that prevents the blood from flowing
11:50
away from the brain too fast so it means
11:52
you can remain conscious longer
11:53
and the guys who can tolerate lots and
11:55
lots of g-force are called g-monsters
11:57
oh cool i've seen
12:01
that contraption uh so they sit at the
12:03
end they spin round and round
12:05
i've seen it i've seen brian blessed do
12:07
it um
12:08
was he straining no well so no he
12:11
so he was training to be uh an astronaut
12:14
um
12:15
in uh russia because they said they were
12:17
gonna send him up to space
12:18
there's footage you can see if you wanna
12:20
see it's on youtube he gets into it and
12:22
he's saying you know i've been built
12:23
i've been up everest i'm
12:24
i'm built to last in this thing i have a
12:27
body and lungs bigger than anyone else
12:28
i'm amazing and
12:29
he sits inside and it starts and
12:31
immediately he's just there going
12:35
it's the funniest thing i've ever seen
12:37
it's just a terrifying blessing
12:40
going on g-forcer astronauts
12:44
but that's actually also what he looks
12:46
like when he's training on the toilet
12:47
[Laughter]
12:49
should we move on to our next fact time
12:51
to go on to fact number two and that is
12:54
andrew hunter murray my fact is that
12:56
america has a national
12:57
grocery bag packing competition
13:00
and this is a huge deal in america um
13:03
they get crowds
13:04
cheering and gathering and people film
13:06
it and it's just people who um who work
13:08
at checkout tills
13:09
packing groceries into a bag that's it
13:11
and is it to see
13:13
the fastest person to do it or the most
13:15
groceries packed in the bag
13:16
the criteria are so strict i love it um
13:19
so you all get the same stuff like you
13:22
and your fellow competitors so we would
13:23
all get the same
13:24
items but they vary hugely in terms of
13:27
weight
13:28
some of them are fragile some of them
13:29
are very dense and the criteria you get
13:31
marked on
13:32
is is speed but also bag building
13:35
technique
13:36
style weight distribution between bags
13:38
attitude
13:39
and appearance attitude
13:43
but um they're really strict so one
13:45
person uh finished
13:46
really really fast but his bags weighed
13:48
17 and 21 pounds
13:50
and the woman who won her bags weighed
13:52
19 and 19 pounds she got it dead on
13:54
wow and did she know the weight of the
13:57
objects prior to putting it in no no no
13:59
you're just doing it
13:59
wow you're just healing yeah it's so
14:03
good well you don't need to smell it to
14:04
work out how heavy it is
14:06
i think that would be attitude that
14:07
would get your attitude point that's
14:09
about 12 kilos
14:12
i would drink points for attitude if
14:14
someone sniffed my shopping while they
14:16
were back here
14:17
i was shopped in uh i i lived for three
14:20
months in kosovo because my grandmother
14:22
was living there and there was our local
14:24
grocery store which took an hour each
14:26
time even if you were buying like six
14:27
items
14:28
because they didn't have any price tags
14:30
on each item so the person at the
14:32
counter would pick it up and stare at it
14:33
for ages and never spoke out loud but i
14:35
could see they were going
14:36
if i were a can of baked beans
14:40
how much would i be and really
14:43
thought about it and then slowly packed
14:44
so i feel like that's
14:46
good attitude yeah
14:49
so there's one contestant from each
14:51
state in america there are 50
14:52
competitors out there
14:54
if there are two really good backpackers
14:56
in your state then they have to have a
14:58
bag off
15:00
that's true and they call themselves bag
15:03
fleets
15:04
or like athletes yeah right it doesn't
15:07
quite work does it as word play
15:09
but if you win your store where you work
15:12
your home store gets a gold-plated cash
15:14
register
15:15
how useful
15:17
[Laughter]
15:21
oh my god sorry it's quite good if
15:24
robbers come into the store and they ask
15:26
for all the money from the till you're
15:27
like
15:28
stupid robbers
15:28
[Laughter]
15:31
but the washington state competition has
15:33
a guy who is called
15:35
a bagger whisperer again
15:38
doesn't quite work doesn't it but he's a
15:40
store manager and he's coached
15:42
um a couple at least of successive
15:44
champions yeah
15:45
they also look as impressive as being a
15:46
horse whisperer because horses don't
15:48
speak english and so
15:49
it's really amazing that you could
15:50
communicate with a horse communicating
15:52
with someone who bangs shopping i mean i
15:54
find that quite easy
15:56
when i'm in the shop
15:59
put it in the bag look look how she is
16:01
actually putting it in the bag now
16:03
[Laughter]
16:06
as well so the really elite ones are
16:08
called bag fleets
16:09
um but actually they're all called
16:11
baggers aren't they they all call
16:12
themselves baggers if they do this job
16:14
um and i went on to urban dictionary to
16:16
find out any other meanings of the word
16:18
baggage
16:24
um a flamboyant member of the tea party
16:27
in america is known as a bagger um it's
16:30
a derivative of the word teabagger and
16:32
it describes the costumes
16:36
it describes the costumes with tea bags
16:39
that
16:39
the members wear but it does also say
16:42
sometimes it is used as a derogatory
16:44
name because it also depicts a unique
16:46
sexual act
16:48
and you can fill in the rest yourself
16:51
did you know the first time that um
16:53
you could bag your own stuff was it
16:55
1916.
16:56
so this is the first self-service
16:58
grocery store so before 1916
17:00
you had to go into a shop with your
17:02
shopping list and you had to give it to
17:03
the person who worked in the shop and
17:05
say
17:05
go and do my shopping for me and then
17:07
you waited for them to bring it to you
17:08
which was really time consuming and you
17:09
needed lots of clerks to go and do it so
17:11
in 1916
17:12
uh the first self-service shop was set
17:14
up what we would call just a shop
17:16
and it was called piggly wiggly
17:20
in tennessee and no one ever knew why he
17:22
called it that the founder was someone
17:23
called clarence saunders and he launched
17:25
this shot with a beauty contest and he
17:27
gave free flowers and balloons to all
17:29
the kids who came
17:30
and he never explained why he called it
17:32
piggly wiggly he did once
17:34
was this where he said he just thought
17:36
it was a funny word so people would talk
17:37
about it he got asked yeah why is it
17:39
called piggly wiggly and he said
17:40
so people will ask that very question
17:46
sorry so you're saying 1916 for that
17:48
because i was reading in 1929
17:50
was in america the invention of the
17:52
grocery bag as a
17:54
as a paper bag um and it was a guy who
17:57
invented it called walter dominar
17:59
and he woke up in the middle of the
18:01
night he had a vision
18:02
in the middle of the night and he woke
18:04
up and he went bags
18:06
and because he had it he had
18:09
the way he kind of does this yeah and
18:11
then he's getting
18:12
i've got nothing to breathe into
18:18
yeah yeah good boy he woke up he went he
18:21
went bags and
18:22
he he woke his wife up and he said bags
18:25
and she
18:25
they had they had a shop a grocery shop
18:27
and he went down with his wife early in
18:29
the morning
18:30
and his the thought he had was to have
18:32
these um
18:33
a brown paper bag and to punch holes in
18:36
both sides to put the strings in
18:38
and so they did that they put strings in
18:40
so that it was handles and then
18:42
that day they started selling them and
18:44
people went nuts for it
18:45
they sold them incidentally very uh sort
18:48
of full circle for five cents
18:49
you know so it was you bought it for
18:51
what we've now returned to
18:53
wow yeah but um so he sold them everyone
18:56
went crazy they were buying more bags
18:58
and they were the actual stuff in the
18:59
grocery store
19:00
and then they ran out of bags they
19:01
bought more bags and then she sat there
19:04
customizing all the bags with magazines
19:07
and newspapers so she cut out pictures
19:09
that she thought were really
19:10
nice and she stuck them to the side of
19:11
each bag and just sold that
19:14
and then he filed it as a patent and he
19:15
became a multi-millionaire
19:17
over the next couple of years and they
19:19
were the largest manufacturer of grocery
19:21
bags in america
19:22
for a very long time i think i've made
19:23
that bid up but they
19:26
that feels right doesn't it so that yeah
19:28
yeah just just quickly do you know what
19:29
people had
19:30
before they had shopping bags this is
19:33
so cool before you had a shopping bag
19:36
some people
19:37
not everybody but a lot of people had uh
19:39
cornucopias
19:40
so you know in sort of old paintings you
19:42
have these horns of plenty
19:44
and it's full of fruit and lobster and
19:46
white grapes and everything
19:48
yes people would take big horns like a
19:50
big horn it was wicker
19:52
and you would take your horn of plenty
19:54
to the shops
19:56
how cool is that why don't we all have
19:57
horns of plenty why have we been cheated
20:00
from our birthright i think we could we
20:02
could have a new
20:03
business couldn't we yes like according
20:05
to dan this other guy made billions
20:07
yeah if we start making horns of plenty
20:09
for life
20:10
[Laughter]
20:13
would you buy a horn of plenty
20:17
i think if you come up with any business
20:18
idea starting with the phrase according
20:20
to dan
20:22
you need to be really careful plastic
20:24
bags
20:25
when they started this the marketing was
20:28
so confident that it was going to change
20:30
the world
20:30
this is from the baker like corporation
20:32
who were the first people to
20:34
put out plastic bags they said and this
20:36
was literally their pr
20:38
that this bag had transcended the old
20:40
tax on uh how did i say that taxonomy
20:43
taxonomy thank you yep always good to
20:45
have another point
20:47
had transcended the old taxonomy of
20:50
animal minera
20:51
really close so what's it again taxonomy
20:54
taxonomy
20:56
taxonomy i mean soft pedal it
21:00
taxonomy yeah they said it had
21:04
transcended the old
21:05
taxonomy of animal
21:14
that's gonna be awkward to edit with
21:15
that massive cheer
21:18
i guess the people of manchester just
21:19
really love taxonomy
21:25
darling did manchester invent taxonomy
21:32
come on dad you've got to get to the end
21:34
of this we've lost it
21:35
this better be good jesus
21:41
the baker like company said that it
21:42
transcended the old taxonomy of animal
21:49
of animal mineral and vegetable and now
21:51
we had a fourth
21:52
kingdom whose boundaries are unlimited
21:57
that is cool yeah okay it is time
22:01
for fact number three and that is my
22:04
fact
22:05
my fact is one of the things you need to
22:07
know in order to become a british
22:09
citizen
22:10
is who introduced shampoo to the uk
22:14
it's an actual thing that you get asked
22:16
and who was it
22:17
i well his name is get out
22:24
his name is sheikh dean mohammed he was
22:27
a bengali anglo-indian
22:28
traveler inventor um he he opened the
22:31
very first curry house in the uk it was
22:33
in
22:34
london um but he also opened up these
22:37
amazing things called the shampoo baths
22:39
of the
22:40
uk there was shampooing baths where you
22:42
would go in and it was basically a
22:43
massage and it was all sorts of oils and
22:46
it was it was like a spa it was a
22:47
bathing spa
22:48
and um weirdly that is a question
22:52
that you get asked when you're sitting
22:53
down to work out if you're allowed into
22:56
the uk as a citizen have you seen the
22:57
list of questions yeah i i mean they're
23:00
unbelievably hard aren't they
23:01
literally no one will be able to get any
23:03
of these answers yeah
23:04
it's like um you have to know what year
23:07
was the battle of the boyne
23:09
just off the top of your head oh 1680
23:13
get out 1680.
23:16
i i don't know when it was you get out
23:21
i know you're gonna have to carry the
23:22
show from this point onwards
23:24
in the previous version it was worse in
23:26
the past in previous versions of the
23:28
test you needed to know 49 different
23:29
websites
23:30
and 36 telephone numbers including the
23:33
phone number for the national academic
23:35
recognition
23:35
information center you still need to
23:39
know
23:40
that there are still five telephone
23:41
numbers on it so they have paired it
23:42
down
23:43
but you still need to know the phone
23:44
numbers for the house of commons
23:47
the welsh assembly why and the scottish
23:49
parliament
23:50
but weirdly in the five telephone
23:52
numbers that you need to know 999 is not
23:54
there
23:56
nowhere hello is that my mp there's a
23:59
burglar in my house
24:02
i'd like to know what you're going to do
24:03
about it oh fine i'll ring the welsh
24:05
assembly
24:06
[Laughter]
24:09
um i read one question that's in it
24:11
apparently um it used to have this
24:13
question
24:13
suppose you spill someone's pint in the
24:15
pub
24:17
what usually happens next bunch up
24:21
i rather think that that depends the
24:22
answer in london will be very different
24:24
from the answer in manchester i think
24:26
what what happens in manchester well why
24:28
don't you try it tonight
24:32
is it a quaint local custom that if
24:34
you're a newcomer to the city you have
24:35
to spill as many people's points as
24:36
possible
24:37
yeah that's right okay great uh any
24:39
stuff on shampoo
24:41
maybe yeah yeah sure um this is just
24:43
interesting um the word shampoo
24:46
is kind of an indian a hindi word and it
24:49
comes from
24:49
shampner meaning to need and it comes
24:52
from the same word as chapati
24:54
no way just an interesting thing i got
24:57
completely distracted and i started
24:58
looking at how uh people
25:00
people's hair and how animals clean
25:02
themselves because if you don't shampoo
25:04
eventually your hair gets back into a
25:05
kind of balance
25:06
well actually i tried that oh yeah
25:10
yeah right yeah for qi i tried going six
25:13
months
25:14
without washing my hair i remember that
25:15
and it does not work
25:18
and his wife was not happy well this was
25:22
before i was married actually
25:24
i was i was single actually okay yeah
25:27
and actually around the same time i read
25:29
something else which was that if you put
25:30
an
25:31
onion in your shoe and walk around then
25:33
by the end of the day you'll be able to
25:35
taste it in your mouth
25:37
and that doesn't work either wow
25:40
but it does probably explain why i was
25:42
single
25:44
because there are so many reasons
25:47
um so when uh when a fly cleans itself
25:50
right it combs itself it sort of combs
25:52
its body and it's got hair sticking out
25:54
of it
25:54
when they clean themselves the particles
25:56
that have gathered on them are
25:57
catapulted off the hairs
25:58
at a thousand g what
26:02
no well it's a thousand times the
26:04
acceleration of gravity is that g
26:06
it is yeah yeah probably missed a zero
26:07
or two um
26:09
but do you know how cicadas keep
26:11
themselves clean
26:12
this is so cool they have on their
26:15
bodies tiny tiny
26:16
nanoscale pin cushions that mean that
26:19
when a bacteria bumps into them the
26:20
bacteria
26:21
explodes whoa and what that cleans them
26:25
through the explosion
26:26
well it doesn't clean them it just means
26:27
they don't have a bacteria on them
26:28
anymore that is
26:29
so cool not if you're a bacteria
26:32
sure yeah no one ever speaks of the
26:34
bacteria that's on a cicada side
26:37
actually the reason we need to wash our
26:39
hair i
26:40
think is quite interesting it's that we
26:42
have all these sebaceous glands and they
26:44
secrete oil into our scalp and
26:46
so that it gets really oily and gross
26:47
and it's to waterproof so our scalp is
26:50
quite waterproof our face also has quite
26:51
a lot of them so that's quite waterproof
26:54
but we don't have any of these glands on
26:56
the palms of our hands or the soles of
26:58
our feet
26:58
so if you grow hair on the palms of your
27:01
hands or the soles of your feet
27:02
you don't need to wash it as a
27:04
constellation i have
27:06
i have hair on my feet i've got like
27:07
hobbit feet so yeah what are the soles
27:09
of your feet
27:11
yeah the nose of your feet are hairy
27:15
hang on are we quibbling over what souls
27:17
mean i think i think so
27:18
the bottom bit okay no right yeah oh my
27:21
god
27:23
okay we should move on
27:26
to our final fact you guys ready to go
27:29
to the final fact
27:30
okay it's time for a final fact of the
27:33
show
27:34
and that is chozinski
27:37
yes my fact is that if your metabolism
27:40
was as fast as a hummingbirds
27:42
you'd need to drink a can of coke every
27:44
minute to stay alive
27:48
it's this hummingbirds have the most
27:50
incredible metabolisms
27:52
that we can't imagine so they've
27:54
processed
27:55
sugars so fast that they need to drink
27:57
one twelve ounce can
27:58
of fizzy drink no no the equivalent of
28:02
sorry yeah you've been seeing a poor
28:05
hummingbird get back to its nest with a
28:06
16 pack of coke
28:09
and a quarter of an hour later back to
28:11
the bloody shops
28:12
[Laughter]
28:13
but that is is if if we had to have the
28:16
equivalent to survive then we'd be
28:18
eating or drinking
28:20
202 000 calories a day
28:23
we'd have to eat to stay alive so they
28:25
have to visit 2 000 flowers a day
28:27
it's a lot yeah i read that i read 1500
28:31
flowers on
28:31
obviously another website every day and
28:34
what i liked about that is it's
28:35
approximately the same number as there
28:37
are greg's in the uk
28:40
the human flower
28:45
but what i worked out is with all the
28:47
calories that they get and everything
28:48
like that
28:49
if you were a hummingbird it's the
28:50
equivalent of going to every greg's in
28:52
the uk
28:53
and eating half a steak bake in every
28:55
one
28:56
ah coincidentally i've never managed
28:58
more than half of a steak bake
28:59
yeah am i a hummingbird no
29:03
wow hummingbird hearts are so cool they
29:06
beat
29:06
10 times a second and that's quite slow
29:09
for a hummingbird
29:10
despite being the size of a rubber on
29:12
the end of a pencil
29:14
and that's the size of hummingbirds no
29:15
the heart just the heart oh
29:18
sorry but they're small though
29:23
they're not six foot tall animals with
29:24
hearts the sounds of a rubber on the end
29:26
of a pencil
29:29
they would be fainting all the time but
29:32
they
29:32
so they their heart beats up to 1
29:36
200 beats a minute which is very fast um
29:40
but when they
29:41
and even when they're resting it's 500
29:43
and as a result at night
29:45
just to prevent themselves from dying
29:46
overnight basically every night they go
29:48
into a coma
29:49
and their heart slows down to 50 beats a
29:51
minute it's still pretty fast
29:53
it's like hibernation it's like
29:54
herbivorous hibernate literally
29:56
everything
29:56
and they won't wake up obviously don't
29:59
[Laughter]
30:01
yeah but yeah they also just all the
30:04
figures that you read about hummingbirds
30:06
you really have to think about and
30:07
process so their wings
30:08
flap up to a hundred times a second
30:12
okay that is completely insane and as i
30:16
read it i think i must have written it
30:17
wrong
30:18
yeah no you haven't i read it in the
30:20
national geographic
30:21
and so i should say by the way that this
30:23
came from an amazing article on
30:24
hummingbirds from the national
30:25
geographic sometime in the last year so
30:27
you can't get it anymore but it was
30:28
really good but that's
30:29
i mean something quite cool that
30:31
researchers have done
30:32
to work out what their visual perception
30:34
is like is um
30:36
they've worked out how they respond to
30:38
optical illusions
30:40
so this again was in the natural
30:41
geographic and they got one of those
30:43
optical illusions that is a spiral of
30:45
black stripe
30:46
with white stripes in between it and
30:49
when you spin that round it looks like
30:50
it's moving away from you
30:51
and they put a test tube full of
30:53
hummingbird food sticking out of it
30:55
and so the hummingbird gets its beacon
30:56
and it's got its little fork tongue
30:58
that drinks from the test tube and then
31:00
when they start spinning the spiral
31:02
the hummingbird just like humans do
31:04
thinks that the spiral is moving away
31:05
from them
31:06
and because they can fly backwards they
31:07
reverse out of the test tube
31:09
because they're like sorry they think
31:10
it's moving towards them so they reverse
31:12
out of the test tube
31:14
so they do have the same eyesight as we
31:16
do
31:17
and also they're kind of idiots they
31:19
kept backing away from their food
31:21
yeah they've got really interesting legs
31:23
as well
31:24
um they basically they've got almost
31:26
like display legs in that they're sort
31:28
of
31:29
they're attached to them but they can't
31:31
walk on them so they they land
31:32
and they can't walk and they can't hop
31:35
so they're just there for like
31:36
standing purposes what are they what do
31:38
they do they can do a sideways thing you
31:40
know when
31:41
you they can like so like oh god no no
31:44
no
31:44
no no because i don't know how to
31:45
describe it but you know so like they'll
31:47
like land on the branch
31:48
and then they'll just be like they'll do
31:50
that
31:51
[Applause]
31:53
a shuffle for anyone who's listening to
31:55
the podcast shuffled sideways that was
31:57
the word he couldn't think of
31:59
so he had to stand up can i just say as
32:01
well for them that's called a lec and
32:03
it's a mating dance
32:05
and i can kind of well i'm not sure i
32:07
can see what i can see
32:09
that's how i met my wife
32:14
yeah that's how they that and they do
32:15
that on a um on a stick
32:17
attached to a tree a branch
32:21
[Applause]
32:24
only takes half a second beginning to
32:26
end what do you mean only
32:31
and the courting only takes a few
32:32
seconds as well and they dive
32:35
yeah they do they they to impress women
32:37
they go up
32:38
high and then they dive at 60 miles an
32:40
hour down and they also
32:41
make chirping sounds they tweet but not
32:44
with their mouths
32:45
with their feathers so all hummingbirds
32:48
make a different chirping sound and it
32:49
sounds exactly like bird tweeting
32:51
but it's they're doing it with their
32:52
tail feathers so it's when they swoop
32:54
the way that they vibrate as they go
32:56
through the air
32:57
makes a certain noise and it's really
32:59
beautiful and as a smithsonian put it
33:01
imagine if you could sing
33:02
with your ponytail or your beard
33:05
that is what it's like to be a
33:06
hummingbird that's pretty cool and
33:08
that's singing to us it just kind of
33:10
sounds like a chirp
33:11
right it is a nice chat but it's just a
33:13
chirp but if you slow it down
33:15
and play it into a computer they can
33:16
hear real levels of complexity that
33:18
humans can't hear
33:20
levels of complexity yeah like what
33:22
please i just want to stop drinking coke
33:25
god just let me slow down
33:28
[Laughter]
33:31
so there is only one known piece of dna
33:34
in vertebrates
33:35
with the ability to taste sweetness and
33:38
hummingbirds don't have it
33:40
so even though they're drinking all this
33:41
nectar stuff we don't think they can
33:43
taste sweetness
33:45
oh really yeah it's tragic i think
33:47
there's a theory though
33:49
that they modified so we have a bunch of
33:52
taste receptors we we all know now
33:54
uh uh sweet salty a bitter sour
33:57
and umami and as we all agree umami is
34:00
the kind of pointless weird one that's
34:02
like savory isn't it yeah it's savory
34:04
and they actually think that
34:05
hummingbirds have adapted their umami
34:07
gland and that's evolved to taste
34:09
sweetness
34:09
over the years which what that might
34:11
mean is when they're going around
34:13
tasting all these flowers 1500 times it
34:15
actually tastes like a greg's steak
34:21
did you structure this whole part of the
34:23
podcast to come back around to that
34:27
so they've got really um fast metabolism
34:30
don't they
34:31
um and i was trying to i was trying to
34:33
work out the other end of metabolism
34:35
super slow metabolism and
34:37
sloths have extremely slow metabolism
34:40
and obviously we know them as a very
34:41
slow animal
34:42
um so they they yeah they they have an
34:44
extraordinarily slow
34:46
metabolism but um they so i started just
34:49
this is very off
34:50
topic but i started reading about sloths
34:52
because i thought why are they moving so
34:54
slow and what goes on
34:55
it turns out i think they're meant to be
34:56
water-based animals rather than
34:59
in the trees because when you put a
35:00
sloth in water
35:02
it can swim three times as fast as it
35:05
can move when it's outside of water
35:07
and it can hold its breath for over 40
35:10
minutes
35:11
under water which is 20 minutes longer
35:13
than a dolphin
35:15
what yeah that is amazing and they're
35:18
just stuck up there on that
35:19
stick attached to a tree yeah it's like
35:27
okay that's it that is all of our facts

01:42
[Music]
01:51
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:54
no such thing as a fish
01:56
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
01:59
from wimbledon
02:07
my name is dan schreiber and i am
02:10
sitting here
02:11
with anna chazinski andrew hunter murray
02:14
and james harkin
02:15
and once again we have gathered around
02:17
the microphones with our four favorite
02:18
facts from the last seven days
02:20
and in no particular order here we go
02:23
[Music]
02:23
[Laughter]
02:25
very good we'll keep it in uh this week
02:29
starting with my fact my fact this week
02:32
is that the telephone
02:33
dialing code for cape canaveral the
02:36
famous rocket launch site
02:38
is three two one
02:43
is that amazing this this was changed in
02:47
1999 after a petition obviously cape
02:49
canaveral
02:50
very famous for its connection to nasa
02:52
for rocket launching for so on
02:53
they just said let's just have a new uh
02:55
dialing telephone number and
02:57
that's that's what it is now three two
02:59
one so cool
03:01
thank you but they did do they steal it
03:05
off anyone
03:05
i think they did actually there's a town
03:07
that's really pissed off right now
03:09
i think they stole it off chicago didn't
03:11
they it was supposed to be chicago yeah
03:13
yeah yeah so uh it nearly it could have
03:16
been
03:17
one two three do you know this what do
03:18
you mean when they were launching rocks
03:20
yeah
03:20
so um nasa they used to do account up
03:25
what until and when do they go when they
03:26
get to like infinity or
03:28
yeah the original thing and this was in
03:30
fact originally they got their cue from
03:32
the films
03:32
so in films in the 20s and 30s in space
03:35
scenes it went one
03:36
two three and then when they got to five
03:38
or ten or whatever they would go
03:39
but then when fritz lang released a film
03:41
in 1929
03:42
he did three two one and then nasa
03:44
borrowed from that oh really
03:46
yeah and on count ups instead of
03:48
countdowns
03:49
the telegraph website they did a counter
03:51
i think it was counting up to
03:53
uh the royal wedding the last royal
03:55
wedding uh and
03:57
it was just a counter and it counting up
03:58
and it's still counting up
04:00
you can go and see it and it's just done
04:02
millions of seconds since the royal
04:03
wedding happened for what for like
04:05
until they get to divorce or
04:09
what are they that's the end nothing
04:10
there's no end point it's just counting
04:12
it's just counting yeah it's just to
04:14
help prince william remember when his
04:15
wedding anniversary is
04:17
yeah it'd be 1 million and 26 000
04:20
seconds honey
04:21
why would yeah why would you need it
04:23
it's a look it's a flawed system that's
04:24
why i brought it up
04:25
all right um cape canaveral is really
04:29
interesting do you know why it is
04:30
where it is it's obviously in florida on
04:33
the coast of florida and there are two
04:34
main reasons for it is positioning
04:36
and one is that when rockets take
04:39
off they can sort of steal a bunch of
04:42
speed from the rotation of the earth and
04:43
the earth rotates fastest at the equator
04:46
right like if a ball is rotating then
04:48
the widest bit is going faster than the
04:50
smallest bit
04:50
um so when rockets take off they sort of
04:53
steal
04:54
that speed that acceleration as they're
04:56
taking off which really helps them
04:57
and also they always go in line with the
05:00
rotation of the earth so they're going
05:02
sort of from america towards britain
05:04
and so that means if anything goes
05:05
really badly wrong it crashes into the
05:08
sea
05:08
which doesn't hurt very many people how
05:10
come they never do that thing that they
05:11
do in formula one where you have
05:13
you go behind someone and you get the
05:14
tailwind speed how come there's not like
05:16
an initial rocket that's a really good
05:18
idea that is a good idea i think now
05:20
you've said it they might do that
05:21
is that scientifically literally no
05:23
one's thought of that before
05:24
really or it could be the fact that each
05:27
rocket costs about 100 million quid to
05:29
make
05:29
[Laughter]
05:31
that's true it does and do you actually
05:33
know why the
05:34
russians really screwed us over in terms
05:37
of this you know helping rockets get
05:39
into space
05:40
is that you know the iss the positioning
05:42
of the iss
05:43
is not on the equator which is
05:46
incredibly inconvenient because one of
05:47
the things we want is for the iss to be
05:48
a stop-off point on the way to the moon
05:50
and so we'd stop over the iss get some
05:53
food have a picnic
05:54
refuel have a nap and then you can jump
05:57
onto the moon
05:57
in future and we can't do that because
06:00
to appease the soviet union
06:02
we put the iss sort of halfway between
06:04
the latitude of florida and halfway
06:06
between their space station
06:07
which is way way further north and that
06:10
actually means that the rotation effect
06:12
doesn't give the acceleration to rockets
06:13
that they need
06:14
i've not understood a single thing
06:15
you've said in the last minute
06:17
maybe we should talk about um telephone
06:19
numbers yeah sure
06:21
yeah um so dan's telephone number is
06:24
awesome
06:27
when they first came up with the idea of
06:29
area codes and stuff like that
06:31
basically before that you would kind of
06:32
ring up an operator and say
06:34
put me through to chicago you know
06:36
whatever
06:37
but when they came up with a number
06:39
system there was an anti-digit dialing
06:41
league
06:42
who tried to stop the idea of having
06:44
phone numbers rather than phone words
06:47
and this was in america and it was
06:49
organized by
06:50
a guy who um the internet calls famed
06:52
semanticist
06:54
s i hayakawa and i want to be a famed
06:58
semanticist that's the amazing title
07:00
but he said that of this idea of giving
07:02
numbers rather than words he said these
07:04
people
07:04
are systematically trying to destroy the
07:07
use of memory
07:09
wow he says they tell you to write it
07:12
down
07:12
but try writing a telephone number down
07:14
in a dark booth
07:16
while groping for a pencil and gasping
07:18
for breath
07:20
what where is this phone booth
07:25
in a sulphur pit or something they were
07:27
super anti though weren't they they were
07:29
they thought it'd be dehumanizing there
07:31
was yeah a bunch of leagues that were
07:33
set up to attack the creeping numeralism
07:36
they called it and the cult of
07:37
technology and actually the man who came
07:39
up with the idea that phone numbers
07:41
should be numbers
07:42
rather than a name because all the
07:44
letters were sort of getting used up by
07:45
that point all the three
07:46
letter letters so the man who came up
07:48
with the idea of changing us all to
07:49
numbers was at a party once and he was
07:51
approached by someone who said
07:53
how does it feel to be the most hated
07:54
man in america wow
07:57
rough that is bad so these people who
08:00
are from the anti-digit dialing league
08:02
and they try to protest by phoning up
08:04
operators
08:05
and rather than giving them the number
08:06
as anyone else does they said
08:08
operator get me s-i hayakawa
08:11
at 4 billion 155 million
08:15
842 301.
08:18
so they said all of their phone numbers
08:19
as actual numbers oh that's great
08:21
and they said if they want digits we'll
08:24
give them digits
08:29
and hanging up the phone was invented
08:31
that day
08:33
have you guys uh heard of a rapper
08:35
called soldier boy
08:37
because i haven't no i do know one thing
08:40
about him so he
08:41
when he was when he was uh a lot younger
08:42
this is in 2009
08:44
he listed a phone number at the start of
08:46
his song kiss me through the phone
08:48
he just read out a string of phone
08:49
numbers uh 12 digit number
08:51
and as a result of him reading out that
08:53
number a family in oldham
08:55
who owned that number got bombarded with
08:59
60 phone calls every day for months
09:02
saying is soldier boy there please
09:06
and the householder was a woman called
09:07
catriona howard smith and she said we
09:09
just tell them that he doesn't live in
09:10
oldham
09:11
[Laughter]
09:14
that's very similar to bruce almighty
09:16
you know the film bruce almighty yeah
09:18
jim carrey
09:18
yeah exactly where um there was a real
09:21
phone number
09:22
used in bruce almighty that belonged to
09:23
god and the
09:25
tradition is in america if you're making
09:27
a film the real phone numbers that you
09:28
use in the film
09:29
start with five five five because then
09:31
it won't be taken um but they
09:33
sort of contravened this rule and so
09:35
they just said a number that actually
09:37
existed
09:38
and the film bruce almighty got in real
09:39
trouble so the number was double seven
09:41
six two three two
09:42
three and a bunch of people all across
09:45
america got phone calls asking to be put
09:47
through to god
09:48
and and these numbers included one of
09:50
the numbers put people through to a
09:52
church in north carolina
09:54
and the other went through to a pastor
09:55
in wisconsin and saying can i please get
09:58
through to god
09:59
you would start thinking wouldn't you if
10:00
you were a pastor and you got a load of
10:01
phone calls for god you might start
10:03
thinking i don't know i'm not god
10:05
[Laughter]
10:07
is is this how he would tell me
10:11
no but i read an interview with one of
10:13
the guys one of the
10:14
church pastors and he did get the calls
10:17
and they would say uh is god there
10:19
and then he would be able to go actually
10:21
yes he is actually he's everywhere
10:23
yeah yeah but they changed it for the
10:25
dvd release
10:27
okay just in case you've not just read
10:29
it out now
10:30
[Laughter]
10:33
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:36
that is
10:36
chozinski my fact this week is that the
10:39
world's largest honeybees
10:41
make hallucinogenic honey and you're
10:44
only allowed to collect this honey if
10:46
you've had
10:47
a specific dream so to start from the
10:50
beginning these are
10:51
himalayan giant honeybees and they make
10:53
what's called mad honey
10:54
and they are collected by the kulung
10:57
people of nepal and at the moment
11:00
there's
11:00
one collector left in this little
11:03
community who's a guy called
11:04
maoli dan he's the last honey collector
11:07
and he's got a bunch of apprentices who
11:08
come with him on the honey collecting
11:10
missions
11:10
but they're not allowed to actually
11:12
extract the sort of hives from the cliff
11:14
face he has to do that himself
11:16
because he's the only person who's had
11:18
this dream um
11:19
and the dream he had was 42 years ago so
11:22
he's been doing it for a while
11:23
he generally was caught in a spider web
11:25
he was saved by a monkey
11:26
and he woke up and it became clear to
11:29
him that the monkey was a spirit
11:30
guardian called rankemy that they
11:32
believe in
11:32
and so that means rankemy is a spirit of
11:36
of bees and monkeys and so that meant
11:39
ryan kami was saying you can steal our
11:40
honey and you'll be okay and did the
11:42
rest of the people go that guy's clearly
11:44
nuts he'll definitely be able to go down
11:45
the side of a cliff
11:46
and attack a beehive
11:49
maybe it was that that was his father's
11:52
father's father before him
11:54
but they have this serious problem now
11:56
because it's a real source of income
11:57
because it's quite valuable
11:58
but no one else has had the dream so
12:00
he's got this apprentice and this
12:02
apprentice says
12:03
i really want to collect the honey on
12:05
the really dangerous
12:06
cliff face that i but i just haven't had
12:09
the dream
12:10
and you can't lie about the dream well
12:13
i no no what i mean is everyone here now
12:16
knows about the dream is does he not
12:18
know about the dream you know they all
12:19
know about the dream but of course you
12:20
can't lie about the dream this is a
12:22
spiritual mission you've been given
12:23
the idea is that if you collect the
12:25
honey without having had the dream then
12:26
you'll be cursed forever more
12:28
why would you lie about it dan yeah dan
12:31
yeah dan sorry oh no
12:35
think about what you've done dan
12:38
sorry it was a long article i've been to
12:40
a brainwashed by it it's an amazing
12:42
article it was in national geographic
12:43
and i really would recommend it it's
12:44
really good
12:45
do you know what else they do these bees
12:47
they do mexican waves they nest
12:49
in the open right they have a single
12:50
flat comb on the cliff face okay
12:52
they nest out in the open and they've
12:53
got seven or eight layers of bees thick
12:55
on the outside for warmth
12:57
and when a predator approaches their
12:59
method
13:00
is to do a wave pointing their abdomens
13:02
out into the air so all their stings are
13:04
facing outwards
13:05
and they do it in a mexican waveform and
13:07
that notifies the bees on the other side
13:09
that there's a predator approaching and
13:10
they then do it too
13:12
okay like the mexican wave in football
13:15
stadiums notifies the people on the
13:16
other end that there's a mexican wave
13:18
coming yes but in that case the predator
13:20
is the mexican wave
13:26
so this mad honey it's from plants
13:29
from the rhododendron plant is it
13:31
something like that yes it's bees that
13:33
pollinate using the rhododendron plant
13:35
in spring which and then that makes them
13:37
make the mad honey
13:38
right but it's been known about for
13:39
millennia hasn't it like the romans
13:41
wrote about it the greeks wrote about it
13:43
yeah um there was someone quite recently
13:45
a bit more recently a married couple who
13:47
deliberately had some mad honey
13:49
um for reasons of sexual performance
13:52
they'd been ringing the meningitis
13:53
hotline hadn't they
13:54
[Laughter]
13:56
but it's yeah it's said to be a sort of
13:58
viagra isn't it yeah so they have one
14:00
teaspoon per day for a week
14:02
and then after a week they decided to
14:04
crank it up and had a full tablespoon
14:06
each
14:08
but unfortunately that meant they
14:09
suffered from confusion chest pain
14:11
low blood pressure and a slowed
14:13
heartbeat and they had to go to the
14:15
hospital and it turned out they
14:16
both had a mild heart attack whoa
14:20
oh yeah no not sexy
14:24
okay
14:24
[Laughter]
14:27
it could be worse i read that if you
14:29
have too much of it
14:30
your body purges itself from both ends
14:32
and then you go intermittently blind
14:34
have a sound wave pulsing in your head
14:36
and then you're paralyzed for a day
14:39
not sexy not sexy yeah apparently you're
14:43
suddenly seized at one point with the
14:45
urge to simultaneously urinate defecate
14:47
and vomit
14:48
and then you do all of those things but
14:50
then i think it's the purging process
14:51
which creates the spiritual
14:53
um awakening have you guys heard of uh
14:55
dawson's bees
14:57
do awesome species bees this is so cool
14:59
they are so aggressive that during their
15:01
mating sessions
15:02
all the males bite each other to death
15:06
not all of them all of them all of them
15:08
in the mating process how does the
15:09
mating happen then well i think they're
15:10
kind of mating and biting at the same
15:12
time but basically
15:14
all the males not sexy not sexy
15:17
but but sexual yeah yeah um so the
15:20
entire generation of males is wiped out
15:22
and the only ones left behind to the
15:24
females and they just get along with
15:25
each other fine
15:26
[Laughter]
15:28
and then they raise the next generation
15:29
of males who kill each other and leave
15:31
the females to get on with it again
15:33
wow that's amazing and you know
15:36
something to
15:37
take a note of i suppose right yeah
15:42
i've read that um a lot of honey that we
15:44
buy in shops these days
15:45
are not as honey-ish as they can be
15:49
they're they sort of get watered down in
15:51
the process and they disguise it because
15:53
it's very hard if you're just going
15:54
through honey to be like
15:55
that's been watered down and it's a big
15:57
industry it's like a mafia style
15:59
industry and they call it honey
16:00
laundering
16:01
and they yeah genuinely it's called
16:04
honey laundering
16:04
and so good yeah something like 75
16:07
percent of honey that we have in shots
16:09
has been watered down so it's not in its
16:11
pure state
16:12
i made that bit up but it was yeah it
16:13
was
16:15
it's a stat like that kind of oh yeah
16:17
yeah
16:18
there were there were victorian honey
16:19
launderers and they did exactly the same
16:21
thing and they would i think it was just
16:22
they just used syrup or
16:24
sometimes they just used glucose they
16:25
just poured it into a jar and
16:27
for added uh verite they would sprinkle
16:29
in a couple of wings and legs
16:31
so you would think ah good this is
16:33
proper honey
16:35
there was someone who got in trouble for
16:36
stealing honey in 2008 actually
16:39
and this was in macedonia and this was a
16:42
bear
16:42
who was convicted in a court of criminal
16:45
damage
16:46
for stealing honey jim this said this is
16:48
the case was brought by this beekeeper
16:49
and this bear had been stealing his bee
16:51
constantly stealing his bee stealing his
16:53
honey
16:54
constantly um and eventually he reported
16:57
the bear the first thing he tried was to
16:58
play
16:59
loud serbian turbo folk music
17:03
so yeah he took the the um bear to court
17:06
and the bear didn't actually turn up in
17:08
court
17:08
and so the state had to pay the fine it
17:11
was about 1800 pounds
17:13
imagine imagine being the cell mate who
17:15
gets stuck in with the best
17:18
what are you in for mate
17:19
[Laughter]
17:23
got caught in a honey trap
17:34
well sometimes a pun is so good you just
17:38
need to sit in silence and respect it
17:40
um did you know that bees were sent up
17:43
on interspace in 1984 as they have been
17:45
a few times
17:46
i think but they were sent on a
17:47
challenger flight and there were 3
17:49
300 bees in space they were housed in
17:52
this little box and it was to see how
17:53
they dealt with zero gravity
17:54
and whether they built a decent enough
17:56
hive and stuff and they did really well
17:58
actually
17:58
they built a nearly normal comb
18:00
according to nasa
18:02
but bees are very clean so they don't
18:04
like to excrete inside their hive
18:06
they always go out to we and in this
18:09
challenger thing they were just stuck in
18:10
the hive the whole time so even though
18:11
they were there for a full week and
18:12
they're excreting you know
18:14
every hour usually they held it all in
18:17
yeah they sucked it up they waited and
18:19
then they just had an explosive time as
18:21
soon as they got back to earth i guess
18:23
but yeah there was no excreting and the
18:25
nasa spokesperson said when the hive got
18:27
back from space it was as clean as a pin
18:30
really yeah and one minute later it was
18:33
not as clean as
18:33
yeah well just on uh um b specifically
18:37
honeybee genitalia
18:38
um i was reading about their sex life
18:40
and andy yes it is sexy
18:42
uh they oh no i've just remembered what
18:44
it is they
18:45
[Laughter]
18:47
they have sex and the ejaculation is so
18:50
intense for them
18:51
their penis explodes that is true
18:54
there's actually an audible pop that
18:56
humans can hear
18:57
whoa really why where are you
19:01
that you're listening in on a
19:05
with a stethoscope up against the eyes
19:09
we should move on to our third fact guys
19:10
uh okay it is time for our third
19:13
fact of the show and that is james
19:16
harkin
19:16
okay my fact this week is the man who
19:18
invented the pink flamingo
19:20
garden ornament dressed in matching
19:23
clothes with his wife
19:24
for 35 years it's amazing
19:28
it's so weird is it weird or is it sweet
19:32
sweet it's sweet okay cheer for
19:37
oh weird for sweet
19:40
extremely female cheer for sweets
19:44
it's so incredible like even when they
19:46
were in different places
19:48
she would pack his suitcase and tell him
19:50
what to wear on each day so they felt
19:52
closer to each other
19:53
yeah yeah there was something that
19:54
wouldn't make me feel closer to my
19:56
partner of course they
19:57
that would make me feel like i needed to
19:59
reassess the relationship
20:00
[Laughter]
20:02
but there was an interview with this
20:03
guy's wife he was called donald
20:04
featherstone and he died in 2015.
20:07
there was an interview with his wife and
20:08
she said that donald proposed on their
20:10
first date
20:11
and they've been together almost all the
20:13
time since
20:14
wow they didn't go apart that much and
20:17
they said
20:18
we find it funny when we're watching
20:20
those crime shows
20:21
and they say what was he wearing when
20:23
you last saw him
20:25
if it was us we could point to ourselves
20:27
and say this
20:30
[Laughter]
20:33
that must be so fun watching tv with
20:35
them
20:37
hey uh by the way we should just quickly
20:38
explain the absolute
20:40
cultural um massiveness of this
20:42
character he created these pink flamingo
20:45
ornaments picture
20:46
that ornament in your head that's the
20:47
one that he invented and
20:51
well thanks for clarifying that dad
20:56
picture the other one that's not the one
20:59
it was the one you thought of first and
21:00
that so he
21:02
created the pink flamingo and it was
21:04
ginormous no
21:05
i mean it was small but the
21:08
the the production line of it was
21:11
ginormous they sold a load of them
21:12
as well yeah yeah
21:13
there's something like 50 million out
21:15
there in the world and
21:16
and it was a casting mold that he made
21:18
of a flamingo and he done lots of
21:19
different animals and they all
21:21
had you know mild success but not
21:23
flamingo success
21:24
the duck was quite big yeah the duck was
21:26
bigger than the flamingo for three
21:28
decades late 80s that the flamingo
21:30
overtook the ducks which i can't even
21:32
picture the duck
21:33
just imagine that duck
21:35
[Laughter]
21:36
he did that yeah
21:40
and he based on a real duck didn't he
21:41
that he he bought a duck and he kept it
21:44
in his sink
21:45
and he built a model of this duck
21:48
probably unhappy looking duck that he
21:51
tried to sell yeah called charlie
21:52
and he set it up with mirrors in his
21:54
words so it would think it had friends
21:58
this is the best couple ever this is so
22:00
exciting they also had because so they
22:02
had
22:02
um four different wardrobes physical uh
22:05
built wardrobes in their house and in
22:07
each wardrobe was the different season
22:09
that they had
22:11
of the clothing relative to the season
22:13
so it's summertime let's go to wardrobe
22:15
number two and they would open it and
22:16
there would be
22:17
the matching his costume and then her
22:19
costume and then the next version of the
22:21
matching his hurricane
22:22
and then they had a special fifth
22:25
cupboard
22:26
that was specifically for the flamingo
22:28
based outfits
22:30
was it and they would occasionally go to
22:32
the fifth cupboard and go its flamingo
22:33
day and they would
22:36
and they would wear it
22:40
just on garden ornaments sure yeah
22:43
do you know what the first uh garden
22:45
ornaments were oh these were very early
22:47
garden ornaments i don't know if they
22:48
were the first
22:49
like gnomes or they were like gnomes
22:52
they were ancient greek statues of the
22:54
god
22:54
priapos with an enormous erection
22:59
absolutely massive and the basic message
23:01
was if you come in here priapus will
23:03
chase you
23:06
so it's like having a guard dog before
23:08
guard dogs are involved it's like having
23:09
a guard penis basically
23:12
actually i i found that as well um it
23:14
said it also was to promote fertility
23:17
and also to scare birds away
23:20
it would give them a perch more than
23:22
anything
23:22
[Music]
23:24
um flamingos oh yeah this is amazing
23:27
parent flamingos pass their color to
23:30
their children
23:31
so flamingos are only pink because of
23:33
the things they eat they're all pink
23:35
right they're all pink but the
23:36
when they're born they're gray and it's
23:38
because they haven't eaten any of the
23:39
shrimp
23:40
that have the pink pigment in that gives
23:42
the um the
23:43
flamingos their color so baby flamingos
23:46
start getting pink as their parents feed
23:48
them and they turn pink and the parents
23:50
start to fade what yeah yeah
23:53
the pink transfer that's where you're
23:55
going now you've had a kid then
23:58
fading away
24:05
they are the ultimate metaphor for
24:07
mortality amazing
24:09
wow so uh we've discussed this before on
24:11
on the tv show
24:12
so you know how the bird joint that
24:14
looks like the knee and bends backwards
24:16
that's actually the ankle
24:17
right and the their knee is actually up
24:19
uh right by the body so you can't see
24:21
their knee
24:21
then the ankle bends backwards and then
24:23
they're standing on their tiptoes
24:24
basically
24:25
this is amazing baby flamingos haven't
24:27
worked out yet how to move that joint up
24:30
right so they haven't worked out how to
24:31
stand on the very tall legs like their
24:33
parents so if you look at a baby
24:34
flamingo
24:35
it's got these massively long clown legs
24:37
and then this tiny little joint up to
24:39
its body
24:39
it's so funny it's feet come out way
24:42
further than it is tall
24:44
it's incredible it must be that is
24:45
amazing there must be a moment in the
24:47
flamingo's life where it just goes
24:52
they do look stupid don't they they look
24:54
really stupid
24:56
okay let's move on to our final fact of
24:57
the show and that is
24:59
andy my fact is that when winston
25:02
churchill made his first
25:03
radio address to the people of occupied
25:05
france he had his male french coach
25:07
sitting on his lap this is true
25:11
it's this is from a new book about the
25:13
bbc in the sacrament war it's called
25:15
auntie's war by edward sturton
25:16
and it was october 1940. france has
25:19
fallen to the nazis
25:20
and churchill had to make a rallying cry
25:22
to the people of occupied france he did
25:24
it in french
25:25
because he wanted to speak to the french
25:26
in their own language and he said
25:28
francais
25:29
churchill and but better than that
25:32
because he was very
25:33
very good at french or was he very good
25:35
well he had his french teacher sitting
25:36
on his lap
25:38
because i read on winston churchill.org
25:41
who you think would be on his side that
25:43
his french was variously described on a
25:45
scale from
25:46
poor to excremental oh
25:50
it was very controversial his ability to
25:52
speak french i think wasn't it i think
25:53
de gaulle
25:54
wasn't impressed at one point and he
25:56
spoke with a deliberately very
25:58
english accent yeah so he would say
26:00
marseille instead of marseille and he'd
26:02
say calais
26:03
but he deliberately mispronounced these
26:05
things yeah but he was on his what was
26:07
he gonna do while he was on his lap he
26:09
was just giving him extra tuition
26:11
how but because he could do that sitting
26:13
next to him
26:14
oh no no the thing is the room was so
26:16
small they were in i know this
26:17
it sounds bad didn't it but it was a
26:20
different time in the 40s it was
26:22
it was no he the the his it was an
26:24
improvised radio studio in the cabinet
26:26
wall rooms and there was one
26:27
chair in the room basically what is he
26:29
going to do during that speech is he
26:30
going to be whispering the words
26:32
i don't know i guess you could point to
26:34
the syllables on the page for emphasis
26:36
i'm not sure i think what we're saying
26:38
is it wouldn't stand up as a defense in
26:40
court
26:40
now but
26:43
he ended it by saying um sleep well to
26:46
the french because it was it was a
26:47
broadcast in the evening
26:48
and he said sleep well um the dawn will
26:50
come brightly it will shine on the brave
26:52
and true glorious on the tombs of heroes
26:54
viv la france which is very moving and
26:56
stirring but when he first arrived in
26:58
the room to deliver the speech he just
27:00
said
27:00
where is my frog speech
27:05
wow so this reminded me of another story
27:08
where i think someone was uh very
27:10
practical
27:11
uh to be there with the person who was
27:13
who was delivering this speech
27:14
um this was lord john kerr
27:18
and if you don't know the name lord john
27:19
kerr he is the person who wrote article
27:21
50.
27:22
that's what his he he wrote that not in
27:24
spain as juan care
27:28
yeah he's one car in spain it's awesome
27:30
um
27:32
and so um in 1991 john major when he was
27:36
prime minister
27:37
he was having to debate the emu which is
27:39
the economic and monetary union of the
27:41
single currency
27:42
uh basically he was debating that
27:43
whether or not to go with the euro
27:45
that's it
27:46
and um he was so ill prepared for it he
27:49
didn't know what to do that much like a
27:50
table like this where it's fabric on the
27:52
top
27:53
before the meeting started and the
27:54
dignitaries came in to talk to him
27:56
he had john kerr hide underneath the
27:59
table
28:00
and as he was sort of trying to find
28:02
what he was doing jonko was writing
28:04
little notes and handing them up
28:06
to john major so he would look and go
28:08
actually this is what i think
28:09
that that's a practical tutor that is
28:12
incredible
28:13
it is absolutely incredible that in our
28:15
in living memory the prime minister had
28:16
a
28:17
man under a table passing a knight and
28:19
what where did they think these notes
28:20
were coming from
28:21
on the other side of the table oh john
28:24
made just magic penises passing in
28:25
minutes again
28:28
is he but winston churchill was one of
28:31
those people who
28:32
i think there are two different types of
28:33
people some people go to france and
28:34
they're too scared to try out their
28:35
french because they might look like an
28:36
idiot and then some people are really
28:38
bad at french and they go and they just
28:39
confidently
28:40
roll on in there and churchill was
28:42
definitely one of those so he used to
28:43
make up french words
28:45
when he didn't know what the word was so
28:47
that he he said one very famous thing to
28:49
de gaul when they were debating
28:50
strategy in 1941 he said c
28:53
vu's obstacle rate je vous liquidare
28:57
which obstacle rate is not a word in
28:59
french
29:00
but it was one of those things that he
29:01
kind of got the general gist if you get
29:03
in my way i'll liquidate you
29:05
and he did it in english as well he made
29:08
up
29:09
english words so he made up the word uh
29:12
paintious
29:13
to describe places that were worthy of
29:15
being painted by him
29:16
just dropped that in one day chardegal
29:19
once said
29:20
that only through learning english was
29:22
he able to understand churchill's french
29:28
it was a time of sick burns the second
29:30
world war i didn't realize this but
29:32
the girl once said when i am right i get
29:35
angry
29:36
when churchill gets angry he is wrong we
29:38
are angry at each other much of the time
29:40
[Laughter]
29:43
this was our closest always we were
29:45
talking to
29:46
he did say that um he didn't really
29:49
enjoy speaking french so he spoke it
29:51
during the war for diplomatic reasons
29:52
and chastised chelsea
29:54
and then in 1946 he went to france and
29:57
he was
29:57
asked a question in french and he said
29:59
no no i won't be speaking french
30:01
that was a sacrifice that had to be
30:02
accepted in wartime
30:05
bang another singer
30:09
wasn't his mother french yes so that's
30:12
why he could speak it quite well
30:13
yeah and his letters to his mother they
30:16
were half english and half french
30:18
so they had stuff like we arrived at
30:20
dieppe onu
30:22
partouque de boncafe olay i prayed la
30:25
dejanei
30:26
we went for a walk
30:29
that's really good yeah um i have some
30:31
french phrases i wonder if
30:33
you will know what they mean okay um
30:36
i've got other cats to whip that's
30:39
english
30:42
all right all right is it like i've got
30:45
other
30:46
things to do or bingo other fish to fry
30:49
exactly
30:52
oh can you do it in english please
30:53
[Laughter]
30:55
i've got an ass full of noodles
30:59
and the phrase
31:03
um in russian noodles on your ear means
31:05
someone is um
31:06
like telling stories no this means i'm
31:08
lucky okay
31:11
uh sofia common rat more
31:14
i'm pooing like a dead rat
31:18
is that literal no it means i'm bored
31:22
oh does it yeah oh sorry i thought you
31:25
meant it actually meant that you would
31:26
just had
31:27
had the shits or something no no okay
31:29
because there is one which is avoir la
31:31
top
31:32
oguiche which is it literally is
31:36
so many french speakers in the audience
31:37
it's awesome are there any french people
31:39
or french fluent speakers in tonight
31:42
um do shout out if we get this wrong but
31:44
i heard that that literally means avoir
31:46
la top ogie it means to have a mole at
31:48
the counter
31:49
which means that you really need to poo
31:54
a mole a ball of the counter
31:58
just waiting to be served is that true
31:59
it's a beautiful language isn't it
32:01
the language of love
32:06
um we're gonna have to wrap up very soon
32:08
uh do you guys have stuff before we do
32:10
uh well i can tell you something about
32:13
radio broadcasting the war
32:14
oh yeah um so in world war ii there were
32:16
air raids in leningrad
32:17
and they broadcasted over the radio and
32:20
also in massive loudspeakers
32:21
um instructions to take cover and what
32:24
to do whenever there were attacks
32:26
and if there was going to be attacks
32:27
they told you that was happening but
32:28
it's all done on the radio
32:30
but the problem is how do you know that
32:31
the germans haven't bombed the radio
32:33
place
32:34
right and so in world war ii in
32:36
leningrad
32:37
they had the sound of a metronome
32:39
playing
32:40
on the radio and the loudspeakers all
32:43
over just going
32:44
tick tock tick tock whoa
32:48
wait all loud speakers in public places
32:51
that is very annoying isn't it wow yes
32:55

32:56
the experience of total war

00:52
here we go starting with my fact my fact
00:55
this week
00:56
is that as well as getting a visit from
00:58
santa claus at christmas
00:59
icelanders also get a visit from the
01:01
spoon licker
01:04
the door sniffer and the sausage swiper
01:10
yeah so these they do have santa there
01:13
but they also have and this is what
01:14
wikipedia says they're called
01:16
your lads they're like lads that's
01:18
that's that's that's
01:19
nice that's our life also sausage wiper
01:23
they think the reason wikipedia calls
01:25
them that is because that's what they
01:26
are called
01:27
yeah right oh okay okay cool yeah um
01:31
i mean i know you've fallen for fake
01:33
wikipedia facts a lot in the past
01:35
but this is real i just thought that was
01:37
cool casual lingo i was like yeah i'm
01:39
cool with you wiki
01:40
um so yeah they're called the yule lads
01:42
and there's there's 13 of them in total
01:44
spoon liquor is one
01:45
he um licks bowls no he looks spoons
01:48
but there is a bowl licker there is
01:50
actually a bowling coat yeah i misread
01:51
my note there
01:53
and then covered it up like it was a
01:55
joke um
01:57
there's the sausage swiper who licks
01:59
spoons and then
02:00
[Laughter]
02:02
so does the sausage swiper he swipes
02:05
sausages does he yeah so he hides in the
02:07
rafters of your house and
02:08
while you go and you know check for your
02:10
spoon so someone's licked the spoons you
02:12
quickly
02:13
you quickly head into the kitchen he
02:15
lowers himself i think
02:17
tom cruise style from mexican impossible
02:19
gets your sausages and then gets pulled
02:21
back up
02:22
to the uh to the roof and then you come
02:23
back in you go ah the spoons now the
02:25
sausages what's going on
02:27
yeah we've had three what are the other
02:29
10 like um there's a guy
02:31
who um he he harasses sheep
02:37
they all have very like expressive names
02:39
don't they yeah his one's not so
02:41
sheep coat claude is his name yeah um
02:44
yeah
02:44
there's meat hook they were all thieves
02:47
basically aren't they yeah
02:48
just in ice and you just have to accept
02:50
the like people will come and steal all
02:52
your stuff
02:52
um there's pot scraper there's door the
02:55
doorway sniffer
02:56
is not someone who likes doorways it's
02:58
just someone who's smelling beyond the
02:59
doorway to try and steal your food later
03:01
but there used to be way more of them so
03:03
there used to be more than 80 yule lands
03:05
whoa
03:05
which is a lot to descend upon you and
03:08
uh the ones that were
03:10
you know kibosh about mid-century were
03:13
uh falda feykir which is skirt sweeper
03:18
he got the shop um and literally pungo
03:21
which is small testicles
03:24
what did he do he just went around
03:27
flattering people
03:31
those are bigger than mine
03:35
i've got small ones so it's yeah so
03:38
do they do these guys bring you anything
03:40
or do they just take things away they
03:41
take things well they used to take
03:43
things away and back in the day in 1746
03:46
uh the stories became so scary that they
03:48
actually banned them from telling them
03:49
to children because
03:50
they they brought them into such a sort
03:52
of stephen king-esque territory of fear
03:54
that they said this is too much it was
03:56
the danish wasn't it who did that and
03:58
not only that they banned using any
04:00
stories to scare children
04:02
yeah and it was because of these guys it
04:04
wasn't only because of them so have you
04:05
heard of iceland's
04:07
famous christmas child eating cat
04:13
who prowls around the country eating
04:15
children on christmas day
04:18
um and the terrible thing is so you know
04:20
if you're naughty or nice you'll get
04:22
you'll get presents or you get a lump of
04:23
coal
04:24
the child has no control over whether
04:26
it's eaten or not
04:28
the only thing that controls whether
04:29
childhood is eaten or not is whether the
04:31
child got any new clothes for christmas
04:33
from his parents and if your parents
04:34
didn't give you some socks
04:36
you're going to be eaten there is a
04:38
slight thing with that with
04:40
if you've done all of your chores by
04:42
christmas day then they're supposed to
04:43
give you some
04:44
clothes but they they could not it just
04:47
look just i'm saying that that would be
04:49
a pretty harsh bit of parenting
04:54
it's insult to injury isn't it a you're
04:56
not getting a new t-shirt and b you're
04:58
about to be eaten by a giant cat
05:00
yeah it was a big cut though wasn't it
05:01
it was like the size of a house
05:03
and it belonged to a troll right so it
05:05
was like katy hop this is all still
05:08

05:54
but she killed all of her husbands
05:56
because they bored her
05:58
wow my wife is in the audience and i
06:00
just like to say that's not the right
06:02
way to behave
06:04
and she is the mother of the yule lads
06:06
no she's just my wife
06:08
[Laughter]
06:14
and she she is half ogre half troll and
06:16
i am referring here
06:18
to grueller
06:22
and their cat is christmas cat yeah the
06:24
family cat is christmas cat and the cat
06:26
brings
06:27
the yule sometimes grabbed children and
06:29
brought them back to be turned into stew
06:31
but this is all just to deter children
06:32
from misbehaving it's not anything worse
06:34
than what we do which is sound won't
06:36
bring your presence if you're bad
06:37
um should we talk about father christmas
06:39
yeah sure because you know
06:41
he is leaking sorry wow his bones father
06:44
christmas has bones uh so this is
06:46
nicholas
06:47
and he has some relics and it's kind of
06:49
debatable which relics are his but it's
06:50
generally accepted that he has some in
06:52
italy
06:53
and they leak it's a clear liquid that
06:55
is called sort of manner by the priests
06:57
who guard the tomb and
06:59
it can sell for a good
07:02
[Laughter]
07:04
but i think it's because he's in this
07:05
place called bari in italy which is a
07:07
harbour town so it's below sea level in
07:09
fact so the harbour water tends to seep
07:11
into
07:12
where he's entombed and then every year
07:14
they have this festival
07:15
where a holy fish has come in
07:20
yeah exactly it's like the great story
07:22
of jesus he makes fish out of
07:24
um santa
07:29
there's a place where uh i think it's
07:31
south america yeah it's
07:32
um parts of latin america um father
07:36
baby the bot hang on the models of baby
07:40
jesus are dressed up like father
07:41
christmas
07:43
yeah there's this weird synergy between
07:45
uh jesus and father christmas
07:47
really yeah i can't find it in my notes
07:49
either
07:51
i am panicking like crazy
07:53
[Laughter]
07:55
oh yeah yeah yeah i've seen the words
07:58
magic helicopter
07:59
yeah well no
08:04
yeah so basically that you get you get
08:07
presents from the baby jesus you don't
08:09
get them from father christmas so that's
08:10
why they've kind of dressed up the two
08:11
traditions together
08:12
but people ask children how exactly does
08:14
that work how are you getting presents
08:15
from this baby
08:16
and they variously explained a that he
08:18
has a magic helicopter
08:20
or b that he just hasn't he owns all the
08:22
toy shops he's just a massive toy
08:24
magnate
08:24
and he can afford to give them to
08:26
children
08:28
do you know how the reason he exists
08:29
though is because it's too difficult for
08:31
jesus on his own to deliver all those
08:33
presents
08:34
so um what this is so so nicholas was
08:38
a like a common thing everyone knew
08:41
about nicholas until about the
08:42
1500s um and then the reformation came
08:46
in and protestantism came in and they
08:47
said jesus is the only thing
08:49
and then it was established that there
08:50
should be a festival where jesus brings
08:52
everyone presents
08:53
on christmas day on the day of his birth
08:56
and then it was established that a tiny
08:58
newborn baby
08:59
can't handle all these presents and all
09:01
this present giving
09:03
and so father christmas initially was
09:05
the sidekick to jesus
09:06
this was like no post reformation was
09:09
the first time he became his
09:11
co-deliverer of gifts because it was
09:12
like well he's a tiny baby he can't
09:14
actually carry all these presents so
09:16
um so nicholas joined him but a tiny
09:18
baby would be
09:19
could fit down a chimney much more
09:21
easily than a massive
09:23
man so that was why father chris has
09:25
brought jesus it was a symbiotic
09:26
relationship
09:28
but so are there actual historical
09:30
stories of the two of them
09:31
like batman robin style just traveling
09:35
i refer you to the word historical in
09:36
that sentence
09:37
[Laughter]
09:39
all right shall we move on to our second
09:40
fact okay it is time for our second fact
09:43
of the show and that is anna
09:44
yeah my fact this week is that an
09:46
ancient greek form of contraception
09:49
was a suppository made of frankincense
09:52
myrrh
09:52
and blister beetles
09:55
this is this is the thing and blister
09:57
beetles by the way if you don't know
09:58
what they are they're beetles that cause
09:59
blisters
10:00
um um no there so blister beetles are
10:03
these things that secrete something
10:04
called
10:04
cantha ridden uh which i probably
10:06
mispronounced but it's this poison and
10:08
the reason they secrete it is because
10:09
they give it to their their the male
10:12
gives it to the female during mating as
10:14
a gift as like a mating gift
10:16
but during sex which is a bit weird um
10:18
and then it's to cover her eggs with it
10:21
and that stops predators from you know
10:23
getting hold of it but it's actually
10:25
very poisonous
10:26
um so a tenth of a milligram can blister
10:28
your skin really badly but this was a
10:30
very common
10:31
medicine so it was used as a
10:33
contraception you shove it up the bum
10:34
and you don't get pregnant that is what
10:38
traditionally happens when you
10:44
shuffle
10:46
[Laughter]
10:52
oh that blister beetle stuff is called
10:55
spanish fly i think
10:56
and yeah it was an aphrodisiac as well
10:59
yeah uh
10:59
and i think i've written down casanova
11:02
and marquis de sade i can't remember
11:03
which one it was but one of them used it
11:05
as a
11:06
um as an aphrodisiac marky and
11:09
that's what he got said to prison sorry
11:10
if you're using the blister beetles
11:12
thing yeah but i think that's right
11:15
yeah yeah and the idea was it would make
11:18
you itchy and you would put it down
11:19
there and you would itch yourself and
11:20
that would turn you on
11:22
oh yeah nice just a bit of history
11:27
a good tip for the room
11:31
but frankincense and mac come on let's
11:33
talk about those christmas
11:35
yeah frankincense a bit of a panacea
11:37
people thought it
11:38
um kind of cured loads of different
11:39
things in oman it still is a little bit
11:42
uh it's been variously used as a stomach
11:44
soother a cough remover a blood thinner
11:46
cold medicine wound cleaner and fly
11:49
repellent
11:51
and it was really really popular in oman
11:54
it was
11:54
basically made them one of the most kind
11:56
of rich countries in the world
11:58
uh but not anymore because the roman
12:00
catholic church buys the cheap stuff
12:01
from somalia these days
12:04
what um what is frankincense it's
12:06
incense
12:07
what is the word frank at the front
12:11
is that really what it is yeah and frank
12:13
kind of means honest or whatever it just
12:15
means really good
12:16
really good incense don't don't listen
12:18
it's true
12:20
i swear to god that's true that is true
12:22
was the incense bit true all of it's
12:24
true
12:24
the frank bit as well yeah andy
12:29
dan the reason i asked was because i
12:31
dramatically under researched on this
12:32
fact
12:34
but it is and the word frank to mean
12:36
sort of really good and honest
12:38
came from frank's meaning french people
12:40
as well from the roman times
12:41
uh and in fact in roman times it was so
12:44
important frankincense that
12:45
augustus caesar sent 10 000 troops to
12:48
invade the area where frankincense came
12:50
from because he thought it was so
12:51
important
12:52
right it's so weird it was so important
12:55
yeah frankincense and
12:57
it so it was medicinally thought to be
12:58
so important and it was an incense and
13:01
it's from tree sap basically isn't it
13:03
which is like mer they're both basically
13:05
from tree sap and they're turned into
13:06
incense um but
13:08
between 1000 bc and 400 a.d
13:12
frankincense was the most lucrative
13:14
trade in the world
13:15
it was the most valuable thing in the
13:17
world to be traded for
13:18
like 1500 years it's amazing and in oman
13:21
it's still a really big deal to the
13:22
extent that
13:23
they have i think roundabouts in oman
13:26
are quite famous so they're
13:27
quite well decorated with giant versions
13:29
of stuff and in quite a lot of
13:30
roundabouts in oman
13:32
then they have giant frankincense
13:34
dispensers
13:35
like properly huge the size of a
13:37
building a frankincense dispenser
13:39
in the center for a roundabout i did a
13:41
little bit on gift giving okay
13:43
so because these blister beetles they
13:45
they give a present to their mates
13:46
during sex
13:47
and so i looked up and also gold
13:49
frankincense and there were gifts given
13:51
to the baby jesus
13:53
there are so many links to the
13:59
um but so you've heard of these spiders
14:01
that give gifts to the females
14:02
uh they're called paratra kalea ornata
14:05
and they give
14:06
silk wrapped parcels full of prey and
14:09
it's really interesting because 70
14:10
of them give rubbish gifts which are
14:14
worthless they're leftovers it's like
14:16
basically giving someone an empty
14:18
selection box selection box exactly
14:20
because it's like just the bouncy bar
14:22
left in
14:23
exactly it is exactly like that but
14:25
basically the male suppliers they can't
14:27
help themselves from eating
14:28
most of the present before they give it
14:30
to the female then right better just
14:31
right this nice oh god it's so oh
14:34
um but the spiders uh it's really
14:37
sensible for the spiders to give a
14:39
rubbish
14:39
present to the female because the
14:40
females don't judge on what's inside the
14:42
parcel by the time they open the package
14:44
they've already uh pressed the button to
14:46
go ahead or not go ahead with the mating
14:48
and what they judge on is how the male
14:50
uh looks his physical condition
14:52
so the main thing is good body
14:54
conditions so the males who ate their
14:56
gifts were cleverer
14:57
because it's better to turn up looking
14:59
well fed and in good shape
15:01
but with nothing in the box than it is
15:04
to turn up with an actual meal in the
15:05
box but you look hungry
15:07
and you do know that's not going to fly
15:08
in your own life
15:11
in fact the main thing with dalek is
15:12
that i look good
15:17
i read something really interesting
15:18
today um have you guys heard the
15:20
jesus as an alien theory no no jesus
15:24
oh no hang in there this one's really
15:27
interesting
15:30
so the idea is that um a lot of people
15:32
think that jesus is an alien
15:34
and so because they describe in the
15:37
bible
15:38
um that the star they say lo the star
15:41
which they saw in the east went before
15:43
them until it came and stood over where
15:45
the young child was and everyone's like
15:47
how can a star move like that that's
15:49
insane
15:49
maybe it wasn't a star maybe it was a
15:52
ufo
15:54
ufo comes guiding these three wise men
15:57
three kings from very separate places
15:58
who all of a sudden are hanging out
16:00
how's that happen were they like
16:01
a king conference like how one was from
16:04
persia one was from india they were all
16:05
over the shop and suddenly
16:06
they're
16:12
then you go okay the immaculate
16:15
conception
16:16
how did she have the child inside of her
16:18
well that's very consistent my friends
16:20
with an abduction where they bring you
16:22
up and they play something inside you
16:24
not my theory you're saying the fact
16:25
that
16:26
murray was anally probed
16:29
and that's the one time where the bum
16:30
contraception would not work andy
16:33
because look what she had a jesus so
16:38
i cannot believe you've done this to our
16:40
show what do you mean
16:41
this is can i tell you something about
16:44
jesus that
16:44
well can i ask you something about jesus
16:47
where was he born
16:48
bethlehem incorrect
16:52
not bethlehem he was born in bethlehem
16:56
so
16:59
it's a different bethlehem there's a
17:01
bethlehem in israel where everyone goes
17:03
and they're like this is the birthplace
17:04
of jesus but
17:05
israel has two bethlehems and it turns
17:08
out
17:08
that the one that is much closer to uh
17:11
nazareth where jesus was born
17:13
is a totally different bethlehem and
17:15
archaeologists now are saying
17:16
that actually we've got the wrong one so
17:19
the place that everyone goes to
17:20
celebrate the birth of jesus is
17:21
completely wrong
17:22
it's somewhere yeah they should go to
17:23
area 51
17:24
[Laughter]
17:31
you know i'm trying to raise the turn
17:32
but whatever
17:35
um so do you know what the names of the
17:37
three wise men were
17:38
yes and
17:41
casper yeah okay and according to a
17:43
survey by the british christmas tree
17:45
growers association
17:50
your sourcing is getting worse
17:54
there is only one place in the world or
17:56
at least in the uk
17:57
where there are people with those
17:59
surnames that all live in that place
18:01
and it is eaton has eaten it isn't it
18:03
it's bedfordshire
18:06
apparently there are people with that
18:08
names and they decided
18:09
because presumably it was a slow season
18:11
for christmas tree growing
18:13
that they'd look at all the different
18:14
christmasy names and see where people
18:16
are there is only one mr scrooge in the
18:18
whole world
18:19
and he lives in canada no there are 16
18:23
people in england
18:24
called grinch the surname grinch and
18:27
there's only one person in the whole uk
18:28
called mr baubles
18:30
[Laughter]
18:35
all right let's let's move on to our
18:37
next fact it is time for fact number
18:39
three and that is andy
18:40
my fact is that oregon has 12 times as
18:43
many christmas trees as humans
18:46
yeah so uh this is just a fact about how
18:48
many christmas trees there are you've
18:49
heard the fact it's about
18:52
how few humans there are in oregon
18:54
that's true but it's not it's got
18:57
a reasonably healthy human population
18:59
and just a shitload of christmas trees
19:02
um so the but the amazing thing is uh
19:05
how it harvests them so it harvests them
19:08
you may have seen this by helicopter to
19:10
whether the vacuum
19:11
magic helicopter is flown by jesus
19:13
[Laughter]
19:16
is not a magic helicopter they get
19:17
lifted up in massive bundles and it's
19:19
incredible to watch in action because
19:20
they're doing a constant zigzag
19:22
between um the the where the christmas
19:24
trees are in bundles and where they need
19:26
to be loaded and it takes about 26
19:28
seconds to fly
19:29
a few hundred years from one to the
19:30
other and then they zip back and one of
19:32
the
19:33
pilot trainers the helicopter pilot
19:35
trainer said it's similar to sprinting
19:37
down a field putting someone on your
19:38
back piggyback and then dropping them
19:40
off then running back across the field
19:42
which is such an unhelpful analogy
19:46
[Laughter]
19:48
but in america there's a massive
19:49
shortage right now of trees yeah of
19:52
christmas trees right
19:53
and this is because of the recession
19:54
when the recession happened was about
19:56
that amount of time ago that it takes to
19:58
grow a christmas tree
19:59
so just under 10 years so now we've got
20:02
a massive shortage because
20:03
people's businesses went to pot and they
20:05
went into other industries
20:06
so actually in oregon which is one of
20:08
the main christmas tree industries
20:10
uh pot growing marijuana growing is a
20:12
big industry as well
20:13
and so a lot of christmas tree farmers
20:15
have gone to marijuana instead
20:16
so you can't get a christmas tree you
20:19
can get some wood
20:20
does that mean like in what 15 years
20:22
time everyone will have
20:23
pot plants well pot plants
20:26
yeah really i guess so yeah giant pot
20:29
plants that they hang baubles and tinsel
20:31
off and put an angel on top of
20:33
yeah but there is a shortage it's a
20:35
problem
20:36
not a huge problem but
20:37
[Laughter]
20:41
do you know uh britain has a eurovision
20:43
for christmas trees
20:46
it's from the british christmas tree
20:48
growers association
20:54
they have an annual christmas tree
20:55
grower of the year competition
20:57
and they all compete on various metrics
20:59
of you know height and um
21:03
um so when you say eurovision sorry is
21:05
it all of europe it's not all of europe
21:07
it's all the
21:08
british christmas tree growers the only
21:10
thing
21:11
that even makes it slightly like
21:12
eurovision is we all ring up to see who
21:15
wins
21:16
it's on bbc one everyone prime time
21:19
it's hosted by graeme norton that's
21:21
right
21:22
it's got an undercurrent of cold war
21:24
rivalry
21:26
that determines the winner every year
21:31
is that they get to vote on each other's
21:33
troops
21:41
what happens to the best tree it's not
21:43
interesting
21:46
no it it gets to go outside downing
21:49
street
21:51
does it really yeah do you know what
21:52
happens to the runner up
21:54
it gets partly a pulp no the runner-up
21:58
gets to go
21:59
inside down history
22:01
[Laughter]
22:04
[Music]
22:05
that's amazing that's the better that's
22:07
the better price
22:09
because you don't get seen by the public
22:10
and stuff there yeah you get to hear all
22:13
the juicy goss
22:15
that's true so you can buy half
22:17
christmas trees
22:19
have you seen these they're pretty cool
22:20
it's basically them plastic ones
22:22
but they're basically half a christmas
22:24
tree and you lean it up against your
22:26
wall
22:27
that is so clever isn't that clever i
22:29
mean it's
22:30
awful but it is awfully clever
22:33
oh yeah no they put them up because if
22:35
you live in a small flat let's say in
22:36
london for instance you don't have that
22:38
much space
22:39
but you still want to see the christmas
22:40
tree then you can have it just half of
22:42
the wall
22:42
yeah that's great i think that's really
22:44
good and you can also have um
22:45
our gus sells upside down christmas
22:47
trees so the pointy bit is at the bottom
22:50
and the fat bed is at the top and that's
22:52
if you don't have much floor space
22:55
that's very cool and that used to happen
22:57
in the 19th century
22:59
did it people hung it upside down from
23:00
the rafters yeah really
23:02
yeah yeah because there was not much
23:04
floor space same reason
23:05
but actually the christmas tree industry
23:07
in the 2000s really hated these plastic
23:09
trees
23:11
in 2004 the national christmas tree
23:13
association of america
23:15
launched a free online video game called
23:18
attack of the mutant artificial
23:20
christmas tree
23:22
and in it you would throw snowballs at
23:24
artificial trees that were blamed for
23:26
sucking the spirit out of christmas
23:29
whereas actually artificial trees have
23:31
been around for almost as long as
23:32
christmas trees have been around
23:34
in popular terms right so feather trees
23:36
were a thing
23:37
from the late 19th century feather trees
23:40
uh
23:40
yeah so the first artificial christmas
23:42
trees were made of goose feather and
23:44
they used to kind of like
23:45
sort of back comb it so it looked like a
23:47
tree
23:48
and then they would paint it and that
23:50
was an artificial tree because they were
23:51
really worried about deforestation
23:53
in the 19th century which i think is
23:55
quite interesting and it's still an
23:56
argument about what's best for the
23:58
environment like an artificial one or a
23:59
real one right
24:00
yeah i read one report and a few of them
24:02
have kind of vary but one of them says
24:04
that it's better to use real ones but
24:07
not if you're going to use your
24:08
artificial tree for 20 years or more
24:10
20 years basically 20 years worth of
24:13
real trees is
24:14
one plastic one as well but i throw away
24:16
my plastic one every year
24:20
do you know how the christmas tree was
24:21
made popular uh
24:23
worldwide in the way it is martin luther
24:26
or something
24:26
uh i'm thinking about like commercially
24:28
popular it's made popular by
24:29
queen victoria um which so it was in
24:33
1846
24:34
when victoria and albert had a christmas
24:35
tree because in germany christmas trees
24:37
were where they celebrate
24:38
christmas and albert um came over and he
24:41
brought that over with him
24:43
and then this image of their christmas
24:44
tree was published in like london
24:46
illustrator magazine or something
24:48
and then it really caught on because
24:49
they had this decorated tree and so
24:51
everyone got this decorated tree
24:53
but then it caught on in america a
24:55
couple of years later
24:56
because it was in something called
24:58
goadie's ladybook
25:00
and it was totally innocent by the way
25:05
um but what they did was they took this
25:07
picture and they popularized it in
25:08
america
25:09
but they thought that victoria's tiara
25:12
and albert's moustache were too british
25:15
so they removed them this was like the
25:17
early days of photoshop and that's how
25:18
the christmas tree got popular in
25:20
america
25:21
was a moustacheless albert can i give
25:24
you a story from the new york herald in
25:26
the early 20th century about a cursed
25:28
christmas tree someone's allergic to
25:32
cursed christmas trees over there
25:34
um chopping the butt of a christmas tree
25:36
in prospect this afternoon
25:38
william smith a farmhand nearly cut off
25:41
his great toe
25:42
angered he threw an axe and it broke a
25:44
window and struck a child
25:46
[Music]
25:48
in the face inflicting a severe cut wow
25:51
can i just say you're all laughing at a
25:53
child it's a long time ago
25:55
it's a different time it was a different
25:56
time
25:57
[Music]
25:58
trimming the tree later mrs william
26:00
scoville
26:01
fell and broke an ankle indignant over
26:04
the chain of events howard scoville
26:06
son of the woman insisted on doing the
26:08
rest of the work himself
26:10
and while testing the candles set the
26:12
tree of fire and nearly burned down the
26:14
farmhouse
26:15
believing the tree bewitched the father
26:18
ambrose scoville
26:19
threw it into the hog pen where it fell
26:21
on and killed a chicken
26:25
i find it amazing that people didn't die
26:27
constantly from christmas tree accidents
26:29
because before electricity became a
26:30
thing
26:31
they were all lit by candlelight and
26:33
that was 50 60 years
26:34
of just being candles strapped to a tree
26:37
and they were decorated with snow made
26:39
out of cotton
26:40
yeah oh yeah dangerous you could get in
26:42
the 50s you could get um it was called
26:44
flocking wasn't it
26:45
you could get a an attachment uh for
26:47
your vacuum cleaner
26:48
which was a like a gun to fire
26:51
artificial
26:52
snow from your hoover all over the tree
26:54
wow
26:55
the candles have the candles yeah that's
26:58
so cool i know isn't it good
27:00
and you know like you're saying the
27:01
christmas tree with albert and victoria
27:03
suddenly took off um
27:04
that was the same for electric christmas
27:06
lights that we all have now around our
27:07
tree that was invented by a guy called
27:09
edward hibbert johnson
27:10
who was the right-hand man to thomas
27:13
edison
27:14
people were putting candles on their
27:15
tree they kept burning down and he
27:17
thought okay i'm gonna
27:18
i'm gonna try and make this a thing and
27:20
it just caught on in the next few years
27:21
in america just so quickly because it's
27:23
just such a beautiful thing
27:24
and he died of an electric shock no way
27:28
i don't it says citation needed on
27:30
wikipedia next to that but
27:35
but it sounds plausible
27:38
uh should we move on to the final fact
27:40
to the show it is time for our final
27:42
fact
27:42
of the show and that is james harkin
27:45
okay my fact this week is the man who
27:47
brought the phrase merry christmas
27:49
to english was also the first englishman
27:52
to use the word
27:52
prosecco was it in the same
27:56
card merry christmas i have invented
28:00
prosecco so he didn't invent it
28:04
uh it was invented by some italian
28:06
people sure but he was in italy at the
28:08
time he was a traveler called fines
28:10
morrison and he wrote all about italy
28:13
and lots of different countries actually
28:14
and he was traveling around the
28:16
time it was in the 16th century late
28:18
16th century
28:19
and it was kind of dangerous to travel
28:20
around the world really but especially
28:22
in europe
28:23
there was a time of kind of bad
28:25
religious strife and he would always
28:27
whenever anyone mentioned religion to
28:29
him especially around easter he would
28:31
immediately move to another city
28:33
to avoid inquiries when he was in spain
28:36
he pretended to be czech
28:38
when he was in france he pretended to be
28:39
polish when he was in netherlands he
28:41
pretended to be german
28:43
when he was in italy he pretended to be
28:44
dutch except when he was in rome and he
28:46
pretended to be french
28:48
okay and he traveled without any funds
28:50
he he didn't like have any official
28:52
protection
28:53
and so whenever there was any problems
28:55
he adopted a deferential posture
28:57
and avoided eye contact that's great
29:00
that's a good way of traveling though
29:02
it sounds like me on a night out
29:06
i read something about fines morrison
29:08
it's this is from the wikipedia entry on
29:10
him
29:10
and i'm quoting exactly here his
29:12
biographer charles hughes says he had a
29:15
sane charity for all men
29:17
except turks and irish priests
29:20
which is another way of saying that he
29:22
was prejudiced against
29:23
turks and irish priests
29:27
yeah he was he was a man of his time
29:31
but also no one had seen prosecco before
29:34
uh and this was
29:35
it was a drink that even pliny drank and
29:37
it was also known as pukinum
29:40
um and then he said it was called
29:42
pukinum now called prosecco much
29:44
celebrated by pliny
29:46
and when we say celebrated by plenty we
29:47
mean sparkling white wine presumably
29:50
yeah
29:50
yeah i had no idea that sparkling wine
29:52
went that far back yeah
29:54
yeah because with wine its default
29:56
position is often sparkling
29:58
we get the um we get the stuff which
29:59
they've taken the bubbles out
30:01
why why why do these people treat us
30:05
like children
30:08
doesn't want all wine to be sparkling
30:09
wine but children love fizzy stuff
30:11
yeah why are they treating what they're
30:13
treating us like grown-ups
30:15
but prosecco christmas drink at the
30:17
moment right the uk consumes 77 million
30:20
liters of prosecco last year
30:22
and i worked out that's in the region of
30:24
the amount of rain that falls on wembley
30:26
stadium in a year
30:31
also my favorite thing about brexit and
30:34
it's a long list
30:38
[Laughter]
30:41
thank god i've got a favorable audience
30:43
okay
30:44
so no but is that champagne can be sold
30:47
by the pint again
30:48
so there's always been this weird
30:50
dichotomy
30:51
which is that um wine can only be sold
30:55
in metric and beer can only be sold in
30:57
imperial
30:58
um but paul roger always used to sell
31:01
champagne by the pint
31:02
it was a bottle that was the size of a
31:04
pint rather than a pint glass yes
31:06
yeah yeah i bought those sizes a pint
31:07
and churchill loved paul roger that was
31:09
served in pines he said it was perfect
31:11
for lunch and actually
31:12
he he actually had paul rodger the
31:17
champagne manufacturers
31:18
deliver him a pint of champagne at 11
31:20
a.m every morning because he was so
31:22
such a fan of it and now paul roger have
31:25
explicitly said maybe one of the
31:26
advantages of leaving the eu
31:28
is that we'll be able to sell champagne
31:30
by the pint again and they're already
31:32
preparing to sell champagne by the pint
31:34
so if you want to be optimistic
31:36
about the future this is it is that one
31:40
of the battle buses we didn't see
31:41
[Laughter]
31:44
did you know one of the first battles of
31:45
the first world war was called the
31:46
champagne offensive
31:48
no yeah so it was uh it was when the
31:50
german armies were moving west uh
31:52
through
31:52
the champaign region and lots of people
31:54
at the time fled underground to the wine
31:56
cellars
31:57
but but basically they they learn their
31:59
lesson in the champagne region because
32:01
uh when the german army arrived again in
32:03
1940
32:04
uh there were false walls built in the
32:06
wine cellars to conceal
32:08
the really good stuff and supposedly
32:11
some houses like bollinger mislabeled
32:13
they're really good bottles
32:15
poison
32:18
they did it it was a real front of the
32:21
second world war that we haven't
32:22
acknowledged so far
32:23
i think there's a book called wine and
32:25
war i think
32:26
which has first-hand accounts of
32:28
winemakers in france
32:30
who fought the nazis by withholding
32:32
their best wine and they're so proud of
32:34
it
32:35
so it's so sweet so um so it's in the
32:38
champaign region and there's one
32:39
winemaker who bragged about the fact
32:41
that he watered down his champagne
32:42
before giving it to the nazis
32:44
um and or he would bottle his worst
32:48
wine this is in the champagne region he
32:49
would bottle his worst wines
32:51
and say this is the special cuvee for
32:53
the vermax
32:55
and there was one guy who said that we
32:58
got orders from the nazis to deliver
33:00
them lots of wine and they made the
33:02
foolish mistake of not saying which
33:03
vintage wine they would
33:05
prefer and so we sent them a thousand
33:08
bottles of our 1939
33:10
which was absolute rubbish
33:15
and that that absolutely taught them
33:18
other facts about wishing people a merry
33:20
christmas okay so this was a
33:22
an experiment that happened in 1974
33:24
sociological
33:25
two sociologists uh called philip kunz
33:27
and michael wolcott
33:28
they posted nearly 600 christmas cards
33:31
to people they didn't know
33:33
they got the addresses out of the phone
33:34
book and they sent some high status
33:36
cards
33:36
which were very lavish and fancy and
33:39
somewhat low status which were just
33:41
plain white cards with merry christmas
33:43
written in a red sharpie on the front
33:46
and they were either signed from doctor
33:47
and mrs philip guns or from philip and
33:49
joyce [ __ ]
33:50
and they included a return address
33:52
saying where you can send them back to
33:53
so they were definitely for people they
33:55
hadn't met and
33:56
um over 20 of people sent a signed card
34:00
back
34:01
with varying degrees of detail some said
34:03
merry christmas some sent pictures of
34:05
their families to people they had never
34:06
met
34:07
some sent letters of several pages
34:09
saying what had been going on with them
34:11
for the last few years i know
34:15
um and but six people wrote back and
34:18
directly asked how do i know you
34:21
which is incredibly ballsy to me i
34:24
wouldn't have the courage to do that
34:25
when was that 74. you can't imagine it
34:28
would happen today could you
34:29
you think if you got a random christmas
34:32
card through the post guys would you
34:34
responsible well a few liars but most
34:38
people say that
34:39
um we uh my parents uh they keep getting
34:42
a card addressed to the cajun aries and
34:43
we've no idea who they are
34:45
but they arrive it arrives like
34:46
clockwork every year every year and
34:49
the family has grown it's added several
34:50
members in this time
34:52
and they they never include their return
34:54
address and they keep saying we'd love
34:56
to see you in the new year please
34:57
please get in touch
34:59
[Laughter]
35:01
so wendy john if you're listening
35:06
we need to wrap up guys anything before
35:07
we do um some stuff on wine or
35:10
whatever in 2015 scotland made its first
35:14
homegrown wine and it was described as
35:17
undrinkable by experts
35:23
the guy who produced it said it has
35:25
potential

[Music]
01:49
a in which we learn how brexit was
01:52
triggered in a space egg
01:54
whether computers or humans are better
01:56
at pac-man
01:58
why australia is air-dropping kangaroo
02:01
sausages
02:02
which king doubles as an airline pilot
02:05
and who's invented an underwater
02:08
warehouse
02:10
aardvarks a zookeeper performed mouth to
02:13
snout
02:13
on an aardvark for an hour only five
02:16
advanced were born in europe in 2016
02:19
so when one was born in the polish city
02:20
of rockland this year
02:22
and struggled to survive the head of the
02:24
small mammals division at the zoo there
02:26
andre miazka did all he could to keep
02:28
him alive
02:29
we spoke to ratclav zoo and asked how
02:31
you perform cpr on an aardvark
02:34
this is what they said mr miyazaki acted
02:37
on instinct
02:38
he cut the cord placed the baby on his
02:39
fleece jacket and started rubbing it
02:41
vigorously but gently with a towel
02:44
he then placed the baby snout in his
02:46
mouth and blew the air in
02:47
at the same time he was doing chest
02:49
compressions using his fingers
02:51
and continued rubbing with a towel after
02:53
a few rounds the little hearts started
02:55
beating
02:56
but the cub still wasn't breathing so mr
02:58
mioska went on with the mouth to snout
03:00
ventilation
03:02
altogether it took about one hour after
03:04
he came out
03:05
i am so glad you didn't do the accent
03:07
there
03:09
i thought we're gonna start on a big
03:10
polish accent i like the idea that to do
03:12
master snail and artwork you have to
03:14
hold
03:14
the end of the artwork snout and then
03:16
basically you can get both your hands
03:18
around the
03:18
rest of the other snout for people
03:20
listening andy is doing the mime
03:23
like playing a trumpet exactly yeah this
03:25
reminds me of a story actually that
03:27
happened quite a few years ago in china
03:28
there was a small monkey
03:30
that had eaten a peanut and it wasn't
03:32
allowed to eat the peanut because its
03:33
stomach couldn't digest it so someone
03:34
had thrown it into the cage and it laid
03:36
on its back
03:37
in the cage dying and it was such a rare
03:39
little monkey they couldn't actually
03:41
operate on it so no one knew what to do
03:42
all these zookeepers were going how we
03:44
going to save this monkey
03:45
and suddenly zhang bangshun who is the
03:48
veteran zookeeper at that zoo
03:49
stepped forward and said i know how to
03:51
save this monkey and he went up to the
03:53
monkey and he didn't perform
03:54
mouth the snails oh mouth-to-mouth even
03:56
on the monkey
03:57
he performed mouth to bum-bum he
04:01
sorry could you spare us his technical
04:04
mumbo jumbo
04:05
he looked he licked the monkey's butt
04:08
for
04:08
over an hour sort of drawing the peanut
04:11
through the system kind of like you know
04:13
if you drop a ball in a pool
04:14
and you have to do that little wavy
04:16
thing at the corner to bring the wave to
04:17
bring the ball back to you
04:18
he lit for an hour this peanut out of
04:21
the monkey and the monkey survived
04:23
there must have been a point about 45
04:25
minutes in where the other zookeepers
04:26
were saying
04:28
zhang chun what are you doing
04:31
i think i'd say it earlier than that i
04:34
think he would have looked at them and
04:35
give me 15 more minutes i also think
04:38
we've gone off topic really early
04:41
so meanwhile in south africa scientists
04:43
finally caught our bucks having a drink
04:45
250 years after the species was first
04:48
described
04:49
it'd long been assumed that they got all
04:50
the water they needed from the juicy
04:52
bodies of termites
04:53
but a zoologist at nelson mandela
04:55
metropolitan university in part
04:56
elizabeth
04:57
graham curley and his team announced
05:00
that evidence exists for aardvarks
05:02
drinking from puddles
05:03
so we've never known them to drink
05:05
before this is huge news
05:07
feels like we just haven't been watching
05:08
them hard enough i mean surely if
05:10
they're drinking from puddles now
05:11
they've always been doing it yeah it's
05:12
not like puddles are new are they
05:14
puddles have been around as long as as
05:16
long as water
05:19
this wasn't the only uh puddle news from
05:21
the year by the way
05:22
researchers in australia found that
05:24
koalas are now getting their water from
05:26
puddles they used to think it was just
05:28
from eucalyptus leaves and they've never
05:29
seen it before but they think because of
05:30
climate change
05:31
they're now drinking from puddles it's a
05:34
bad year if you're a puddle
05:35
suddenly there are two new massive
05:37
threats to your existence
05:39
james is there any advice for people who
05:41
want to drink like our books
05:42
there is if you can't find a puddle
05:44
there's a bar in exeter that's selling
05:46
an aardvark cocktail
05:47
served with real ants the drinks made
05:50
with rum lemongrass and lime and it's
05:52
served with an
05:52
ant chaser the bar owner patrick
05:55
foggerty describes it as crunchy
05:57
yet satisfying
06:00
abdications the japanese emperor wanted
06:04
to abdicate but wasn't allowed to tell
06:06
anyone japan's emperor akihito is banned
06:10
from making political statements
06:12
including any that suggests that he
06:13
wants to abdicate
06:15
as a result he had to make a speech very
06:17
delicately hinting at his concerns about
06:20
being able to fulfill his duties the
06:22
government eventually worked out what he
06:24
meant
06:24
and allowed him to step down i wonder if
06:27
they said to him so do you want to
06:28
abdicate and he said
06:29
well i didn't just say that pretty much
06:32
yeah
06:32
he had to be so subtle about it so
06:36
i'm feeling pretty old guys
06:39
and then eventually they sort of figured
06:40
it out um but there is still a problem
06:42
for him which is that he has a distinct
06:44
lack of heirs
06:45
once the new emperor takes over there
06:46
will only be three heirs
06:48
in total because emperors have to be men
06:50
although there is now some debate about
06:52
this
06:53
some experts are worried that if the
06:55
youngest heir prince hisahito
06:57
has no sons the 2600 year old imperial
07:00
line will be broken
07:02
although his sahih is only 11 so it is a
07:04
little early to tell how this will
07:06
and it's a lot of pressure on him isn't
07:07
it huge amount of pressure
07:09
that must be the smallest royal family
07:11
in the world is it well actually i think
07:13
that the
07:14
vatican is technically a one-man elected
07:16
monarchy
07:17
and that is a royal family of one but i
07:19
know you disagree james i do disagree
07:20
yeah
07:22
what about saudi arabia they have a lot
07:24
don't they i think that's the largest
07:25
royal family in the world they've got 4
07:26
000
07:27
princes whoa i know so just back to
07:29
akihito
07:30
as a young man he had a list of 800
07:33
candidates for marriage
07:34
prepared for him wow and he rejected
07:36
every single one of them in favor of
07:38
someone he met playing tennis
07:40
and he's quite an interesting guy his
07:41
main interest is marine biology
07:43
and he is an expert on the gobi fish and
07:46
when the gobi equivalent of an emperor
07:49
the dominant male
07:50
dies he is replaced by the next in line
07:52
but if there are no males
07:54
then a female will change its sex and
07:56
take the emperor's place
07:58
[Music]
08:01
abkhazia a country that most of the
08:04
world doesn't think exists
08:05
had an election that assumed most of its
08:07
population didn't exist
08:10
abkhazia is a self-declared republic
08:12
that's trying to break from georgia
08:14
and is currently recognized only by
08:15
russia nicaragua venezuela
08:17
and bizarrely the tiny pacific island of
08:20
naoru
08:21
still despite the lack of more general
08:23
recognition parliamentary elections were
08:25
held there this
08:26
year and technically elections in
08:27
abkhazia are deemed invalid if less than
08:30
25 percent of people vote
08:32
but although only 21 of the population
08:34
voted on this occasion
08:36
the election was still declared valid as
08:37
it was decided that any citizens who
08:39
hold georgian passports
08:40
should not be regarded as abkhazian
08:42
nationals the country was also the
08:44
subject of a critically acclaimed
08:45
romanian documentary this year
08:47
called uwale louis tarzan or tarzan's
08:51
testicles
08:53
so this was the story of the world's
08:54
oldest primate center the institute of
08:56
experimental pathology and therapy
08:58
in the abkhazian capital of tsukumi the
09:01
institute provided the monkeys that the
09:02
soviet union sent into space in the
09:04
1980s and it was founded by a man called
09:06
ilya ivanov whose lifetime obsession was
09:09
creating an ape-human hybrid
09:12
advertising the advertising for the
09:15
newly opened trump international hotel
09:17
and tower in vancouver
09:19
claims it is six floors taller than it
09:21
actually is
09:23
trump hotels claim that the building is
09:25
69 stories high when actually
09:27
it is only 63. they arrived at their
09:30
total by including below ground stories
09:32
which are mostly used for parking in
09:33
their calculations
09:35
in the course of his career trump has
09:37
claimed that a 67-story tower
09:39
has 78 floors that a 43-storey building
09:43
has 46 floors that a 44-storey building
09:46
has 52 floors that a 31 story building
09:50
has 41 floors that a 70-story building
09:53
has
09:53
90 floors and that he lives on the 66th
09:56
floor
09:56
of a 58-storey building he needs to get
09:58
his story straight
09:59
[Laughter]
10:02
meanwhile the trump international hotel
10:04
and tower in toronto paid a reported six
10:06
million dollars
10:07
not to advertise itself as a trump hotel
10:10
the hotel decided to part ways with the
10:12
trump name
10:13
following many years of construction
10:14
delays lawsuits
10:16
and more recently because it become a
10:17
gathering point for protests against the
10:19
president
10:20
the agreement they reached allows the
10:22
management to remove all of trump's
10:23
branding from the 65-storey building
10:26
which incidentally has only 57 floors
10:30
ai the world champion of the ancient
10:34
chinese game of go was beaten by a
10:36
three-year-old brit
10:37
who then immediately retired intriguing
10:41
what could that mean considering i said
10:44
it was about ai
10:46
one way or another it's been a pretty
10:47
bad year for humankind we've been
10:49
defeated by artificial intelligence at
10:51
no limit texas holden poker
10:53
and the fighting game super smash bros
10:56
but perhaps the most crushing defeat
10:57
came when alphago
10:58
an ai program developed by google's
11:01
deepmind technologies
11:02
beat the world champion china's kerji
11:05
three nil
11:06
alphago was born in 2014 and was classed
11:09
as british in the go rankings
11:10
as the team behind it is based in london
11:13
after beating the world champion it
11:15
immediately retired
11:16
deep mine ceo demis hasabis said that
11:19
winning these games had been the highest
11:21
possible pinnacle for alphago as a
11:23
competitive program
11:24
owing to its incredible complexity go
11:27
had been one of the final games at which
11:28
humans could still beat the machines
11:31
kg later said last year it was still
11:33
quite human-like
11:34
but this year it became like a god of go
11:37
james i've never played go yeah can you
11:40
quickly give me a
11:41
idea of what we're talking about here
11:42
yeah sure so um you have a board with
11:44
lots of squares on it
11:45
and you put pebbles on it to win
11:47
territory and it's extremely complicated
11:49
there are 10 to the power of 10 to the
11:51
power of 171 possible combinations of
11:54
move
11:55
which is pretty hard to imagine right
11:57
can you put that in some kind of
11:58
metaphorical context for me
12:00
yes i can oh how convenient if every
12:03
grain of sand on earth
12:04
each contain the number of stars in the
12:06
milky way and each of those stars had
12:08
100 planets
12:09
and each of those planets had 10 billion
12:11
humans then the number of
12:13
cells in all those humans would be fewer
12:15
than the number of zeros in the number
12:17
that we're talking about wow oh you know
12:20
that famous story there's a chess board
12:21
and each
12:22
has a grain of rice and it doubles and
12:24
doubles and suddenly he's got all the
12:25
rice and country
12:26
do you think in this scenario he'd be
12:27
like i've gone way too far
12:30
this is a lot of rice yeah um but that
12:33
interview with kg
12:34
actually chinese fans didn't see the
12:35
interview because china
12:37
presumably for reasons of national pride
12:39
wouldn't allow the match to be shown on
12:41
television or streamed online
12:44
airdrops australia is dropping sausages
12:48
over its outback
12:49
they come in two flavors toad and
12:51
kangaroo i will take
12:52

afraid
12:56
um so for years australia has had this
12:58
problem with cane toads
12:59
which aren't indigenous to the continent
13:01
and so many of its native animals eat
13:03
them
13:04
and because the toads are toxic they
13:05
tend to kill their predators
13:07
so to combat this scientists are
13:09
dropping cane-toed flavoured sausages
13:11
laced with a chemical that makes
13:12
predators feel sick over the outback and
13:15
hope that it'll deter them from biting
13:16
the real toads in future
13:19
a bit more brutally the aussie
13:20
government is also dropping poisoned
13:22
sausages to deal with their feral cats
13:24
who are also partial to a bit of
13:25
kangaroo wiener
13:27
still fancy that kangaroo wiener andy
13:29
now you know it's poisonous
13:33
this year canada also combated an
13:35
environmental issue with air drops this
13:37
time of pregnant bison
13:39
banff national park has not had any
13:41
bison for more than a hundred years
13:42
and the ecosystem suffers from their
13:44
absence conservationists collected
13:46
pregnant bison from the nearby elk
13:48
island
13:49
and took them to the pastures of the
13:50
rocky mountains they spent the last 25
13:53
kilometers of their journey packed into
13:54
shipping containers
13:55
dangling underneath a helicopter by a
13:57
rope their horns were covered in plastic
13:59
hoses to stop them injuring each other
14:01
in transit
14:03
aliens 11 promising
14:07
alien signals were reported this year
14:09
unfortunately they all turned out to be
14:11
from mobile phones on earth
14:12
[Laughter]
14:14
this is the green bank telescope in west
14:17
virginia
14:18
which listens for radio signals that
14:19
might indicate signs of intelligence
14:21
from 692
14:23
of the nearest stars to earth it turns
14:26
out however
14:26
that the signals that aliens might send
14:28
are very similar to those given out by
14:30
mobile phones
14:31
this wasn't the only alien mystery that
14:33
may have been solved this year
14:34
the wow signal was named in 1977 when
14:38
an anomaly was found in the list of data
14:40
and astronomer
14:41
jerry r ehrman was so impressed that he
14:44
circled numbers on his computer printout
14:46
and wrote the comment
14:47
wow antonio paris an astronomy professor
14:50
at st
14:50
petersburg college in florida has now
14:53
suggested that the signal didn't come
14:54
from an alien life form
14:56
but from a couple of comets that were
14:57
passing by at the time
14:59
not everyone is convinced though alan
15:01
fitzsimmons a scientist at queen's
15:03
university belfast has described the
15:05
theory
15:05
as rubbish there were a lot of names in
15:08
that paragraph james
15:10
antonia paris alan fitzsimmons can i
15:12
throw another name into the mix sure
15:14
former front man of blink182 tom de long
15:17
okay he was named ufo researcher of the
15:20
year this year
15:20
at the 2017 international ufo congress
15:24
and he got this because it turns out
15:25
he's secretly been emailing
15:28
high-level security people in america to
15:30
talk to them about
15:31
the alien threats well last year
15:35
when the podesta emails were leaked he
15:37
was the campaign manager of hillary
15:38
clinton that was part of the big
15:40
wikileaks that was happening that
15:41
ruined her campaign largely amongst
15:44
those emails were emails from tom delong
15:46
blink 182's former lead singer and he
15:48
was saying i want to talk to you
15:49
about all the stuff that i believe is
15:52
going on and that you have knowledge of
15:53
on the inside about alien life and our
15:55
contact with them
15:56
and as a result of all his digging and
15:58
all of his expertise
15:59
he is officially the ufo researcher of
16:01
the year 2017.
16:02
and the rest of us missed the big story
16:04
about hillary's email leaks it turns out
16:07
what are the awards like are they a sort
16:08
of golden probe that you win
16:11
awards thank you can i i always thought
16:14
was blink 182 but you said blink
16:16
182. i've always said blink 182. does
16:18
anyone say blink 18 too
16:22
so the hunt for et moved up a gear this
16:25
year after the 500 meter
16:27
aperture spherical telescope also known
16:29
as fast
16:30
the world's largest joined the search
16:33
fast is so vast
16:34
that you could fill its dish with enough
16:36
corn flakes to supply every person on
16:38
earth with one bowls worth
16:40
every day for a year and still have some
16:42
left over
16:43
it's cited in guiju province south west
16:46
china
16:47
and it hasn't proved universally popular
16:49
its construction
16:50
involved the forcible displacement of
16:52
nine thousand villagers
16:55
amazon the founder of amazon.com became
16:59
the world's richest person
17:01
for just four hours a surge in amazon
17:04
stock on the 27th of july increased jeff
17:06
bezos's net worth by
17:07
1.1 billion dollars which meant that he
17:10
overtook microsoft's bill gates
17:12
who's worth a measly 90.7 billion
17:14
however
17:15
by the middle of the next day bezos
17:17
stock had fallen back
17:18
and a few days later he was down to
17:20
third place behind
17:22
amancio ortega the owner of the fashion
17:24
company
17:25
zara amazon's stock performance was
17:28
largely thanks to increased sales
17:30
in the early days of the company a bell
17:32
would ring every time there was a sale
17:33
and staff would gather around to see if
17:35
they knew the person who had made the
17:37
purchase
17:37
they don't do that anymore if they did
17:39
then on their biggest sales day in 2017
17:42
amazon prime day 11th of july a bell
17:45
would need to be rung
17:46
more than 80 million times sorry would
17:49
you mind putting that in some kind of
17:51
context again for me okay i'll just
17:53
rustle up something
17:54
on the spot that is the equivalent of
17:58
every church bell in england being wrong
18:00
2 400 times hang on how many church
18:02
bells are there in england
18:04
well you can work that out if you divide
18:05
80 million by 2
18:07
400. i'm not sure i can james
18:10
we'll leave that as an exercise for the
18:11
reader
18:13
each second is very important to amazon
18:15
they've calculated that if their page is
18:17
loaded just one second slower it would
18:19
cost them 1.6 billion dollars in annual
18:22
sales
18:23
amazon expanded beyond the online sector
18:25
this year opening a physical bookshop in
18:27
new york
18:28
the company recognizes that people have
18:30
a habit of browsing in shops before
18:31
buying their books online
18:33
and so registered a patent to stop
18:35
customers in amazon shops
18:37
from checking out competitors as they
18:39
look around it's not the only patent
18:40
application that amazon has filed in the
18:42
past few months
18:43
they've also invented an underwater
18:45
warehouse in which everything is stored
18:47
in watertight boxes at the bottom of the
18:49
lake
18:50
each is assigned a unique sound which
18:52
when triggered inflates a balloon
18:54
that floats the box to the surface the
18:56
idea is that this will be more efficient
18:58
than having people or machines fetch the
19:00
packages
19:01
because they'll be transported by the
19:02
water buoyancy instead
19:04
amazon also holds a patent for a flying
19:06
warehouse
19:08
antarctica the foreign office warned
19:12
britain's to look out for terrorists
19:13
in the antarctic the population of
19:16
britain's 660
19:18
000 square miles of antarctic territory
19:20
may be only 250
19:22
but as the foreign office points out you
19:24
can never be too careful
19:26
according to official guidelines it
19:28
issued in may although there's no recent
19:30
history of terrorism in the british
19:32
antarctic territory
19:33
attacks can't be ruled out visitors
19:36
should therefore
19:36
be vigilant but they will probably be
19:38
fine the last crime to be committed
19:40
anywhere on the continent was back in
19:42
2003
19:43
and involved computer hacking and even
19:45
that wasn't homegrown it was done
19:47
remotely from romania
19:49
one briton who braved the terrorist
19:50
threat was patrick bergel
19:52
great grandson of ernest shackleton who
19:54
made the first ever crossing of
19:56
antarctica by car
19:58
it was a month-long 3600 mile
20:01
trip sponsored by hyundai in a normal
20:04
family car
20:05
although it was adapted to run on jet
20:07
fuel
20:09
i'd argue that isn't a normal family car
20:11
then on an almost normal family car
20:13
i'd say and to avoid littering the team
20:16
had to drag
20:16
all the excrement behind them in a huge
20:19
fuel drum
20:19
again not the same as my family car
20:23
so when he was first asked to make the
20:24
journey burgle hadn't even taken his
20:26
driving test
20:27
he modestly insisted that compared to
20:30
what my great-grandfather did
20:31
this was one thousandth as hard i would
20:34
say that's
20:35
less modest and more just accurate
20:38
i think his great grandfather would
20:40
agree that his job was harder
20:42
so as if going on four wheels wasn't
20:44
hard enough canadian
20:45
hank van wielden attempted a 700 mile
20:48
bike ride
20:49
on a custom-made 10 000 pound bicycle
20:52
across antarctica
20:54
he was meant to complete the journey in
20:56
30 days but after six days of pulling a
20:58
90 kilo pack
21:00
in minus 40 degrees celsius temperatures
21:02
he dropped out
21:03
he later said i got a taste of it and i
21:06
got my ass kicked by it
21:09
apps if you want to make an emergency
21:12
confession
21:13
there's an app for that a new app
21:15
developed in spain and called
21:17
confessor go tells you where your
21:19
nearest priest is for confession
21:21
and maps the best route to him handily
21:24
it also tells you the priest's name
21:26
and the year he was ordained in addition
21:28
it includes the ten commandments to
21:30
prompt you to recall what you might need
21:32
to confess
21:33
so if you've coveted your neighbors ox
21:35
or anything
21:37
unlike uber the priest doesn't come to
21:39
you but on the plus side he doesn't
21:40
charge extra at busy times
21:42
what is a busy time for sins oh
21:45
good question christmas i imagine do you
21:47
think so yeah you're always coveting
21:49
people's oxen
21:50
i think you've got time on your hands
21:52
right also a priest available 24 hours
21:55
for confession i don't think so yeah i
21:56
assumed that there was a sort of
21:58
time that they get in that photo box you
22:00
know it's like the
22:02
confession booth the confession
22:06
they should combine that with passport
22:07
photos
22:09
so you look really happy once you've got
22:10
everything off your chest you have a
22:11
nice big smile
22:13
so there have been other apps built
22:15
recently for various different
22:17
things so there have been apps built
22:18
that will help you if you want to
22:21
find a celebrity lookalike partner the
22:23
dating app badou
22:24
has added a feature that allows users to
22:26
look for celebrity lookalikes
22:28
soon after launch there were 1405 people
22:31
on the app who supposedly looked like ed
22:33
sheeran
22:34
according to them according to the app i
22:37
think there are other apps which can
22:38
help you find where the nearest iceberg
22:40
is providing you're in canada
22:43
and there's one app that can stop you
22:45
from buying things while drunk
22:46
so once you've consumed alcohol up to a
22:49
self-imposed limit
22:50
the app stops your bank card from
22:51
working unfortunately for the app to
22:54
take effect you need to be sober enough
22:56
to tell it that you've been drinking if
22:58
you're talking
22:59
to a machine you're drunk i think not if
23:02
the machine can respond to you
23:04
i mean sure if i'm talking to my washing
23:06
machine
23:08
like if i'm talking to siri i think
23:09
that's okay while we're on smartphones
23:12
donald trump has only downloaded one app
23:14
on his phone
23:15
it's twitter but he has inspired 250
23:19
apps and more
23:20
for android alone including one that
23:23
measures how many times a man
23:24
interrupts a woman one where you can
23:26
draw your own executive order
23:28
and a third one dj trump which uses a
23:31
huge archive of words that donald has
23:33
said
23:33
to enable you to make the u.s president
23:35
say anything you want
23:38
arrests human a mafia boss famous for
23:42
having a permanent erection
23:43
was caught in spain after seven years on
23:46
the run francesco
23:47
castriotta said his priapism was thanks
23:50
to his out of control cocaine habit
23:53
as he sat in court during a previous
23:55
hearing with a bag of ice on his aching
23:56
groin
23:57
one policeman remarked that he could
23:59
expect a stiff
24:00
sentence sorry his name is castriata i
24:03
know
24:04
didn't notice that until i read it just
24:05
now no me neither it's very exciting
24:07
isn't it it's like his name is begging
24:08
out for his penis to be removed
24:13
other notable arrests include a man in
24:15
india who was arrested for trying to
24:17
create a fake id card
24:19
using the name osama bin laden he even
24:22
uploaded a blurred photo of the former
24:24
al-qaeda leader
24:25
as the profile picture police discovered
24:27
the man's real name
24:29
was saddam hussein a woman in bangladesh
24:32
who believed that she was her husband's
24:34
third wife
24:34
had him arrested after discovering she
24:36
was in fact his 25th
24:38
of 28. police arrested him at the home
24:41
of his 27th
24:42
wife and lastly a man was arrested by
24:45
new york state police for driving under
24:47
the influence of alcohol
24:49
this only came to international
24:50
attention because joseph talbot
24:52
didn't want anyone to know about it
24:54
after learning that his local paper the
24:56
times of wayne county
24:57
had covered the story he tried to buy
24:59
every copy of the relevant edition to
25:01
stop people finding out
25:03
unfortunately the fact that he managed
25:04
to purchase around 900 copies became a
25:07
story in its own right
25:08
and then spread art
25:12
a giant snow globe was made using the
25:14
confetti
25:15
meant for hillary clinton's election
25:16
night
25:18
this was designed by an artist called
25:20
bunny burson whose former works include
25:22
collages made from
25:23
chads which are the punched out pieces
25:25
of ballot paper that famously decided
25:27
the year 2000
25:28
presidential election in favour of
25:29
george w bush
25:31
it took person two weeks to find the
25:33
confetti that had been loaded into
25:34
hillary's victory cannons ready to
25:36
celebrate the election result last
25:38
november
25:38
and when she did she got the company who
25:40
produced it to write a letter of
25:42
verification
25:43
she then placed the confetti in a glass
25:45
case with the slogan
25:46
and still i rise which she took from a
25:48
poem by maya angelou who was a close
25:50
friend of the clintons
25:52
in a less overtly political act a french
25:54
artist called abraham
25:56
poishaval attempted to live like a
25:58
chicken
25:59
and successfully hatched nine eggs
26:02
he sat on the eggs in a glass case in a
26:04
paris museum for a month
26:06
they were underneath his bottom on a
26:07
laying table which had a dugout section
26:09
in it to stop the eggs from being
26:11
squashed
26:12
porn chaval said that his work egg
26:14
raises the question of metamorphosis and
26:17
gender
26:18
despite animal scientists saying that
26:19
the task was nearly impossible due to
26:21
humans lower body temperature
26:23
after 21 days nine of his original 10
26:26
eggs had indeed hatched
26:27
the chicks were sent to a farm he is an
26:29
amazing guy one chevelle
26:31
yeah so in february this year he spent a
26:33
week in another museum
26:35
inside a 12-ton limestone boulder it had
26:38
a hollowed-out section which was only
26:40
slightly bigger than he was
26:41
and he was sealed within it wow yeah and
26:44
he had little niches where he stored his
26:46
food and drink and also
26:47
his excrement do you think that maybe
26:51
he has been kicked out of his flat and
26:53
he's just looking for
26:54
museum television he did live inside a
26:57
stuffed bear for a while too
26:59
so actually there is a lot behind that
27:01
theory i think yeah
27:02
another artist that hit the news this
27:04
year was a russian artist called
27:06
feodor pavlov andrejevich who in america
27:08
faced potential charges of public
27:10
lewdness
27:11
criminal trespassing and disorderly
27:13
conduct after he was arrested for having
27:15
himself delivered
27:16
naked inside a clear plastic box to the
27:19
exclusive
27:20
met gala in new york this is the fifth
27:22
time he'd had himself sent to an art
27:24
event
27:24
his aim being to donate himself to
27:26
institutions that have
27:28
difficulty understanding or accepting
27:30
performance art
27:31
in a statement his friends clarified
27:33
that the box had also been arrested
27:35
in their view the charges were ludicrous
27:37
they said even the policemen were
27:39
showing signs of having fun
27:42
ashes carrie fisher's ashes were placed
27:45
in an urn shaped like a massive prozac
27:48
pill
27:49
the giant pill was one of her favorite
27:50
ornaments at her funeral in january her
27:53
brother said of it
27:54
we felt it was where she'd want to be
27:56
this year people have also chosen to
27:58
have their ashes sprinkled
27:59
in the toilet of a baseball stadium the
28:02
ashes of new york plumber and baseball
28:04
fan roy regal
28:05
have been sprinkled in baseball stadium
28:07
toilets all over america by his best
28:09
friend
28:10
roy mcdonald mcdonald said he has
28:12
sometimes used the toilet at the same
28:14
time as scattering his friend but that
28:16
i always flush in between ashes have
28:19
also been sprinkled
28:20
over a ferry a ceremony on an australian
28:23
ferry went wrong when the ashes were
28:24
blown back on deck and over the
28:26
passengers
28:27
the daughter of the deceased said it was
28:29
her mother having the last laugh
28:31
it could be worse in late 2016 a man
28:33
tried to scat his opera loving friends
28:35
ashes at new york city's metropolitan
28:37
opera
28:38
other members of the audience however
28:39
assumed he was a terrorist
28:41
who was trying to spread anthrax he
28:43
apologized
28:44
saying it was a sweet gesture to a dying
28:46
friend that went completely and utterly
28:48
wrong in ways that i could never have
28:50
imagined
28:50
[Laughter]
28:53
anyway they've also been sprinkled in a
28:54
hockey penalty box
28:56
hockey player bob probert had his ashes
28:58
sprinkled in his team's penalty box
29:00
or the sin bin because he had been
29:03
involved in 200
29:04
mid-match fights in the course of his
29:05
career and had therefore spent 3300
29:08
minutes there
29:10
and finally they've also been sprinkled
29:12
in separate places
29:13
a survey of britain's funeral directors
29:16
revealed that they're now agreeing ever
29:18
more frequently
29:18
to split ashes up to stop angry families
29:21
arguing over them
29:23
article 50. the letter that we ended up
29:27
sending to activate article 50 was six
29:29
pages long but it was nearly
29:31
100 pages long that's a big edit
29:34
well they didn't start with 100 pages
29:35
and then just whittle it down to six
29:37
the government sources said there were
29:39
two options but they eventually picked
29:41
the six pager i think they may have
29:42
thought that sending 100 would have been
29:44
excessive yeah and so who wrote it was
29:46
it theresa may
29:47
well she definitely had some civil
29:49
service assistance but she did
29:51
definitely sign it
29:52
she gave it a wet signature i.e with pen
29:54
and ink but unfortunately she signed it
29:56
with a parker pen
29:57
that was once manufactured in britain
29:59
but is now made in france
30:01
oh really that's weird because also
30:03
article 50 was ratified in norman french
30:06
so as a law passes in the house of lords
30:08
the lords have to say the words
30:10
lorraine levolt which is old norman
30:13
french for the queen
30:14
allows it another thing about the letter
30:16
is that it was delivered by sir tim
30:18
barrow the uk's permanent representative
30:20
at the eu and he took it from britain's
30:23
embassy in brussels to the eu
30:24
headquarters which is known as the space
30:27
egg
30:27
space egg well that is just a nickname
30:30
it's a futuristic oval building
30:32
set inside a cube made from recycled
30:35
window frames from across europe
30:37
but the location is pretty interesting
30:39
the back of the building was the nazi
30:40
headquarters during their occupation of
30:42
europe
30:43
ah speaking of nazis i read that article
30:46
50 was put in place
30:48
partly because of right-wing politics
30:50
the guy who wrote it did so at a time
30:52
when austria had this far-right
30:53
politician called york haider
30:55
and people were really worried that he
30:56
might be elected so article 50 was
30:58
basically written partly to make it
31:00
easier for a country to storm out of the
31:01
eu
31:02
yeah that's right and the guy who
31:04
actually wrote article 50 is called lord
31:06
john care and what i love about that is
31:08
that in spain his name would be juan
31:10
care
31:12
but they wouldn't understand that in
31:14
spain because they'll speak spanish
31:16
oh yeah apart from the british people
31:17
who live in spain and they're not going
31:18
to be there for long
31:19
because of brexit so in a few years no
31:21
one will get that joke anymore
31:23
so it's not just expats we also need to
31:25
work out what to do with the words
31:26
united kingdom
31:28
in the lisbon treaty so the lisbon
31:29
treaty is the document that underpins
31:31
the whole of the eu basically
31:33
and there are 12 mentions of the uk in
31:35
it and at the moment they think they're
31:36
just going to leave them in because it's
31:38
going to be too much bureaucratic hassle
31:39
to actually go through removing every
31:41
mention
31:42
is it true that article 50 was given a
31:43
lot of fake roots
31:45
on its way to the space egg so that when
31:47
sir tim was delivering it
31:48
it would confuse potential saboteurs
31:50
it's possible
31:51
it did definitely have an armed god when
31:53
it was on the eurostar on his way over
31:55
and the daily telegraph reported that
31:57
his path to the space egg was kept
31:59
secret
32:00
in case ultra remainers grabbed the
32:02
letter from him
32:03
wow i mean i wouldn't call myself an
32:05
ultra remainer but i did go on google
32:07
maps
32:08
and i did the journey from one place to
32:10
the other and it is extremely short
32:12
so i don't think there's much space for
32:14
alternate routes no it was about 300
32:15
meters
32:16
yeah or 328 yards as we're gonna have to
32:18
call it after 2019
32:21
aviation the king of the netherlands
32:24
revealed he's been secretly moonlighting
32:26
as an airline pilot since ascending the
32:28
throne in 2013
32:30
king villain alexander has been
32:32
co-piloting commercial flights twice a
32:34
month without telling passengers
32:36
he only ever pilots short haul flights
32:38
though and makes sure to always return
32:40
home on the same day
32:41
just in case he suddenly needed his king
32:44
meanwhile in afghanistan
32:45
two mps went one better and took control
32:47
of a plane they weren't even on
32:50
after learning the mps had missed their
32:51
flight from kabul to bamiyan
32:53
supporters of the pair apparently
32:55
organized a team to stop the plane from
32:57
landing at bamian airport by blocking
32:59
the runway
33:00
it was therefore forced to fly back to
33:02
kabul where it picked up the two
33:03
politicians
33:04
according to al-jazeera one of them
33:06
abdul rahman
33:08
shahidani said everyone will now know
33:10
who i am and what my power is
33:12
shahidani added that he hadn't asked his
33:15
supporters to force the plane to return
33:16
to kabul
33:17
another mp embroiled in an aviation
33:19
scandal was indian politician
33:21
ravindra gaikwad who admitted to hitting
33:24
an air steward
33:25
25 times with his slipper and breaking
33:27
the steward's glasses
33:29
his excuse was that he had been given an
33:31
economy seat rather than business
33:33
air india explained that mr gaikwad had
33:36
been placed an economy rather
33:38
than business because there was no
33:39
business class on this particular
33:41
all-economy flight
33:45
avocados the world's first avocado
33:48
restaurant
33:49
where every dish contains avocado opened
33:51
in new york
33:52
it ran out of avocados on its first day
33:55
once all the kinks rained out the
33:57
restaurant became very popular
33:59
they went through 650 pounds of avocado
34:01
a week
34:02
helped no doubt by the fact that diners
34:04
who particularly like avocados
34:06
can double the amount of avocado on
34:08
their dish for an extra two dollars
34:11
so avocados reached peak hipster this
34:13
year millennials were told the only
34:15
reason they can't afford houses
34:17
is that they keep spending their money
34:19
on avocado on toast
34:21
avocados are dangerous too they were
34:23
blamed for a rash of brunch time hand
34:25
injuries to people ineptly trying to cut
34:27
them up
34:28
the british association of plastic
34:30
reconstructive and aesthetic surgeons
34:32
demanded that warnings should be placed
34:34
on all avocados
34:36
to go back to the avocado restaurant you
34:38
know where you can double the amount of
34:39
avocado on your plate for extra two
34:40
dollars presumably you can only do that
34:42
once
34:42
because like with the rice on the chess
34:44
board if you do that eight times
34:47
that's already more avocados than mexico
34:49
produces in a year
34:52
so m s are going to be lasering barcodes
34:55
into their avocados because at the
34:57
moment they obviously have those little
34:58
stickers on them with the barcodes
35:00
and by replacing those with lasers
35:01
they're gonna save 10 tons of paper
35:03
and five tons of glue every year and
35:06
they did some early trials although they
35:07
lasered them too deep and i think cut
35:09
through the actual avocado
35:10
so did they call them other barcodes
35:13
yeah they've also said that they're
35:14
thinking about lasering pumpkins for
35:16
halloween
35:17
but there was no pun involved so they've
35:20
given it up
35:21
so demand for avocados has increased but
35:24
supply has fallen this year
35:25
and that's because avocados are an
35:27
alternate bearing crop
35:29
which means that every other year the
35:30
harvest is smaller
35:32
if you add that to the flooding in peru
35:34
and the workers strikes in mexico
35:36
you have what america's national public
35:38
radio has dubbed
35:39
the guac apocalypse
35:41
[Laughter]
35:42
and with president trump planning large
35:45
tariffs on goods coming from mexico to
35:47
pay for his wall
35:48
it may be that avocado lovers will soon
35:50
be waiting even longer to get on the
35:52
housing ladder
35:58

while statisticians were advising
36:39
against putting glitter in envelopes
36:41
doctors were sorry i just remembered
36:43
this bit
36:45
while statisticians were advising
36:47
against putting glitter in envelopes
36:49
doctors were advising against putting it
36:51
in vaginas
36:52
after a product called passion dust
36:54
appeared online
36:56
it's a glitter filled capsule designed
36:58
to be inserted into the vagina
37:00
where it gradually yeah
37:03
i'm so enjoying this you do the crime
37:06
you do the time you would be willing to
37:08
read out
37:11
oh my god
37:15
oh think about awful things right
37:18
we all are rather than fabulous things
37:25
it's a glitter-filled capsule designed
37:27
to be inserted into the vagina
37:29
where it gradually dissolves and spills
37:31
its contents
37:33
according to the website this generates
37:37
according to the website this generates
37:39
a sweet flavor
37:47
i'm really sorry according to the
37:50
website this generates a sweet flavored
37:53
sparkly substance
37:54
called magicum that will liven up the
37:56
user's sex
37:57
life is that a latter word
38:02
i think it comes up in the end multiple
38:05
gynecologists strongly advised against
38:07
using the product
38:08
saying it could lead to bacterial infect
38:10
lead to bacterial infections

=197.66 Wasted Material 2017
00:00
hi everybody happy in the middle bit
00:01
between christmas and new year
00:04
oh very nice thank you very much i'm
00:06
trying to get a range of greeting cards
00:07
out
00:08
it's going phrase no one wants to buy
00:09
greetings cards after christmas very
00:11
weird yeah
00:12
dan and andy here uh we just want to
00:14
quickly let you know what you're about
00:15
to listen to
00:16
uh this is a compilation of all the
00:19
outtakes
00:19
from the whole of 2017 every podcast
00:23
we always chop away a lot of stuff and
00:24
james has been secretly collecting it
00:27
to put together for this big bumper
00:29
edition 78 minute long
00:31
78 minutes seven eight minutes of
00:33
outtake i could watch a short children's
00:35
film or a very very long episode of
00:37
frasier in that time
00:38
frasier made 78 minute long episodes i
00:40
don't believe so
00:41
but uh it was the only thing i could
00:42
think of that's shorter than 78 minutes
00:44
[Laughter]
00:46
so what we're saying is please do enjoy
00:48
it unless there's a weird frasier
00:49
marathon on in which case we give you a
00:51
license to go and watch that instead
00:52
yeah we hope you enjoy this
00:54
have a wonderful new year when it comes
00:56
i will see you then
00:57
all right on with the outtakes i have to
00:59
watch frasier
01:12
[Music]
01:15
so you guys know that anteaters who have
01:17
obviously
01:18
famously long tongues have got very very
01:20
few taste buds
01:22
really yeah what does one taste about
01:23
every meat they can hardly taste what
01:25
they're eating well they're eating
01:27
shitty ants and you know termites and
01:30
they occasionally swallow dirt as well
01:31
is the other thing
01:33
so it may be an advantage you don't need
01:35
to be because all ants are going to
01:36
taste the same right
01:38
they're going to taste vinegar oh yeah
01:39
they are because they're full of
01:40
pharmaceuticals
01:42
disagree 100 disagree because there are
01:45
some of those ants
01:46
and they do remember they swallow honey
01:50
and they hang upside down and they're
01:52
sort of honey repositories imagine how
01:54
much you must think you've lucked out
01:55
when you get the odd honey tasting out
01:58
such a relief um they have well
02:00
pangolins which look quite similar
02:01
have their tongues attached to their
02:03
pelvis um i don't know if andy's
02:05
doing the same thing because they have
02:07
such long tongues um
02:09
and they start with their pelvis so i
02:10
think their tongues are so they're
02:12
attached at the back
02:13
[Laughter]
02:17
on the inside of them yeah like their
02:18
tongue comes out and then sweeps around
02:20
that's what i was thinking
02:21
yeah hang on yeah it can't be all tongue
02:24
all the way back
02:25
it's to all tongues all the way back
02:26
into a pangolin their tongues are longer
02:28
than their bodies are
02:29
what's the what's the point of that um
02:32
so you can i guess maneuver it all the
02:34
way down the tongue and once it's back
02:35
at the pelvis
02:36
the food's practically there the barely
02:38
need a digestive system
02:39
i don't know they're just the truth
02:42
that's amazing
02:43
isn't it true that um i think
02:44
woodpeckers have them all the way
02:46
through back into the skull and they
02:48
wind around their skull i've seen like a
02:50
x-ray of them right yeah yeah and that
02:52
helps cushion their skull when they're
02:54
pecking doesn't it
02:54
as well as being a useful place to store
02:56
their tongue do you know what the
02:57
longest tongue is
02:58
and this is relation to body size it
03:00
must be this pangolin
03:01
i think i no go on go for it no
03:05
have a banner it's a bat uh yes it is
03:07
yeah oh nice the tube
03:09
lipped nectar bat and its tongue
03:12
can go to 1.5 times the length of its
03:15
actual body
03:16
wow so that's the longest tongue in
03:18
proportion to bodysuit exactly in a
03:19
mammal i know that
03:20
it's a lame for that fat oh do you yeah
03:22
anorexia later
03:24
how on earth did you remember that it's
03:27
weird that
03:28
with them having such a massive tongue
03:30
and the tongue being
03:31
1.5 times bigger than the whole thing
03:33
that they chose to name it after the lip
03:36
yes yeah that's true but maybe they
03:38
didn't see the tongue for a long time
03:39
maybe they're like wow look at that lip
03:40
almost no one had ever seen the tongue
03:42
because
03:43
it's always in the um these massively
03:45
long flower um
03:46
no what am i saying no this is the
03:48
flower nose the flower nose trumpet
03:50
yeah so did they think that the bat's
03:52
face was a flower
03:54
that's got the head of a flower it's
03:56
really weird do you know
03:57
when an elephant's charging you when you
03:59
should be nervous
04:01
it's running towards you very fast is it
04:03
only about 30 centimeters before it hits
04:05
you
04:06
you panic uh it's not that if an
04:09
elephant has its trunk out this is
04:11
according to oh
04:18
and like not in use yeah as if it's
04:20
trunk is like that is facing downwards
04:22
or coiled up or looks relaxed
04:23
it's always out that was a bit it is
04:25
always out so it's never sucked into its
04:27
face yeah
04:28
it's just like lifting up and it's doing
04:29
like one of those like charging the
04:31
light brigade like fanfares out of it
04:32
like
04:34
i'm charging at you that's when you know
04:35
it's gonna attack no it's not gonna
04:36
attack then when it's during the charge
04:37
of the light brigade so when it's got
04:38
its trunk
04:39
protruding out towards you you can
04:41
absolutely relax you're going to be fine
04:43
apparently that's a bluff and it's when
04:45
the trunks down
04:46
and relax that they're doing a proper
04:47
time i've never seen an elephant with
04:49
its trunk
04:50
straight out like a well that's because
04:51
they genuinely want to trample you down
04:53
james
04:54
have you seen that though i've never
04:55
even seen a picture of that i haven't
04:57
really
04:57
running with your fist out ready to hit
04:59
someone yeah you very
05:00
rarely get to photograph an elephant
05:02
charging from the side on don't you
05:05
normally
05:06
human elephant contact is rare enough
05:08
especially
05:09
in safari that there wouldn't be another
05:11
group of people photographing the
05:12
elephant from the side so you're saying
05:14
he saw it face on and it just looked
05:15
like an elephant without a trunk because
05:16
it was pointing straight out of us
05:18
that's exactly right i do see that but
05:19
i'm just surprised i've never
05:21
come across a picture like that i think
05:22
something that happens i'm surprised i
05:24
didn't look at google images as soon as
05:25
i read the facts so what's that
05:27
research if the trunk is stretched out
05:29
it's bluffing will it just get up to you
05:30
and then just be an awkward
05:31
get up and then nozzle you friend in a
05:33
friendly manner shove its trunk in your
05:34
mouth
05:35
just thinks you're stressed uh it's just
05:37
to scare you away oh okay
05:39
i think it would work for me even if i
05:41
remembered this conversation and thought
05:43
hannah said that that's not gonna hurt
05:44
me
05:45
imagine if i've got this the wrong way
05:47
around and how guilty i'm gonna feel
05:48
well i always forget the numbers i
05:50
always think 99
05:52
of elephant charges are bluffs and then
05:53
i think or is that 99 of
05:56
shark attacks and actually only four
05:58
percent of elephant charges are bluffs
06:01
but then and then it's also like but the
06:02
black bear and the brown bear but then
06:04
brown bears can be black and then which
06:06
one is
06:06
wait it's nightmare yeah yeah just run
06:09
away from the mall
06:11
just live in a city um have you heard of
06:14
hobart's funnies
06:15
no no good great um so these were tanks
06:19
that were used in d-day
06:20
and there was this whole range like a
06:23
range of superheroes basically they all
06:24
each had their own special superpower
06:27
were they named funnies because
06:29
they're unusual yeah pretty much right
06:31
that was the sort of nickname they were
06:32
given
06:32
there was one whose sole job was to
06:34
carry massive bundles of sticks
06:38
exactly it was called the fascine
06:40
carrier and it basically if you came to
06:43
a ramp that was too steep or a hole in
06:45
the ground that you need to fill in it
06:46
just dropped a few massive bundles of
06:48
and these were enormous bundles of
06:49
sticks and that's where the name fascism
06:51
comes from
06:51
exactly so it was using the fascinating
06:54
carrier to defeat fascism
06:55
yeah clever with the first ones actually
06:58
the first
06:59
armored vehicle launched bridges were
07:01
the ones that just carried a big bunch
07:02
of sticks
07:03
and then tipped them into a ditch it
07:05
might it kind of seemed very scary if
07:07
those were the first things the germans
07:08
saw on the horizon
07:10
the least scary robot wars
07:13
but you would think that the like in the
07:15
end of macbeth
07:16
spoiler alert the trees the trees are
07:19
coming towards you oh yeah that's true
07:20
yeah i guess any german soldiers who had
07:22
done
07:23
english gcse would have been frightened
07:28
did you guys know that and i'm not sure
07:29
that this is true so i'm sort of asking
07:32
as well as saying um that in france
07:34
camembert is
07:35
the the translated equivalent of our pie
07:38
chart
07:39
it is yeah is it yeah camembert
07:41
camembert
07:42
i said look
07:45
yeah and that's because the correct way
07:47
to eat camembert is to slice it into pie
07:49
shapes really
07:50
and then the people who think theresa
07:52
may would be a better prime minister get
07:54
one bit of the cheese
07:55
they get a tiny little slither of cheese
08:00
and then don't knows just get a massive
08:02
amount um and
08:03
actually on reddit i think it was this
08:05
year it was late last year they had a
08:07
big argument
08:08
where somebody showed a picture of a
08:10
camembert that their mum had cut
08:12
and their mum had cut it in not a slicey
08:15
way
08:16
and this was a french lady and they were
08:17
all saying she should be kicked out of
08:19
the country for that
08:20
i've got to say i can't i wouldn't cross
08:22
my mind not to
08:23
slice it up like a pie who's doing it in
08:26
a slicey way
08:28
well this lady kicks out well they
08:31
didn't kick her out i don't think in the
08:33
end
08:34
but someone said oh there's a cause for
08:36
loss of nationality
08:37
and another commenter said take her to
08:39
the british border immediately
08:43
i actually cut off the top of the
08:44
camembert the whole thing
08:46
just the mold i just eat that because
08:48
that is just solid
08:50
bacteria isn't it basically i think so
08:52
the
08:57
and then the bacteria is a little
08:58
brownie bits and you should have some
09:00
brown bits on it but
09:01
not too much like a banana
09:04
yes like a banana that depends what you
09:06
like in a banana
09:08
also probably depends what you like in a
09:09
camembert no this is objective facts
09:12
[Laughter]
09:14
so i've been to pompeii um i went last
09:17
year
09:18
and there was a lot of brothels there
09:19
that they found which was still
09:21
standing um in particular there's one
09:23
called lupinar
09:24
and the latin for that is um she-wolf
09:28
which was slang for prostitutes and it
09:30
was two levels
09:31
had five rooms and you know that it's a
09:33
brothel because on the walls
09:34
there are still depictions of people in
09:36
various positions having sex
09:38
and they think the idea behind that was
09:40
it was almost like
09:41
porn material to be watching while you
09:44
were having sex it was the equivalent
09:45
of uh having a pornographic movie on in
09:48
the background for them
09:50
isn't that weird they had porn on their
09:52
walls in the brothel it might have been
09:54
like one of those
09:55
menus where if you don't speak the
09:57
language you just point
09:59
at the thing you want but yeah no it's
10:00
an extraordinary place highly recommend
10:02
yeah you go there they also one of the
10:04
things i find amazing about pompeii
10:05
or it might be herculaneum which was the
10:07
place nearby that the same thing
10:08
happened to it is the scrolls that were
10:10
found so 800 scrolls were found
10:13
perfectly preserved as everything there
10:15
was and
10:16
it's you know one of the ancient world's
10:18
best surviving libraries most extensive
10:20
surviving libraries and we can't
10:22
read it or we can't read a huge amount
10:24
of it because they're in such a delicate
10:26
state that we can't touch them so we've
10:27
got
10:28
all these rolled up scrolls and we don't
10:30
know what they say
10:31
when they're sitting in museums and
10:32
stuff and we're just developing the
10:34
x-ray technology to try and read bits of
10:36
them and they've just found out that
10:37
they use
10:37
lead sometimes in the ink and now x-rays
10:40
can see what the lead shapes are and
10:42
work out what they read but how annoying
10:43
is that we
10:44
wouldn't you just if i saw that i'd try
10:45
and unroll one oh well they did try but
10:48
every time they tried they would just
10:49
fall apart
10:50
oh so they did sample that yeah they
10:52
tried it and they fall apart and then
10:53
i read an article i don't know how this
10:55
would work but one time they said they
10:57
tried to open it and exploded
11:00
that don't know how that works wow but
11:02
yeah this x-ray stuff is really
11:03
interesting isn't it because they
11:05
they can virtually unroll scrolls
11:08
which is just unbelievable it's so cool
11:11
so they kind of get the x-ray
11:13
um scan of it and then they go okay now
11:15
we're going to take off the first layer
11:17
and they can unroll it and they can see
11:18
what's on the next layer which is just
11:20
outrageous yeah that's this is amazing
11:23
how many squirrels do you think
11:24
they ruined that turn to dust in their
11:26
hand before they went you know
11:28
this isn't working i would have stopped
11:29
after about 50.
11:30
[Laughter]
11:32
in the 1930s sociologist norbert elias
11:35
walked around europe with his shoelaces
11:37
untied to see what people would say to
11:39
him
11:39
no he did what was his real name though
11:43
oh very good yeah that sounds like alias
11:49
that's good uh he found that in england
11:52
most
11:52
um old men won that he might fall over
11:56
uh when he was in germany um the older
11:58
men would look at him
11:59
with contempt wow and he was
12:02
walking around the spanish fishing
12:04
village with his shoelaces untied and he
12:06
felt that he was
12:07
being warned that his laces were untied
12:09
but he felt that it was helping him to
12:10
be included in the village community
12:13
really yeah i think i read about this
12:15
guy there's something about
12:16
i don't know what country he was walking
12:17
and a bunch of girls were giggling at
12:20
him little girls were giggling at him
12:21
because of the
12:22
untying of the shoelaces and then he
12:23
tied them up and that really
12:25
transformed how he felt about his
12:27
connection to the places that he was in
12:29
when he realized who he was yeah that's
12:31
weird because if i saw
12:33
someone walking around with their
12:34
shoelaces untied i think my instinct
12:35
would be to go and try and step on one
12:36
of them to trip them over did you not
12:38
find that it happened a lot
12:40
or to wait until they stop and then to
12:42
tie them together yeah definitely oh
12:45
wow yeah if you've got enough time for
12:47
that that's a dream
12:49
yeah do you guys know about the
12:51
orangutan that can tie knots
12:53
and we don't know why and this sounds
12:54
like a it's a [ __ ] animal fact
12:57
but it's genuinely true and it's bizarre
12:59
so there's this orangutan called watana
13:01
uh she was born i think it's a she yeah
13:03
she was born in 1995 in belgium
13:06
and this guy called chris hertzfeld has
13:08
written a book about her
13:09
but she ties knots and no one's ever
13:10
taught her to do it and she just find if
13:12
she finds two threads or two vines or
13:14
whatever
13:15
then she ties them together i think
13:16
she's trying to escape
13:20
is she kept in a very high zoo
13:22
[Laughter]
13:25
she's uh she's never tried to climb up
13:27
out of them or hang herself from them
13:29
she's sorry are you quoting here i got
13:33
dark very quickly
13:35
that was my instinct when he said she
13:36
was trying to escape right i realized
13:38
that i'd got it wrong
13:39
from the monotony of life
13:44
there was an article in the new york
13:45
times from 1976
13:47
which reports an occasion where there
13:48
was an exhibition game of football
13:50
between a team from china and a team
13:52
from athens and
13:53
over the loudspeaker uh june started
13:55
blaring
13:56
and both teams stood up and put hands on
13:58
hearts because you know
13:59
they assumed it was the other ones
14:01
national earned them and it turned out
14:02
it was a toothpaste advert
14:05
and the stadium stood up and
14:07
respectfully that's amazing
14:08
that's really good do you know what the
14:10
rules are about singing the anthem the
14:11
government has said that you should
14:12
dress appropriately
14:14
right also that you should stand still
14:17
right
14:17
and that you should be full of energy
14:22
okay that's interesting yeah stand still
14:25
and
14:26
so you're ready to go basically i think
14:28
you have to be quivering basically
14:30
that's not still it's no you're right
14:33
you're right
14:34
i don't know how soon as they finish
14:36
everyone's just gonna explode in some
14:38
kind of
14:39
yeah are you not allowed to whisper
14:40
during it you're not allowed to talk on
14:42
the phone during it
14:43
but lots of countries have weird rules
14:45
don't they that's true i think
14:46
philippines in the philippines the
14:48
national anthem has to be between 100
14:50
and 120 beats per minute
14:52
um the star spangled banner when that
14:54
was first written
14:56
it was supposed to be conspirato which
14:58
means with spirit
15:00
um i thought you meant that was meant to
15:02
be called non-spiritual
15:04
he sounds like a magician
15:07
and also the um god save the queen
15:11
uh george v he thought he was an expert
15:13
because he listened to it so many times
15:15
and he said
15:18
it was called god save the king then as
15:20
well yeah just desperate pleading for
15:22
some kind of skill
15:23
how many times have you listened to him
15:27
if that is he is like i'm the person who
15:29
has to hear this more than any of you
15:31
that's true
15:31
please can you sing it right but if he
15:33
sings it it's called god save me
15:36
that doesn't scan yeah gracious it was
15:38
like prince philip's joke he jokes that
15:40
he's the world's best plaque unveiler oh
15:42
yes yeah
15:42
he's and there's a great cut of him
15:44
saying it repeatedly still it's
15:45
a good joke anyway he said that um the
15:47
opening section
15:48
you should set your metronome to 60 and
15:51
then later on it goes down to
15:53
52. that's pretty slow that
15:56
what sort of as everyone loses energy i
15:58
know that's always
15:59
it's that big ending of an american
16:01
national anthem
16:02
no you're talking about god saying i'm
16:03
talking about sorry so the american
16:06
national anthem was supposed to be quite
16:08
you know conspirator with spirit is
16:09
supposed to be kind of quite
16:11
upbeat and whatever of course these days
16:13
if you watch the
16:14
super bowl you can bet on how long it's
16:16
going to be and the the average is
16:18
usually about one minute
16:19
50 or something think is that slow
16:23
uh yeah so they put loads of extra notes
16:26
in like they're on american idol don't
16:27
they
16:29
uh other things that are being played at
16:30
the wrong tempo oh yeah
16:32
a lot of beethoven so this is a theory
16:35
that
16:35
beethoven's metronome was broken
16:40
that just sounds like a sick burn from a
16:42
reviewer
16:44
wait so he wrote his songs at the wrong
16:45
tempo no he wrote them at the wrong
16:47
tempo because his metronome was wrong so
16:49
this is some research that's been done
16:50
by
16:51
by brahms
16:54
because he didn't start playing like
16:55
whoa this is fast no no no that's not so
16:58
he played it at a tempo that doesn't
17:00
sound fast
17:00
but even went through a phase of writing
17:02
pieces of music that are unplayably fast
17:04
so between 1850 and 1820 the timing that
17:07
he writes
17:08
uh the time that he says he should play
17:09
it in is like unplayably fast it's
17:11
impossible so no one plays it at that
17:12
tempo
17:13
and everyone thinks well why not did he
17:14
write this it sounds awful it's frantic
17:16
and mad
17:17
and it turns out this guy called peter
17:19
stardlin who's a pianist
17:21
did some in-depth research and some
17:23
mathematical analysis
17:24
and worked out that the metronome he had
17:26
was weighted slightly wrong
17:28
so beethoven was just writing down the
17:30
wrong stuff because his metronome was
17:31
ticking wrong so when his metronome was
17:33
saying
17:33
yeah you're playing at 60 beats a minute
17:35
he was actually playing it 90 beats a
17:37
minute that's
17:37
brilliant that's amazing to know he
17:39
wrote to a metronome i'd never
17:40
well he actually owned the first ever
17:42
metronome i think or he owned a
17:44
metronome that was made by the inventor
17:46
of the metronome
17:47
he was really excited by this new
17:48
technology turns out he wasn't actually
17:50
quite developed fully
17:51
yes yeah i suppose it's plausible that
17:53
you could have a
17:54
um a pianist who writes music and all of
17:57
his keys
17:58
are out of tune and then when he writes
18:01
it down
18:02
it's just a completely different tune to
18:03
what you thought it was yeah
18:05
like every single time beethoven thought
18:07
he was writing happy birthday or
18:09
something
18:10
but then his keys just kept going out of
18:12
tune do you think beethoven's ninth is
18:14
actually happy birthday
18:15
yeah miss written i don't really think
18:18
that
18:18
um there's a really creepy ant colony
18:21
that
18:22
um they've just discovered in poland
18:24
which lives in an old soviet nuclear
18:26
bunker um
18:27
and basically there's this ants nest on
18:29
top of a ventilation pipe outlet
18:31
that comes up from the nuclear bunker
18:33
but a lot of ants are falling
18:35
through um this ventilation pipe and
18:38
they're falling into the bunker below
18:39
which is about three meters underground
18:41
and then they can't get out so they
18:42
can't climb up the walls and get back
18:43
out
18:44
and they keep they do what ants do so
18:46
they build nests and they operate as
18:48
ants but they have no food obviously
18:50
so they die eventually but they
18:53
constantly are being replenished
18:54
so there's this deadly community where
18:57
new ants keep falling down onto what is
18:59
now about a few centimeters thick layer
19:02
of their dead
19:02
comrades and then they just keep working
19:05
and building at their nests
19:06
and they die and then their stock is
19:08
replenished oh that's like a sick sci-fi
19:10
film
19:10
it is isn't it it sounds like a metaphor
19:12
for the soviet
19:14
times it does
19:17
obviously it's kind of like a metaphor
19:18
for life isn't it that's really just
19:20
what we're doing
19:21
yeah just falling into a life and dying
19:23
on top of our dead comrades
19:25
and on that note
19:26
[Laughter]
19:28
in 1850 there's an article that
19:31
i found it in the english civil
19:33
engineering architects journal
19:35
and it states that the academy of
19:37
sciences in france
19:39
was considering an idea for a suspension
19:40
bridge between england and france so
19:42
going from dover to calais
19:44
full barges would be sunk at equal
19:46
distances apart
19:47
across the channel and then they'd have
19:49
chains going up from the barges to the
19:51
surface and then the chains would be
19:53
affixed to the bridge
19:54
which would run from england to france
19:55
and then above
19:57
the bridge would be these huge balloons
20:00
it described them as giant balloons of
20:02
elliptical form and firmly secured
20:04
which would support in the air the
20:06
extremity of these chains
20:08
in my head i'm imagining it like the big
20:09
red balls in total wipe
20:11
out and you could just bounce from
20:12
balloon to balloon that now
20:14
i can see that working what i think
20:16
about those big
20:17
plastic bowls is they're in south
20:20
america somewhere aren't they
20:22
if mankind kind of collapses
20:25
quite soon and then the whole of the
20:27
world just kind of becomes
20:29
grown over by plants and stuff like that
20:31
they're made of plastic so they won't
20:32
really biodegrade
20:34
so if aliens come along all they'll see
20:36
really is these big plastic things
20:38
around
20:39
no no i don't think that's true no i
20:41
think that's true
20:42
if they landed in south america all of
20:45
the um
20:45
concrete stuff would go before the
20:47
plastic surely but we've got a lot more
20:49
plastic than just the balls that are
20:51
used in this
20:52
weird tv show sure sure but they'd
20:54
probably think that that was the center
20:56
of human civilization or something like
20:57
this is where they built their greatest
20:59
tank exactly you would probably look at
21:00
it and they probably they're maybe north
21:02
south
21:03
uh aligned or something like that or
21:05
they probably work out that they're
21:06
aligned with the sun or something
21:08
and they think that it was a temple yeah
21:09
although they think it's a model of the
21:10
planets
21:11
they think it's an early human attempt
21:12
to understand the solar system
21:14
yeah and that the different sizes
21:16
represent the different things they're
21:17
all the same size though
21:19
so they'd be like idiotic humans they
21:22
thought that mars and tubes are the same
21:23
size
21:24
actually james you make a very
21:25
compelling argument think of all the
21:26
temples the step pyramids in south
21:28
america think what game show they
21:29
probably were
21:30
yeah gladiators they used to have a
21:33
thing where you had to climb up
21:34
a pyramid that was probably it yeah yeah
21:38
you get to the top and at the top you're
21:39
sacrificed to the guys
21:42
i think we all know that they'll assume
21:44
that disney plastic castle in paris
21:46
is our ultimate temple that's true we're
21:49
gonna leave such weird stuff behind i
21:50
was reading an article the other day
21:51
about what
21:52
happens first when uh if if all humans
21:55
disappeared
21:56
the the rough running order of how
21:58
things wind down
22:00
and it was fascinating because it was
22:02
talking about actually concrete lasts a
22:03
lot less
22:04
time than you would think because
22:06
freezing and thawing
22:08
in let's say new york actually in about
22:10
10 years lots of plants will have
22:13
um grown in between the cracks in the
22:15
concrete and it'll all be working loose
22:17
and actually it's quite quickly that you
22:19
end up with in ten years
22:21
it might be a bit more than that well i
22:23
did think because if you don't just
22:24
rebuild new york every 10 years today
22:27
if i mean if this is predicting the
22:28
apocalypse and they're like well all the
22:30
concrete's going to disappear in 10
22:31
years
22:32
that should have been headline i can't
22:33
believe they buried the news
22:35
but it is a fair point perhaps that in
22:38
1500 years or 2 000 years
22:40
that only the um disney tower in paris
22:43
the one in disneyland the one in disney
22:46
world these are going to be the only
22:47
buildings left because they're made of
22:48
plastic
22:49
yeah are they made of plastic we assume
22:53
or just wendy houses i don't think we
22:55
all lived a tiny a tiny race
22:57
of polly pockets
23:01
all the exhibits in their museums will
23:03
be you know little playmobil dolls and
23:05
lego people
23:07
we think that these were the life forms
23:08
themselves frozen
23:10
uh when the disaster came why don't we
23:12
talk about bridges
23:15
absolutely lost it how does dan keep
23:16
this thing together it's so hard to know
23:19
so much fun when teachers away um they
23:22
used to
23:23
in the medieval times draw elephants
23:25
with actual trumpets for trunks
23:27
did they yeah so the idea they think
23:30
is not that they actually thought this
23:32
was the case but it was kind of an
23:33
allegorical way of drawing
23:35
it would be very weird if they thought
23:36
it was if they'd seen an elephant and
23:38
they saw it
23:39
but the idea being that they did make
23:41
loud noises and they thought that no
23:43
noises came from the trunks and the only
23:45
way you can show them on a picture is by
23:46
showing the
23:47
trunk as natural or trump and they think
23:49
maybe a lot of medieval pictures are
23:51
like this they're more
23:52
allegorical than actually literal oh
23:54
that's kind of i said whenever you put
23:56
anything that has notes coming out of it
23:57
like to symbolize music like yeah
24:00
musical notation it's not actually yeah
24:02
yeah
24:03
wait you said they thought that the
24:05
noise came out of the trunks it does
24:06
doesn't it
24:07
i don't know it sounds very nasal the
24:09
noise i think it comes out of the trunk
24:11
sure you're basing this off your own i
24:13
just tried doing it yeah yeah and it
24:15
sounded very elephant time when i did it
24:16
out of the nose
24:17
i think you're right
24:18
[Music]
24:20
and now with the mouth
24:24
it's not the same actually did you read
24:27
about that woman i think it was in this
24:29
country
24:29
this week or last week who um ordered a
24:32
takeaway
24:34
and she put a note on the takeaway when
24:36
it said are there any delivery
24:37
instructions saying
24:38
i feel so ill i've got terrible flu
24:40
can't get out of bed please could you
24:41
stop there chemist on the way and bring
24:42
me some benadryl i don't even want the
24:44
takeaway
24:45
i'm only ordering this so you can do
24:46
that and so this restaurant brought her
24:49
her medication there was a chinese
24:52
restaurant near me that used to deliver
24:54
cigarettes as well so people just used
24:55
to order a bag of prawn crackers and 10
24:57
boxes of cigarettes
25:00
there was a guy at harvard business
25:01
school who did a study and came up with
25:03
this thing called the ikea effect which
25:05
is that you place more value on
25:07
ikea or self-assembled furniture
25:10
yeah because you made it yourself yeah
25:12
and you kind of get attached to it and
25:13
fall in love with it as you're building
25:14
and then
25:15
by the end of it you've got a shitty
25:16
bookcase that doesn't really stand out
25:17
right but
25:18
it's yours but you fall in love with it
25:20
is that i think that's
25:21
he said fallen over those are his words
25:22
online all right okay because that would
25:24
be like a good argument
25:26
in favor of like a robotic wife for
25:28
instance
25:29
that you build yourself yeah oh yeah or
25:32
a lego wife yeah either of those
25:36
painful we'll be tiny
25:37
[Laughter]
25:40
you get massive lego people though don't
25:42
you do yeah yeah yeah
25:43
lego land but not like six at legoland
25:45
but you'd have to get married at
25:46
legoland wouldn't you
25:48
but i think i think if you're going as
25:49
far as getting a lego wife thing that's
25:50
probably not an issue
25:51
no i'm gonna be like no that's not
25:52
really my scene
25:55
you've put on a lot of bricks since we
25:56
married
25:57
[Laughter]
26:00
have you guys ever heard of the national
26:02
fruit collection
26:03
no i saw this i was reading about apples
26:05
and i just saw it and i've never heard
26:07
of it so i don't know anything about it
26:08
apart from what i saw in this
26:10
article but apparently it's in brockdale
26:12
in kent and they have a living
26:14
collection
26:14
of apples presumably all trees they have
26:17
2
26:18
300 traditional varieties of apple
26:21
wow really apparently they get 40 000
26:25
visitors a year
26:26
that's so cool so you get a chance to
26:27
taste all those varieties that have gone
26:29
out of public
26:30
use they haven't even said you can eat
26:32
them yeah i'm not sure if you're allowed
26:34
to eat them assuming
26:36
there's like anything
26:39
[Laughter]
26:46
and you can try all of them in our
26:49
restaurant you're the reason they don't
26:50
have the please don't eat the penguins
26:55
yeah well isn't that cool apparently
26:56
it's been there since 1952 and i've
26:58
never heard of it
26:59
i really want to go and visit that that
27:00
sounds so fun i found it
27:02
i think we should visit actually yeah
27:04
let's go yeah
27:06
if you're listening to this and you work
27:07
at the national fruit collection why not
27:09
invite us
27:10
[Laughter]
27:13
do you know what was a real the company
27:15
that was a huge boon for apple eating
27:17
in the world uh over the last 15 years
27:21
strong bowl um close but that's
27:24
a major in apple drinking um uh
27:27
apple eating is it an apple tart
27:30
company is it like mr kipling it is not
27:33
mr kipling
27:34
the answer is oh i think we can get it
27:36
and now we can get it so
27:37
i'll give you some clues it's like a
27:38
lolly company it was like flavoring
27:40
things smoothie makers
27:41
i'll give you some i will give you some
27:44
clues
27:45
um so basically when sliced apples
27:48
started being a thing
27:49
consumption suddenly went massively up
27:51
sorry i missed that memo
27:53
i sliced apples i have one in my
27:55
lunchbox pretty much every day at school
27:57
i'm still stuck on avocado toast
28:01
you know when you buy a apple in the
28:02
supermarket some people do and it's a
28:04
slice and it's in a package i didn't
28:06
know that no have you never seen those
28:07
in the food section i haven't seen that
28:09
i think they're all very weird and also
28:10
i've never met anyone who's done this
28:11
but you can go to mcdonald's and
28:12
exchange your fries
28:13
for sliced apples oh that was yeah
28:16
that's like why but you can't see
28:17
mcdonald's anna there you go
28:19
[Laughter]
28:22
i get points there are no points well
28:24
i'm going to edit out what you just
28:27
it is mcdonald's so they introduced
28:30
sliced apples
28:31
in the 1980s into their um
28:34
restaurant fair i think it was the 1980s
28:37
and overall apple consumption
28:39
tripled within 10 years and it's because
28:41
children especially but all of us we are
28:43
more willing to eat more of an apple if
28:44
it's sliced it's just easier to eat and
28:46
apple consumption shoots up
28:47
and it's also really helped in schools
28:49
across britain people before that were
28:51
just having one bite of an apple and
28:52
throwing it away weren't they
28:54
but um but i think it's also it's not
28:55
partly to the just the size of mandalas
28:57
is a franchise because when they started
28:59
giving away free books
29:00
um on in their happy meals one year they
29:02
became
29:03
the largest literary producer in the
29:05
world literacy tripled in america
29:09
yeah so they it's ten percent of
29:10
applesaud in the us are of sliced apple
29:12
soda in the us from mcdonald's but
29:14
exactly the same thing happened in the
29:15
uk when they introduced them into
29:16
schools
29:17
then apple consumption went up by almost
29:19
a hundred percent yeah
29:20
wow because they can just make you eat
29:22
stuff
29:23
no but they tried to make you eat full
29:25
apples and it didn't work and then when
29:27
you get sliced apples
29:28
i had an apple this morning did you and
29:29
i'm amazed at my bravery and getting
29:31
through it without having it sliced for
29:33
me
29:34
james has an apple peeling machine by
29:36
his desk i do i've never used it
29:39
uh i bought it for qi because for the
29:41
opening show i was going to put it in
29:43
there as a weird opening thing and then
29:44
i bought it and everyone went that's not
29:46
weird
29:47
everyone has it everyone has one of
29:48
those what the hell i've never heard of
29:50
that does it actually work it looks like
29:51
a little torture device it's made of
29:52
metal and you basically skewer the apple
29:54
and you sort of you put it on a skewer
29:56
and then you turn it so it's being like
29:58
spit roasted essentially
29:59
and then there's a kind of little arm
30:00
that comes down with a little knife on
30:01
it and you sort of turn it and it peels
30:03
it
30:04
off the it takes off appear like a
30:05
little big big spiral
30:07
it's also for oranges i only really like
30:09
an apple on a skewer and it's got a
30:10
suckling pig
30:11
wrapped around it
30:12
[Laughter]
30:17
so there is a shaving brush manufacturer
30:19
around at the moment called pen haligans
30:21
i think they're quite an old
30:23
an old one with um a lot of history on
30:25
their website they're asked
30:27
do you use badger hair on your shaving
30:29
brushes and they say yes we do
30:31
but they take them from parts of the
30:33
world where badges are not endangered
30:35
and in fact are primarily
30:37
farmed for their meat and i don't know
30:41
where that is
30:41
because i can't see really many places
30:43
in the world where they farm badgers for
30:45
meat
30:46
but presumably they must do well i was
30:48
on a forum i think it was a gillette
30:50
forum
30:50
about um whether the badger hair on
30:52
razer
30:53
on um brushes was ethically farmed and
30:55
they got theirs from china
30:57
so i think it was a really good email
31:00
saying you know we make sure that we
31:02
source only the most ethical budget so
31:04
do you think they
31:05
fund budget for meat in china maybe they
31:07
do maybe um they used to eat badger in
31:09
europe
31:10
uh and old european recipes for badger
31:12
would
31:13
tell you to lay it in running water for
31:15
several days to get rid of its rank of
31:17
flavor
31:18
several days
31:21
you just have to tie it up in the river
31:22
i guess yeah but rank flavor as well
31:25
otherwise
31:27
all just eat beef yeah they don't make a
31:30
noise though do they
31:32
do that well do they they must it
31:35
depends what you do to them
31:36
[Music]
31:36
[Laughter]
31:38
um old macdonald had a badger e-i-e-i-o
31:41
yes
31:41
with a what
31:44
today's i don't know do they fluff like
31:47
um
31:48
like ferrets do like maybe i like that
31:51
yeah i imagine squealing i reckon they
31:53
squeal if you run them
31:55
that'd be a great quiz by the way just
31:57
sing the old macdonald song and put in a
31:59
new animal
32:00
and the person has to respond and if
32:02
they're wrong they're out of the quiz
32:03
how many animals can you get down the
32:05
line
32:07
uh big ships yeah yeah the sea wise
32:09
giant
32:10
is pretty much the biggest ship i think
32:11
it is the biggest it's longer than the
32:13
empire state building is tall wow uh
32:17
it goes at about 16.5 knots which is
32:20
about 30 kilometers an hour
32:22
and its stopping distance is nine
32:26
kilometers
32:29
and its turning circle in clear weather
32:32
is
32:32
three kilometers so that's like imagine
32:36
we're
32:37
standing outside our office facing south
32:39
and we wanted to face north we had to go
32:41
all the way
32:42
around to around where madame tussauds
32:44
is
32:45
before we were facing north wow
32:48
we're like quite close to trafalgar
32:50
square here imagine
32:51
in an emergency like in the way you
32:54
would in a car hitting the brakes on a
32:55
boat
32:56
but nine kilometers away because if you
32:59
did it just one kilometer too late you'd
33:00
be like
33:00
we're screwed we just have to watch
33:02
ourselves plow into this island
33:04
i have a fact about um sort of banning
33:06
songs and rude songs
33:08
okay um so it's about parental advisory
33:11
lyrics you know that sticker that you
33:13
see on albums do you know who those are
33:15
partly thanks to you may do can i can i
33:18
actually have a genuine guest
33:19
cypress hill oh they are one of the
33:21
early people to have it no
33:22
okay that's not what i've got although
33:23
that might be part of the nwa um
33:26
is it a rap group it's al gore's wife
33:31
you were close is she part of a rap
33:34
group
33:35
yeah she is yeah no um she was listening
33:38
to prince with her young daughter
33:40
and she heard some very explicit lyrics
33:41
they were things like
33:44
i guess you could say she was a sex
33:45
fiend i met her in a hotel lobby
33:47
masturbating with a magazine and she was
33:49
very angry about this because she was
33:50
listening with her daughter and she
33:51
thought it was very inappropriate
33:52
so she wrote a book called raising pg
33:54
kids in an x-rated society
33:56
and as part of this drive she set up the
33:59
parents music resource center
34:00
and they released a list of artists
34:01
called the filthy 15. so this
34:03
contributed to the rise of the parental
34:06
advisory
34:06
filthy 15 is a great name
34:12
but there was an album once that got a
34:13
parental advisory label in spite of the
34:15
fact that it was completely instrumental
34:17
why did it have uh sex noises no it
34:20
didn't no it was completely instrumental
34:21
it was by frank zappa it says frank
34:23
zappa album
34:24
it was called g-spot tornado
34:29
one of the other bits of trivia from the
34:31
movie twister was
34:32
there's a cow which goes through at some
34:34
point yeah that was a sort of early cgi
34:37
cow supposedly i haven't backed this up
34:40
yet though supposedly that cow was
34:41
originally one of the zebras from
34:43
jumanji
34:45
but that's quite a career change isn't
34:47
there i'm tired of being typecasted as a
34:49
zebra
34:51
i also like that you say i haven't
34:53
backed this up yet like
34:54
as soon as we stop this podcast you're
34:56
gonna be out there i like this zebra's
34:58
um
34:59
cv it says oh it says here you can also
35:01
do cow
35:03
you need two zebras one in the front and
35:05
one in the back of the cow
35:08
yeah no you're right after every podcast
35:10
done i go through verifying everything
35:12
yeah
35:12
what did they um what do you mean by
35:14
that did they paint the stripes off
35:16
the zebra or did they paint stripes onto
35:18
a zebra for jumanji
35:19
i think maybe because jumanji came out
35:21
first maybe they had the design of
35:23
a zebra going around in a tornado yeah
35:25
and so they just used
35:26
that footage not the footage but you
35:29
know i mean that little
35:30
computer-generated thing to be the
35:31
account
35:31
i don't as i say haven't backed it up
35:33
yeah but gonna do it as soon as the
35:34
podcast
35:35
so my friend dan who works in cgi told
35:38
me he
35:38
a fact he learned to london film school
35:41
and again i haven't been able to back
35:42
this up so possibly
35:44
if someone's cgi is listening if you
35:45
guys can start doing your research
35:47
before the podcast in the future that
35:48
would be ideal
35:49
no but this is it's one of those things
35:50
where it's been said but don't know
35:52
where the proof is um any time cgi has
35:55
been used i
35:56
i don't know if it's now but let's say
35:57
movies of the last 10 years roughly
36:00
the last maybe five years predominantly
36:02
cgi has been using if they have a person
36:04
in it they've been using brad pitt
36:07
because when
36:07
uh benjamin button was made they made a
36:10
full dna as it were a cgi
36:12
of brad pitt the full motion of him and
36:14
rather than needing to replicate that
36:16
you just use that so
36:17
the company that built that sells brad
36:19
pitt to all these different movies that
36:21
need a body
36:22
that's cool so they can use all the
36:23
different ages of man as well exactly
36:26
so theoretically in world war z the
36:29
zombie film would all the zombies that
36:30
they used have also been brad pitt wow
36:33
i hope they paid him well for that i bet
36:36
they did
36:39
what if there's someone really
36:40
overweight or something was there a bit
36:41
in benjamin button
36:43
two brad pitts
36:44
[Laughter]
36:52
have you seen the new thing that ikea is
36:54
doing where they're using augmented
36:56
reality
36:58
this is pretty cool so um if you want to
37:01
get let's say you want to get a sofa and
37:03
you want to have it in your front room
37:04
but you want to know what it looks like
37:06
they've got a new app where you can take
37:07
a photo of your room and then you can
37:09
kind of
37:10
augment a sofa in the place where it
37:13
would be so you can see what the room
37:14
would look like with that sofa
37:16
that is so cool that's amazing isn't it
37:18
because they already had they had like a
37:20
build your own kitchen
37:21
in your website it was like a budget
37:22
version of the sims but without the
37:23
people in it
37:24
which i had hours of fun with we did
37:26
that for our new house it was amazing
37:28
yeah we didn't go with them in the end
37:30
but we've got pictures of what it might
37:31
have looked like
37:32
this thing you've got the happy ending
37:33
of you then get to build a kitchen
37:34
whereas i'm just like well i can't do
37:35
this because
37:36
honey don't actually own anywhere to put
37:38
a kitchen industry but there is a video
37:40
game as well
37:41
you'll love this then uh it's basically
37:43
a
37:44
it simulates you building ikea furniture
37:47
but on a computer
37:48
and there's no end to it you know you
37:50
don't win no just you don't even end up
37:52
with the furniture no
37:53
yeah and the idea is that it basically
37:54
simulates the frustration of what it's
37:56
like to build ikea furniture and you can
37:58
do it with up to four friends it's a
37:59
game called home
38:01
improvisation so home improvisation um
38:04
thanks for the translation what language
38:07
were you from
38:08
i googled that it turns out it
38:10
translates as home improvisation
38:12
and uh it lets you yeah basically
38:15
through virtual reality exactly what
38:16
you're doing alex so if you want to
38:17
build stuff outside of kitchens that's
38:19
there for you
38:21
there is a thing that's happening at the
38:23
moment uh people keep having sleepovers
38:25
in ikea shops
38:27
and ikea are not relaxed about it they
38:29
are really annoyed
38:31
well surely they could just stop people
38:33
like as in kick them out
38:34
well people go in and they hide in
38:35
cupboards at the end you can't
38:37
go through at the end of every working
38:39
day checking every cupboard in the shop
38:41
there's an old stat isn't there
38:42
something like it might be one percent
38:44
as well
38:45
of um people in europe were conceived in
38:47
an ikea bed
38:48
yeah one in ten yeah one in tennessee
38:50
wow and were they all in the shop
38:52
[Laughter]
38:54
somebody um filmed the soap opera set um
38:57
entirely in ikea and they did it without
38:59
ikea's knowledge
39:00
and um no yeah it was a web series yeah
39:02
that's amazing that's awesome
39:04
so they were in the physical shop that
39:06
they just never
39:08
yeah staff never caught on to no they
39:09
were always filming with some handheld
39:10
cameras and things and presumably they
39:12
must have got asked to leave a few times
39:13
but as in they filmed an entire web
39:14
series and
39:15
you know it was just that they were just
39:17
like living in the home oh because yeah
39:18
because
39:19
if it's a kitchen set yeah yeah they're
39:21
like got a set i think the only awkward
39:22
thing is that
39:23
in every scene you've got random people
39:24
walking around your house and just like
39:26
you're picking up your
39:29
the whole concept of the sitcom has to
39:32
be about a place where you live where
39:33
there's a lot of burglars
39:38
do you know if we ever said that when
39:39
nelson died and he
39:41
famously had hardy next to him and
39:43
cradling him in his arms and the person
39:45
who wrote the account who was there at
39:46
the time said that
39:47
nelson said kiss me hardy and then hardy
39:50
kissed him and then have we ever
39:51
mentioned that for
39:52
about 80 years during the victorian era
39:55
that story was
39:56
changed so that he said kismet hardy
39:58
because they were too squeamish about
40:00
the idea of two men kissing each other
40:01
and kismet was a turkish for fate
40:04
and so they said that he'd said kismet
40:06
hardy and this guy must have misheard it
40:08
no one would have said kiss me hardly
40:09
why do you say kismet mihaardi
40:11
isn't that because because he wasn't a
40:15
fake pirate
40:16
it's a missed opportunity i think i bet
40:19
hardy got a load of those jokes all the
40:21
way through yeah
40:24
um but if they if the story was that
40:26
nelson said
40:27
kismet hardy how do they explain away
40:29
the bit where harley then kisses him
40:33
did they say odd nelson said oh get off
40:35
me your weirdo
40:38
can i throw in one nixon fact before we
40:39
move on can anyone tell me what
40:42
richard nixon's middle name is milhouse
40:45
yeah i'd say milhouse yeah so it is mel
40:48
house
40:49
however i i'm going to put forward the
40:52
uh reviewed fact that it's in fact a
40:55
double barrel surname
40:57
because it is his mother's maiden name
41:00
milhouse was his mom okay so he took
41:03
that on
41:04
and i would say that that's not a that's
41:06
quite so my brother has the same thing
41:08
with my mama's maiden name that's quite
41:10
common and i would say that's not
41:11
double-barreled because
41:12
it's not the mother's name anymore is it
41:16
well it can still be her name she might
41:19
yeah
41:19
was her name still milhouse i don't know
41:21
but it's probably not
41:22
it's taken because it's his mother's
41:24
middle sorry maiden name interesting
41:26
yeah oh just i didn't know that
41:27
connection in any case
41:28
it's a huge huge news if true though
41:30
that richard nixon's middle name isn't
41:32
milhouse it might just be a part of
41:34
it yeah that's what i'm trying to put
41:36
forward here yeah
41:37
it is a relatively common thing i think
41:39
especially in scotland they do that a
41:40
lot don't they they use mothers made a
41:42
name for middle names
41:43
if that is took correct then there are
41:45
presumably a lot of times his name has
41:47
been carved into stone where they're
41:48
gonna have to go back and do a really
41:49
botched squeeze of the word milhouse
41:51
into it
41:52
i don't know how many times his name's
41:53
been written in stone actually
41:56
yeah that's true i mean he's not i don't
41:58
think he's one of mount rushmore is he
42:00
nixon
42:03
should be a [ __ ] rushmore with you know
42:05
andrew jackson and nixon and
42:06
calvin coolidge calvin coolidge yeah
42:09
trump yeah
42:10
just another thing about his name he was
42:11
named after a british king
42:13
so there's a thought that his family
42:15
tree actually goes back and he descends
42:17
from king edward iii
42:18
of england that's a sort of um an idea
42:20
that was put out there
42:21
um but he's named after richard the
42:23
lionheart and he is one of four brothers
42:25
and all of them also carry english king
42:27
names
42:28
really yeah what are they what do you
42:29
have the names well uh
42:31
there are only about three others sorry
42:32
sorry the three of them carried it and
42:34
then there was francis who was the name
42:35
of uh his dad
42:37
encounter isn't written far back enough
42:39
that everyone is directly descended from
42:41
him i think he
42:42
is i think edward iii is so everyone
42:46
on earth is directly descended what
42:48
because
42:50
everyone in britain everyone pretty much
42:52
everyone in western europe support
42:54
everyone in america as well because
42:55
but danny dyer did who do you think you
42:57
are and they found that he was related
42:58
to edward the thirdness this huge story
43:00
and actually
43:00
the odds of him not being related it
43:02
would have been an amazing news story if
43:03
he had not been related
43:06
i don't think that's going to sell many
43:07
papers isn't it daddy
43:09
they're not related explain the
43:17
don't usually go much past the headline
43:18
don't they and if the headline isn't
43:21
related to edward iii
43:23
but that's an interesting story because
43:25
the odds are 99 that he would be in my
43:27
newspaper it's gonna have very long
43:28
headlines
43:29
articles country music has the most
43:33
intelligent lyrics apparently
43:34
because one of the measures which sounds
43:36
like not a great measure is the number
43:37
of syllables in words
43:38
and it doesn't have filler words so you
43:40
don't get a lot of um oh
43:42
yeah yeah yeah oh you know that kind of
43:45
stuff you get
43:46
i see what you mean but if you say that
43:48
the most
43:49
advanced songs are the ones with more
43:51
syllables then the most advanced song in
43:53
history is
43:54
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
43:56
yeah it takes years of study to
43:57
understand that
43:59
the example the study used was country
44:01
music uses more syllables
44:03
using words such as cigarettes tackle
44:05
box and hillbilly
44:09
apparently so that's too advanced for an
44:12
eight-year-old obviously yeah fair
44:13
enough
44:16
um also on too big to fit i googled too
44:19
big to fit
44:20
and uh dwayne the rock johnson is too
44:24
big to fit in a lot of the cars
44:26
in the latest fast and the furious wow
44:30
so there was an interview with him and
44:32
they were asking him why are you net why
44:33
are you always in trucks and not in the
44:35
little cars and he's like i'm too big to
44:37
fit in there
44:37
oh my god wow that makes sense yeah yeah
44:41
you should drill a hole in the ceiling
44:42
or something is he too tall or two
44:45
he's very muscular he's muscular yeah
44:48
but that is extraordinary he's good that
44:49
isn't it does he have
44:51
could they have an adapted one where
44:52
he's just got one seat in the middle
44:54
so it's not a two-seater i guess they
44:57
could although they'd have to write that
44:58
into the storyline of the film
45:00
yeah what storyline there is
45:04
if you want to collect semen from
45:06
macaques it's quite hard
45:08
um macaques little primates little
45:10
monkey things oh yeah
45:11
um what they used to do is they would
45:14
stimulate their
45:15
genitals with electricity um sometimes
45:19
a little weak jolt but it would make
45:21
them ejaculate
45:22
but one researcher realized that
45:24
actually they were ejaculating quite a
45:26
lot anyway
45:27
because they do it like four times an
45:29
hour or something like that
45:31
um yeah they average four times an hour
45:33
ejaculating when they're just having fun
45:34
and just on their own
45:35
watch all the time not when they're
45:38
asleep
45:40
whether it's sleep now it just keeps
45:42
going
45:43
but do they eject like 40 times a day
45:45
you know um
45:48
yeah they do i'm seeing on what so what
45:50
i'm seeing here on this bit of paper is
45:52
on the island the males masturbate on
45:54
average four times an hour
45:56
so that's on average four times an hour
45:58
they're gonna have some better hours
45:59
than that you know good outlet
46:01
um and so what she realized this um
46:03
researcher is what she could do is just
46:05
kind of hang around because it happened
46:07
so frequently
46:08
and then when it happens just quickly
46:09
get in there with the pipette and suck
46:11
it up
46:12
and she does that um the main problem
46:14
being that they often
46:15
lick the ground or their hands clean
46:17
before she can get close
46:19
and because semen happens to be highly
46:21
nutritious and they don't want to waste
46:23
the nutrients
46:24
devious devious macaques yeah they are
46:27
randy though
46:28
so randy um
46:31
you can obviously at all times an hour
46:33
yeah they like to masturbate
46:36
look we all like to masturbate but they
46:38
should get a job
46:41
you know when crocodiles die they bloat
46:43
and float their bloaters and floaters
46:45
um because of all these gases being
46:47
released that keep them afloat
46:49
and they float for over a month without
46:51
thinking
46:52
wow so i don't understand why we don't
46:54
see crocodiles floating down
46:56
well we must do it all the time we must
46:58
do right maybe we do in countries with
47:00
crosstalk just think they're logs
47:01
yeah yeah or crocodiles because they
47:04
they're very stealth aren't they
47:05
crocodiles
47:06
they don't do much movement so if you
47:08
saw one going like that you'd think oh
47:10
he's on a cheeky mission
47:11
cockroaches go on the back don't they
47:13
when they die famously yes
47:15
the reason being that they have long
47:17
legs for an insect
47:19
and they have a high center of gravity
47:22
their center of gravity is quite near
47:23
their bum
47:24
kind of thing and as they get older they
47:26
kind of start to
47:28
get weighed down to their bum side and
47:31
then
47:31
when they kind of eventually die they
47:33
flip over and they don't have enough
47:35
um energy in their arms they don't have
47:37
enough strength in their legs
47:39
to put them back over and the same thing
47:41
happens if you
47:42
give them kind of pesticides they spasm
47:46
and they'll flip over and then they
47:48
won't have the energy left in their
47:49
legs to flip them back so they're
47:51
flipping over
47:53
their head they're not they're not
47:55
rolling over sideways they're flipping
47:56
over vertically because their body is
47:57
weighing them down
47:58
exactly they do a backflip well i don't
48:00
know if it's exactly like that it could
48:02
be a slightly sideways slightly black
48:04
flippy thing i don't know about that
48:06
but basically you're walking around with
48:09
a heavy bum
48:10
and as you get older you're less able to
48:13
deal with it
48:14
we've we know how it feels
48:17
tortoises uh have that same problem do
48:19
they obviously because they've got round
48:21
shells
48:21
but they have this really weird
48:23
balancing act that they need to strike
48:25
because bigger animals obviously do
48:27
better
48:28
because they're stronger and they can
48:29
fight other males and they can compete
48:31
more
48:32
but also if they get too big
48:35
uh a bigger shell means that it's hard
48:38
to write yourself again so you have all
48:41
the advantages of being big but if you
48:42
lose one fight and you then get rolled
48:44
over onto your back it's much likely
48:45
that you won't be able to
48:47
write yourself again oh yeah it's a
48:49
trade-off
48:50
basically putting all your eggs in one
48:51
basket to be really big
48:53
there's a really interesting thing about
48:55
tortoises which we covered on qi
48:57
uh years and years ago and that is that
48:59
it's possible to invent a shape
49:01
that you put it on a table and it always
49:04
flips over to a certain side
49:06
just due to the shape of the thing it's
49:08
felt like a gombok but i think it's
49:10
pronounced more like gumbers
49:12
anyway so this shape has been invented
49:14
by computer scientists and it took us
49:16
decades to do it and they managed to do
49:18
it through using computers
49:20
but tortoise shells some tortoise shells
49:22
have this exact same shape
49:24
and so if they flip over they naturally
49:26
kind of roll back onto their feet
49:29
wow that's so cool that's awesome was
49:30
the inventor of the gombok
49:32
inspired by turtles or with tortoises or
49:35
is that i believe he was
49:37
i've met him and i can't remember right
49:39
vice versa you're gonna ask yes this is
49:42
the turtles
49:43
went to one of his shows and thought
49:44
guys we should try that
49:46
yeah i was so proud of myself for not
49:48
finishing the sentence you
49:49
clearly knew where i was going with that
49:51
i was like no
49:52
because james started talking i thought
49:54
ah that looks like a clever question
49:58
i wasn't gonna let him save you uh
50:01
diamonds are the hardest substance in
50:02
the world i read
50:03
a whoop they're not james's chicken and
50:05
hair diesel
50:06
[Laughter]
50:10
they're not what is they're the hardest
50:11
naturally occurring sorry that's what i
50:13
meant to say yes the hardest naturally
50:15
occurring substance
50:16
you can't scratch a diamond except
50:19
with another diamond you can yeah so you
50:21
can scratch
50:22
a diamond with a diamond that's what it
50:24
means that's what hardness means in this
50:26
sense it means that you can scratch
50:27
something with something
50:29
so hardness is whether something can be
50:30
scratched and toughness is whether it
50:32
shatters into a thousand pieces if you
50:33
hit it with something so diamonds
50:35
because the layers of carbon
50:36
are very tough uh you know internally
50:39
but you hit it with a hammer bang smash
50:41
it
50:41
right yeah so don't try that don't do
50:43
that yeah
50:44
okay yeah and that's i think i think we
50:47
may have said this before that's what
50:48
traders used to do
50:49
uh if someone had mined a diamond uh
50:51
there was some unscrupulous people who'd
50:53
say well okay let's have a look and
50:54
we'll just give it a quick test to see
50:55
if it's a real diamond
50:56
uh i'll just hit it with this hammer
50:58
bang smashes and then he says i'm so
51:00
sorry it wasn't a real diamond after all
51:01
it was something else but i'll keep the
51:03
sharks i'll keep the showers and i'll
51:04
pay you a nominal sum for them i'll pay
51:06
you a tiny bit to keep yourself going
51:07
you know and
51:08
then they just set off a load of smaller
51:09
diamonds very clever very clever yeah
51:12
oh you could glue them back together and
51:13
make a bigger diamond again oh
51:15
god i think that's where the
51:16
imperfections come in come on down to
51:18
anna's shitty diamond store
51:23
we've got loads of rubbish diamonds full
51:25
of glue
51:28
uh i've got some stuff on quarantine oh
51:30
right yeah
51:31
um it comes from the italian for 40
51:35
karantee which um because you used to
51:38
have to stay 40 days
51:39
um in quarantine yeah that makes sense
51:41
incubation period of the black death
51:43
supposedly okay
51:44
um they put astronauts in quarantine
51:46
that's right um
51:47
when they come back down do you know why
51:50
yeah because of radiation
51:52
and uh in case uh in space they were
51:55
given some sort of flu disease or
51:56
something it was it was to do with
51:57
diseases wasn't it well
51:58
it was a little bit aliens with small
52:00
blocks yeah so you might think if you
52:02
were a sci-fi fan that it was to stop
52:04
alien
52:05
diseases coming to earth but it's
52:07
actually because their immune system
52:08
is lessened due to them being in space
52:11
so when they come
52:12
back down they need to go in quarantine
52:14
so they don't pick up bugs on
52:17
technically that you're earth the entire
52:18
rest of the world in quarantine
52:20
yeah yes that's that's just true of all
52:22
quarantine
52:23
just flip around the exit entrance
52:25
[Laughter]
52:27
yeah i suppose that is true yeah there
52:29
was you know just uh just picking up on
52:31
that
52:31
quickly um when the apollo 11 astronauts
52:34
came down
52:34
they they had to do that they had to be
52:36
in quarantine in this room where they
52:38
had a sort of kitchen in there and
52:39
living quarters and so on and they had
52:41
to stay in there for ages
52:42
um before they could do any of their
52:44
parades around the world wow
52:46
um and what ended up happening was if a
52:48
scientist
52:49
accidentally kind of was infected
52:52
as it were with um with the room that
52:54
they were kept in because they were
52:55
delivering stuff and so on i guess
52:57
for them it was for possible space
52:59
cooties wasn't it yes yeah
53:01
those scientists then had to move in
53:02
with them so there was a whole batch of
53:05
people that
53:06
subtly got or might have been infected
53:07
so therefore needed to be
53:09
the next people came along to give them
53:11
some food and they got exactly it's like
53:12
a horror film it's like oh where's
53:14
where's sarah i better go and find out
53:16
oh no where's bernard gone now
53:18
it's a little like a game of sardines it
53:20
is it is
53:21
exactly and um there was a suggestion
53:23
and i'm not saying this is true but
53:25
there was a suggestion
53:26
that um some of the people who
53:28
accidentally had to go into the
53:29
quarantine
53:30
looked like ladies of the night uh who
53:33
made their way into there and had to
53:35
live out i don't even know what the
53:36
implication you're making is
53:37
um prostitution prostitutes were there
53:40
institutes no because it's back on earth
53:41
now
53:42
but why adult space prostitutes don't
53:44
exist oh yes
53:47
but really was another time wasn't it
53:49
the 60s yeah
53:50
i mean it literally was yes
53:52
[Laughter]
53:55
i looked at some skillful number people
53:59
and i was looking at like the world
54:00
record for memorizing
54:02
numbers and stuff like that okay and the
54:05
world record for most
54:06
digits memorized in one minute has two
54:09
different sections
54:10
one with the light on and one with the
54:11
light off because apparently it's
54:14
miles easier when the light's off that
54:16
makes sense because of no distractions i
54:18
guess so right
54:19
but you can close your eyes how do you
54:20
see the number to memorize
54:23
maybe that's another reason but yeah
54:25
maybe you're allowed a little torch or
54:27
something i don't know right
54:29
perhaps they give you an audio recording
54:30
of it maybe
54:32
i don't know so this is for binary
54:34
digits so it's zeros and ones
54:36
okay the one the specific one i'm
54:37
looking at and the record for most
54:40
zeros and ones memorized in one minute
54:42
with the light
54:44
on is 107. okay with the light off it's
54:48
273. oh
54:50
whoa wow isn't that amazing that makes
54:52
that much difference that's incredible
54:54
so all mass exams should be held in the
54:55
dark shouldn't they i guess so if they
54:57
were all in binary
54:59
mine mine will work
55:02
did you just quickly one thing on
55:04
chocolate i think it's quite funny
55:05
bernie madoff
55:06
remember him um is now running a
55:08
chocolate racket in prison
55:11
so who's he again sorry you know he's
55:12
the guy who uh
55:14
massive ponzi screen didn't he ponzi
55:16
scream
55:18
um yeah so he was a businessman who it
55:21
turned out was stealing lots of people's
55:22
investments so he got millions and
55:24
millions of pounds and um
55:25
stole lots of money and he's running
55:27
this chocolate racket and in prison in
55:28
america now he's really respected
55:30
because he's stolen more money than
55:31
anyone else in there
55:32
so he wrote this letter to his daughter
55:35
saying he's quite the celebrity in there
55:37
other inmates treat him like a mafia don
55:39
and call him uncle bernie
55:40
i can't walk anywhere without people
55:42
shouting their greetings and
55:43
encouragement
55:44
it's really quite sweet and he's brought
55:46
up all the chocolate in the prison
55:48
and now he runs this racket where the
55:50
only person you can get it from is him
55:52
and so he makes a big profit does it
55:53
work because it sounds like that should
55:54
be illegal right
55:56
it's unusual to have people committing a
55:58
very similar crime in prison to the one
56:00
they were put in there
56:00
yeah yeah and then to announce it i mean
56:03
do the prison guards not read news
56:05
no that's not it's not it's not illegal
56:07
no what just to buy up to get in there
56:08
first and buy up all the stuff so you
56:10
can sell it on for a profit that's okay
56:12
it's immoral
56:13
right it's a bit of a monopoly i don't
56:15
think there's like anti-monopoly rules
56:16
in prisons
56:17
it's touting it is touting yeah okay
56:21
well good luck to him i think that's
56:22
what you're saying couldn't have
56:24
happened to a nicer guy
56:27
i'd love to know where the boxes are
56:28
from deal or no deal
56:32
you'll notice i said nothing in that
56:33
whole bit because i was busy thinking
56:35
god yeah did they
56:37
edmonds just got them in his house yeah
56:40
he probably i reckon he uses them to
56:42
wrap christmas presents
56:44
uh that would be such a good idea if he
56:46
doesn't and he's listening but that's a
56:47
great christmas present so you unwrap it
56:49
there's a box you open the box there's
56:50
nothing inside and you're like oh this
56:52
is terrible and he says actually it's
56:53
one of the boxes
56:54
there's a no deal and you're like that's
56:55
the best present up in the
56:57
christmas is saved um yeah i would be
56:59
still unhappy with the dill no build
57:01
boxes my christmas present just the
57:02
chilly ones thinking about it
57:03
if it was a real one that was used on
57:05
the show i really intentionally did not
57:07
want that
57:08
as a present great okay well i'm sure
57:11
someone else will have it yeah
57:13
i bought it now sorry no we thought
57:15
she'd love it
57:16
or he might use it for like storage yeah
57:19
or if he goes shopping putting his
57:21
shopping in the boxes yeah just goes
57:23
everywhere
57:24
if you look at every photo of him these
57:25
days he's actually got a box with him if
57:27
he gets fired
57:28
once he got fired from a job do you
57:29
think he cleared his desk in those boxes
57:32
oh yeah when they got cancelled yeah
57:34
yeah how do you move them though does
57:35
you put handles on them
57:36
or wheels oh yeah cause they don't have
57:38
handles do they no
57:40
not very easy to carry how many items of
57:42
checking luggage will you have today so
57:43
i've got 15.
57:47
um i read a thing there's a basketball
57:49
player called jimmy butler
57:50
um he plays for the chicago bulls i
57:52
think he's just been traded but i'm not
57:54
sure to where
57:54
but he i read an article this is the in
57:57
the headline it says that jimmy butler
57:59
took out his car rear-view mirror as a
58:02
reminder to never look back
58:04
is that awesome i was promptly arrested
58:08
[Laughter]
58:10
um have you heard of the north american
58:11
walnut sphinx caterpillar no
58:13
that's a goodie it pretends to be a bird
58:16
to freak birds out it's a bird
58:26
sorry i should clarify they make a noise
58:28
like a freaked out bird
58:30
i just scared the other incoming birds
58:32
away exactly so
58:33
what they do it's amazing they um to
58:36
make the noise they have
58:37
uh not quite lungs in the sense that we
58:39
understand they have these holes along
58:40
the sides called spiracles
58:42
exactly and to make the noise they
58:44
squeeze themselves shut like an
58:45
accordion
58:49
it's amazing and that when they do that
58:51
it makes a noise that goes
58:53
and it sounds exactly like a bird's
58:55
alarm call saying there is a bird of
58:57
prey nearby or
58:58
get out of here we're all we're under
58:59
attack and so the other birds will fly
59:01
off as soon as this caterpillar are they
59:03
doing it to scare the birds away they're
59:04
doing it to scare the birds away because
59:06
it's extraordinary on them
59:08
is that evolution or is that a
59:09
coincidence that the note the the
59:11
specific notes
59:13
everything's evolution is it yeah
59:16
that's what we all are what was the
59:19
other option
59:23
well yeah it could be evolution by
59:27
coincidence
59:28
it probably started as a bit of a
59:31
looking at but that's how coincidence
59:32
works evolution always starts as a
59:34
coincidence which then evolves into
59:36
being a pattern
59:36
does it yeah yeah
59:40
no but if you if you were an animal and
59:42
you were living on the galapagos
59:43
and the trees were too high and the
59:45
leaves were too high on the tree it's
59:46
not coincidence for you to grow your
59:48
neck to try and yes it is
59:49
it's a coincidence that there was
59:51
someone who was born with a really long
59:52
neck
59:53
no but don't you grow your neck no oh my
59:55
god
59:56
that's lamarckism that's lamarcism the
60:00
original evolution
60:01
and in some people's eyes the best
60:06
now one individual gets born with a
60:08
slightly longer neck slightly not one
60:10
individual is born with 50 vertebrae
60:19
slight slightly longer neck and then can
60:21
get one or two more leaves and then it's
60:22
a bit more likely to pass on his jeans
60:24
yes i knew that bit right
60:28
did you though it just sounded a lot
60:31
like
60:32
it
60:32
[Laughter]
60:37
that yeah when i was reading about
60:38
caterpillars i read this statement that
60:41
said that basically
60:42
all they're doing is collecting food for
60:45
the
60:45
the moment where they go into their uh
60:47
chrysalis stage
60:49
um so they're just their whole life as a
60:51
caterpillar is just to feed themselves
60:53
in order
60:54
for that like like how i moved house the
60:57
other day it'd be like as if my whole
60:58
life was just
60:59
collecting boxes i mean in order to live
61:02
and breathe and you know for their
61:03
processes to work they have to be
61:04
metabolizing some of the food they can't
61:07
just all be
61:08
you mean they're just creating no yeah
61:10
they're effectively just like i just
61:11
need to just eat and get myself yeah
61:13
they are also using the food yeah a lot
61:14
of it for energy as a caterpillar yes
61:17
totally yeah
61:18
nobody points but what's the point of
61:19
using all that energy so that you can
61:20
turn into a butterfly
61:21
exactly it's the same as dan saving up
61:23
for his new house like he has spent some
61:25
of the money on
61:26
you know coke and prostitutes and
61:28
whatever yeah but eventually he's been
61:30
saving up for this house
61:32
they're putting something aside is what
61:33
you're saying they've got a little
61:35
savings account on the side yeah but
61:37
it's it defines their whole existence
61:39
because then they're a new thing they're
61:41
a new it's a whole new account
61:42
who are you just saying what defines the
61:44
existence of a caterpillar i don't know
61:46
i read it in a
61:46
in an article i don't know if a
61:48
caterpillar would agree with that
61:50
why they probably wouldn't be able to
61:52
argue me too
61:53
don't even know their caterpillars
62:03
do you know um auctioneers watch videos
62:06
of
62:06
other auctioneers at their best sort of
62:08
like the greatest hits of
62:10
auctioneering like auctioneers have to
62:13
do that as part of their training no no
62:15
they watch it to marvel at the
62:17
complexity of what certain auctioneers
62:20
have done so this guy called chris burge
62:21
who's acknowledged as christie's
62:23
greatest auctioneer
62:24
some people acknowledge him as the
62:25
greatest auctioneer of um
62:27
of all time
62:32
i think i've slightly made that up but
62:35
um he basically so he joined christie's
62:37
in 1970
62:39
and he averaged now this i'm just going
62:41
to read this sentence as it's written
62:43
i didn't fully understand it because i
62:44
can't believe it's true averaging more
62:46
than one million dollars a minute in
62:48
sales
62:49
up to his retirement in 2012. no it
62:52
can't be true can't be true
62:53
very fast that's that's his that's
62:56
per minutes across his sales isn't it so
62:59
if an auction takes 50 minutes
63:02
then his average was one million a
63:04
minute ah in in the 17 minutes he got 50
63:06
million
63:07
so she sells one painting for 25 million
63:09
in one minute he can then sit around for
63:11
24 minutes
63:12
yeah yeah really not trying yeah that's
63:16
amazing but so there's a video of him
63:19
that auctioneers love to watch
63:20
and he s and he sold the 10 most
63:23
expensive works ever sold at auction in
63:25
the world
63:26
wow yeah and the video is of him
63:29
selling monet's water lilies in new york
63:32
and
63:32
in it he's taking bids from three people
63:34
in the room and two people on the phone
63:36
and what they're watching
63:37
is the magic of him being able to juggle
63:40
between it all be charming and witty and
63:43
it's a sort of master class in
63:44
auctioneering videos well i mean i
63:46
listen to other podcasts
63:47
so it's the same kind of thing yeah i
63:50
mean you wanna yeah
63:51
if you do love auctioneering and you're
63:53
an auctioneer of course you're gonna
63:54
watch
63:54
yeah videos i just didn't know that they
63:56
existed that you know that there's the
63:57
greatest hits out there yeah there are
63:59
dvds and things you can get
64:00
they're my greatest auctioneers yeah
64:02
they must probably are i don't think
64:03
that's the biggest auction of all time
64:05
though
64:05
even the waterloo's one i've got one
64:07
that was bigger go on yeah
64:08
the entire roman empire was auctioned
64:12
was auctioned off
64:13
in 193 a.d yeah it was auctioned off by
64:16
the praetorian guard
64:18
who took bids from a couple of people it
64:20
was a closed auction it wasn't anyone
64:21
could bid
64:22
and um this is according to cassius dio
64:25
who wrote a history of rome
64:26
and um uh two people were bidding saul
64:28
pickianus and
64:30
marcus didios salvius giulianis and he
64:33
made the maximum bid supposedly it was
64:35
the equivalent of about five million
64:36
quid in today's money which i think
64:37
surely someone else could have stumped
64:40
up more but it was past its best in 1938
64:43
[Music]
64:44
some some damage
64:48
but then several careless owners
64:51
so at the moment british police are
64:53
investigating a caterpillar thief
64:55
who has stolen from a nature reserve in
64:57
norfolk
64:58
some milk parsley plants right now there
65:01
is a kind of
65:02
butterfly in britain called the
65:04
swallowtail it's the largest native
65:06
british butterfly
65:07
and the caterpillars only eat milk
65:09
parsley and these plants in norfolk
65:11
had swallowed tail caterpillars on them
65:15
so they the police think that they've
65:17
been stolen and the plants will be
65:19
kept alive and then eventually the
65:21
caterpillars will turn into butterflies
65:22
and then collectors will kill the
65:24
butterflies and they're very rare these
65:25
butterflies because they only feed on
65:27
these plants
65:28
right so what do you see so someone's
65:29
throwing the plants in order to get the
65:30
caterpillars that they can sell to
65:32
collectors
65:32
yes well no to turn the caterpillars
65:34
into butterflies to be killed for
65:36
collectors yeah yeah but then you're
65:37
breeding caterpillars i suppose so you
65:38
are making more of the species then
65:40
you're immediately killing the butterfly
65:41
as soon as it comes out of the thing
65:43
right yeah it swings around about no
65:45
it's not
65:46
it's all swings oh crap
65:52
do you know they used to play cricket on
65:54
the ice and the fence
65:56
and um this was in north uh in
65:59
what's it called in east anglia in
66:01
england was that not quite confusing if
66:03
they're all wearing their whites
66:06
um no this would take place uh in the
66:09
18th
66:09
in the 19th century and i read one
66:12
account
66:13
saying that the fielding and batting of
66:15
many of the players was considered to be
66:16
far
66:17
superior and more graceful than any
66:19
cricketing on the green
66:21
really so apparently playing cricket on
66:23
ice is better were they
66:25
were they in skates or were they just
66:26
running i think they were on skates yeah
66:28
that must be amazing yeah i mean the
66:30
ball will go so far
66:32
if you hit it yeah yeah standing on
66:34
skates to bat
66:35
hang on why would the ball go fast
66:37
because it was skid on the ice
66:38
oh once it hit the ground yes i thought
66:40
you meant it gave you super human power
66:42
of hitting
66:45
i'm just quickly on the dutch and how
66:46
good they are at skating oh they're
66:48
amazing at speed skating aren't they
66:49
this is the thing okay so they're now so
66:51
good that other countries are refusing
66:52
to play against them
66:54
there's no point um in sochi in 2014
66:57
uh the norwegians dropped out of the 10
66:59
000 meter speed skating race ostensibly
67:01
because they said oh we want to focus on
67:03
the team event actually it's just
67:04
because they knew they get marmalised by
67:05
the um by the dutch
67:07
and so and noy loves skating as well so
67:09
that's a big thing
67:10
so the women's 1500 meter team they came
67:13
first
67:14
second third and fourth in that event
67:17
and out of 36 medals they the dutch got
67:19
23.
67:20
no other team got more than three maybe
67:22
it's unfair because they're the tallest
67:24
nation aren't they so perhaps
67:25
on focus their legs are too long but
67:27
they will have a higher center of
67:29
gravity yeah meaning sure
67:33
it's easier than fall over are we sure
67:35
that being tall is an advantage
67:37
in ice skating i think we are certainly
67:39
not sure of that
67:40
i think really long legs might help i
67:42
guess if you're trying to if you're
67:43
propelling yourself or because you can
67:44
go further from each stroke maybe and
67:46
it's like a more efficient use of energy
67:47
perhaps i don't know i would suggest
67:49
that if jamaica were to take part in
67:52
this event
67:53
they might be as good as if not better
67:56
than the dutch i think we've just come
67:57
with a sequel to cool runnings
67:58
[Laughter]
68:01
um but the fastest skater the world
68:03
record holder for the fastest skater is
68:05
a russian
68:06
um called um pavel kuliz
68:09
and he he's he's he whatever how would
68:11
you say it then james
68:12
kulesnikov
68:16
and to before i didn't even read the
68:18
name until just now i should have i
68:19
should have run the finances falling
68:20
down
68:21
um and he went up he was registered
68:23
going at uh 53 kilometers an hour
68:26
registered going not by like a police
68:27
camera but like
68:29
he but like 50 i just think that's
68:30
astonishingly fast for a skater
68:32
and he was in a 500 meter race so he
68:34
picked up speed fast
68:35
how many is that in miles now
68:40
yeah yeah is that that's fast isn't it
68:43
eight miles an hour yeah can you say
68:44
bolt runner 30 miles an hour he's not
68:46
it doesn't normally happen in miles now
68:47
does it they do it in seconds per 100
68:49
meters
68:50
i think it would be nicer if it was
68:51
miles an hour for the spectators he can
68:53
run at approximately 9.9 seconds per
68:56
hundred meters
68:57
i'm not sure what that is in miles per
68:59
hour someone at home can work it out
69:01
i think it's less i think it's about 20
69:03
that he runs isn't it no that's not very
69:04
that's like a
69:05
built up area
69:09
um i was looking up lonely insects and
69:12
i was looking up cockroaches and they
69:14
suffer from isolation syndrome
69:16
if they're left on their own and they
69:18
die so or they
69:20
are not able to mature properly and this
69:23
is really weird so the way that
69:24
cockroaches are really affectionate
69:26
physically so you know if you see them
69:27
they're always crawling all over each
69:29
other and stuff and touching each other
69:30
and it turns out all this physical com
69:32
physical contact stimulates them to grow
69:34
so if you isolate a cockroach even if
69:36
you give it food and water
69:37
then it won't grow and it won't molt
69:39
properly and it won't mature
69:41
but you can make it mature by poking it
69:43
with a feather
69:44
so yeah and that convinces them that
69:46
they're having this physical contact
69:47
with their fellow cockroaches and they
69:49
grow properly
69:50
yeah that's amazing does it have to be a
69:52
feather or it could probably actually be
69:53
any kind of slightly ticklish device
69:55
is there a limit to how big a cockroach
69:57
grows yes because they can maintain it
69:59
right
69:59
like if they were if they were touching
70:01
another cockroach they're like i just
70:02
want to grow a bit today and so they'd
70:04
touch a cockroach so you're saying if
70:05
you get a cockroach and you tickle it
70:07
for like let's say
70:08
seven weeks yeah it might be the size of
70:10
a dog exactly that's my question
70:12
maybe try it i think andy's skeptical i
70:14
am skeptical and i'm surprised
70:16
i know that you're encouraging this line
70:17
of inquiry
70:19
we've kai bosh a lot of the stupid
70:20
things he said today
70:22
[Laughter]
70:27
so for many years in many places um
70:30
collecting flies
70:32
and giving them to the government has
70:33
gotten you money um
70:35
so in china uh officials in lua yang
70:39
offered 125 per 2000 dead flies
70:44
during the campaign really um each fly
70:46
was worth about seven cents
70:48
was that a massive amount for a flyer it
70:50
was just recently sorry that was quite
70:52
recently yeah wow
70:55
is quite a lot bigger than a flight as
70:56
well yeah that's not really how money
70:59
works
71:00
it's interesting but usually usually the
71:02
money's less than the thing you know
71:03
wait till the time
71:05
goes to the shop with loads of flies and
71:07
they say you can't pay with that you're
71:08
like well it's heavier than that
71:09
oh no it's weird because the sandwich
71:11
weighs a lot more than the 20 queen but
71:13
the 20 pound note is heavier it doesn't
71:16
really make sense doesn't worry i
71:17
completely retract that ridiculous thing
71:20
to say
71:21
so in um because then you wouldn't be
71:23
able to buy anything
71:27
oh man that must be tough yeah i had to
71:29
find a coin as big as a house
71:32
that's what happens on the island of yap
71:34
in micronesia oh
71:36
because they have massive stone coins
71:37
with holes in them and the bigger
71:39
the better really yeah that's where i
71:41
was going with that
71:42
[Laughter]
71:45
salvador dali he was obsessed with um
71:48
breasts wasn't he isn't it
71:49
lots of his art depicts but he his
71:52
ultimate obsession was
71:53
uh with the other because he said it's a
71:56
very weird
71:57
sexual thing it's half penis and half
71:58
udder
72:03
it's half penis half breast all other
72:06
in
72:13
a ufc fighter called justine kish
72:17
uh she was in a fight and halfway
72:20
through
72:20
the match she was held in i think in a
72:23
stranglehold
72:24
and it as a result she she pooed herself
72:27
mid-fight in the octagon i still won the
72:30
match
72:31
and um she got offered a bum wiping
72:34
product
72:35
as her sponsor for future pilot paper no
72:37
it's it's white
72:40
yes can i um have some non-white
72:42
products please
72:45
yeah tesco's like equivalent when
72:47
they're not allowed to call it jaffa
72:48
cake
72:59
but actually this wasn't toilet paper no
73:01
no it's wipes it's
73:03
bum wipes wet wipes for adults as
73:06
opposed to babies
73:07
uh so yeah so she thought she was gonna
73:08
do and she was really good because she
73:09
won the match anyway and she came off
73:11
and they asked her about it and she said
73:12
[ __ ] happens did she very good it's very
73:15
nice did she use it
73:16
as a weapon in the fight i mean no holds
73:20
barred
73:20
there's no there's no weapons in ufc but
73:22
there's no rules right
73:23
yeah there's no rules if you rub your
73:26
[ __ ] in someone's face that's true oh do
73:28
you mean did she use the poo
73:30
in the fight not her wipes
73:32
[Music]
73:34
[Laughter]
73:39
have you heard of the uh in holland
73:41
there's a race in holland called the elf
73:42
stadium talked
73:43
uh leaving skyra told me about this
73:45
actually um so it's
73:46
this race that happens well it happens
73:49
whenever it's able to happen so
73:50
sometimes it doesn't have for 20 years
73:51
sometimes it'll happen in consecutive
73:52
years and it's apparently a massive
73:53
event in holland when it does happen
73:55
and it is a uh ice skating tour that is
73:58
about 200 kilometers long and goes to 11
74:00
cities and that's what the names mean
74:01
it's 11 city tour
74:03
and apparently it's just a massive event
74:04
and what happens is every year
74:06
everything gets cold and freezes in
74:07
winter and they go around they
74:09
the the race the the racetrack is uh
74:12
goes
74:13
along as a network yeah exactly and they
74:16
have to make sure that the ice is taken
74:17
off because
74:17
it's an amateur contest and the
74:19
professionals and amateurs take part and
74:20
so
74:21
there loads and loads of people are uh
74:23
take part in it and then
74:25
pretty much the rest of the country all
74:26
call in sick and watch it on television
74:28
and and apparently that's like a thing
74:30
like if it's like they stay home
74:32
like watch it it's been like the grand
74:33
national here but everybody watches it
74:35
or something yeah
74:36
or anything everyone watches it yeah
74:39
absolutely
74:40
yeah yeah i have heard of that but um i
74:42
think global warming means it hasn't
74:43
happened for a while
74:44
for a while there was one that was going
74:45
to happen in 2012 and they called it and
74:47
what happens is they decide they're
74:48
going to call it and then it has to
74:49
happen in the next 48 hours so everyone
74:51
has to rush to get prepared
74:52
but then it didn't happen even though
74:53
they called it because the ice just
74:54
wasn't so exciting
74:56
and there was actually speaking of ice
74:58
preparation they do this thing called
74:59
ice transplanting which is taking thick
75:01
ice in one place and moving it
75:03
to say a bit under a bridge where the
75:05
ice isn't very um
75:06
thick and to kind of fusing it to the
75:08
ice it's like a skin transplant but yeah
75:10
isn't that really cool
75:11
because it has to be six inches thick
75:14
along the entire
75:15
200 kilometers of the course and
75:18
obviously that's very
75:20
seldom gonna happen yeah why aren't the
75:22
climate change lobby using this more
75:24
in their pr i really think that might
75:26
persuade the likes of donald trump and
75:28
and other such people surely if we know
75:30
that this canal ice race is going to end
75:33
people would step up to the plate yeah
75:35
if donald trump has a secret passion for
75:37
ice
75:38
skating race racing i don't think he
75:39
does who wouldn't for this
75:41
yeah it is incredible it's so cool do
75:44
you mind if i ask
75:44
why people are monitoring the koala
75:47
populations do we know that
75:48
yeah i think um
75:56
[Laughter]
76:01
did you guys see that photo from march
76:03
of this year there was a guy
76:04
sitting at a train station he looked up
76:07
and he just couldn't believe what he saw
76:08
he took a photo to prove it
76:10
um he was stopped at seven sisters
76:13
station
76:14
sitting right there on the platform with
76:17
seven nuns
76:19
oh seven nuns seven sisters and
76:22
uh he took a photo of it uh it's yeah do
76:25
you think an eighth none wanted to come
76:26
on that trip but they were like
76:28
guys we can't no this is like the moon
76:30
landings being fake if you look in the
76:32
photo there is an eighth nun
76:34
well there's an eighth man no there's
76:36
well there's one man but
76:37
no he's an eighth in the party oh i
76:40
thought i saw an eighth none when i
76:42
looked at the photo
76:43
oh really and so was there anything
76:45
hiding behind the other ones you're
76:46
right there's an eighth none
76:47
oh my god ruined oh
76:50
man i'm sorry i feel like i've killed
76:52
christmas did you did you do it that
76:54
easy with the moon landings as well
76:57
um have you heard of open source seeds
77:01
um no okay so that's these that don't
77:04
charge you to read them
77:06
kind of okay no i think i think these
77:09
are the seeds that are in these
77:10
libraries these open sources well
77:12
so in the 1930s the usa started applying
77:15
patent law
77:16
to plants so there are various plants
77:20
where the intellectual property is owned
77:22
like you can own an avocado
77:24
well you can own an avocado but you can
77:26
own the whole
77:28
avocado except of the avocado the whole
77:30
species of the
77:31
yeah they've got this new kind of rice
77:32
they're called golden rice
77:34
which is is it hardier and it grows
77:36
faster and better and therefore has
77:37
prevented starvation
77:39
that is owned by someone the
77:41
intellectual property for it
77:42
does that mean you're not allowed to
77:44
grow it or you're not allowed to give it
77:46
the name
77:46
i think you're not allowed to then i'm
77:49
not sure about this i think you're then
77:50
not allowed to breed it
77:51
develop it and then make money selling
77:53
your own extra strain of it
77:54
but i'm not certain so anyway commercial
77:57
use basically and i think that's because
77:58
that specific breed of rice
77:59
was grown in space and that and it was
78:02
like the means that it took
78:03
to do that it then means well therefore
78:06
those people deserve a kind of a cut of
78:07
any profits
78:08
well i don't think it's the specifically
78:10
the space thing but but i just think
78:12
yeah yeah that's specifically the effort
78:14
that went into making that new breed of
78:15
rice
78:15
yeah so if you it's kind of like
78:17
developing a medicine in some ways yeah
78:19
that if you develop the medicine you
78:20
then get the rights to it because you've
78:21
spent money developing it but they've
78:23
now got this thing called open source
78:24
seeds
78:25
german breeders are experimenting with
78:27
it you're not allowed to
78:28
patent anything that you get out of it
78:30
any new great strains that you get
78:32
but you don't have to pay anybody to do
78:34
the developing and
78:35
okay isn't that weird yeah that's truly
78:37
bizarre and it
78:38
doesn't seem morally great
78:41
surely if you're not allowed to let
78:43
anyone grow this thing that could be a
78:45
great food source that you can probably
78:47
it might not incentivize people to
78:48
develop new strains if you can't own it
78:51
so there's a bit of a
78:52
capitalism
78:59
imagine you'd like everybody to have
79:00
enough to eat anna well well i'm sorry
79:02
[Laughter]
79:04
i suppose it's not a million miles away
79:06
from peyton tinga mars
79:08
bar or or a strain of apple is in like a
79:10
granny smith or something
79:11
right yeah i found fanner was in charge
79:13
just be formless lumps of chocolate and
79:15
nougat that we'd be eating now
79:17
and everyone would get one wouldn't they
79:19
it's a better world
79:23
[Music]

=198
00:00
[Music]
00:10
[Applause]
00:14
hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
this week coming to you live
00:20
from up the creek in greenwich london
00:30
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:32
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
00:34
hunter murray and james harkin and once
00:36
again we have gathered around the
00:37
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:39
from the last seven days and in no
00:41
particular order
00:42
here we go starting with you andy
00:45
my fact is that archaeologists have just
00:47
dug up in the middle of the desert an
00:49
enormous
00:50
sphinx statue it is believed to be
00:53
anywhere
00:53
up to 95 years old
01:02
i think you're gonna have to explain um
01:05
so there are now archaeologists looking
01:08
at old film sets
01:09
from the early days of hollywood and
01:11
they're doing proper excavations
01:13
on movie sets that were abandoned to the
01:15
desert this is a real thing
01:16
and there was a very famous film in the
01:18
20s called the ten commandments it was
01:20
this massive biblical epic
01:22
and at the end of it they didn't take
01:23
the sets down there's a theory it would
01:25
have been too expensive
01:27
or there's another theory that he didn't
01:28
want anyone else to use the set
01:30
because the director was cecil b demille
01:32
yes and he was a bit of a
01:33
megalomaniac wasn't he and he thought he
01:35
didn't want anyone else to use this so
01:37
i'm going to bury it in the middle of
01:38
the desert
01:38
yeah and now we found it and they buried
01:40
it and yeah there's this filmmaker who's
01:42
been searching for it for years he's
01:43
called peter brosnan
01:45
and there's now a film about the finding
01:47
of the original
01:48
film wow it's called cecil b demille's
01:52
lost city or something uh very similar
01:54
to that and it was this enormous
01:55
set so it was 12 stories high 800 feet
01:58
wide there were 21 sphinxes
02:00
um the the pharaoh statues weighed four
02:03
tons each
02:04
and they built an extra sphinx so that
02:06
actors playing slaves could drag it
02:08
around
02:10
the effort they went to this film was
02:11
enormous that's awesome i read
02:13
a thing that um the idea that we have
02:15
that slaves
02:16
built the pyramids and so on um is down
02:19
largely to this movie
02:20
because that's not the case it wasn't
02:22
those people working but they just as a
02:24
as a representation used slaves in the
02:26
movie yeah that's where we get that
02:28
common myth they were kind of
02:30
freelancers as far as i understand that
02:32
yeah
02:33
they were they were farmers outside the
02:34
farming season weren't they
02:36
pyramids yeah i think so yeah but this
02:39
movie
02:39
um when demille put it in the in the
02:42
middle of the desert he said
02:43
if 1 000 years from now archaeologists
02:45
happen to dig beneath the sands
02:47
i hope they will not rush into print
02:49
with the amazing news that egyptian
02:51
civilization
02:52
extended all the way to the pacific
02:54
coast of north america
02:56
so he actually saw the idea that people
02:59
would be digging this up in the future
03:00
and might think that it was real
03:01
we've totally [ __ ] up his plan that's
03:03
so sad we know we knew as well that
03:06
that's what he wanted
03:06
no he didn't want that that's what he
03:08
said he specifically
03:10
didn't want i think he was saying that
03:12
he was sitting with a bit of a wink
03:13
wasn't he he was like oh i
03:15
really hope they don't do that yeah
03:17
that's how i interpreted it but
03:19
i'm i'm making that up i actually
03:20
thought that's what he had said
03:22
um some people who did do that
03:25
is the website nine gag um everyone
03:28
knows everyone knows the website nine
03:29
guys yeah it sounds rude i know people
03:33
love but it's not
03:34
it's not a rude site is it no it's just
03:36
like memes and stuff like that yeah and
03:38
what they did was
03:39
they um buried a huge pillar carved with
03:41
internet memes deliberately
03:43
to [ __ ] with the archaeologists of the
03:45
future
03:47
so everyone had to vote for their
03:49
favorite memes and the ones that went in
03:50
were such
03:51
uh memes as dick butt
03:54
uh doge who you probably all know [ __ ]
03:57
just got real
03:58
and hardest name in africa i don't know
04:00
what that one was
04:01
um but they buried this in there and
04:03
they're hoping that in thousands of
04:04
years people will see it and think that
04:06
it was some kind of religion or
04:07
something right
04:08
which i guess it is right yeah yeah iron
04:10
age bronze age
04:12
banter age
04:15
i was reading uh in the movie cleopatra
04:18
itself
04:18
um because it was a huge a huge
04:20
operation to get this movie made it was
04:22
it was
04:22
it was so ambitious they made all these
04:25
incredible sets and wait are you talking
04:26
about the ten commandments or cleopatra
04:28
sorry sorry it's the ten commandments
04:29
we're meant to be talking about i've
04:31
researched cleopatra let's move on
04:37
okay cleopatra it was they had a big set
04:40
too it was you know very expensive
04:43
yeah yeah thanks guys
04:47
i'll just comment on what you guys have
04:49
to say for the rest of the evening
04:51
okay so has anyone got any cleopatra
04:55
material that we can help him out with
04:57
i do have a fact related to cleopatra
05:00
yeah it's about the film the ten
05:01
commandments
05:06
okay so it was that basically in 1922
05:09
cecil b demille he was already pretty
05:10
famous
05:11
um but he ran a competition for what his
05:13
next film would be about
05:14
so you everyone submitted subjects and
05:17
the best subject won a thousand dollars
05:19
and he would make the film
05:20
and it went to a man who was called fc
05:23
nelson he was a lubricating oil
05:24
manufacturer
05:25
and he he just wrote on a bit of paper
05:28
make the ten commandments
05:31
if only he'd written mate cleopatra
05:37
but then beneath it he had a little ps
05:38
at the bottom of the page he then wrote
05:40
you cannot break the ten commandments
05:42
or they will break you but he won he won
05:45
the competition but it was
05:46
it was a bit disastrous right the ten
05:48
commandments in a sense because cecil b
05:50
demille was so
05:51
determined to get it working and um it
05:53
went so way over budget he
05:55
like didn't accept any profits from it
05:57
uh ever like his
05:59
producers called him and were like come
06:00
back now give up
06:02
this is a complete disaster and he
06:04
refused to and he did things like he
06:06
refused to use painted backgrounds at
06:08
all so he refused to use like
06:10
normal scenery so that meant he just had
06:12
to literally build everything so i think
06:14
there was like a
06:15
wall that was miles and miles long that
06:16
he had bill it wasn't there and then at
06:18
the end did he dynamite the whole
06:20
thing i'm just thinking if donald trump
06:22
digs around and finds that wall
06:24
yeah um i don't think he did dynamite no
06:28
that's a rumor
06:30
cecil demille just quickly um great
06:33
director
06:34
do you guys have any stuff on uh joseph
06:37
mankowitz who what did he do right then
06:39
sorry
06:44
i'm just quickly on cecil b demille so
06:49
for the for the shooting of it and this
06:51
is just this the incredible budgets of
06:53
the day
06:53
uh he built a city which had 3500 actors
06:56
technicians and extras
06:58
they were divided into 14 units of men
07:01
and seven of women
07:02
in a 24 square mile city and
07:05
there were very strict rules about you
07:07
know alcohol and gambling and stuff
07:09
um he hired 225 orthodox jews
07:12
to look like their ancestors
07:16
the israelites and apparently during the
07:19
filming they kept missing their cues
07:21
because they were so overwhelmed by the
07:22
emotion of being in this thing
07:24
um and then he wrote to everyone on set
07:27
he said
07:28
your skin will be cooked raw you will
07:30
miss the comforts of home
07:31
you will be asked to endure perhaps the
07:33
most unpleasant location in cinema
07:35
history
07:36
i expect of you your supreme efforts
07:39
it was so tough he was an ass wasn't he
07:42
i
07:48
i'm not saying that you're a prima donna
07:50
randy but this he had a chair boy
07:52
who always walked three steps behind him
07:55
carrying a chair
07:57
he was never allowed to look his master
07:59
in the eye and whenever demille stood
08:01
still for more than a minute
08:03
the chair boy had to put the chair
08:04
behind him and then bang the back of his
08:06
knees so that he sat down
08:08
on the chair which was there whoa can
08:10
you imagine having one of those yes i
08:12
can
08:13
[Music]
08:15
and i'm frankly angry i had to sit down
08:17
tonight
08:19
was cecil b demille a puppet it sounds
08:21
like he was one of those
08:23
collapsing puppets he made loads of
08:24
biblical films he made another
08:26
biblical epic called the king of kings
08:28
oh yeah and he
08:29
made but he was mostly known for
08:32
slightly saucy movies they always
08:33
involved a naked woman in a bathtub at
08:35
some point
08:36
and then he made the ten commandments
08:37
which is a big switcheroo cleopatra used
08:40
to spend a lot of time in bathtubs
08:41
didn't she
08:42
i james i don't have anything on it
08:46
actually i got it i got a different
08:47
thing which is just um picking up on
08:49
what james said earlier about
08:50
him wanting to bury uh demille wanting
08:53
to bury the set so no one else would use
08:55
it
08:55
there's a bit of logic behind that
08:56
because people back in the day of early
08:59
hollywood did used to do that
09:01
um so there's a very famous version of
09:03
dracula that was made with bella lugosi
09:05
and the idea was you would pay for all
09:07
these movies uh
09:08
huge budgets for their sets to be made
09:11
but because of
09:12
workers unions and and clocking off at
09:14
the right time it meant that
09:15
you know you'd film in a day and in the
09:17
evening the set was just sitting there
09:19
so they thought what if we filmed the
09:20
foreign language version
09:22
of the movie that we're now making in
09:24
spanish and italian
09:25
in the night time when they've abandoned
09:27
the set and that's what they did and
09:29
there's a very famous version of dracula
09:31
from 1931
09:32
where they made in the daytime the
09:34
english version with bella lugosi
09:36
and in the evening time they made the
09:37
spanish version and the spanish version
09:40
because they were able to sit at the end
09:42
of the day of filming of the
09:44
of the american one they would watch the
09:46
dailies and so the rushes that they
09:48
filmed that day
09:48
and they would go oh that angle's no use
09:50
why don't we film from this direction
09:52
and so they would re-angle everything
09:54
they learned to make the movie by
09:56
watching
09:56
a different movie being made on the same
09:58
set yeah and as a result it took
10:00
something
10:00
like seven weeks or something sorry a
10:03
few months for them to make
10:04
the american version but the spanish
10:06
version just got done it really quickly
10:08
and they made it
10:09
way before the americans finished and
10:11
released it before the americans
10:12
released it again
10:14
and so people saw the spanish version
10:16
and the reviews were
10:18
well if the american version is as good
10:20
as this and it's probably better it's
10:21
going to be an amazing movie
10:23
because it was awesome but the problem
10:24
was was it it was [ __ ] the american
10:26
version
10:27
but one reason i think it would be [ __ ]
10:29
is doesn't dracula die in the daytime
10:32
yeah yes
10:35
you're right yeah yeah well the guy the
10:38
director was so bad he didn't even
10:40
capture
10:40
dracula's death on camera he failed to
10:42
put the camera in the right position
10:44
so it's just bella go off screen you
10:47
don't even see
10:48
yeah but you can't i mean presumably
10:50
better than you didn't actually die so
10:51
you can't just retake that
10:54
and have them in front of the camera
10:55
yeah i know but they didn't they just
10:57
didn't i guess back then they were just
10:58
like oh it's six o'clock the spanish are
11:00
coming in all right let's
11:02
we gotta go bella's done but yeah so
11:05
they did used to double up on the sets
11:07
and so
11:07
that version of dracula was more famous
11:09
for the spanish version that was copying
11:11
the american
11:12
than the american version wow so you can
11:14
understand why you wanted to bury sets
11:16
it was probably a crew of spaniards
11:17
around the corner that were
11:20
he was only out there avoiding thomas
11:21
edison wasn't he who
11:23
uh cecil b demille really yeah that's
11:26
why he was out
11:27
west that's why they went way out west
11:28
is because there were loads of um
11:31
edison thugs who would beat you up for
11:32
using was it film technology
11:34
yeah and that's basically why hollywood
11:36
is where it is today and why they made
11:37
all the movies out there because
11:39
edison was on the east coast and if they
11:42
went to the other side of america they
11:43
couldn't get them with all the patents
11:44
and all things like that
11:45
yeah and so um owned 80 guns
11:49
to protect himself 80 guns
11:52
and a wolf he had a wolf as well i'm
11:55
serious
11:56
at 80 i know it sounds like i just out
11:57
of that spur of the moment
11:59
wow you know the blues brothers you know
12:01
when they filmed the blues brothers
12:02
uh again went quite over budget the most
12:05
impressive thing they did was they
12:06
dropped a car
12:08
from a helicopter i think there's a
12:09
scene in it where they fly a helicopter
12:11
like 1500 feet in the air and then they
12:13
drop a car
12:15
down on chicago they got permission from
12:16
the government the state government to
12:18
do that
12:18
they dropped a pinto car down into like
12:21
presumably an abandoned area of chicago
12:23
presumably
12:27
and the car when it landed it was 45
12:29
centimeters tall
12:31
because of the squat that was the extent
12:34
of the force
12:35
yeah that's pretty cool and they also
12:36
had a cocaine budget they always used to
12:37
say that about the blues brothers didn't
12:38
they
12:39
that that film had its own cocaine
12:40
budget there was a there's a film
12:42
with uh dennis hopper easy rider it was
12:44
called and this is a great book yeah
12:46
awesome film but
12:47
he was he was part of the creative team
12:49
and he was doing drugs every single
12:52
day and he was doing all different kinds
12:53
of drugs and it got to the point where
12:55
they were like we just have to give up
12:56
and accept that he's on ecstasy in the
12:58
morning
12:58
cocaine in the afternoon and heroin in
13:01
the evening whatever he was doing part
13:02
in the evening
13:03
it got to the point that when he got the
13:04
scripts for the next day for the film
13:06
they wrote on it the drug that he was on
13:09
in the previous scene so he could match
13:11
the energy
13:12
that he was bringing to it so they're
13:14
like we're gonna film the second half of
13:16
the scene we did three days ago and you
13:17
were on cocaine then so if you could do
13:19
three lines before we start shooting
13:22
we'll get the same vibe as what you were
13:24
i'd love to see the movie where they mix
13:26
them up and
13:27
he's doing heroin and then suddenly he's
13:29
doing cocaine halfway through the scene
13:31
yeah it's true we need to move on
13:33
shortly to our second fact you guys have
13:34
anything
13:35
before we go oh apocalypse now yeah
13:38
there are filming apocalypse now uh one
13:40
of the things that francis ford
13:41
coppola demanded was that a he was
13:43
allowed to burn down
13:45
a lot of jungle in vietnam and because
13:46
he was a big deal at that point they
13:48
allowed him to so many acres of jungle
13:49
were just burned down for it
13:51
but also he used real military
13:52
helicopters but apparently
13:54
he used to get really annoyed on set
13:56
because they kept on having to fly off
13:59
to fight in
14:01
so actual wars got really pissed off wow
14:04
yeah i got one last thing um it was a
14:06
movie set problem
14:08
um it's a movie back in the day called
14:09
cleopatra where
14:14
what happened was is that cleopatra's
14:16
entrance scene was a huge
14:17
you're not even listening okay it is
14:19
time for fact number two
14:21
and that is me it's my fact uh
14:25
okay my fact this week is that when
14:27
british author william haslet
14:29
died his landlady was so keen to re-let
14:32
his room
14:33
that she hid his body under the bed
14:36
while she showed new tenants around
14:40
this is extraordinary what a viewing
14:42
that must have been
14:44
[Laughter]
14:46
uh so hazlitt uh he's not that famous
14:48
now is he no but if we made this show
14:50
back in the 1800s you guys would be like
14:54
hazlitt was huge he was a massive
14:56
british author not only an author he's a
14:58
literary critic he was a painter social
15:00
commentator philosopher
15:02
he was um he was a big deal he died in
15:05
1830
15:06
um he was living in soho and in fact
15:09
there is a hotel now there
15:10
which is called the hazlitt house i
15:12
believe and that is the location where
15:15
he died
15:16
and he's still there under that bed
15:17
isn't he still there yeah
15:19
but he was he was a big deal and people
15:22
used to go
15:23
just to the hazlett hotel just because
15:25
that's where he lived
15:26
seamus heaney used to go there obsessed
15:28
with him and they would they would have
15:30
meetups there just to be able to be in
15:31
the sort of presence of the location of
15:33
this great person who everyone seems to
15:35
have forgotten except it turns out
15:37
you and i people i mean people know
15:40
william has it is but i did happen to
15:42
take a book of his essays
15:43
on my gap year which i know is i just
15:45
told these guys backstage
15:47
one of those guys was going to mention
15:49
it so i thought i'd get in there which
15:50
stroke were you taking when you were
15:52
reading it
15:54
the essays themselves were my drug james
16:01
what am i on i'm on chapter 3.
16:08
i mean they didn't come in chapters but
16:10
whatever um
16:12
but he was he was unappreciated by his
16:14
death wasn't he like when he died he
16:16
died in poverty it was on fritz street
16:17
and
16:18
um he'd been basically uh dissed by
16:21
all of the people he'd been mates with
16:23
so he was really good friends with
16:24
coleridge and sudhi
16:25
and wordsworth but he kind of also hated
16:29
everyone yeah he kind of started it he
16:31
did start it
16:32
so well they they embody these
16:34
revolutionary ideals that he
16:36
loved and he thought that they didn't
16:38
see them through properly he thought
16:39
they'd all sold out so he kind of loved
16:41
coleridge but he wrote all these essays
16:43
saying i hate that you haven't lived up
16:44
to your potential
16:45
so eventually they just ruined his
16:47
reputation and he died in poverty
16:49
wow and it all started actually when he
16:51
groped somebody
16:52
did you read this story yeah yeah it was
16:55
yeah boo exactly yeah well
16:59
well don't don't say it was a different
17:03
time anna
17:04
[Laughter]
17:06
it was a different time they were
17:08
staying in the lake district it was him
17:10
and coleridge and wordsworth all staying
17:11
in the lake district and writing
17:12
together
17:13
and he went away hazel went to the pub
17:15
one night
17:16
and a woman was flirting with him and
17:18
sort of teasing him and he thought that
17:20
she wanted to get off with him so he
17:21
sort of leaned in
17:22
or something or you know came onto her
17:24
and then she
17:26
laughed at him and said no don't be such
17:27
a you know cat
17:29
and so he lifted up her petticoats and
17:30
slapped her on the bottom
17:32
um look
17:35
i'm with the lady on the second row here
17:38
i'm not saying it's good behavior but
17:40
he'd been embarrassed
17:42
and then he got chased by this mob um
17:44
who wanted to duck him
17:46
which apparently is a common thing they
17:47
wanted to duck him and die that's an
17:48
awful correct thing i think
17:55
i don't think so
18:00
um but yeah and he ran back to kohler
18:02
ridge and said please hide me and they
18:03
they smothered him away over the
18:05
mountain
18:06
that's extreme
18:07
[Laughter]
18:10
they saved him but then they spread all
18:11
these rumors that he was a horrible
18:12
lascivious sleazy
18:14
um man and then he had an affair with
18:16
someone half his age
18:19
he sort of thought so it was landlady's
18:22
daughter not the landlady i believe who
18:23
later
18:25
got vengeance by hiding him out of the
18:28
bed
18:29
uh he yeah she was half his agent he
18:32
just fell completely in love with her
18:34
and then he wrote this whole book saying
18:35
that he had
18:36
fallen in love with her and uh declaring
18:38
it in public yeah
18:39
and he sent his he sent his friend
18:42
to test her by making advances and
18:46
flirting with her
18:47
and seeing how she reacted and she
18:48
flirted back with his friend
18:50
although she drew the line at any
18:51
serious stuff and then he asked his
18:53
friend whether he could set
18:54
sarah this girl up as the friend's
18:57
mistress
18:58
and he would pay for it and uh the
19:00
friend said no
19:01
i would prefer a woman who can read and
19:03
talk
19:06
okay yeah very judgmental if girl was in
19:08
love with someone else it was a complete
19:09
disaster anyway it was a great literary
19:10
figure
19:13
here's my favorite william hazlitt
19:15
complete disaster story
19:17
uh and that is his first lecture at the
19:19
russell institution
19:20
uh where he turned up and they told him
19:22
it had to be one hour long
19:24
but he prepared enough material for
19:25
three hours and so instead of editing it
19:28
he just did the three hour talk in one
19:30
hour
19:33
and just put his head down and just read
19:35
it as quickly as he had
19:37
wow that's really funny james because it
19:40
reminds me of another story about
19:41
hazlitt which i've brought along and i'm
19:42
so glad you mentioned it
19:44
i read actually relatedly something
19:46
recently about gordon brown
19:47
which was this is in the week i think
19:49
and it was a story that
19:51
goes around westminster which is that he
19:52
was asked to give a talk at sort of a
19:54
pensions dinner quite early on in his mp
19:56
dumb and it was just it was about
19:58
pensions
19:59
it was a talk about pensions to a bunch
20:01
of pensioners and other people
20:03
and he was asked to speak for 45 minutes
20:04
so he got up and he gave
20:06
and he really works really hard you know
20:08
he's known for working hard on stuff
20:09
so he thought really hard he delivered
20:10
this 45 minute speech
20:12
and at the end the person who was
20:14
comparing the event came on and
20:15
apologized for the fact that he got on
20:17
so long and they'd actually asked him to
20:19
a four to five minutes video
20:27
at what stage do you think i'm gonna
20:29
have to stop him here
20:31
you can imagine on pensions
20:36
um hazlitt invented well he coined a
20:39
word
20:40
uh that we all use today gusto
20:44
yeah yeah it's got gusto that's hazlitt
20:48
so he existed before didn't it but he
20:49
sort of wrote an essay
20:51
on it sort of properly defining it yep
20:55
i didn't i thought i thought he'd
20:57
invented it no it didn't exist before
21:00
to mean like um uh life
21:03
and he just he said it as something to
21:06
do with arts didn't he yeah he was the
21:07
first person to use it to describe art
21:09
yes
21:10
oh well anyone can use a word to mean a
21:11
different thing to
21:13
i think we've all agreed it means well
21:14
he also according to the oed
21:16
coined the words newsmongering
21:18
modernizing
21:20
and acorning acorning apparently means
21:23
collecting acorns
21:26
he was the first person to use that yeah
21:29
unbelievable
21:30
yeah what a great contribution to the
21:31
english language and people don't
21:33
appreciate it see why i took a massive
21:34
brick of his essays on your gap year
21:39
seeing your customs anything to declare
21:41
no
21:43
what's that in your bag madam
21:44
[Laughter]
21:47
and a bunch of acorns no problem
21:50
um some stuff on dead bodies or estate
21:53
agents dead bodies
21:56
dead bodies and if we can cleopatra
22:00
so here's the thing about the dead um
22:04
no so uh so a contemporary of hazlitts
22:06
uh was shelley
22:07
and there's a there's a an often
22:09
repeated story about shelley's heart
22:11
being uh plucked from the funeral pyre
22:13
he was being burned on
22:15
um so he drowned and he was at sea for
22:17
several days
22:18
uh dead and and bobbing around and then
22:20
he was it was retrieved and he was burnt
22:22
on the beach uh there's now a theory
22:24
that it wasn't his heart which
22:26
refused to burn because it's a very nice
22:27
romantic image that his you know his
22:29
heart refused to burn
22:30
they now think it was his liver which
22:33
refused to bow because it was just
22:34
soaked in seawater
22:36
for days and days and it was the biggest
22:37
organ so it would have been less likely
22:39
to burn
22:40
right and it was taken out and a friend
22:42
of his took it and then bequeathed it to
22:44
another friend of his
22:45
who then gave it to mary shelley who put
22:48
it in a bag
22:49
it's really it's re-gifting isn't it
22:52
but actually speaking of livers and back
22:54
on haslet
22:55
he didn't drink but do you know why he
22:57
didn't drink
22:58
at the end of his life um no because i
23:01
felt like you're going to guess then
23:02
don't
23:03
uh broke he was broke uh he he was broke
23:05
but that's not why so it said that he
23:07
died of tannic acid poisoning from
23:09
excessive tea drinking because he was
23:10
obsessed with drinking tea and he used
23:12
to
23:12
fill half a teapot with tea possible too
23:15
much
23:16
i don't think so i think would be dead
23:22
was obsessed with it though apparently
23:23
he used to get up at one or two in the
23:24
afternoon never before that
23:26
and he would get up and pour himself a
23:27
tea half half full of tea
23:29
like the tea leaves and then half of
23:31
water and then he would sit there for
23:33
four to five hours stirring
23:43
wow that was beautiful like quantified
23:47
when we put this podcast out that's
23:48
going to come in stereo in people's ears
23:51
that's going to be the best hard-hitting
23:53
punchline anyone's ever heard
23:56
anyway no sorry four to five hours
23:59
motionless staring into the distance
24:01
so he loved tea but he didn't drink
24:03
because the last time he drunk
24:04
was when he went on a huge binge
24:07
following the battle of waterloo so he
24:08
was a massive napoleon fan
24:10
and he loved napoleon and he was
24:12
devastated that napoleon had been
24:14
defeated he thought he epitomized the
24:16
great revolutionary cause
24:17
and so he wanted his huge drinking binge
24:19
and he spent weeks and weeks wandering
24:21
london completely unwashed in a drunken
24:23
haze
24:24
and after that he thought alcohol wasn't
24:25
for him
24:28
okay it is time for fact number three
24:30
and that is james
24:31
okay my fact this week is that unicef
24:34
has a nutrition ambassador
24:36
called poopy
24:39
so this is just a thing this is just
24:42
true
24:43
um she is called um jose helli hunter
24:46
rama harvey lissoa and she is a singer
24:49
from madagascar
24:51
and she's goes by the stage name poopy
24:54
and lonely planet has declared poopy a
24:56
national treasure
24:58
and she's been active in educating young
25:01
mothers about breastfeeding
25:02
their infants as a nutrition ambassador
25:05
for unicef
25:06
uh and that's basically her entire
25:08
english language wikipedia that i've
25:10
just read out
25:12
and there is nothing else on her on the
25:13
internet really there's in english
25:14
anyway
25:15
um but she joins other unicef
25:17
ambassadors such as katy perry
25:19
serena williams liam neeson the wiggles
25:23
dustin the turkey and the vanuatu
25:25
women's beach volleyball team
25:28
oh cool god that embassy must be a
25:30
writer
25:34
and yeah so she's just um she's a
25:36
nutrition ambassador and she's got a
25:37
funny name but we don't know why she's
25:39
got i mean it's her stage name right
25:40
just her stage name yeah we don't know
25:42
why she got that name
25:43
okay i imagine it must mean something
25:45
different in malagasy i guess
25:47
yeah you would hope i looked up a little
25:49
bit on stage names
25:50
okay so uh stevie wonder he has a stage
25:54

25:54

you're interested uh joan crawford the
29:06
actress
29:07
she was named by the public
29:13
[Laughter]
29:17
and her original name was lucille
29:20
this is a french surname s-l-e-s-u-e
29:26
but people thought studio bosses thought
29:28
that sounds like lucille the sewer
29:30
so they held a public competition to
29:33
change her name and joan crawford was
29:34
the entry which won
29:35
she didn't like it at first but she had
29:37
to be called that
29:39
wow it grew on her apparently okay yeah
29:42
that's so cool it's not that cool a name
29:45
really
29:45
or is it like just the time that makes
29:47
it feel like that
29:48
joan crawford doesn't feel like her when
29:50
was it 20th century
29:54
anyone 47
29:57
what a specific answer
30:00
june 47. any advance on june 47. do i
30:03
have 48.
30:06
june 47 was one of the names that were
30:07
put up
30:08
[Laughter]
30:11
i've got a thing on ambassadors okay um
30:14
so uh the fact at the top if you
30:16
remember unicef has a nutrition
30:18
ambassador
30:18
and that's called poopy um so a lot of
30:21
celebrities get asked to be ambassadors
30:23
for certain things and very recently
30:25
helen mirren um has been an ambassador
30:27
for l'oreal so she'll do panels and so
30:29
on for their moisturizer
30:31
so like it's so annoyed about the
30:32
ambassador it's the brand ambassador
30:35
that's foreign
30:36
it's like it's not the same as unicef
30:38
though is it like you don't set up in a
30:39
massive building in the middle east and
30:41
say i am the l'oreal ambassador
30:44
how can i where the [ __ ] are my ferrero
30:48
rocher
30:51
where is the l'oreal embassy
30:54
you're right yeah um no she's a loyal
30:57
ambassador it's a real thing
30:58
yeah she's like yeah she's a brand
30:59
ambassador and she's not a very good one
31:01
because she did
31:02
a talk they did a panel talk in the
31:04
south of france and they asked her
31:06
about moisturizer and what it does and
31:08
she said probably [ __ ] all
31:10
that that was her answer
31:15
no i was looking at because poopy the
31:18
ambassador is a nutritionist right
31:20
and um and is from madagascar so i was
31:23
looking at some
31:24
malagasy nutrition stuff and so
31:27
there are some groups in madagascar that
31:30
will
31:30
circumcision is a thing in some tribes
31:32
and some of them eat the foreskin
31:36
but also i was reading a oh
31:39
sorry i didn't i got that three seconds
31:41
after everyone else in the room
31:43
is that weird though i don't think
31:44
that's weird you don't think that's
31:45
weird
31:47
in malay in madagascar this is a thing
31:50
um
31:53
and uh there was a journalist went to
31:55
madagascar and traveled around it
31:57
a few years ago and it's it's
31:59
specifically in certain regions so it's
32:00
in the
32:01
antambra hawaka region and where they
32:04
eat the foreskin and
32:05
traditionally it you get circumcised and
32:08
then it's given to the grandfather
32:10
who then can either eat it or offer it
32:12
to a very honored guest
32:17
journalist
32:18
[Laughter]
32:22
they've got a little bit soft in the bag
32:26
but anyway it's pretty awkward if you're
32:29
a guest in
32:30
specific madagascar areas of madagascar
32:33
uh then just look out for being offered
32:34
foreskin and it is polite to accept it
32:40
wow
32:42
there was another person who was
32:43
interviewed from a different tribe
32:46
uh who said we actually think that's
32:48
weird this is something from that
32:52
this is someone from the saca lava tribe
32:54
this is a different anthropologist
32:56
who went there and he said we think
32:57
that's weird it's only the guys in the
32:58
mountains in the middle who do that
32:59
no we put the foreskin into a firework
33:01
and send it into the
33:03
[Laughter]
33:09
all sky should we move on to our final
33:11
facts yes please okay
33:14
it's time for our final fact of the show
33:16
and that is
33:17
chozinski yes my fact this week is that
33:20
the first ever
33:21
sports bra was two jock straps
33:26
yeah this is i actually heard this on
33:28
another podcast
33:29
i don't know if you're allowed to just
33:30
like trans migrate a fax
33:32
from one but i've heard it on 99
33:34
invisible which i assume a lot of you
33:36
listen to and if you don't you should
33:37
but this
33:38
is it was invented by someone called
33:39
lisa lindall in 1970s 1977
33:43
and she it was when jogging became a
33:45
really fashionable thing to do and
33:47
specifically for women to do
33:48
and there was an issue because sports
33:50
bras didn't exist
33:52
and there were various issues and she
33:55
was in her sitting room one day and she
33:57
was saying what are we going to do about
33:58
the fact that every time we go running
33:59
there's all this rubbing
34:01
and it hurts and it just doesn't work
34:03
for us and then her husband
34:05
started parading around their sitting
34:07
room with his jock strap on his chest
34:09
saying you should try one of these guys
34:10
they work really well
34:11
and she actually thought yeah what a
34:13
great plan and she got a friend to sew
34:15
together
34:16
two jock straps which if i had to remind
34:19
myself what a jock strap was
34:20
but it's like it's like tight why fronts
34:23
for men who are playing sports right
34:24
yeah yeah cool um and she said
34:28
she's a very sparty panel i'm just be
34:30
sad
34:32
we need to wrap up soon actually because
34:33
we're going to hit the gym
34:36
hey don't laugh so hard guys
34:40
but it's so these ladies um lisa lindell
34:43
and also polly smith who did
34:44
her designing they get all the credit
34:46
but surely the credit should go to her
34:48
husband who was prancing around his
34:50
front room
34:51
good point james behind every great
34:53
woman is a great owner
34:56
there's an unbelievably childish man
34:58
dancing around this front room
35:00
i didn't mean that by the way that was
35:03
crazy as a joke they called it the jock
35:04
bra
35:05
and then that got changed into the jog
35:07
bra
35:08
which got changed into the sports bra
35:12
and who knows what that will become next
35:15
but you know someone else who is
35:16
responsible for inventing it uh so
35:18
so the what she did lisa was she sewed
35:21
these two or she got her assistant polly
35:22
to sew these two jock straps together
35:24
and she ran around with it and it worked
35:26
but uh the person who helped with the
35:28
sewing was someone called hindu
35:29
schreiber
35:30
no yeah your surname so a distant
35:33
relation of yours helped invent the
35:34
sports bra
35:35
cool not that distant though because
35:36
it's unbelievably recent right
35:38
people are always surprised that the
35:40
person who invented it is still alive
35:41
and still doing interviews and stuff
35:42
you're right it's so weird
35:44
that it was literally 40 years ago she
35:46
has a whole section on her website about
35:48
i invented the sports bra well i would
35:51
have thought that would be the main bit
35:52
now yeah no
35:53
no she does loads of other stuff because
35:54
she she's not a you know one-trick pony
35:56
she now does loads of other stuff
35:58
like well i didn't you know
36:00
[Music]
36:03
there's only so much reading time in the
36:05
day
36:06
i didn't read the whole thing um she's
36:09
an artist i think as well
36:10
does motivational speaking possibly i
36:12
would think so yeah
36:15
i heard that there was possibly a
36:17
slightly earlier one
36:19
called the free swing tennis bra yes
36:22
that was a rival and that was a couple
36:24
of years earlier was specifically for
36:25
tennis and
36:26
it was not so this wasn't really a
36:28
sports bra that wasn't it was just a bra
36:30
yeah i was just saying you can play
36:31
sports in this if you want yeah okay
36:33
this was a specific kind of holding you
36:36
in kind of thing right held you in
36:37
strapped you down and also had
36:38
thick straps because the rubbing but
36:40
there were a few patents much earlier on
36:43
this is the first commercial one but
36:44
actually in 1909
36:46
a breast supporter was patiented by
36:48
someone called madeline gabo
36:49
and that was actually the first thing
36:51
that separated the breasts because
36:54
breasts were thought of as one entity i
36:56
remember researching this for qi once
36:58
the bosom was what the word you would
36:59
use to refer to yourself yeah it's a
37:00
singular but
37:01
it was singular they were just one just
37:04
one
37:04
rectangular thing
37:09
yeah they were a different shape then
37:12
yeah but that was that was popular until
37:15
uh for very late the mono boob basically
37:20
there was no lift and separate that was
37:22
just the shelf
37:23
yeah the mono boob until the 20th
37:26
century basically was the weight again
37:28
and that's why the french phrase for a
37:29
woman having a large bosom is ilia monde
37:32
du balcon
37:32
there is a crowd on the balcony
37:36
[Laughter]
37:40
is it still though i don't think it's
37:42
very is there any french people in
37:44
that's not in use now is it no we know
37:46
what it is no sorry i mean you should
37:47
use it it's a
37:48
it's a lovely metaphor yeah it applies
37:51
also to a royal wedding for example
37:54
yeah there's there's a lot of amazing
37:58
bras out there now like in japan they
38:00
have a few which
38:01
are sort of very technologically
38:03
advanced um there's one called the
38:04
uplifting bra
38:06
and the uplifting bra basically plays
38:08
you sort of motivational
38:10
conversation so it will monitor your
38:14
heart rate and if it feels your heart
38:15
rate going up
38:16
it might sense that you're scared and
38:18
your bra would be like you got this
38:19
you don't need to you don't need to
38:21
freak out
38:23
you are going to own this and it's just
38:25
messages that come
38:26
out from someone's t-shirt
38:30
do they have this for pants as well i
38:33
don't know
38:36
just asking for a friend
38:39
just calm down you've got all the time
38:41
in the world
38:46
[Applause]
38:50
oh that's a shave
39:00
there's another japanese bra that's also
39:02
quite exciting which measures your heart
39:04
rate but this is the true love bra
39:06
oh yeah and um this will only spring
39:08
open
39:09
if you are truly in love with the person
39:12
who's trying to take it off and by truly
39:14
enough they mean if your heart rate uh
39:16
does the stuff that they've
39:17
made sure the heart rate does so what
39:18
goes on what if you're jogging well
39:21
that does feel like one of the major
39:23
flaws of this bra doesn't happen
39:25
loads of things make your heart rather
39:27
like if you're on a roller coaster
39:29
yeah or if you're really anxious about
39:31
the fact that your bra might pop open
39:37
i'm with you some kinks need ironing out
39:39
but that guy's a thing it measures your
39:41
heart it sends it to an iphone which
39:42
analyzes your heart rate and tells if
39:44
you're in love with someone based on how
39:45
fast your heart's beating which is not
39:47
a super foolproof method and then
39:49
springs open
39:50
there's another bar in japan which is in
39:52
its translation called marriage hunt
39:55
and the the bra comes down with a
39:57
countdown clock
39:59
on your bra which is set by the wearer
40:01
of the bra so they go oh what do you
40:02
mean by count that
40:03
i want to be married game show countdown
40:07
no it's so you go i want to be married
40:09
exactly a year from now i want to meet
40:11
the right person and i want to be
40:12
married a year from now so you set on
40:15
your bra the uh
40:16
doesn't that look like you're wearing a
40:17
bomb
40:19
i know it's again like anna said about
40:23
the previous one there's a few kinks to
40:24
sort out
40:25
if this woman doesn't get married in 20
40:27
minutes she's going to explode
40:30
have you heard of mary phelps jacobs
40:33
yeah she is the person who supposedly
40:35
invented well she patented an early
40:36
version of it exactly in
40:38
1914. i know there were versions of it
40:40
before then um but
40:42
she uh she was a young woman she was
40:43
quite a wealthy young woman she was uh
40:45
going to a dance and she didn't want to
40:46
wear a corset
40:47
because it's very you know it's hard to
40:49
move it's how to dance um but she
40:51
had the most incredible life so we
40:53
featured her on the podcast a few weeks
40:55
ago
40:55
an audience remember one effect by
40:57
saying that the woman who invented the
40:59
bra
40:59
had a whippet called clitoris and she
41:02
did
41:03
but she was the most incredible woman so
41:05
she changed her name to caress crosby
41:08
and she nearly named herself clitoris
41:09
crosby but then she said no that's for
41:11
the dog
41:13
and then and she sold her patent for not
41:15
very much money but then she moved to
41:16
paris
41:17
and became a publisher she and her
41:19
husband harry had this incredible
41:21
publishing life they published everyone
41:23
d.h lawrence and and charles bukowski
41:25
and lewis carroll but they also
41:27
had these raucous uh sex and drug-fueled
41:30
parties
41:31
in an abandoned mill um which they owned
41:34
and they had a they they bought their
41:36
own tombstones
41:37
and then they kept them on the roof of
41:39
their block of flats and sunbathed naked
41:40
on them
41:41
they just had this incredible life sexy
41:44
yeah
41:44
um but the thing is about them she sold
41:47
the patent like you say for not much
41:48
money
41:48
it was a husband's idea he got fed up
41:50
with the whole thing and said oh you
41:52
should just sell the patent
41:53
and she did sell it she sold it for
41:55
fifteen hundred dollars
41:57
and she did this in around 1915 1916
42:00
and then america joined the war in 1917
42:04
and corsets were banned because they had
42:06
so much wire in them
42:07
and suddenly brass became massive
42:14
but braz became really really really
42:16
popular and so she missed out by only a
42:18
couple of years on making billions from
42:19
them
42:20
wait and presumably why they needed why
42:22
they needed the metal for the war effort
42:23
yes yes i read that they got two
42:25
battleships out of
42:26
the steel they saved yeah there's enough
42:28
to build two battleships
42:30
oh wow the fact about rubber pants in
42:32
the sec the first world war
42:34
oh yeah people used to have a rubber
42:36
diet and the rubber diet was not an
42:38
actual food diet it was just to wear
42:39
rubber knickers and rubber corsets which
42:40
would
42:41
rub against you and make you sweat and
42:42
then you would lose weight oh yeah
42:44
it didn't work and it just it flayed
42:46
your flesh but
42:48
that's like now people would put like um
42:50
cling film around them weren't they yeah
42:52
the cling film diet we've all done it
42:54
we've all yeah
42:55
but don't i think boxers do that don't
42:57
they they wrap themselves in cling film
42:59
and then they
42:59
exercise they lose more weight through
43:01
water jockeys too don't yeah
43:02
um yeah you're right but they they
43:05
didn't work and also
43:06
it doesn't work because all you lose is
43:08
water and then as soon as you drink some
43:09
water it goes back into you so it's very
43:11
short-term
43:12
um but then the first world war broke
43:13
out and all the rubber was needed
43:15
for the war hmm yeah so bouncy bouncy
43:19
one
43:23
what do you think
43:32
[Laughter]
43:35
just speaking of uh boxers and fighting
43:37
there's been an innovation off the back
43:38
of someone watching
43:40
um an mma fight uh that sort of conor
43:42
mcgregor style fighting uh that goes on
43:45
um and someone lost a match after being
43:47
kicked in the testicles
43:48
and he thought ah i wonder why that jock
43:50
strap didn't protect him more so he's
43:52
invented now a bulletproof
43:55
job scrap which is on the market it's
43:58
called nutshells
43:59
and and nutshells can withstand
44:02
a bullet being fired at your groin um i
44:05
mean who does those tests
44:07
yeah i'm pretty sure that the inventor
44:10
who's called robert did do that um and
44:13
um so
44:13
the idea is it can be used for sports
44:15
because if you're playing baseball and a
44:16
fastball comes or a tennis serve comes
44:19
or okay or someone's trying a bullet at
44:21
you at a
44:22
i mean an incredibly well aimed bullet
44:25
yes yeah
44:26
but but i mean it's now it's been picked
44:28
up by the military people
44:30
[Laughter]
44:33
they need to be a pretty sharp shooter
44:35
to hit you
44:43
why does the military need that
44:44
technology it doesn't it has bulletproof
44:46
technology
44:47
it doesn't need a different kind of
44:48
bulletproof for your penis it's just the
44:50
same
44:51
kind of bulletproof you try surrounding
44:52
the penis with 30 or 40 layers of
44:54
toughened glass
44:57
i think imelda marcos had a bulletproof
44:59
bra didn't she
45:00
did she think she yeah made out of
45:02
kevlar right but yeah she did cool wow
45:05
the the jock strap is as you mentioned
45:08
it is from it's from jockey but it was
45:11
invented
45:12
for bicycle jockeys so this is in the in
45:15
the
45:16
1880s i thought like american jocks like
45:19
just a no the word jock comes from
45:21
jockstrap um
45:23
so it was invented for cyclists in
45:25
boston in the 1880s because
45:28
they were called jockeys and they
45:30
deliver stuff and they were cobbled
45:31
streets and so it was quite painful to
45:33
cycle over the cobbled streets and so
45:34
the jock strap was invented for that
45:37
and that's where the job comes from it's
45:39
a sporty thing now
45:40
but at the start it was invented to stop
45:42
your bulls bumping over cobbles
45:46
wow um guys we need to wrap up very
45:48
shortly oh yeah
45:49
um so the thing with braz is everyone
45:52
thought they were invented about 100
45:53
years ago
45:54
but they found some really old ones from
45:55
the middle ages
45:57
and they were found in a castle in
46:00
austria
46:01
by a scientist or an archaeologist
46:03
called beatrix nuts
46:04
from the university of innsbruck uh and
46:06
she's found out basically that what
46:08
happened was the bra came first
46:10
and then the corset took over and then
46:11
the bra came back again
46:13
which no one believed until 2012 when
46:15
she found this
46:16
wow and at the same time they found um
46:18
what looks like a pair of panties
46:20
is kind of like a gusset and just some
46:23
kind of string going round
46:24
but they turn out to be men's underwear
46:26
because women didn't wear underwear
46:28
at that time and according to beatrice
46:30
underpants were considered a symbol of
46:32
male dominance and power
46:35
oh really well because even when women
46:38
started wearing underpants in victorian
46:39
times
46:40
they were crotchless and i read one
46:42
historian said they were crotchless in
46:44
order to distinguish them from men's
46:46
underpants
46:48
[Laughter]
46:52
labels name labels of the way yeah
46:56
or you know the men's ones are the ones
46:58
which constantly matter things like
46:59
you're doing fine really
47:06
okay that's it that is all of our facts
47:09
thank you so much for listening if you'd

00:13
[Music]
00:15
hello
00:16
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish
00:20
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:22
from leicester
00:30
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:33
sitting here
00:34
with anna chazinski andrew hunter murray
00:37
and james harkin and
00:38
once again we have gathered around the
00:40
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:42
from the last seven days
00:43
and in no particular order here we go
00:46
starting with you
00:47
shizinsky my fact this week is that
00:50
walker's crisps only source potatoes
00:53
that are grown
00:54
far away from golf courses because their
00:56
factory machines can't distinguish
00:58
between golf balls
00:59
and potatoes
01:00
[Laughter]
01:05
that's amazing it's true um so this is
01:08
a walker's crisp factory in in leicester
01:11
obviously and
01:13
yeah well done guys a very good
01:15
contribution to the country i would say
01:18
and yeah its factory has this density
01:20
based sorting system so
01:21
what it is is all the potatoes come in
01:23
and the
01:25
machine automatically knows the stuff
01:27
that has the right density to be a
01:28
potato that can be turned into a crisp
01:30
but it just turns out that the density
01:32
of golf balls
01:33
is exactly the same and so it used to be
01:36
that there'd be a lot of golf courses
01:37
next to the fields where
01:38
farmers are growing their potatoes which
01:40
would then be shipped to walkers and
01:42
lots of people got like hard bits of
01:44
golf ball in their crisp packets so
01:46
would you sort of
01:46
you'd be on the green about to take your
01:48
shot and a walker's machine would just
01:50
nab your golf ball and whisk it off to a
01:53
factory
01:54
i didn't read the details of it but i
01:55
would assume it's more likely that you'd
01:57
take your shot it would go
01:59
over into the field as you're a girl for
02:01
james sometimes you miss hit things
02:03
right not you just
02:04
very very occasionally every single time
02:06
i ever play yeah yeah
02:08
and then i get scooped up by the
02:10
tractors but i wouldn't have thought i'd
02:11
be able to replace my golf ball with a
02:13
potato for instance
02:14
i know it's weird isn't it it doesn't
02:16
feel like they're the same density
02:18
i'll give it a go and so was this a
02:20
problem were there were there people
02:22
sending packets back going i expected
02:24
salt and vinegar crisps and i got
02:27
a golf ball like was that has that ever
02:29
been a thing people did mention it
02:31
and mentioned that they had hard crisps
02:32
but if you're interested each golf ball
02:34
yields 18
02:35
crisps
02:39
that's incredible the factory is really
02:41
cool isn't it
02:42
yeah so the one of the things i really
02:44
like about it is um
02:46
basically a crisp goes from being a
02:47
potato to being in a bag in 20 minutes
02:51
wow which is extremely fast i think and
02:53
there's a man at the end of the whole
02:54
potato line
02:56
who just said he's the potato overlord
02:58
and he just looks at the potatoes and he
03:00
said they're all good they're all good
03:01
they're good that one's bad
03:03
yeah it doesn't sound quite as exciting
03:05
as you just made it look though
03:07
because i think maybe you read the same
03:08
article as i did in the leicester
03:10
mercury
03:13
wow another great contribution to the
03:15
country
03:17
they said about this guy who's checking
03:19
that um actual potatoes go through they
03:21
said
03:21
he looks unsurprisingly utterly bored
03:28
the worst thing is they probably got
03:30
permission from walkers to go in and
03:31
said oh we'll write it up really nicely
03:33
they say look utterly bored this is
03:36
surely
03:37
the worst job in the whole building
03:40
whoa in the whole building though maybe
03:42
everyone else is a crisp taster
03:44
except that one guy there are crisp
03:46
tasters aren't there
03:47
yeah you have to be a super taster if
03:50
you want to be a crisp taster
03:51
and when you're doing it you're not
03:53
allowed to drink tea or coffee
03:55
because it will interfere with your
03:56
palate and they have to have 20-minute
03:59
breaks between between
04:00
tests where all they eat is fruit and
04:03
they make it so that you're only allowed
04:04
a certain number of crisps every day so
04:06
you don't go over your salt limit for
04:07
the day as well
04:10
it doesn't sound quite as cool does it
04:11
no it doesn't i mean it's better than
04:12
the guy just looking at potatoes
04:15
but what use is that crisp once the
04:17
guy's eating it
04:18
no no no they don't
04:21
retrieve it afterwards all right you
04:23
have the assistant vomiter and i think
04:25
actually that's the worst job
04:26
and they shove their fingers down his
04:28
throat and they get the crisp back
04:30
it's just for like the general batch
04:31
it's like a sample
04:33
that i mean you should have said that
04:35
because that makes sense you left
04:37
you left us all hanging thinking i i
04:39
think when you say ozal
04:41
i think my feeling is that the people of
04:43
leicester got that
04:45
i'll talk about me and the voices in my
04:47
head
04:48
i think you said that because you've
04:49
seen wine tasters and you've seen them
04:51
taste the wine then spit it out again
04:53
yeah like they do don't they and did you
04:54
assume that other people then drunk
04:56
that spot out splat out one yeah
04:59
[Laughter]
05:01
i have a fact about the the leicester
05:03
walkers factory they aim to extract
05:05
so much water from the potatoes that
05:07
they don't need any water
05:09
because potatoes are 80 water okay so
05:12
when the potato slices get sliced up and
05:14
then they get boiled
05:15
all the steam comes off and they
05:16
condense it and get water from that that
05:18
they use
05:19
for the process of running their
05:20
building well they also use water to
05:22
peel the potatoes don't they they fire
05:24
it at it so it must be there
05:25
yeah yeah so basically what i'm saying
05:27
is in the event of a
05:28
catastrophe this is probably the safest
05:30
place to be on the planet
05:32
you've got self-sufficient supplies of
05:33
water and potatoes
05:35
yeah as long as the potatoes keep being
05:37
delivered
05:37
[Laughter]
05:40
they might relax their whole no golf
05:42
course kind of deliveries
05:44
um they also have a sort of what was
05:47
described in this amazing blog i read
05:49
and i would really recommend this blog
05:51
it was this girl who went to visit the
05:52
factory and gives a really detailed
05:54
description of her tour of it and i
05:55
can't remember what she's called or what
05:56
the blog's called
05:57
so just google and google until you find
05:59
it and
06:01
this is she described how there's sort
06:03
of a log flume for the potatoes where
06:05
they're dropped in this water
06:06
and as the potatoes go through the
06:08
factory all the starches
06:10
some of the starch comes out of it so in
06:12
various processes some of the starch
06:14
comes out
06:14
so when it goes into this log flume to
06:16
get transferred through the factory
06:17
then the starch goes into the water and
06:19
it goes a kind of milky color
06:21
um and when she was being shown round
06:23
they reassured her
06:24
they said don't worry that starch
06:25
doesn't get wasted it goes to a starch
06:27
recovery plant
06:29
which is just next door and then it gets
06:30
turned into quavers
06:32
oh that's what quavers are that's
06:35
awesome
06:36
did she work that out or did they work
06:38
that was she told that for the blog
06:40
how would you deduce how would she
06:41
[Laughter]
06:44
would she have followed a secret door
06:46
that said no
06:50
holy i just blown this thing wide
06:53
open
06:57
oh my god of all the things you could
07:00
work out
07:00
that really is one you have to be told
07:04
just opened a bag of quavers three weeks
07:06
later oh my god i recognize this
07:11
hey so you know how you're saying it
07:12
takes 20 minutes from
07:14
it going from the van into that's the
07:16
full potato into
07:18
a crisp packet in 20 minutes time the
07:21
amount of potatoes that they use every
07:23
single hour
07:24
if you went to the leicester tigers
07:26
stadium um
07:27
i haven't been to that but i imagine
07:29
some of you guys here have
07:30
the amount of potatoes they use in a
07:32
single hour would carpet the entire
07:34
floor
07:35
of that stadium that's how many potatoes
07:37
per hour and that's every day
07:39
that this happens so there's way more
07:41
potatoes on earth than i realized
07:43
is what i get from that that's a lot of
07:45
potatoes that would uh make the sports
07:47
matches that get played at the leicester
07:48
tiger stadium
07:49
extremely amusing
07:54
what gets played there brilliantly
08:02
um did you guys read about my favorite
08:05
part of the factory and then we can move
08:07
on from it but it's a machine called the
08:08
optisort
08:10
and this is the last machine that the
08:12
crisps are put through
08:14
and this is to check for potatoes that
08:16
might have floors in them
08:17
so there's a machine in the beginning
08:19
that looks at them to check for green
08:20
bits and shaves the green bits off but
08:21
there might still be some left
08:23
and what the optisort does is it
08:24
separates the crisps individually onto
08:26
this conveyor belt so they're one layer
08:28
thick
08:29
and then they get hurled like catapulted
08:31
really fast
08:32
at three meters per second past this
08:35
camera
08:36
really high speed camera that checks the
08:38
floors and if the camera sees
08:39
any kind of little speck of green or any
08:41
speck of black or something
08:43
then the crisp flies over a gap uh
08:46
still going really fast a 10 centimetre
08:47
wide gap and if it's a dodgy one then
08:50
there's a swift puff of air
08:51
that blows down through the gap and
08:53
dismisses it from the production line
08:55
whoa why cool yeah but why all the drama
08:57
of the speed
08:58
and the tight cause you've just got to
09:00
be incredibly quick because you've got
09:01
to make so many bloody crisps
09:04
that's actually the motto of walkers
09:05
chris we've got to make so many bloody
09:07
crisps
09:07
[Laughter]
09:11
i suppose you think it's easy you
09:12
bastards at kettle hand manufacturing
09:14
everyone
09:15
we've got a proper company to run here
09:23
we should move on we need to move on i
09:24
have so much stuff on golf oh no we
09:26
don't have time
09:27
we don't have time um why aren't you
09:29
trying crowbar or golf oh yeah i'll just
09:31
go
09:31
back into one of these just wait for
09:32
that later yeah um
09:34
okay it's time for fact number two and
09:36
that is james
09:37
okay my fact is about golf
09:42
it's not i could make it about gold
09:46
that would really screw up the podcast
09:48
wouldn't it yeah okay no it's not about
09:50
golf
09:51
my fact this week is that during world
09:52
war one truces would occasionally be
09:55
called in the trenches
09:56
so both sides could yell insults at one
09:59
another
10:02
so good that is really cool yeah so this
10:05
is the diaries of a guy called sapper
10:06
french
10:07
uh sappo is his nickname and he said in
10:09
one of his diaries and this has been
10:11
quite recently found
10:12
i saw a rather curious thing in the
10:14
trenches this morning
10:15
heard some shouting and laughing and saw
10:17
a german leaning over the parapet and
10:20
shouting across to our men
10:21
the distance was about 75 yards one of
10:24
our men shouted
10:25
come on over fritz fritz sheltered back
10:28
in perfect english
10:29
no blooming fear in fact they could all
10:31
speak good english
10:32
this went on for half an hour and then
10:35
all the heads went down
10:36
and the wall went on the same as usual
10:39
wow that's pretty cool isn't it they
10:40
just thought oh let's just do a bit of
10:42
insults and then we'll
10:43
carry on shooting it's amazing a lot of
10:45
german people who'd been
10:46
in britain before the war had been
10:48
waiters and there was one instance which
10:50
was a bit of a nicer instance of how
10:52
they used to actually tr chat between
10:54
the trenches when they weren't actually
10:55
at war
10:56
and someone recorded how one englishman
10:59
had shouted
11:00
guten morgen at dawn presumably the only
11:02
two words he knew
11:03
and then uh the other the german guy on
11:06
the other side
11:06
had responded and said hello in english
11:09
and then they started exchanging some
11:10
kind of fun
11:11
insults and they'd ended by saying the
11:13
english guy said
11:14
waiter and the german guy said coming
11:16
sir so
11:19
the war so nearly tipped over into
11:21
banter and it would
11:23
we could have avoided hundreds of
11:24
thousands of deaths yeah
11:26
yeah the trenches were really
11:27
interesting because the british ones
11:29
were made as if it was going to be quite
11:30
temporary that's what they thought
11:32
and the germans thought we might be here
11:34
for a while
11:35
and so their trenches they had doorbells
11:38
no yep they had staircases electric
11:41
lights steel
11:42
doors real kitchens and wallpaper
11:44
wallpaper
11:46
no paper on the trenches yeah the
11:48
doorbell is an especially impressive
11:49
thing because obviously when the british
11:51
go over the top and arrive they'll have
11:52
to wait after ringing the doorbell
11:55
very clever but they were i
11:58
just recently read all quiet on the
11:59
western front which is an uplifting read
12:01
if you haven't been there yet but about
12:04
the first world war and the constant
12:05
chat
12:06
among the german troops was how their
12:08
stuff was better than
12:10
the allies that's cool and there's um
12:12
there's kind of a history of
12:13
yelling and shouting and was um the
12:16
georgian hero tariel
12:18
was apparently able to drop opposing
12:20
warriors using only the force of his
12:22
mighty war cry
12:24
okay and in welsh mythology their hero
12:27
cult hook
12:28
he was said to be able to give a battle
12:29
cry so loud and violent
12:31
that all women in the courts will become
12:33
sterile
12:34
[Music]
12:36
whoa he must have been a really popular
12:38
guy at parties huh yeah
12:40
i thought you were i was wondering where
12:42
you were going i thought you were going
12:43
to say
12:44
pregnant no it sounds like it would be
12:46
that doesn't yeah
12:47
exactly the opposite actually yes
12:49
[Laughter]
12:51
yes a sobering thought
12:56
i have another fact about um life in the
12:58
trenches okay and sort of
13:00
agreements between the two sides in the
13:01
trenches um so there was a guy in the
13:03
first world war british officer
13:05
captain robert campbell he got captured
13:07
by the germans i think after the battle
13:09
of mons
13:10
and um after nearly two years imprisoned
13:14
um in a german prisoner of war camp he
13:16
heard his mother was dying and he wrote
13:17
to the kaiser
13:18
you know asking to be released to go and
13:20
be with his dying mother incredibly
13:22
the request was granted he was given two
13:25
weeks leave
13:25
from a prisoner of war camp on the
13:27
german side to go back to england
13:30
visit his mother on the understanding
13:31
that he would then go back and go to
13:33
prison again
13:34
and he did he went he visited his mother
13:38
he spent time with her
13:39
in the last days of her life and he then
13:41
honored the agreement and returned
13:43
and he and then the next day is like oh
13:45
my dad's sick now
13:48
and that's the is the only time that
13:50
happened in the whole of the war
13:51
well because didn't the allies then um
13:54
so there was a german prisoner of war
13:56
with the allies who tried it i think
13:58
because that had happened oh really
13:59
and the allies did not let him go and
14:02
then
14:02
they said no we didn't trust you and so
14:04
then it was clamped down on so yeah
14:05
kidding
14:06
the only one wow it's so weird though i
14:08
think these insults
14:09
mean a lot to military when they're
14:11
doing it to each other because it still
14:12
goes on to this day
14:14
and a few years back there was a big
14:16
moment between
14:17
north korea and the americans the north
14:20
korean soldiers were
14:21
seeing american soldiers uh point you
14:24
know
14:24
point at them make strange noises they
14:26
were pulling disgusting facial
14:28
expressions at them
14:29
and this was their big problem with them
14:30
and the americans said we wouldn't do
14:32
this
14:32
and this is how important that is in the
14:34
follow-up bit to the statement of them
14:36
going they're pulling faces at us
14:37
they're making you know they're pointing
14:38
us
14:38
really weirdly they said oh also they're
14:41
aiming their guns at us
14:43
that's like the second thing on the list
14:46
and then just to prove how childish it
14:48
is the statement warned
14:50
u.s troops to stop the hooliganism or
14:53
face dog's death anytime anyplace
14:58
like it's just it's all it is it's like
15:00
banter wars isn't it
15:01
that reminds me of is it in that book or
15:03
did we cut it um in bhutan
15:06
in bhutan there was um a battle it
15:08
wasn't a battle it was an argument
15:10
between
15:10
india and china and they went kind of
15:13
arguing over this tiny bit of bhutan
15:15
and if they went to war it would have
15:17
been something like a quarter of the
15:18
world's population would have gone to
15:19
war
15:20
and they all went to this tiny bit of
15:22
bhutan but they decided they
15:23
none of one really wanted to have a war
15:26
and so no one brought any weapons
15:28
and you can see videos of it and it's
15:29
just basically some chinese soldiers and
15:31
some indian soldiers kind of just
15:33
chest bumping each other yeah yeah it's
15:36
incredible yeah it's literally it's a
15:38
whole line of army members just
15:40
not fighting but sort of just doubling
15:42
yeah yeah
15:44
in leicester
15:47
is that what it's like here you don't
15:50
know just go home and have a nice pack
15:52
of crisps
15:55
um there was a lot of friendliness
15:56
there's a really good book about world
15:58
of one called meeting the enemy the
16:00
human face of the great war
16:01
and even more friendly than that there
16:03
was one instance where brits arrived at
16:05
the somme
16:06
and they were expected they were like
16:07
you know we're fighting the enemy you
16:09
know
16:09
all geared up for a massive battle and
16:11
they arrived and they just found
16:13
on a bit of barbed wire a note and it
16:15
was from the german saying
16:16
why don't you send two or three of your
16:17
guys with some stuff you want to trade
16:19
and we'll send two or three of ours and
16:20
we'll swap presents
16:21
and they met up in the middle of no
16:23
man's land that first day and they
16:24
exchanged kind of magazines and
16:26
souvenirs and periodicals that they
16:28
wanted to read
16:29
and it's amazing having a book club in
16:31
the middle of a total war it really is
16:33
it's so impressive so and we haven't
16:35
even mentioned the christmas truce
16:37
which was a big thing a sporadic thing
16:39
along a lot of the western front
16:41
so i didn't know though it stretched not
16:43
only in the army it stretched to the
16:45
other services as well
16:46
so on christmas eve 1914 the royal
16:49
flying corps
16:50
flew over a german airfield at lille and
16:52
they dropped
16:53
on the runway a plum pudding and then
16:56
and then on christmas day the german air
16:58
force
16:58
flew over a british airfield and they
16:59
dropped a bottle of rum to say thank you
17:01
at the christmas trees there was one
17:03
really lovely moment a lot of germans
17:05
had been living in the uk before the war
17:07
and during the christmas truce they all
17:09
went up into no man's land and one of
17:10
the english guys realized that one of
17:12
the german guys was his barber
17:13
who used to cut his hair in hoban and he
17:15
said i need a haircut
17:16
and so his hobe and barber cut his hair
17:18
for him i mean that's very trusting
17:21
[Laughter]
17:23
do you know who didn't take part he was
17:25
an absolute killjoy at the christmas
17:26
truce actually
17:27
was it the senior officers or the yeah
17:30
they didn't but in particular
17:31
one soldier on the german side you might
17:33
be able to guess who it was
17:34
oh i can guess yeah is it the most
17:36
famous one it's the most famous one
17:38
hitler he absolutely was not a fan hated
17:40
the christmas truce yeah refused to take
17:42
part he sat in a strop
17:44
on his own and just said really
17:46
disapproving things like you guys have
17:47
no sense of honor and this isn't what we
17:49
should be doing in wartime
17:50
classic hitler
17:55
hey um we should move on to our next
17:57
fact right um okay
17:59
it is time for fact number three and
18:02
that is
18:02
my fact my fact this week is this and i
18:05
i find this so interesting
18:07
14 of all california's firefighters
18:10
are in prison is that
18:16
who are in prison women who are in
18:17
prison and they say would you like to
18:18
sign up for this
18:19
and we'll relocate you to a program
18:21
whereby you'll be a firefighter but
18:23
under the confines but you won't be in
18:25
actual prison
18:26
and lots and lots of women have signed
18:28
up to it so as a result
18:30
14 of their whole firefighting force are
18:32
prisoners who are serving time
18:34
and then when they're needed they go and
18:36
they go and either fight fires or
18:39
they clear paths where fires might
18:40
happen and
18:42
yeah i think it i mean it's women and
18:43
men isn't it
18:45
at one point it was forty percent it was
18:47
third supporting but i think
18:48
yeah no it's both lots of men and i
18:51
don't think they
18:52
get to do the super fun stuff like the
18:54
hosing they do a lot more
18:56
clearing like you said yeah some of them
18:58
do get chainsaws
19:00
ooh yeah and because obviously you need
19:01
to clear a path in in forest
19:03
you're going to need a chainsaw to do it
19:05
yeah so yeah and they get they get paid
19:07
something like
19:08
a dollar an hour in america but the
19:11
exchange of it is that they're not in a
19:12
classic
19:13
prison system they get to and they get
19:15
days off their sentence
19:17
every time they serve for what they're
19:19
what they're doing with their job as a
19:20
firefighter but it's only a dollar an
19:22
hour when you're actively fighting a
19:23
fire
19:24
if normally you get paid about a dollar
19:27
a day
19:27
but i think there is a certain economy
19:29
in prisons isn't there and you know
19:31
there's a lot of trading that goes on
19:32
and did you know that they have their
19:33
own shopping catalogues well in prison
19:36
yeah so there are immigrant shopping
19:37
catalogs at least in america so
19:40
gizmodo the really great website did a
19:42
series of articles called lockdown
19:44
and interviewed this guy who said that
19:47
they have a shopping catalog of approved
19:49
items so it's anything that you want
19:51
really from tvs to toothbrushes or
19:53
whatever
19:54
and what happens is you can pick what
19:55
you want and you take it out the small
19:57
pay that you might have got in prison or
19:59
your family can buy it
20:00
and then it gets delivered and then it
20:02
gets engraved so you get automatically
20:04
engraved items because otherwise all the
20:05
other prisoners have also got
20:07
the same stuff and so you need to know
20:08
that it's yours and actually weirdly
20:10
in the youtube clip i was watching of
20:13
the guy being interviewed
20:14
he was saying and this is some of the
20:15
stuff the prisoners have ordered this
20:16
week and he was opening packages
20:18
and he opened up a dvd of the series
20:21
richie rich
20:22
season two wait wait wait wait wait wait
20:24
wait wait
20:25
um i only know richie rich as a film i
20:28
did too until i had to look into this
20:30
are you saying they've made a tv series
20:31
of richie rich yeah it's the same uh
20:33
the same general thesis oh sure
20:37
that is fantastic well i get i mean you
20:39
hid a fact within a fact there
20:41
it gets something like 22 on rotten
20:43
tomatoes but you could certainly give it
20:45
a go
20:47
but so the thing that really amazed me
20:48
about this fact was um
20:50
a that's an amazing percentage uh that
20:53
are there in prison that are working for
20:54
the firefighters
20:55
but b i thought that firefighting was
20:57
largely about fighting fires
20:59
and it turns out that it's not it turns
21:01
out that most of the time that
21:03
firefighters spent is doing
21:05
tasks that the public call for them to
21:07
do and there was a report from the uk
21:09
from a few years ago
21:10
that said we need to stop responding to
21:12
these weird calls that we're getting
21:14
because that we just keep wasting our
21:16
time between 2009 and 2011 these are the
21:19
stats
21:20
1 613 incidents where people were locked
21:23
out
21:23
where firefighters had to go and let
21:26
them back in
21:27
um 276 adults called firefighters out
21:30
because they were locked in toilets
21:32
14 people were locked in cupboards
21:36
one woman was stuck in a fridge
21:40
one man was stuck in a freezer and one
21:43
person was stuck in a recycling bin
21:44
there is so many ridiculous things that
21:47
they get called out in on a day-to-day
21:49
basis
21:49
they used to shout as they ran to a fire
21:52
and this was going on as late as 1901 in
21:55
america as they went to the fire they
21:56
would shout
21:57
hi hi hi hi were they doing the ninos
22:01
themselves well
22:05
it seems that way right yeah i mean i
22:07
kind of i worked out what i thought the
22:09
tune might be it might not have been
22:11
that
22:11
okay it might have been high high i i
22:13
don't know
22:14
but when they they decided to replace
22:16
the shouting with a gong
22:18
a gong a gong and they all hated it they
22:21
were like no we like doing the higher i
22:23
think
22:24
and also when automatic fire alarms came
22:26
in they all hated that as well
22:28
and the reason being that they had
22:30
lookouts um who would look out for the
22:32
fire and as soon as the automatic fire
22:34
alarms came in
22:34
those guys lost their job it's the
22:36
robots taking over the jobs isn't it
22:38
that was the start of it it is pretty
22:39
much and so then the firemen started
22:41
doing
22:42
fire alarm pranks to set off these
22:44
firelands no
22:45
yeah did they oh but that's the thing
22:48
there used to be
22:49
loads of um rival gangs of firefighters
22:52
and there's a scene in new york where
22:53
all the firefighters
22:54
get in the scrap outside of fire because
22:55
they all want to be the ones to
22:57
um solve the fire
23:00
so you know in japan firefighters um
23:02
they bring water pumps to
23:04
the um fire but they don't aim the water
23:06
at the fire they made it themselves
23:08
what oh yeah so they wet themselves down
23:11
so they're not flammable
23:12
and then they wrap this was in the edo
23:14
period in the 17th century oh right
23:16
not now and so they would
23:19
wet themselves down they'd run into the
23:21
house and then they pulled the house
23:22
down
23:23
and that's how they stopped the fires
23:24
and they used to smother them didn't
23:26
they so they had deliberately very very
23:28
thick clothes that would weigh
23:29
you know as much as a person when they
23:30
were wet and they would go up to a fire
23:33
and just smother it they'd go up towards
23:35
them they would just jump on it
23:36
basically
23:37
they would they would be able to get
23:38
close enough that they could cover it up
23:40
but amazingly they were positions of
23:43
real
23:43
um respect in japan in the edo period so
23:46
up until 1868
23:47
and they used to wear outfits that
23:50
looked like normal fireman's outfits on
23:52
the outside so they were quite plain
23:53
but then on the inside of their suits
23:56
they had
23:57
unbelievable works of art stitched
23:58
throughout them and they had like
23:59
stories and everything it was kind of
24:01
like
24:01
manga that kind of style and they became
24:04
really famous and if they were
24:05
successful and they put out a fire
24:07
they all turned their coats inside out
24:09
and they paraded through the streets
24:10
victoriously
24:11
wow and they often had their bodies
24:13
tattooed with the designs on their coats
24:15
because you know it was such a mark of
24:17
you know something
24:18
special and yeah they were and also the
24:20
stories that were told on the inside of
24:22
their jackets became best sellers in
24:23
japan
24:24
so the kind of cartoon strips that
24:26
firefighters had became
24:28
well-known stories that you tell your
24:29
children there was another thing which
24:30
uh speaking of covering yourself
24:32
completely in uh in water to be going
24:35
that was
24:35
in the early days one of the things with
24:37
uh firefighters breathing was very hard
24:40
and so in order to get into a fire and
24:41
keep
24:42
your own breath and not suffocate was a
24:44
hard thing so most firefighters used to
24:45
have a massive beard
24:47
the male firefighters that would go in
24:48
and what they would do is they'd drench
24:50
their beard into a bucket of water
24:52
and then they would bite into their
24:53
beard and hold it over their mouth and
24:55
that's how they would survive the fires
24:57
because they would have
24:58
this beard mask that stopped the uh the
25:01
smoke coming through
25:02
is that true that's incredible isn't it
25:04
true that the guy with the longest beard
25:06
ever
25:07
died because there was a fire and he ran
25:09
out of his house and he forgot to put
25:10
his beard in his pocket and he tripped
25:12
over it and fell down the stairs yes
25:14
she just wet it she just dipped it in
25:16
the bath before he left that doesn't
25:17
stop you tripping over it if anything it
25:19
makes it more rope-like makes it likely
25:22
um have you guys heard about the fire
25:24
fighting goats of san francisco
25:27
no but i get the feeling we're about to
25:29
sure thing san francisco has fire
25:31
fighting goats
25:32
that's great yeah great move anyway time
25:34
for fact number four
25:36
and no do you want to do you want to say
25:38
it yeah sure
25:39
um look well they're kind of pre-fire
25:41
fighting goats so they're let loose
25:43
around san francisco to eat
25:44
bits of dry scrubling that would
25:46
otherwise be a massive fire risk
25:47
that's clever but they've been
25:48
introduced and it's helped massively
25:50
with the problems
25:50
of fire breaking out in the summer
25:52
that's really clever
25:54
it's not as kind of rock and roll when
25:57
you
25:58
explain it when the girl goes home to
25:59
his wife and he's like i'm a firefighter
26:01
what did you do today darling i just ate
26:03
some more grass it was really nice
26:06
save some lives um should we move on to
26:10
our final thoughts
26:11
okay it is time for our final fact of
26:13
the show and that is
26:14
andy my fact is that meerkats can turn
26:17
their bottoms
26:18
inside out
26:18
[Laughter]
26:21
so so did they do it on purpose they do
26:24
do it on purpose
26:24
um they do it to socialize so
26:28
they've all got a party trick and it's
26:30
all turning their bottoms inside out so
26:32
they
26:32
they uh they have what's called an anal
26:34
pouch um
26:36
and it's under their tails and they
26:38
produce this kind of paste
26:39
inside it and they it's nature
26:43
you can't go it's nature um
26:46
and they smear it on plants and rocks to
26:48
mark territory as their own
26:50
and they even sometimes smear it on
26:52
other meerkats
26:55
i read that this paste comes out of them
26:57
a lot like when play-doh is extruded
26:59
from one of those doll's heads
27:02
i believe so yeah from adults from
27:04
adulthood yeah you know those things
27:06
yeah you remember it was like an old
27:08
kind of toy from there probably
27:10
you're too young i guess but you used to
27:11
have play-doh and you used to squeeze it
27:12
and then you had these little dolls and
27:14
it would come out their hair and their
27:15
hair would end up looking like oh yeah
27:16
yeah yeah yeah and scientists do squeeze
27:18
it didn't they so when they're trying to
27:20
study
27:20
the makeup of this paste that's how they
27:23
get
27:23
it when they've extruded their pouches
27:25
the scientists literally grab it and
27:26
they squeeze it and you can actually get
27:28
it out like that
27:30
yeah that i think is a worse job than
27:32
being the crisp
27:34
tester at walkers hanging outside of
27:36
meerkat's nest with a cotton bud just
27:38
waiting
27:40
but they um this came to light i think
27:42
probably andy you read this
27:44
they've done a new study about the
27:45
bacteria in meerkat bottoms
27:47
yeah and they've found that it's the
27:49
bacteria that makes up this
27:51
um the different smells which means they
27:54
can kind of
27:55
say whose anal paste it is
27:59
yeah it's so the smell comes not from
28:01
the meerkat it comes from the bacteria
28:03
but the meerkats use the bacteria to
28:05
judge
28:06
yeah what's going on so they swapped
28:08
these
28:09
anal pouches didn't they and to get the
28:11
bacteria
28:13
and i read an article in popular science
28:15
and they were talking about these guys
28:16
who were doing the swabbing
28:18
and they said these pouches are wide
28:20
open they're almost asking to be swabbed
28:22
[Laughter]
28:25
so meerkats are kind of bastards aren't
28:27
they sure yeah
28:30
they really are they've actually did a
28:32
study recently looking at the most
28:34
murderous mammals and meerkats came out
28:36
on top and they're looking at how many
28:39
of their deaths are caused by members of
28:40
their own species and with meerkats is
28:42
20
28:43
so that 20 of meerkat deaths are caused
28:46
by other mere cats
28:47
which is amazing they're always killing
28:48
each other they kill their own babies
28:50
they kill their mates babies
28:52
wow i love killing babies i read that
28:54
study as well and
28:56
it also said that sea lions are more
28:58
murderous than actual lions
29:00
oh wow that's quite a good fact isn't it
29:03
um humans are
29:04
not very murderous according to what we
29:07
should be
29:08
um apparently we should be about 200
29:10
times more murderous than we actually
29:12
are
29:13
should be according to the rules laid
29:15
out 100 million years ago yeah
29:16
pinned to a tree that's really nice that
29:19
we've we've kind of mastered our worst
29:21
instincts yeah it it kind of goes off a
29:23
few times when there's wars and
29:27
sometimes they when they're fighting
29:29
they latch on to their
29:30
enemies so i think basically the tension
29:32
in meerkat colonies is caused by the
29:34
fact that
29:35
they'll have colonies of up to 50 mega
29:36
cats and there's basically one mating
29:38
couple isn't there and no one else is
29:40
really allowed to have kids and if
29:41
someone else has kids
29:42
then the lead couple kills those kids
29:45
and
29:45
also the who's the dominant couple it's
29:48
all decided on
29:49
based on the size and their weight and
29:52
and their age and so everyone's always
29:54
looking at each other and working out
29:57
who's going to be bigger who's going to
29:58
be the next in line
30:00
and they are literally as one article
30:01
pointed out all the meerkats are
30:03
comparing the meerkats
30:05
that's what they're doing
30:09
that's very good constantly just
30:11
uncompare the
30:12
meerkat um did you know that in 2010
30:14
remember um
30:16
the lead meerkat olav um sure
30:19
he released an autobiography that year
30:21
do you remember
30:22
it was like it was like i don't remember
30:24
no you you should have
30:25
because it was one of the biggest
30:27
selling books of that year that was the
30:28
year
30:29
uh that tony blair released his memoirs
30:31
and there was i do remember that one
30:33
yeah there were more pre-orders on the
30:35
meerkats book then they were on tony
30:36
blair's memoirs russell brand's book
30:38
on david beckham's book then cheryl
30:41
cole's book
30:41
this guy outsold everyone way yeah
30:45
do you have any big reveals no the
30:48
fortunately
30:48
he started the iraq war yes yeah
30:52
i knew it um but no actually i read
30:55
here's one odd reveal it's not in the
30:57
book but the voice of the meerkat
30:59
is and this is very niche but this is
31:01
for anyone who's watched
31:02
um alan partridge the second series of
31:05
alan partridge when he's staying
31:07
in the hotel it's the guy who fixes
31:09
everything you know that guy
31:11
michael yeah michael is the voice of
31:13
michael the geordie xl yes
31:14
yeah he's the voice of i was watching
31:17
adam partridge this afternoon so i'm
31:18
very
31:19
this is an amazing fact for me
31:22
you were saying about comparing the
31:23
meerkats um this study i think you were
31:25
talking about
31:26
um it's a guy called clutton brock and
31:28
he did these experiments where they fed
31:30
extra food to some of the meerkats that
31:32
weren't the main meerkats
31:34
and when they got fatter the main
31:36
meerkats got fatter as well
31:38
and so they found that basically when
31:40
you're comparing with the other meerkats
31:41
if someone gets bigger than you
31:43
you immediately eat a load of pizza or
31:45
whatever they eat and then just try and
31:46
get bigger than them because you always
31:48
want to be the biggest one
31:49
because it's the biggest one who's the
31:50
most important oh yeah so you're always
31:52
looking around and it goes oh he's
31:54
looking you know barry's looking a bit
31:55
fat today
31:57
i think someone compared it to something
32:00
that goby fish do which is almost the
32:01
opposite but it's quite interesting is
32:02
that goby fish go on diets
32:04
and it's for the same kind of peer
32:06
pressure reasons like the biggest goby
32:08
fish is the one who's dominant and they
32:09
don't want to cause
32:10
um conflict and so if they see a big
32:13
goby fish
32:14
they make themselves less big they eat a
32:15
bit less because they're like oh i don't
32:17
want to start a fight with that guy
32:18
i'll just go on a little diet be small
32:21
which is quite sweet
32:22
isn't it that's good but meerkats are
32:23
much more like up in your face if you're
32:25
gonna get big i'm gonna get big
32:26
i'll race you to the top kind of
32:27
attitude yeah true
32:29
uh and meerkats when they sleep it's
32:31
quite interesting what they do
32:33
they pile on top of one another to keep
32:35
warm
32:36
adorable yeah so like when this in
32:39
summer when it's hotter they kind of
32:40
spread out a lot
32:41
in winter when it's cold they kind of
32:43
grab another meerkat on top and kind of
32:45
snuggle in quickly
32:46
murder them
32:49
they all have meerkat rugs in their
32:51
homes
32:55
um i have some stuff on anuses if that's
32:58
yes so this fact is about they can turn
33:00
their bottoms inside out
33:02
um i didn't realize i was reading a bbc
33:04
article apparently
33:05
to chart the evolution and history of
33:08
anuses is really hard
33:10
because a lot of species have a bum
33:13
and then they suddenly don't have a bum
33:15
and then
33:16
they have a bum again and so there's
33:18
this like missing link
33:20
of anuses that really yes you can't
33:23
you can't through the fossils chart it
33:25
properly because suddenly it's just out
33:26
of nowhere
33:27
no bum and then thousands of years later
33:30
suddenly there's there's a bum again
33:32
that's so odd do we have examples of
33:34
well there's no there's bound then
33:36
unbummed creatures
33:38
i can't remember any but there is a
33:39
thing called having a transient anus a
33:41
transient anus yes
33:43
yeah but i think that might be in the
33:45
lifetime of an individual you have a bum
33:46
and then you don't have a bum
33:48
exactly no that's so that's a very
33:49
short-term example of the long-term
33:51
thing i was mentioning there's so
33:52
we we've covered the sea cucumber before
33:54
oh yeah which is a little it's
33:56
it's not a cucumber but it does live in
33:57
the sea it's kind of what is it it's
33:59
kind of fishy
34:00
uh organism it's not a fish they're
34:03
really weird
34:03
um they look like odd cucumbers
34:05
underwater but
34:07
we've come we've said before they can um
34:10
self-eviscerate when they're threatened
34:12
by a predator they distract the predator
34:14
by squirting
34:15
their own intestines out of themselves
34:18
and that distracts the predator because
34:19
he thinks
34:20
what's this and then and
34:23
then they slowly leave but the other
34:25
incredible thing is um
34:27
they can turn solid or mushy on command
34:30
on self-command so they can turn their
34:33
body into a mush
34:35
and then climb through a tiny crack and
34:37
then re-solidify
34:38
into lumps so they can't be got out
34:40
through the crack by a predator
34:42
whoa they're nuts they're so nuts and
34:44
then it's not only for self-defense that
34:46
they self-eviscerate
34:48
um it's a seasonal thing in autumn
34:51
they just reabsorb all their intestines
34:53
into their body and they just become a
34:54
solid lump
34:55
of flesh basically so fishermen in the
34:58
caribbean they harvest them in october
35:00
because they know they're not going to
35:01
have to gut them because they have no
35:03
guts anymore
35:04
oh wow yeah and then in spring the they
35:06
regrow all their organs and they
35:08
continue like that
35:08
that's insane they're so weird the one
35:11
thing i know about um
35:12
the anus of a sea cucumber
35:16
is that there's a fish that lives in
35:17
there isn't there it's called a slender
35:19
pearl fish
35:20
and it lives inside the anus of a sea
35:22
cucumber and the funny thing about them
35:24
is whenever they want to go into a sea
35:26
cucumbers anus they kind of do a little
35:28
knock
35:29
on the anus and the anus opens up oh my
35:32
god
35:32
like they're entering a german trench or
35:34
something
35:36
really and is it a secret knock or is it
35:38
just a normal
35:39
oh you think it's like yeah
35:43
oh it's the pearl fish again what a
35:45
slang term for the anus by the way the
35:46
german trench
35:47
that we've kind of guessed over there
35:51
guys we need to wrap up do you have
35:52
anything before we do uh there are
35:54
a dragonfire larvae eats um virus anus
35:58
what they do this is really cool they
36:00
draw water in through the anus
36:02
they clench and then they compress their
36:04
abdomen and the muscles in their thorax
36:06
against the water filled in the rectum
36:09
and then they can raise the pressure in
36:10
their body and it fires out their mouth
36:12
and then they can eat
36:14
what isn't that cool you're drawing
36:15
water in you're squeezing
36:17
and then your mouth comes out and you
36:18
eat wow that's so awesome
36:21
what i'm glad i'm glad i don't do that
36:25
but i'm happy that someone else has
36:26
found that was that on blue planet or is
36:29
it on brown planet actually
36:35

37:31
gonna give away one of our books to one
37:32
of you
37:33
and anna you have that fact yeah so this
37:36
is our favorite fact that you guys sent
37:38
in and it's from
37:39
uh i don't know if i can read my own
37:40
writing but victor jagger nathan
37:42
are you in you in such a good fact so
37:47
this fact is that uh guide runners for
37:49
sight impaired runners
37:51
can't use elasticated tethers at the
37:53
paralympics anymore
37:54
after the chinese started catapulting
37:56
their runners across the finish line at
37:58
the last minute
38:04
that's amazing
38:10
awesome we'll be out the back guys thank
38:12
you so much for coming we'll see you
38:13
later goodbye
38:21
[Music]
38:30
you

=200
00:00
hi guys just before we start this show i
00:02
want to celebrate the fact that this is
00:04
our
00:04
200th episode no such thing as a fish
00:08
thanks for that dan
00:09
um a little woo hoo yep
00:12
and the second one uh and the way i've
00:14
celebrated our 200th episode is by
00:16
making a mistake
00:17
uh yep last week's episode there was an
00:20
incorrect fact in it
00:22
so we recorded the show live in
00:23
leicester and my fact was about how
00:25
the walker's crisp factory can't tell
00:28
the difference between golf balls and
00:30
crisps
00:30
and after we recorded this show someone
00:32
came up to me he was called greg
00:34
hilliard
00:34
and he actually works in the walker's
00:36
crisp factory and he informed me
00:38
that fact was out of date because
00:39
they've now created a machine that can
00:42
distinguish between the two
00:44
in the last couple of years so walkers
00:46
can now tell the difference between golf
00:47
balls and crisps
00:49
happy birthday no such thing as a fish
00:58
[Music]
01:02
[Applause]
01:05
[Music]
01:08
hello and welcome to
01:12
another episode of no such thing as a
01:15
fish
01:16
a weekly podcast guys i'm trying to do
01:18
the intro here
01:20
a weekly podcast coming to you from
01:24
birmingham
01:32
my name is dan schreiber and i am
01:34
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
01:36
hunter murray and james harkin
01:38
and once again we have gathered around
01:40
the microphones with our four
01:41
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:43
and in no particular order
01:45
here we go starting with my fact this
01:47
week my fact this week is that
01:49
in brussels there is a commemorative
01:51
statue to where peter the great once
01:54
vomited
01:59
[Applause]
02:02
[Laughter]
02:06
anyone else want to vomit at this stage
02:12
is it in the shape of vomit or what what
02:14
do you mean oh the statue no it's
02:16
it's of peter the grey yeah yeah but
02:18
what it was is he was over
02:20
in brussels and um he was out just
02:22
having a big day
02:23
and he had a bit too much of a big day
02:25
and they pulled over
02:27
uh to where this sort of little fountain
02:28
he bit is and he
02:30
he vomited and it was established that
02:32
that's what he did historically
02:33
and then years later it was in 1856
02:36
there was a prince who donated a statue
02:38
to say we need to commemorate this so
02:40
it said it had this little plaque on it
02:42
which says as he sat on the edge of this
02:43
fountain he ennobled its waters with the
02:45
wine of his
02:46
libations did i say
02:50
any of the words right and then uh it's
02:52
close enough
02:53
i think his peter the great was
02:55
obviously in one sense this very grand
02:57
historical figure like probably the most
02:58
influential
02:59
tsar russia ever had um you know like
03:02
early 18th century influenced
03:04
everything that came after him but also
03:06
he was an absolute lad
03:08
so yeah he founded a drinking society
03:12
called it was originally called the
03:13
jolly company and then it was called
03:15
the all-joking all-drunken cy nod of
03:18
fools and jesters
03:20
and it had a few rules um so there were
03:23
rules like
03:24
you were never allowed to go to bed
03:25
sober you always had to empty your cup
03:27
when instructed to
03:29
and they just did mad stuff all the time
03:31
just constantly fooling around
03:33
so there was i think there was something
03:34
where um his favorite jester
03:37
got married uh he had this jester and he
03:39
decided he was zabo this time so he
03:41
could do whatever he wanted so he
03:42
decided to make this
03:43
wedding like a massive royal deal and he
03:46
gave his gesture his
03:47
tsar's carriage and then him and his
03:49
drinking society wore boots made of
03:51
straw
03:52
and they wore gloves in the like made of
03:55
mice
03:55
so they shoved their hands into mice and
03:57
they were what sorry
03:59
do you mean like finger puppets no it
04:01
must be mouse skin right they weren't
04:03
putting their hand up at mouse's
04:05
oh yeah okay well i don't know because
04:06
they wore squirrels tails and cat's paws
04:09
just hanging off their clothes for fun
04:11
and then they um made the married couple
04:13
enter moscow on the back of a camel
04:15
and then they just spent three days
04:18
getting absolutely smashed
04:19
and as one biographer put it the joke
04:21
may have been carried too
04:23
far because the groom died during the
04:26
celebrations
04:28
may may have been carried too far that's
04:32
a historian's way of looking at it isn't
04:34
it he was a terrifying man
04:36
so he was uh six foot seven
04:39
he had a standing desk that's not
04:41
terrifying but
04:43
um but the standing desk he had the
04:45
writing surface was five foot six inches
04:47
off the floor
04:48
wow he was huge yeah and also the other
04:51
thing about him he was obsessed with
04:52
dwarfs
04:53
so when he was a baby this is before him
04:56
that everyone would have been addiction
04:58
yeah but he had a retinue of dwarfs
05:00
acting as his servants and playmates and
05:01
he had a mini carriage
05:03
and he would ride in it drawn by four
05:04
dwarf ponies with four dwarfs riding
05:06
their own horses at the side
05:07
and even in later life he became
05:09
obsessed with um dwarfs and pies
05:11
he loved a dwarf jumping out of a pie at
05:12
a banquet really he was
05:14
he was obsessed with it often naked
05:16
naked dwells jumping out of places he
05:18
was really into yeah so simon see back
05:20
montefiore wrote a really good biography
05:22
and he basically said
05:23
all of the parties they had had naked
05:24
girls jumping out of pies dwarves being
05:27
tossed
05:27
dwarves dressed as old men old men
05:29
dressed as dwarves all of them naked
05:31
except for the bishop who would be
05:33
carrying dildos on a cushion
05:37
but that's the thing about it is this
05:39
thing that he did this club it was
05:41
called a synod wasn't it
05:42
and so it was basically to take the piss
05:44
out of the church
05:46
yeah that's what he did the whole time
05:47
so instead of holy water they would
05:49
scatter vodka
05:52
and if you were ever caught being sober
05:54
you'd get excommunicated
05:56
from his club but the worst thing was if
05:58
you got excommunicated you were barred
06:00
from all the pubs in the whole of russia
06:04
wow no way way
06:07
wow imagine the horror anna
06:11
listening at home you want to be able to
06:12
imagine the horror on anna's face right
06:13
now
06:14
he did another thing where so he did a
06:16
number of trips to europe he was famous
06:18
for these massive trips and one time he
06:20
came back and he was so impressed by the
06:22
clean-shaven-ness of of the europeans
06:25
that he imposed a beard tax into russia
06:28
but what the way he did it was he came
06:30
back and they threw a massive reception
06:32
for him
06:32
and he was giving a sort of a rousing
06:34
speech and everyone said it was elation
06:36
everyone was so excited and then it
06:37
turned to horror
06:38
when he suddenly said i don't want
06:41
beards anymore and he pulls out a
06:42
massive razor and he starts shaving the
06:44
faces of people who are attending
06:47
what they thought was just a pleasant
06:48
talk of the homecoming hero
06:50
and they all left without their face
06:52
hair but he did
06:54
he did the tax to start off with and
06:55
then when people started paying the tax
06:57
he
06:57
just went oh i'm just gonna ban them
06:59
then so he just didn't want beards at
07:01
all because he saw that as an example of
07:03
the old russia
07:04
and he was a great modernizer of russia
07:06
so he had a law that everyone had to
07:08
dress
07:09
as either a hungarian a frenchman or a
07:11
german
07:13
that was because he knew a very funny
07:14
joke about a hungarian french
07:18
but the with the beard tax the thing was
07:20
with the tax they gave you these coins
07:22
and i didn't realize these coins are
07:23
still in existence this is from the
07:25
1700s and you can see them there's
07:26
pictures online where
07:28
it's like a uh sort of a goatee and a
07:30
little
07:31
um what what's that a soul patch
07:34
soul patch kind of thing but like but
07:35
like satan would have you know the the
07:37
more pointy one
07:38
a goatee oh yeah a goatee yeah yeah yeah
07:42
so that would be on the coin and you
07:43
would carry your coin around with you so
07:45
if you were seen in the streets with a
07:46
beard they'd go
07:47
where's your coin and you'd you'd look
07:48
around for the coin and if you didn't
07:50
have your coin
07:50
they'd shave your face on the spot he
07:53
took
07:54
russia back 5000 years as well as being
07:56
a massive modernizer
07:58
what do you mean he left russia um in
08:00
the year 7206
08:03
and he got back and he said i don't want
08:04
this anymore because russia used to
08:06
used to begin at 5508 bc
08:09
and he left russia for the west and he
08:11
found oh it's 1700 here
08:13
well i prefer this and so he came back
08:15
and said right it's 1700 forget the 7200
08:17
nonsense
08:18
changing it beards don't exist in the
08:20
future
08:22
that's so cool so you just altered time
08:24
yeah and he trained as a shipbuilder
08:28
so when he was touring europe he um he
08:30
personally
08:31
uh went to a shipyard and just worked
08:33
there in amsterdam
08:34
for months and he he cooked his own
08:36
meals and he lit his own fires and he
08:37
ignored anybody who called him your
08:38
majesty
08:39
he answered only to carpenter peter
08:43
he's very eccentric but an incredibly
08:45
practical man in loads of ways
08:47
yeah he also really liked cutting
08:49
something else
08:50
off people um so you would be actually
08:53
thankful if you cut your beard off
08:54
because he loved cutting people's heads
08:55
off
08:56
himself so usually as a world leader at
08:58
the time people were beheaded but you
09:00
know you'd get your executioner to do it
09:01
but he really liked to be there in the
09:02
thick of it
09:03
and so he did lots of executions himself
09:06
and he was really fascinated by anatomy
09:08
again because i think he liked europeans
09:10
and they were
09:11
maybe a head in biology if he comes at
09:14
you with a razor
09:15
at what stage do you know he's going to
09:17
go for the beard and not cut your hair
09:18
yeah that's got to be absolutely
09:20
terrified comes out with a great big axe
09:22
no this is just my beard
09:23
axe don't worry he actually had a
09:27
mistress called mary hamilton and then
09:28
she ended up being beheaded as lots of
09:30
mysteries did
09:31
and when she was beheaded he was there
09:33
and as soon as she was beheaded he
09:35
lifted up her head in front of the
09:36
crowds who were all watching
09:38
and he gave them all a medical lesson on
09:41
anatomy
09:42
so he turned her neck side out and was
09:44
like this is the trachea
09:46
this is you know her carotid artery
09:49
and then he gave her a big snog and then
09:50
he dropped the head and walked away he
09:52
gave her a snog
09:53
yeah yeah he gave a big kiss um
09:56
i so this fact was sent to me by a
09:59
listener of our podcast called carrie
10:00
and um i loved it because there are
10:03
amazing statues all over the world that
10:04
represent
10:05
very odd things i found one which i find
10:07
um i've been trying to track down
10:09
whether
10:09
the truth of this which is george
10:11
washington in trafalgar square very
10:13
close to where
10:14
we work in covent garden literally a
10:15
walking distance there's a statue of
10:17
george washington there
10:18
outside the national portrait gallery
10:20
and it was donated
10:22
by the americans however there was a
10:24
sentence that george washington said
10:25
just before he died which is he said i
10:27
would never will stand
10:28
on british soil again and as a result it
10:31
is said and this is what tour guides
10:33
tell everyone
10:34
that as they were putting down the
10:35
statue of george washington they
10:37
imported american soil
10:38
and sitting underneath it is american
10:40
soils so he still is not standing
10:42
yeah but what's under the american soil
10:46
it's more british soil how far down does
10:49
this go
10:50
basically on vomiting
10:53
and on american presidents actually
10:56
ulysses s grant
10:58
was a president and also he was
11:01
prominent in the civil war in the
11:02
american civil war before that
11:03
and so he was a kind of a war hero but
11:06
at the same time he was an alcoholic so
11:08
he used to swig whiskey wherever he went
11:10
apparently
11:11
and at one point in battle he vomited
11:13
into his horse's mane
11:17
yeah and just went on with it what about
11:19
um george w
11:20
bush was it george w bush no it's george
11:22
h w bush
11:23
um who vomited um on the lap of japan's
11:26
prime minister
11:28
in 1992 and as a result the japanese
11:31
coined the phrase
11:32
bushu suru meaning embarrassing public
11:35
vomiting
11:38
or literally to do a
11:40
[Laughter]
11:41
because bush is that is frowned on isn't
11:42
it in japan yeah actually everywhere
11:45
what oh i've got so many apologetic
11:48
texts
11:50
do you know he was so good-natured about
11:52
that moment though so he kind of
11:53
collapsed at this dinner he'd been
11:54
feeling bad anyway
11:56
i think because he just played a tennis
11:57
match against a japanese emperor and
11:59
he'd lost
12:00
so he was feeling really unwell after
12:02
that and he collapsed onto the floor
12:03
vomited passed out
12:05
and as soon as he woke up with the
12:06
japanese prime minister there
12:08
above him saying you're okay he said why
12:10
don't you just roll me under the table
12:11
and i'll sleep it off while you finish
12:13
dinner
12:14
really which is quite cool yeah one
12:17
thing about um
12:18
peter the great is at his parties um he
12:21
would train
12:22
bears to serve alcohol and they would
12:24
growl and harass at those who said no
12:27
[Laughter]
12:29
so i thought i'd look at some other
12:30
awesome parties
12:32
and i really like the engagement party
12:34
of the newspaper magnet gordon bennett
12:37
um he turned up at his own engagement
12:39
party so drunk
12:40
that he immediately urinated into the
12:42
living room fireplace
12:44
in full view of his hosts and it's in
12:48
the guinness book of records as the
12:49
greatest engagement faux pas
12:54
and it's supposed to be where we get the
12:55
phrase gordon bennett
12:58
something bad yeah that's supposed to be
13:01
guinness
13:01
still accepting any advance on urinating
13:04
into the fireplace okay
13:06
go for it i think we could smash that
13:09
um during the gin craze there's quite a
13:11
few good parties so this was in the
13:13
18th century and a lot of people were
13:15
drinking gin especially in london
13:17
there was an author called henry
13:18
mckenzie who was at a drinking party
13:20
and he didn't want to drink anymore so
13:22
he fell to the floor to disguise himself
13:25
as a drunken body
13:27
wow and then soon after he felt a small
13:29
hand around his neck
13:30
and he was like what's going on and he
13:32
confronted the boy who was doing it and
13:33
apparently the boy
13:34
said it was his job to loosen the
13:36
neckties of the guests
13:38
to prevent them from choking on their
13:39
own vomit wow
13:42
if you have to hire someone to do that
13:44
yeah
13:45
i had at my uh stag dude party oh are we
13:48
really yeah just before i did my speech
13:50
my brother
13:51
made me drink what in australia is
13:53
called a shoei and they do it on the
13:54
formula one you fill a shoe full of beer
13:56
and you have to drink the whole shoe of
13:58
beer so i did that right after i decided
14:01
i'd say a quick thank you to everyone
14:02
that came
14:03
and i did that passed out woke up in the
14:05
morning and thought i did a pretty good
14:07
speech last night and my brother said i
14:08
recorded it i thought it was like about
14:10
two minutes 45 minutes
14:13
in a 45 minute speech whose shoe did you
14:16
have to drink my brothers it was
14:17
disgusting
14:18
because he's a clown isn't he that was
14:19
the problem
14:25
let's move on to our second fact of the
14:26
show okay it is time for fact number two
14:28
and that is
14:29
james okay my fact this week is that
14:32
only one study
14:33
has ever found that men are better than
14:35
women at recognizing faces
14:38
it was a study looking at the
14:40
recognition of the transformers
14:46
and i i know i know that's bad obviously
14:48
but internally i am thinking
14:50
yeah i'm pretty good at recognizing
14:51
transformers that's true and they're
14:53
robots in disguise so that's even better
14:55
right
14:56
um so this is obviously like an on
14:58
average thing so
14:59
you couldn't say for instance that anna
15:01
would be worse at recognizing
15:02
transformers than dan
15:03
just on average women are worse than men
15:05
although you know that i asked you
15:06
earlier what transformers were so
15:09
and that was having just read the
15:10
wikipedia page on transformers wasn't it
15:13
i still didn't understand it conforming
15:16
to stereotype
15:18
and you couldn't say for instance that
15:19
andy would be worse than anna at
15:21
recognizing barbie faces
15:23
which is the other part of this study
15:25
and so they took barbie faces and they
15:27
took transformer faces and they found
15:28
the women were better at recognizing
15:30
barbie
15:30
and the men were better at recognizing
15:32
transformers and what they think
15:34
is this is a study about looking whether
15:36
experience is important
15:37
when it comes to recognizing faces so
15:39
they found these things where they
15:41
thought women would have more experience
15:42
in looking at barbies and men would have
15:44
more experience in looking at
15:45
transformers
15:46
and they found that maybe experience has
15:48
something to do with it but actually
15:49
overall women are
15:51
a lot lot better than men are looking at
15:53
faces yeah because i
15:54
i think i read a study and this is off
15:57
memory so very risky right now
15:59
but the also women because of the
16:02
genetic material instinct then you kind
16:04
of have to be
16:05
primed to recognize people more often
16:08
and you have to like take an interest in
16:10
more people so you can form a bond with
16:11
them and as soon as you form an
16:12
emotional bond with people
16:13
then you're more likely to recognize
16:15
them next time you see them yeah it
16:16
could be that
16:17
could be that whereas but it's probably
16:18
the barbie thing
16:21
so you have these things called face
16:22
patches in your brain
16:24
and these little bits they're about the
16:26
size of a blueberry and they are
16:27
specifically for recognizing faces
16:29
so they've test they don't respond if
16:31
you get shown another body part but they
16:32
do respond if you get shown a face
16:34
and they are so predictable these face
16:36
patches that scientists
16:37
tried it out with monkeys monkeys also
16:39
have face patches and they would measure
16:41
the electrical activity of the face
16:43
cells
16:43
and then they could recreate the face
16:45
that the monkey had seen
16:47
accurately yes from the activity in the
16:50
brain cells
16:50
wow that is magic but monkeys don't
16:54
aren't very good at recognizing faces i
16:55
don't think are they i think great apes
16:57
are
16:58
but monkeys are quite bad they are good
17:00
though at recognizing
17:01
bottoms chimpanzees especially recognize
17:04
each other by their bottoms the way that
17:06
we recognize each other by the face
17:08
well not exactly the same way well
17:11
the same way but upside down yeah yeah
17:14
and they does that mean they back into
17:15
every social engagement
17:17
they go ask first well then they can't
17:20
because one of them has to be face first
17:21
in order to see the ass
17:23
it's unbelievably embarrassing when one
17:25
comes in ask first and another one comes
17:27
in
17:27
asks first imagine that an engagement
17:30
yeah
17:32
um but the the you know how they tested
17:34
this they tested it by showing
17:35
them um they showed humans faces and
17:38
then faces upside down
17:39
and it's much humans are much slower to
17:41
recognize faces when they're turned
17:42
upside down
17:43
they then showed the chimpanzees asses
17:46
chimpanzees asses and then
17:47
asses upside down and the slowdown was
17:49
the same whereas humans did not slow
17:51
down when they were shown a normal
17:52
bottom and then an upside down bottom
17:55
which they also did for this experiment
17:56
but could the humans recognize the
17:58
bottoms
17:59
no they also could not recognize upside
18:01
down bottoms okay
18:02
i got it yeah um i just thought maybe
18:05
i'd have a quick game of transformer or
18:07
barbie
18:08
oh okay great um we can't do the images
18:11
because this is a podcast
18:12
yeah um but what i can do is give you
18:14
some names of
18:15
either these are people from
18:17
transformers not people transformers
18:19
they're either transformers from
18:21
transformers they're people to me james
18:24

18:33

18:42
what um slag
18:48
is that a barbie doll i think is it a
18:50
transformer
18:51

18:53
ill-conceived barbie
18:57
it's a triceratops dino bot should have
19:00
got that um
19:01
mc hammer
19:02
[Music]
19:04
uh barbie harvey yeah he's got it yeah
19:07
got it because they do celebrity barbies
19:09
there's an angela merkel as well
19:11
yeah yeah
19:14
i tried to get one and they'd said it
19:16
was for sale but then it turned out it
19:18
was uh they brought it just to an eu
19:19
conference barbie created an angela
19:21
merkel
19:22
uh barbie and so it's not for sale for
19:24
general public it should be
19:25
it is if you pay 50 billion pounds yes
19:30
uh one more alan
19:34
transfer yeah who's the transformer
19:38
[Applause]
19:41
who doesn't give a
19:44
okay it's time for fact number three
19:45
then um
19:48
well the answer is you were right not to
19:49
give a because it's both oh
19:52
really it's a high-speed train and
19:54
someone who's married to barbie's friend
19:56
mitch i'm beg your pardon
20:00
i said midge on midge
20:04
cool
20:06
i mean if her friend was called minge
20:08
that would have been one of my
20:12
so you may well have heard of these guys
20:14
called super recognizers
20:15
oh yeah so they're police officers and
20:17
they're incredibly good at recognizing
20:19
criminals faces based on really blurry
20:21
cctv so
20:22
in the metropolitan police they identify
20:25
a quarter of all the criminals
20:26
despite the fact that out of 32 000
20:29
metropolitan police officers there are
20:30
only
20:31
six super recognizers and they get a
20:33
quarter
20:34
and they're so good uh that one officer
20:36
was interviewed for the guardian
20:37
and he said i was coming back from court
20:40
and i saw someone who was wanted for
20:41
seven offenses because they just spot
20:42
they
20:43
remember the faces of people who are
20:44
wanted and they just see them and they
20:45
go that guy
20:47
i saw someone who was wanted for seven
20:48
offenses once i had to stop the car
20:50
three times
20:51
i would take one person in and then on
20:52
the way to the station i saw someone
20:54
else who was wanted
20:55
so i picked them up and then as we were
20:57
driving i saw someone else
20:59
yeah they're just constantly seeing
21:00
crooks wow do you know who was very bad
21:03
at recognizing
21:04
people was back to american president
21:07
ronald reagan
21:08
so he had to speak at a graduation
21:11
ceremony in 1964
21:13
and he was giving you know graduation
21:14
certificates to students
21:16
and a boy came up on stage and he shook
21:19
the boy's hand gave him a certificate
21:20
and said my name's ronald
21:22
what's yours and the boy said i'm
21:24
michael i'm your son
21:28
it was his it was his adoptive son they
21:30
adopted him when he was a baby
21:31
he was 19 by that point oh i mean for an
21:34
actor who has to recognize people you
21:36
would think that would be a flaw not
21:37
being able to recognize other humans
21:39
yeah that's your actors need to
21:41
recognize people i mean it helps if
21:42
you're facing the right way
21:45
you only have to recognize the camera
21:47
then though i guess so
21:49
do you know who i just because i can't
21:51
recognize people so i'm just a bit
21:52
worried i can't be an actor
21:53
james has genuine face blindness he he
21:56
doesn't remember facebook
21:57
kind of i have i have no um imagination
22:00
so james i thought those poems you
22:04
showed me
22:06
and that whole barbie transformer game
22:07
was top
22:10
i can't imagine people's faces i can't
22:12
imagine what my wife looks like for
22:14
instance
22:14
so it's not proper face blindness it's a
22:16
fantasia it's called but it means that i
22:18
can't really recognize people very well
22:19
a fantasia yeah what a whimsical name
22:21
for presumably a bad condition i
22:24
started
22:27
[Laughter]
22:31
[Applause]
22:33
i'm your wife
22:43
just just one quick thing about face
22:44
recognition this year
22:46
there was a festival in wales that used
22:48
facial recognition technology
22:49
to recognize evil elvises
22:52
whoa they were trying to scan for people
22:54
who were wanted same as the
22:56
police do to when they were on their way
22:57
into the world's largest elvis festival
23:00
in bridge end in september 35 000 people
23:03
were going in
23:04
most of them dressed as elvis and
23:07
officers scanned their faces oh and what
23:08
they were looking for bad guys so
23:10
yeah bad guys um well there's a thing as
23:14
well in barcelona
23:15
they've tested out this new thing at
23:16
comedy clubs whereby they've put on the
23:18
back of seats
23:19
little cameras that stares directly into
23:22
the face of the person sitting watching
23:24
the comedy show
23:25
and it's it's there to monitor laughter
23:28
patterns so
23:29
every time you laugh it clicks and says
23:31
you've laughed once
23:32
so if people at the end of the show go
23:34
up and say i found that very
23:35
disappointing
23:36
i would like a refund they can go well
23:38
actually you've laughed
23:40
67 times this evening and you can't have
23:42
your money back
23:43
there's one yeah
23:49
everyone's two laughs at a comedy show
23:51
don't think for a minute we genuinely
23:52
think you're laughing
23:53
everyone puts on a thing you could be
23:55
laughing at how it is yeah yeah
23:57
no it was a it's a test uh it's to see
24:00
how it would work because what they do
24:01
is they
24:02
then they drop the price all together of
24:04
the ticket and so they clock up
24:06
everyone's that says free gig you go to
24:07
it they clock up the laughter amount and
24:09
then at the end of the gig
24:11
they say you black and there's a cap on
24:12
how much left because then everyone's
24:14
just going to go
24:15
i'm just going to enjoy this but i'm not
24:16
going to laugh so i get it for free
24:19
awful yeah mouth closed look straight
24:21
ahead think of death
24:22
think of old people just think of
24:24
sadness
24:26
some people don't laugh even when
24:27
they're finding things really funny
24:30
you keep telling yourself that after
24:31
you're ready i'm referring to the
24:33
audiences at my solo show
24:34
who had a wonderful time on the feedback
24:36
forms
24:38
i've just explained a lot of them uh
24:40
we're remembering something sad
24:45
i quickly tell you my favorite headline
24:47
that i've read recently this is about
24:48
recognizing stuff the headline is that
24:50
babies can see things that
24:52
adults can't but are unable to tell them
24:55
[Laughter]
24:57
they'll look at a picture and they'll
24:58
notice differences that we won't have
24:59
spotted
25:00
or maybe they haven't told us we don't
25:02
know
25:03
that's what they think so how do we know
25:05
they can see the differences i don't
25:06
know i didn't read the article i just
25:08
read the headline it's
25:10
that's going to go on your headstone
25:12
then
25:15
should we move on to our next video yeah
25:17
okay it is time for fact number three
25:20
and that is andy my fact is that there
25:23
is a woman whose job for the last 30
25:25
years
25:26
has been squatting above the queen's
25:28
throne so the tv cameras can get their
25:30
angle right
25:32
the queen doesn't squat above the throne
25:34
exactly
25:35
certainly not there's a woman who's
25:36
called ella slack and she's in her early
25:39
70s
25:39
she is the official stand-in for the
25:41
queen at all events where there are
25:43
going to be tv cameras
25:44
because she's pretty much exactly the
25:46
same size as the queen yeah
25:47
and she doesn't look like the queen at
25:49
all but she um
25:51
she does it and she she's done it 50
25:53
times with different state occasions why
25:54
the squatting thing that's what i want
25:56
to know well
25:57
she said she was interviewed about her
25:59
her life not quite being the queen
26:01
by quite a long way not being the queen
26:02
but she she's not even in the line of
26:05
succession james
26:07
if that's what makes you famous these
26:08
days not being the queen
26:11
but well she said about um the cereal
26:14
have you not been the queen
26:17
um she said about the ceremonies i've
26:19
never been allowed to sit on the throne
26:21
in the house of lords for the state
26:23
opening oh i see she said
26:24
i have to lurk above it yeah but she
26:28
says it's a very strict rule and
26:29
she does say if i'm in a carriage or a
26:31
car i will wave
26:33
which is very sweet yeah she was
26:35
employed yeah like
26:37
over 30 years ago when it was realized
26:39
that the queen had the sun in her eyes
26:40
at some event
26:41
and so the queen might have the sun in
26:44
her eyes but she was standing on a
26:45
podium and so this woman was sent to
26:46
check
26:47
the sun wouldn't be in her eyes and now
26:48
she checks for that so whenever the
26:49
queen has to stand up on a sunny day she
26:51
goes and checks first that the sun won't
26:53
be in her eyes
26:54
um she checks that she'll be visible
26:56
over podiums in case you've made a
26:57
podium too high
26:59
in case peter the great's desk is
27:00
brought up
27:03
wow yeah she and she has her own queen
27:05
costume which she's put together from
27:07
charity shops
27:08
so her queen handbag cost one quid yeah
27:11
and she got fake diamonds from
27:12
woolworth's for the millennium
27:15
i just love it i just think it's really
27:16
nice she's not paid she refuses to
27:17
accept any money for the work she does
27:19
and she's been doing it for 30 years
27:20
i think she's one of the great unsung
27:21
heroes of this country yeah it's worth
27:23
it she doesn't accept any payment and
27:25
she pays for her travel and everything
27:26
i mean i agree she's a hero in a very
27:28
small way yeah
27:30
speaking of clothing um there is someone
27:33
else who
27:34
sort of does a stand-in job for the
27:35
queen as well and that is it's someone
27:37
specifically
27:38
whose job is to break in the shoes of
27:41
the queen
27:41
that are as of yet unworn so that's what
27:44
they do they
27:45
the uh the people who provide all the
27:47
clothing for her her fashion people the
27:49
queen's fashion people they buy new
27:51
shoes
27:51
and obviously when you're wearing new
27:53
shoes they're very painful and so
27:54
someone is hired to just walk around in
27:56
the new pair of shoes before
27:58
she has a go at them that's cool so they
28:00
must have the same size
28:02
feet as the queen right oh yes it would
28:04
be very funny
28:06
if they did not i was just thinking that
28:08
the um the audition for that job or the
28:10
job interview would be just like
28:12
cinderella or something i mean just have
28:14
a load of people sat there they just
28:16
need the right size feet
28:17
yeah because there's no other you know
28:19
skill there is there
28:20
no i and it's probably a quick audition
28:23
process are you size eight no okay thank
28:24
you
28:26
the queen's got massive feet
28:37
do you know so i was looking at sort of
28:40
the reason this lady ella slack she
28:42
called
28:42
the reason she does this it's like to
28:44
prepare for ceremonial events
28:45
and the royal family they have to
28:48
rehearse all the royal ceremonies quite
28:50
a lot
28:50
and in fact the queen herself spent
28:52
weeks rehearsing for her coronation in
28:55
1953
28:56
so she was really nervous about it and
28:58
she used to play recordings of her
29:00
father's coronation over and over again
29:02
her father was george you know who had a
29:04
stutter and so it was quite difficult
29:05
for him
29:06
she used to play recordings of his
29:07
coronation as she paraded up and down
29:09
what was called the white drawing room
29:11
because that had the same dimensions as
29:13
the as the theater in the abbey where
29:14
she was going to be coronated
29:16
and she timed herself doing it to make
29:18
sure she was going to walk the right
29:19
you know distance at the right pace and
29:21
she got all her ladies and waiting to
29:23
walk alongside her
29:24
and she used to wear her bed sheets as a
29:26
robe
29:27
as her queen lee robes which is so cool
29:32
that is really cool do you know in 2012
29:34
there was a queen
29:35
shortage in the uk sorry there was a
29:38
queen shortage
29:39
um it was due to all the jubilee stuff
29:41
and they needed queen look-alikes
29:43
and basically there's about i don't know
29:45
there's about a couple of dozen
29:46
people who can do queen look-alikes and
29:49
they needed them all the time
29:50
and they said the main look-alike
29:52
company susan scott lookalike said
29:54
we could have done with double or triple
29:56
the amount of queens
29:58
[Music]
29:59
that is amazing imagine when the the
30:02
button was pressed dispatch the queens
30:04
[Laughter]
30:06
oh
30:07
[Laughter]
30:13
do you think they've ever all been in
30:14
the same place at the same time i don't
30:16
know but i did read an interview with a
30:18
kate middleton look alike
30:19
and she says that one of the queens or
30:22
one of the queen look-alikes
30:23
is like her honorary granny and the
30:26
reason is because they all hang out
30:27
together all these look-alikes of course
30:29
you do
30:29
you wouldn't because you're all working
30:31
in the same role you're kind of joking
30:32
the queen look like something that kate
30:33
middleton look likes will hang out with
30:35
you yeah and the pippa middleton look
30:36
likes the harry potter look-alikes that
30:38
david beckham look-alikes they all hang
30:40
out together why is harry potter at that
30:41
party
30:45
that's breaking a wall of some sort
30:47
because then that's the only time they
30:49
can truly be themselves
30:50
because outside those circles everyone's
30:52
always saying oh you look just like
30:54
camilla parker bowles
30:55
well to the harry potter look
30:58
have you ever thought about changing
30:59
your look-alike mate you don't look like
31:02
harry potter
31:04
they um they just on that subject they
31:06
do often if they're
31:07
a couple who are celebrity couples in
31:09
real life they will
31:11
fall in love with each other and get
31:12
married i think there's examples of like
31:13
um
31:14
a katie price and a peter andre uh look
31:17
alike when
31:18
that was massive falling in love because
31:19
they did so many events together
31:21
when that was massive yeah that was did
31:24
you know by the
31:24
a whole new world album
31:28
so on body devils yeah um
31:31
general montgomery in the second world
31:33
war uh monty had an impersonator who for
31:35
spying purposes
31:37
pretended to be him and would go to
31:39
different places to
31:40
so that german spies would think oh
31:42
monty's over here
31:43
actually monty wasn't over here monty
31:45
was over there defeating the germans
31:47
um so the only problem was that the
31:50
lookalike had had a finger shot off in
31:52
the first world war
31:53
so he so you needed to count the fingers
31:55
on the fake monty
31:57
really he would have vlog gloves
32:00
or a prosthetic finger or something and
32:01
the only thing was there was another
32:02
body double who was called keith dima
32:04
banwell who looked
32:05
exactly like montgomery so he was used
32:08
as a lookalike the only problem was he
32:10
was substantially taller than monty
32:12
so he was never allowed on any account
32:13
to get out of his car
32:14
[Laughter]
32:18
was that tex banwell or was that or
32:21
clifton james i think it was part of
32:23
something christian change is the first
32:24
one
32:25
james yeah it was called operation
32:26
copperhead and basically
32:28
it was when you know we were planning
32:30
the british were playing attacks on the
32:31
germans and it was dispatched people who
32:33
looked like him to all parts of the
32:35
world
32:35
to make sure but he was a drunk as well
32:38
so he was an absolute liability i think
32:40
so funny the idea of dispatching these
32:41
fake montys everywhere
32:43
we've had intelligence that he's in
32:44
antarctica
32:46
should we strengthen defenses in
32:47
antarctica do you guys read about the
32:50
mexican politician who's actually
32:51
looking for body doubles
32:53
or he was looking for body doubles this
32:55
is a it's a guy called renato tronco
32:57
gomez
32:58
and this is in 2015 he's a politician in
33:01
the mexican parliament
33:02
and he put out a call for body doubles
33:05
because
33:05
he wants to maintain his popularity and
33:08
he's like i'm so popular that i need to
33:09
be in multiple places at once
33:11
so he's trying to put an ego on the man
33:13
[Laughter]
33:15
um he said and he said i'm not that
33:17
fussy if you're short then you can wear
33:19
platform shoes
33:20
if you're chubby you can lose weight if
33:22
you're thin you can gain weight it's
33:24
fine
33:24
if you're tall i'll cut your feet off
33:28
um he said they're banned from smoking
33:30
and drinking because he doesn't smoke
33:31
and drink and it has to be realistic
33:33
although at any public event he
33:35
stipulated that they would have to say
33:36
i'm the double by the way you're not
33:38
quite getting the real guy
33:39
you're getting a look alike and he said
33:41
most importantly they will not be able
33:43
to live in my home
33:44
sleep with my wife or go to congress
33:47
so no shocking as part of the job
33:50
but yeah it was only second most
33:52
important on his list though wasn't it
33:53
[Laughter]
33:55
in order of importance between going to
33:56
congress and living in my house yeah
33:58
i can imagine his wife going wait a
34:00
minute you've got no feet
34:01
[Laughter]
34:05
hey i read a thing guys which is that so
34:07
on the subject of body doubles
34:08
a lot of um in movies there's obviously
34:11
stunt doubles and body doubles uh for
34:13
the biggest actors in the world they all
34:15
have them and
34:16
i started looking into stunt doubles
34:18
generally for this topic tonight and
34:21
found this thing where there's a lot of
34:22
anger amongst the hollywood community of
34:25
stunt of stunt doubles
34:26
because there's no oscar for stunt
34:29
doubling or body doubling
34:30
and that is such a huge part of the
34:32
movies what you see in there is making
34:34
people believe that you've been blown
34:36
out of a window or
34:37
jumped because they have it for special
34:38
effects they have a special event but
34:40
they think they should have an oscar
34:41
for it and i found that there's actually
34:43
a big petition that's been going on
34:45
and as far as i could see as of last
34:47
year they stopped
34:48
pushing it to the public because they
34:50
didn't get the hundred thousand votes
34:51
that they needed
34:52
so it's on a site uh where they've
34:55
managed to get
34:56
87 393
34:59
supporters and they've not quite hit the
35:02
uh the 100
35:03
000 that they need so i'm going to read
35:05
out the uh
35:07
the website for this here it's called
35:09
thepetitionsite.com
35:10
you've got to look for stand up for
35:12
stunts and i reckon if enough people who
35:14
are listening to this podcast
35:15
can just go to that site very quickly
35:18
and just give them a petition support we
35:20
could get to a hundred thousand and
35:21
maybe
35:21
next year or the year after stunt people
35:24
can get an
35:24
oscar at the main awards how cool would
35:26
that be but they could absole through
35:28
the ceiling and pick up their reward
35:29
yes yes yeah they're so close and the
35:32
last update was a year ago so they've
35:34
given up and that's so sad because
35:35
they're incredible
35:36
i would love to see the stunt oscars
35:39
everyone's constantly blowing up
35:41
and
35:42
smashing through the glass that would be
35:43
incredible yeah you'd be as a member of
35:45
the audience you'd be constantly looking
35:47
for the emergency exit before someone
35:48
said no no it's fine it's part of it
35:51
but they are they're more um kind of
35:54
omnipresent than you think aren't they
35:56
so you know that bit in notting hill
35:57
where julie roberts talks about
35:59
people having butt doubles i always
36:00
thought that was a bit that had been
36:02
scripted and wasn't true but they all
36:04
have body doubles
36:05
and in fact really trashy piece of
36:07
celebrity information but
36:09
in pretty woman julia roberts had a body
36:11
double for that as she was called
36:13
shelley michelle
36:14
and actually in the really iconic poster
36:16
of pretty woman where
36:17
you know she's kind of leaning against
36:18
something and she's got something over
36:19
her shoulder she's wearing some short
36:21
leather skirt or something
36:22
the whole the only bit of her that's
36:24
julia roberts is the head
36:26
the rest of that is a body so it's
36:29
i just find it so weird
36:32
someone else's body there are a lot of
36:35
monkeys looking at that picture going
36:37
that's not julia roberts
36:41
guys we need to move on to our final
36:43
fact james you got something before we
36:44
do
36:45
um so i was looking at queen's jobs um
36:48
because this is person who's employed to
36:49
do something for the queen
36:51
um the queen has a keeper of the queen's
36:53
stamps
36:55
okay because the queen doesn't like
36:57
stamp collecting
36:59
but she has a shitload of stamps and so
37:02
she employs someone to be her official
37:04
stamp collector
37:06
you're kidding i am not kidding does she
37:08
go and say how's my stamp collection
37:10
doing
37:10
i guess so why doesn't she like does she
37:12
not like the
37:14
licking the back of her own you don't l
37:15
if you collect stumps
37:17
you don't lick them what that's surely
37:19
one of the perks of stem collecting
37:22
so you just go and get your stamps out
37:24
go oh just like that one again
37:27
i wouldn't lick the fronts of the stamps
37:30
that is deranged
37:32
no one's forcing her to collect stamps
37:35
has a collection that's already there so
37:38
she needs someone to look after it
37:39
but this guy does go and get extra
37:41
stamps for her collection
37:43
yeah so he's basically doing a hobby for
37:46
her
37:46
yeah it's like having an official jigsaw
37:48
maker yes
37:50
oh but she does collect jigsaws no wait
37:52
the fact is she doesn't collect jigsaws
37:54
sorry hang on
37:58
it's better than it sounds
38:01
she doesn't collect jigsaws she does
38:03
jigsaws she loves them
38:04
but to save buying loads of jigsaws
38:08
she gets them out of a jigsaw library
38:10
you can rent jigsaws
38:12
yeah well it's just a library it's a
38:13
free library for jigsaw sorry is she low
38:16
on cash she is thrifty
38:21
well i think they should put our taxes
38:22
up if the queen can't afford jigsaws
38:24
i'm not paying enough tax
38:28
hey listen let's move on to our final
38:29
fact of the show and that is cecinski
38:33
and my fact is that u.s president jimmy
38:36
carter once sent the nuclear launch
38:38
codes to his dry cleaner
38:44
and not on purpose he
38:47
this is i read this article in timeline
38:49
which is one of my favorite websites
38:51
timeline.com
38:52
and it's about the fact that there's
38:54
been an open secret in washington
38:56
since jimmy carter was president that he
38:57
lost the nuclear biscuit as it's known
39:00
which is the little kind of credit card
39:01
with the codes on it
39:02
because he sent a suit to the dry
39:04
cleaners and it was in the pocket
39:06
because the president has to have it on
39:08
him at all times and
39:10
it's just it's amazing did it come back
39:12
sort of slightly blurry
39:13
and he was like oh is that a is that a
39:15
six or a five
39:17
i'll wing it i'll wing it
39:21
but isn't it true that basically all the
39:23
presidents lose the codes all the time
39:25
they're very scary we can only hope that
39:27
they lose the codes all the time frankly
39:29
at the moment one of the problems that
39:31
they do have from george
39:32
w bush onwards is that the person
39:35
carrying the football
39:36
has to be by the president at all times
39:38
but the president often forgets that
39:40
so the president will finish what
39:41
they're doing hop in a car and drive off
39:43
and then suddenly guy with the nuclear
39:44
codes is going what do i do
39:47
and they have to chase after the
39:48
president and try and get back to him
39:50
in case he's needed i would constantly
39:52
hide as president
39:56
yeah you'd be deliberately all the time
39:58
trying to sneak off yeah because they
40:00
have to go even in the same lift as the
40:01
president yeah i don't what happens when
40:03
the president's asleep though
40:05
they sleep in the same bed as them do
40:07
they yeah yeah yeah
40:08
well you found a fact for our our book
40:10
which is about the fact that if trump
40:12
goes to
40:13
yes yeah if he goes to new york the
40:16
nuclear button has its own
40:17
multi-million dollar flat in new york
40:20
which he didn't
40:21
the flat didn't get used for the first
40:23
eight months of the presidency because
40:24
he didn't go to new york but they've
40:25
hired a luxury apartment just for the
40:27
button to sit in
40:28
but i like the fact that it's for the
40:30
button and it's also for the people who
40:31
guard the button so it's for his staff
40:33
but i like the idea that it is mainly
40:35
for the button so the button's in the
40:37
double bed
40:38
and the staff are just standing to
40:40
attention around the bed
40:42
are you comfortable sir as you say clint
40:45
clinton lost it he kept it um
40:48
rubber banded to his credit cards in a
40:50
trouser pocket
40:52
imagine that that makes sense and it
40:55
doesn't make sense it's a very crazy
40:57
thing to do
40:58
what if you accidentally put in your
40:59
nuclear button card into the machine at
41:01
the till
41:02
i don't think that's how it sets off
41:04
stuff
41:06
this is why they say contactless is a
41:07
very dangerous technology
41:11
and they only found out didn't they when
41:12
i think clinton's aide
41:14
said look could you give me the um the
41:16
biscuit back because we need to give you
41:18
an updated version this came out in a
41:20
autobiography hero a short while ago i
41:22
think someone called patterson
41:23
and his so his aide said give me the
41:25
biscuit back because we need to swap it
41:27
and clinton said
41:28
yeah yeah sure i think he's upstairs i
41:30
just left it upstairs i'll go and get it
41:32
and he scurried around for a bit and
41:33
then eventually he admitted that he
41:35
hadn't seen it for months and he had no
41:36
idea where he'd put it
41:38
oh my god but he must have known he
41:41
hadn't seen it before oh he would have
41:42
been panicking
41:43
absolutely
41:44
[Laughter]
41:46
so there was a lot of worry that a
41:48
president with this kind of power
41:50
could launch based on let's say even in
41:53
our current climate you know you get
41:54
too angry one day the president might
41:56
suddenly even in the current climate
41:58
might happen yeah in the current
41:59
blissfully calm environment we're all
42:01
living at the moment yeah
42:02
but he might suddenly you know it's a
42:04
very it's quite an easy process to do
42:06
and back in the day there was a harvard
42:07
professor who thought about this and
42:08
thought
42:09
actually we need to make it a bit harder
42:11
we need to make it a big decision for
42:12
the president to do so this is what he
42:14
suggested he said my suggestion
42:16
was quite simple put the code
42:19
that you needed to launch the nuclear
42:21
warheads
42:22
in a little capsule implant that capsule
42:25
right next to the heart of a volunteer
42:28
the volunteer would carry with him a big
42:30
butcher's knife as he accompanied the
42:32
president
42:33
if the president ever wanted to fire the
42:35
nuclear weapons the only way he would do
42:37
so
42:37
would be with his own hands to kill the
42:40
person
42:41
and then to break it out of them in
42:42
order to do it yeah and
42:44
that wasn't a popular suggestion um
42:48
in fact i didn't think they even went
42:50
for it with peter the great who would
42:51
have absolutely loved to do that
42:55
it's in here somewhere although
42:57
interestingly this
42:58
is the carotid i think that's a very
43:02
impractical suggestion it was it's a guy
43:04
roger fisher he was a harvard professor
43:06
he published in the bulletin of atomic
43:07
science
43:08
it was a it was a real thing and it was
43:09
very talkative the president constantly
43:11
be accompanied by this man with a knife
43:15
this absolutely terrified looking man
43:17
with a knife yeah
43:19
um but yeah just to finish that off
43:21
because i found that as well
43:23
um they suggested it to the pentagon
43:24
didn't they yeah and the pentagon said
43:26
my god that's terrible
43:28
having to kill someone would distort the
43:30
president's judgment
43:31
he might never push the button
43:35
really wow
43:39
wow so like you said there are two
43:40
things isn't it there's this card which
43:42
is the biscuit
43:43
yeah and then there's the briefcase
43:44
which is the uh football
43:46
uh the briefcase is manufactured by a
43:48
company called xero haliburton
43:51
okay and zero halliburton they a utah
43:53
firm and they do this
43:55
and the other thing is they do aluminium
43:57
briefcases for hollywood
43:58
so they've made briefcases for 24 west
44:01
wing
44:02
independence day and santa with muscles
44:07
that's the main ones santa with muscles
44:11
is the 79th
44:12
worst rated film in the whole of imdb
44:15
wow no way in the whole thing
44:19
the whole thing there must be billions
44:21
in there but sorry
44:22
they make so they make this they make
44:25
well they're not fake because they need
44:26
to use them in the movies but they're
44:27
these really awesome kind of
44:29
aluminium um briefcases um because the
44:32
guy who invented it
44:33
realized that briefcases are not so good
44:35
and aluminium ones will be better
44:37
and they're good for carrying nuclear
44:38
codes the nuclear codes that they have
44:40
by the way are pretty weird so that
44:42
it's basically two lists and they're
44:44
pictorial
44:45
and their one list is um places to bomb
44:49
and the other one
44:50
is how to bomb them so you basically go
44:53
down you go i'll go
44:55
for this one pyongyang and this one uh
44:58
big fuck-off bomb and you just wow i
45:02
can't believe the one thing keeping the
45:03
world safe was the idea that trump would
45:04
have to read more than six words
45:08
a military to bill clinton said it was
45:10
like a denny's breakfast menu
45:11
yeah he said you pick one out of column
45:13
a and two out of column b
45:17
i wonder how seriously this because we
45:19
you know it's obviously you know it
45:20
scares you to hear that this thing
45:22
exists
45:22
generally i think um but i don't know
45:24
how seriously they took it so the fact
45:25
is about jimmy carter having sent it
45:28
accidentally the codes to the dry
45:30
cleaners when jimmy carter
45:32
first got the nuclear football it was
45:33
given to him by the lbj
45:36
presidential uh administration and when
45:38
it was brought to him the guy looked
45:40
inside the briefcase
45:41
when he first opened it in the in the
45:43
companionship of
45:45
the companionship when he was with jimmy
45:47
carter
45:48
and inside it when they opened it they
45:49
found that the previous administration
45:51
was having a bit of a joke because they
45:52
left inside it an
45:53
empty beer can and a condom
45:57
not for humans for horses and that was
45:59
inside
46:00
the most deadly bag that a president
46:02
could have next to them
46:03
and he didn't tell jimmy carty close and
46:05
he went yep it's all good and jimmy
46:06
carter
46:08
never found out about that what yeah
46:11
sorry horses have condoms i didn't know
46:12
that either
46:13
no yeah for me is the headline from that
46:15
story yeah yeah
46:17
how do they put them on
46:20
um yeah i've not even thought about
46:23
nobody knows
46:24
unknown us nukes yeah so there is a
46:28
secretive us agency and their job is to
46:30
transport all the nuclear material
46:32
around america
46:33
because obviously you've got loads of
46:34
missile silos you've got loads of
46:35
nuclear sites
46:36
and very few people know about this uh
46:39
but they're called the office of secure
46:41
transportation and their vehicles sound
46:43
absolutely insane so the defenses
46:45
obviously
46:46
they've got convoys they go with but the
46:48
defenses include
46:49
shock delivering systems which basically
46:51
means if you touch it it electrocutes
46:53
you
46:54
they've got axles which explode so you
46:56
can't drive them away
46:57
even if you do manage to take over it
46:59
and they also have
47:00
thick walls which ooze immobilizing foam
47:05
wow so if you are wrong and you touch
47:08
the
47:08
lorry it just oozes out at you and then
47:11
catches you like you're on fly paper
47:14
it's so weird because foam isn't that
47:15
immobilizing
47:21
to think of how difficult it is to get
47:22
out of the yeah
47:24
they have special stuff don't they i
47:26
think it's special it's a special phone
47:28
special phone it's a mobilizing foam got
47:30
it not palm olive
47:31
black favorite bubble bars we're gonna
47:34
have to wrap up in a sec
47:36
anything before we do guys um i can tell
47:39
you
47:39
that we've been talking about american
47:41
nuclear bombs we have nuclear bombs as
47:43
well in the uk
47:44
and it is technically legal for prince
47:46
charles to set off a nuclear bomb
47:48
no that's true it's because he is the
47:52
duke of cornwall
47:54
and if you're duke of cornwall there's a
47:56
few laws that you technically don't have
47:57
to follow
47:58
and one of them is the nuclear
47:59
explosions act
48:02
another one is the data protection act
48:04
and another one is the wildlife and
48:05
countryside act
48:07
so it means as well as being able to set
48:09
off nuclear bombs he can share your
48:11
email address with third parties
48:15
and technically he's allowed to shoot a
48:18
great crested mute with a machine gun
48:20

00:34

02:08
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:11
no such thing as a fish
02:13
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
02:15
from dunstable
02:27
hey my name is dan schreiber and i am
02:31
sitting here with
02:32
anna chazinski andrew hunter murray and
02:34
james harkin
02:35
and once again we have gathered round
02:37
the microphones with our four favorite
02:39
facts from the last seven days
02:40
and in no particular order here we go
02:43
starting with you
02:44
james harkin okay my fact this week is
02:46
that king
02:47
ferdinand of bulgaria was so scared of
02:50
being murdered on the orient express
02:53
that he locked himself in the toilet wow
02:57
had he read the book is that why so
03:01
amazingly enough this happened at the
03:02
turn of the 20th century
03:04
so it happened before the book so the
03:06
book came it came out before the book
03:08
which came out in 1934
03:10
and before the film which came out two
03:11
weeks ago
03:15
wow look himself in the toilet for the
03:17
whole journey do we know no we well we
03:19
know that he definitely didn't do it for
03:20
the whole journey because one thing we
03:22
do know is that as soon as they got into
03:23
bulgaria
03:24
he decided he wanted to drive the train
03:30
and isn't it the case that when he got
03:32
given the controls i know that it's very
03:34
hard to mess up
03:35
driving a train because you're on a
03:36
track but he would put the speed up
03:39
because he was a speed freak
03:40
and it would go exceptionally fast and
03:43
they were worried that it was going to
03:44
derail because he was just
03:46
loving the yeah that's true do we know
03:48
why he was so
03:49
i mean were people after his head or
03:51
were trained just known for murder
03:53
in the olden days it's a bit of the
03:55
first bit actually because
03:56
um it was just after he'd become um king
03:59
and he was known as foxy ferdinand
04:02
oh and he was known as that because he
04:04
was a bit of a dandy
04:06
okay and um to start with he wasn't very
04:08
popular for instance queen victoria said
04:10
he is totally
04:11
unfit delicate eccentric and effeminate
04:14
and he should be stopped at once
04:18
and in his country by the end they loved
04:20
him but to start off with he was quite
04:22
unpopular
04:23
he was wasn't he he was he was sort of a
04:25
wimp i think so
04:26
his mum seemed to control a lot of his
04:28
life like for instance his mum got him
04:30
the job as king
04:31
and it i mean that
04:35
that is how monarchy works
04:36
[Laughter]
04:39
but that's not how it works here is it
04:41
because it's not she
04:42
she bought him the job so bulgaria um it
04:45
was very unpopular the job as king of
04:47
bulgaria at that point because i think
04:48
there was a lot of
04:49
controversy there was a lot of intrigue
04:52
and corruption
04:52
in royal circles so the job actually the
04:55
throne
04:56
as they called it was offered to a bunch
04:57
of other people before it was offered to
04:59
him so it was offered to the princesses
05:00
of denmark
05:01
to princes from the caucasus to the king
05:03
of romania and they all said
05:05
no i think i'm all right thanks and so
05:07
eventually
05:08
um foxy ferdinand's mum said all right
05:11
if i give you this amount of money will
05:12
you let my son be king
05:14
of this place and that's how we got
05:15
there which is so embarrassing
05:17
king edward of britain died in 1910
05:20
and um foxy ferdi was on the way to the
05:22
funeral and
05:24
he got a massive argument over where his
05:26
private railway carriage should go in
05:28
the train because
05:28
you know things of precedence he thought
05:30
well my carriage should obviously be
05:32
right at the front behind the driver
05:33
and he lost to archduke franz ferdinand
05:36
so archduke franz ferdinand got his
05:37
carriage to go right behind the driver
05:39
um but that meant that archduke would
05:43
have to pass through king ferdinand's
05:44
carriage to get to the dining car
05:46
and ferdinand just locked the door
05:50
you just said no you're not coming
05:51
through but things all worked out okay
05:54
for franz ferdinand didn't they
05:55
so on the bright side
05:59
it's actually a really nice thing too
06:01
soon weirdly
06:04
i think when it's over 100 years you're
06:05
in the clear yeah um
06:07
it's weird we have talked about him
06:09
before if you've listened to the podcast
06:11
for a while
06:11
it's quite nice because one of our main
06:14
podcast facts about two years ago
06:16
was that kaiser wilhelm once slapped him
06:19
on the bottom
06:20
and he was so offended by this that he
06:22
was going to give him an arms contract
06:23
but then he gave it away to someone else
06:25
and in that show we talked about kaiser
06:26
wilhelm a lot so now we're kind of
06:27
coming back
06:28
like if you did a series you covered it
06:31
from the other angle
06:32
we are yeah he was very upset about the
06:34
bottom slapping
06:36
it's like that new episode of 50 shades
06:37
of grey isn't it from
06:39
gray's side i didn't know that was what
06:41
it was with the slapping part yes
06:44
a lot of lots of body slapping in 50
06:46
shades of grey i gather i i think
06:48
it's written a bit different to how you
06:50
just
06:52
he walked in saw the body
06:55
that's getting a slap he said
06:59
he'll james i really regret getting
07:01
andrew onto murray to ghostwrite the
07:02
second one
07:06
i read another another method of how a
07:09
bulgarian or in this case all of
07:11
bulgaria
07:12
um avoided being killed and it is and
07:15
i've been i've been assured that this is
07:16
not true but i think it's worth saying
07:18
um and the nice thing is we've now got
07:21
that on tape so you can stitch that
07:23
before any fact dan says in the future
07:24
ever
07:25
no but so this is true in bulgaria when
07:29
a bulgarian
07:30
is signaling yes when you ask them a
07:32
question
07:33
they do it with a horizontal they shake
07:36
their head they shake their head
07:37
as an as what we would know as no they
07:39
shake as a yes and when you ask a
07:41
question
07:41
that is a yes answer they don't do a
07:44
full nod but they do
07:45
they do an up which is what we would
07:47
take to be
07:48
yes right is that sorry someone just
07:50
said yes do we have a bulgarian that is
07:52
true
07:52
yeah so that i don't know what it is we
07:55
won't know whether they are in the
07:56
audience because are you a bulgarian
07:58
yes well well confusingly apparently if
08:02
you're talking to a bulgarian and they
08:04
know that you're uh from some other
08:06
country
08:06
they then reappropriate it so they do
08:09
that the opposite way so it's very
08:10
confusing because you don't know which
08:11
one is the right answer to it
08:13
this whole thing was about how they
08:14
stopped being killed yes
08:16
yes so apparently this goes back to the
08:20
ottoman times and this is when turks
08:22
used to hold
08:23
um a sword to the neck of them and to
08:26
the bulgarians and ask them and it was
08:28
on an angle to ask them
08:30
are you a christian and to say that they
08:33
were
08:33
they had to change it because that was
08:34
the most that was the most efficient way
08:36
to not slice their neck through a
08:38
movement of a
08:39
sword being held tightly they could have
08:40
just said it
08:43
ah
08:47
they could have just said it yeah i
08:48
didn't that's why i was told it's not
08:50
true
08:51
okay but worth saying right
08:54
oh yeah yeah it's certainly worth saying
08:57
oh yeah um
08:58
the orion express was was amazing though
09:00
even more amazing than that
09:02
um it was amazing because so many great
09:04
people traveled on it
09:05
it was you know this if you were famous
09:07
or if you're a world leader then you
09:09
traveled on it um so
09:10
king leopold used it to transport
09:13
himself to constantinople where he'd
09:15
arranged made some complicated
09:16
arrangements with a harem
09:18
to infiltrate harem so he could get
09:19
involved in that um the president of
09:22
france traveled on it at one point this
09:23
is actually in 1920
09:25
and in 1920 what happened was uh there
09:28
was a guy working the signal box
09:30
and a man wearing pajamas stumbled up to
09:32
him in the middle of the night and said
09:33
hey
09:34
please help me i've just fallen off the
09:35
train i've fallen out of the window and
09:37
off the train
09:37
i'm the president of france and the guy
09:41
in the signal box said
09:42
and i'm napoleon bonaparte according to
09:45
those accounts but it turned out it was
09:47
actually the president of france it was
09:48
paul deschanel of france he'd fallen out
09:50
of the window of the orient express
09:52
and he had to resign very shortly
09:54
afterwards because it was so humiliating
09:57
i mean it was slightly to do with that
09:58
it was also slightly to do the fact that
10:00
he'd recently received the british
10:02
ambassador to france
10:03
naked except for the ceremonial
10:05
decorations of his office
10:08
and that he'd walked out of a state
10:09
meeting straight into a lake fully
10:11
clothed
10:13
so there's a few other circumstances
10:14
going on there as well as the orient
10:16
express thing
10:16
it was the straw that broke the camel's
10:18
back and it was a it's what he told his
10:20
wife
10:21
it's when i fell off the train that's
10:22
why i did it
10:24
i have some stuff about sort of luxury
10:26
trains okay so
10:28
did you know that in the in the early
10:29
days of uh rail
10:31
lots of uh very wealthy people had their
10:33
own private train carriages
10:35
and you could just pay and have your
10:36
train carriage kind of put onto a train
10:39
oh like the queen has one of those
10:40
doesn't she well she's got a whole train
10:41
in fact
10:42
um but for example um
10:45
there were private carriages and there
10:46
were family carriages which you could
10:48
just get a carriage
10:48
just for you and your family and you
10:50
would attach it to a train and then
10:51
change it
10:52
and at the start of the 20th century
10:55
manchester had several
10:56
gentlemen's club carriages not in the
10:58
spearmint rhino sense guys
11:01
they would have clubs you would pay a
11:03
subscription and then you would get to
11:04
use that railway carriage
11:06
and there were lockers and you you had
11:07
to be elected and you had to obey the
11:09
rules
11:09
specifically the rules about whether you
11:10
could open the window or not when it was
11:12
appropriate
11:13
wow and you had to turn up to the
11:14
station on time presumably you didn't
11:16
have to
11:16
yeah you just had you had access to the
11:18
train carriage if you joined the club
11:20
and there were it was a gentleman's club
11:22
on wheels yeah yeah okay fun
11:25
um something well you know
11:28
it's nice to give james something to
11:29
edit isn't it
11:31
i think we're giving him too much to
11:33
edit at this point
11:35
you know the uh the orange express um
11:37
the first murder that happened on the
11:39
orange express was the year
11:40
after agatha christie published her
11:42
novel was it yeah
11:44
yeah and also well do you know how the
11:46
person was caught no no what happened
11:48
um it's a really cool story so basically
11:50
there was a woman who was pushed out of
11:52
a window who
11:52
so who was killed and then pushed out of
11:54
a window it's not cool so far anna
11:58
it's extremely harrowing sorry for the
12:01
record
12:01
too soon
12:05
sorry it was 1935 so it's a bit too soon
12:08
she was pushed out of the window and her
12:09
body was found on the tracks and all of
12:11
her possessions
12:11
except for a silver fox scarf so a
12:14
foxcan scarf that she'd been wearing
12:16
and then by total chance so this got
12:18
around that the scarf was missing
12:20
and a policeman in switzerland a few
12:22
weeks later spotted a silver fox scarf
12:24
being worn by a woman
12:25
and then went up to her and said where
12:26
did you get that and she said from this
12:28
guy and it turned out that guy had done
12:30
the murder
12:30
wow larry the murderer gave it to me
12:33
the murderer yeah i got it from a guy
12:36
who called himself
12:36
mr murderer crazy to give away the one
12:40
bit of evidence that links you to a
12:41
crime to a random person
12:43
it was pretty stupid it was very stupid
12:45
yeah
12:46
um so the surrender at the end of world
12:48
war one was signed on the orient express
12:50
it was it was signed in a particular
12:52
carriage which in 1940
12:54
hitler ordered to behold to the precise
12:57
spot where it happened
12:58
and that's where he organized the terms
13:00
of the french surrender
13:02
he was an absolute dick he was such a
13:04
prick
13:04
[Applause]
13:06
like you've just beaten france okay a
13:08
great military power you don't need to
13:10
go on about it even by hitler's
13:12
standards that's pretty petty isn't it
13:13
it's so crazy and you know what he did
13:15
next
13:16
when he started losing the war he had
13:18
that train carriage blown up so they
13:19
couldn't make him surrender in it again
13:21
what
13:22
hitler forget the train carriage
13:25
god the more i hear about this guy
13:26
[Laughter]
13:31
um we need to move on to our second pack
13:33
guys i just have one tiny thing yeah
13:34
yeah yeah i go if this is about the
13:36
queen's
13:36
private train oh he's got the royal
13:37
train uh and it's actually pretty dowdy
13:40
inside it's not you know really blingy
13:41
and uh louis the 14th issue it's pretty
13:43
cool
13:43
and calm anyway there's just one thing
13:46
that happened in it which i really like
13:47
so um it travels around the country to
13:49
pick up the royals and drop them off and
13:50
so on and once it was on its way to pick
13:52
up prince charles for a royal function
13:54
and it stopped very briefly at a station
13:57
but nobody noticed
13:58
a middle-aged woman on the platform to
14:00
see it and get on
14:02
and she just sat at one of the tables in
14:04
the dining car and it is quite well
14:05
decorated and popular it's not a
14:07
standard train
14:08
and she just sat there and a member of
14:09
staff was walking through and said you
14:11
do know this is the queen's train don't
14:12
you and she said no i did not know that
14:16
and sorry when do we get to slough
14:20
and she was given some light
14:21
refreshments and then escorted off at
14:22
the next stop
14:23
ah i should have let her stay
14:26
and she's out there somewhere but she
14:28
knows the other side of this story
14:30
let's move on to our next fact okay it
14:32
is time for fact number two and that is
14:34
my fact my fact this week is that the
14:37
new goalie
14:37
of the ice hockey team the belfast
14:40
giants
14:41
is allergic to ice
14:45
allergic to eyes that is amazing yeah
14:47
and um
14:49
how how do we know he's allergic twice
14:51
he's he's told us
14:52
um they noticed when after a match he
14:54
went into a really cold bath
14:56
and as he was sitting in the ice-cold
14:58
bath that they have he was breaking out
15:00
on top and then
15:01
the the breakout which was sort of
15:03
raised red lumps got really dark below
15:05
and they quickly got him out and they
15:06
said
15:06
you have this disease which is a
15:09
condition of
15:10
um uh you're just allergic to cold
15:12
temperatures
15:13
uh you're highly sensitive to it and so
15:16
as a result
15:16
when he is playing on the ice um
15:19
he doesn't he can't stay still he has to
15:22
keep his blood circulating and moving
15:23
around and so yeah so when the game is
15:25
going on on the other side of
15:27
the of the um the ice uh what's it
15:30
rank the rink the rink um
15:34
he's there sort of just because the
15:36
other side of the ice implies a
15:37
undecided yeah yeah that's okay
15:40
so this guy's called chris truell um and
15:43
he started playing with the belfast
15:44
giants i believe he's a junior goalie
15:46
um he's he's so there's three of them
15:49
and uh yeah so he just constantly has to
15:51
move around
15:52
goalie that's the thing so does he
15:53
sometimes have to move around out of the
15:55
goal
15:55
mouth this is the problem yeah i mean i
15:58
i
15:58
yeah i don't know if it is a problem but
16:00
i assume that that is a problem
16:02
sounds like a problem yeah it does
16:04
doesn't it yeah i think he's actually
16:05
he's really cool about it though if you
16:06
watch an interview he's very much like
16:07
he's not too cool
16:08
because he's great yeah it's an allergy
16:12
to the cold right yeah it's not
16:14
because there's a different allergy
16:15
which is an allergy to water
16:17
um which is like you can be allergic to
16:19
your own tears and stuff can't you so
16:21
every time you cry you then cry
16:22
even more um but it's not that it's the
16:25
the coldness of it yeah it's cool
16:27
so i've been avoid saying the word
16:28
because i can't i can't pronounce it but
16:30
it's
16:30
urtecharia that's the is that they're
16:32
pronounced right
16:34
that's the that's the condition that he
16:35
has and the the test for it
16:37
is very simple the doctor will just hold
16:39
a piece of ice against you
16:41
and then see if you come out in a red
16:42
lump yeah i mean that makes sense right
16:45
i'm not saying there's a better test no
16:48
i mean i mean that literally is the test
16:50
it's like finding out if you're allergic
16:51
to bees by a doctor holding a b to you
16:53
and letting it is that the test for b
16:55
allergies
16:57
it's it seems like it couldn't be doctor
17:00
the doctor doesn't say hey eat a load of
17:01
these walnuts and we'll see what happens
17:03
well yeah
17:05
all right you're fine on those let's see
17:06
if you're allergic to wasps all right
17:07
let's bring that up
17:10
do you know what one way of telling if
17:11
you've got an allergic reaction is which
17:13
i've never heard of is something called
17:14
baboon syndrome
17:16
and that's well what what would you
17:19
guess what's the
17:20
defining oh you get a big you get a big
17:23
bum-bum of uh
17:24
red yeah fifty shades of grey again
17:31
and then he came in with a big bum of
17:33
bread
17:35
yeah it's having a big red bum and it's
17:37
one of the ways you can exhibit allergic
17:39
reaction is bright red buttocks
17:40
a particularly uh penicillin reaction or
17:43
like a nickel reaction
17:44
specifically to the bum specifically to
17:46
the bun i mean you can just have eaten
17:47
some penicillin and then your bum goes
17:49
red
17:49
yeah that's amazing it's a boon syndrome
17:53
yeah i have another ironic sports
17:55
allergy oh yeah there's a jockey a very
17:57
young jockey called sean bowen and he
17:58
raced in the grand national a couple of
18:00
years ago
18:00
as a child he was allergic to horses and
18:03
he grew up he would get exempt any time
18:04
he went near a horse
18:06
but then he grew out of it and then he
18:07
would practice by sitting on a sofa and
18:10
whipping it
18:12
you'd sit on the arm of the sofa and
18:14
thrash it oh that's so funny
18:16
do you know who else was allergic to
18:17
horses clint eastwood no
18:19
no way all his movies he had stunt
18:22
doubles and he would do it but he would
18:24
break out if he was on a horse for too
18:26
long but yeah clint eastwood allergic to
18:27
horses
18:28
that's why he looks so pissed off all
18:29
the time yeah
18:31
anna before you were saying about the
18:32
person who was allergic to the wrong
18:34
tears
18:35
there was a woman who was allergic to
18:37
the allergy medicine she took to deal
18:39
with her allergies oh man
18:43
so basically she got ill with some other
18:45
allergy
18:46
and then she took an antihistamine
18:47
called benadryl and then that caused her
18:50
shortness of breath
18:51
wheezing and she went to hospital and
18:53
then when she was in hospital they gave
18:54
her more benadryl
18:59
harrison schmidt apollo astronaut
19:02
harrison schmidt one of the only people
19:04
to land on the moon
19:05
was allergic to the moon oh yeah can you
19:07
believe that though he was allergic to
19:08
the moon so you might think that's
19:10
really weird because you're in a suit
19:11
when you get
19:12
onto the moon it was when he got back
19:14
off the moon
19:15
into the capsule and they took the suit
19:17
off and the supposedly the the smell is
19:19
of
19:19
like gunpowder sort of smell that is
19:22
what gave him the allergies and he he
19:24
broke out as well in sort of in hives so
19:26
one of the
19:27
only and there's only 12 people have
19:28
landed on the moon and one of them was
19:30
allergic to
19:31
the moon i mean that's amazing that's
19:33
pretty huge right and there's no way of
19:35
testing before you go
19:36
how do you test how do you test um
19:38
tennis player
19:39
clayton hewitt uh allergic to grass as
19:42
in the
19:42
as in the the floor of the wimbledon
19:45
courts yeah not not
19:46
weed you know horses can be allergic to
19:48
grass horses can be allergic yeah horses
19:50
get allergic to grass and they have to
19:52
that it's really sad so there's a woman
19:54
who's got a horse and you have to cover
19:56
them in this big
19:57
anti-allergy sock from head to toe and
20:00
they allergic you get allergies to grass
20:03
and hay
20:04
and seeds all the nuts and seeds that
20:06
they get fed it's amazing that you can
20:08
describe a murder
20:10
as pretty cool but a horse wearing a
20:12
giant sock is somehow really sad
20:15
i know yeah it's because they get weepy
20:18
they genuinely get weepy
20:20
they cry tears and they get itchy and
20:22
they get sneezy
20:24
which of the other dwarfs do they get
20:31
the cue the cure for it is to rub on
20:33
some dock
20:35
there we go all right
20:38
um so if you're hypersensitive of the
20:41
whole
20:41
of just everything like electricity and
20:43
stuff you can go to a town in america
20:46
uh it's in arizona it's called snowflake
20:49
no okay and it doesn't get its name
20:51
because it's full of snowflakes like
20:52
moaning millennials or whatever
20:54
it gets its name because it was founded
20:56
by two people called erastus snow
20:58
and william jordan flake no way
21:02
[Music]
21:04
what that's incredible isn't that
21:05
amazing do you think they thought well
21:07
we better found something now
21:08
because we've met what do you think
21:10
flakes know
21:11
[Laughter]
21:13
wait and so they founded a town for
21:15
people to escape their allergies
21:17
no they founded a town they were mormon
21:18
pioneers but they founded it well away
21:20
from
21:21
cities and stuff like that so if you're
21:22
allergic to wi-fi and
21:24
or you think you are and electricity and
21:25
stuff like that then this is a place
21:27
where you can go and be away from that
21:28
where did he say it was it's in arizona
21:30
arizona oh that's yeah really remote a
21:32
lot some of it is yeah
21:33
phoenix when was that was that 19th
21:36
century
21:37
well they it was founded in 1878 but
21:40
people are going there now
21:41
but they this was a real thing when
21:43
allergies came into the world hey we
21:44
don't know where the hell they appeared
21:46
in the world it was in the 19th century
21:48
and then b it became a really
21:49
fashionable thing because it was the
21:50
wealthier classes that were allergic to
21:52
stuff wasn't it
21:53
and so there began to be hay fever
21:55
holidays that were
21:57
recommended and that would be if you
21:58
lived in new york the idea was that you
22:00
were getting allergic reactions to the
22:01
city like you say
22:03
so lake superior and the white mountain
22:05
new hampshire
22:06
they would all advertise like hay fever
22:08
holidays or allergy escapes
22:10
which is a way to get away from your
22:11
allergies it was it was a very
22:13
fashionable thing to have
22:15
that's very cool anything about hockey
22:17
about ice hockey yeah sure
22:18
um so this sounds quite cool um
22:20
underwater ice hockey
22:23
wow it's played upside down underneath
22:26
frozen pools no so that is the other
22:29
side
22:29
of the ice that i was talking about wow
22:32
and they use a wooden puck so it floats
22:35
and um basically you can only stay under
22:37
they don't use breathing apparatus so
22:38
you can only stay underwater for 30
22:40
seconds and then you go back up and then
22:41
you go back down again and it's
22:43
it's next goal wins so it's only one
22:45
goal whoever scores first wins
22:47
wow is it they're not wearing all the
22:49
hockey stuff are they
22:50
well they have a stick they have a stick
22:52
but are they in trunks and with a stick
22:54
trunks and stick that is amazing yeah
22:57
don't confuse it with underwater hockey
23:00
um
23:00
the world to hockey is on the floor of a
23:02
swimming pool with a sinking puck
23:04
so you have a really heavy sinking
23:06
pockets on the bottom and you're playing
23:07
it along the bottom of a swimming pool
23:09
but how can you
23:09
can you hit something underwater and
23:11
have momentum yes momentum still works
23:14
underwater
23:15
i mean the laws of physics still work
23:17
underwater but you are right that it's
23:19
more viscous so it would be more
23:20
difficult that would be really hard
23:22
right you would hit it and it would
23:23
yeah the whole thing sounds harder
23:27
almost everything is harder underwater
23:30
swimming's not swimming
23:31
swimming is one of the very few
23:32
exceptions to this rule then
23:35
but mostly you have a frying egg
23:37
underwater it's a nightmare
23:39
that's true poaching an egg andy
23:42
[Laughter]
23:48
um no ice hockey yeah go on yeah um just
23:51
i became obsessed with the fights in ice
23:52
hockey oh yes
23:53
oh my goodness there are so many fights
23:55
oh yeah and um i i didn't know anything
23:57
about ice hockey and i think you
23:58
watched it a lot i watch it oh you watch
24:00
it a lot yeah um
24:01
but i didn't know that they were
24:03
regulated as
24:04
uh fisty cuffs in the rule book of ice
24:07
hockey and
24:08
you know it's there are lots of
24:10
unwritten rules as well so you have to
24:11
agree to a fight
24:12
and you can't hit someone with your
24:14
stick yeah i mean they still do but
24:16
you're not supposed to
24:17
but you would have one player on your
24:18
team who's kind of the guy who does the
24:20
fighting
24:21
and how does he is he only allowed to
24:23
fight the other team's fighter guy
24:25
um could he fight they're the guy
24:26
they're the guys who kind of start it
24:28
and then everyone gets in on the act
24:30
okay but you they're called the enforcer
24:32
basically and you would have
24:33
if say the other team is doing really
24:35
well and you kind of want to stop them
24:36
in their tracks a little bit then you
24:38
might start a fight to try and put them
24:39
off and then you might
24:41
carry on but it's andy have you seen it
24:44
a bit of it yeah yeah so it's they it's
24:47
actively
24:48
not officially but it's actively
24:49
encouraged by the crowd and it's part of
24:51
the game yeah so they throw their gloves
24:53
off they take their helmet off
24:54
they they go around each other with
24:56
their fists like that and then they
24:58
they absolutely wallop each other and
25:00
it's part of the tradition it happened
25:02
in fact in the first game
25:03
ever first ever ice hockey game it was
25:05
it was
25:06
uh not between the hockey players um it
25:08
was between the ice hockey players
25:10
and the ice skaters who were pissed off
25:12
that they'd taken their ring
25:14
and it was after the match so it didn't
25:16
get reported but there was a fight
25:18
yeah in the very first ever yeah
25:21
sometimes it goes a little bit too far i
25:22
read about one russian game between
25:24
avangard and vitiaz
25:26
the fighting in that game started after
25:28
three minutes
25:29
um actually it was three minutes 27 when
25:32
a brawl takes place between basically
25:34
all the players of both teams
25:36
okay a few of the players were sent to
25:38
the simbin and then they started the
25:40
game again
25:40
and three seconds later another fight
25:43
started
25:44
and then eight more players were sent
25:46
off and then the game started again
25:48
and then two seconds later there was a
25:50
third fight
25:52
and then at that stage so many people
25:53
have been sent off that they couldn't
25:54
carry on the game so they just abandoned
25:56
it oh my god
25:57
and both teams were given a five nil
25:59
defeat those
26:01
teams lost five nil how did you do
26:03
darling well we lost but so do the other
26:04
guys
26:06
hey we need to move on to our next fact
26:08
very shortly should i move us on now yes
26:10
we should ready to go yeah
26:11
okay it is time for fact number three
26:14
and that
26:15
is andrew hunter murray my fact is that
26:17
after
26:18
every festival the founder of
26:19
glastonbury has to drive around his farm
26:22
with a giant magnet
26:24
and the reason he has to do that is that
26:25
there are tent pegs left
26:27
across his entire farm in the ground and
26:29
you can't see them
26:30
so there's a specially customized
26:32
tractor with a giant magnet strapped
26:34
onto the front of it
26:35
wow which he drives around it weighs
26:37
over a ton i think he has someone to do
26:39
it for him because he's quite old now
26:40
michael eva's
26:41
but what do you reckon it weighs after
26:42
he's done doing it
26:45
i guess 100 or 150 tons wow
26:49
i don't i
26:53
that's crazy i know it's nuts isn't that
26:56
why do you have the actual answer dan
26:58
no i'm just curious because you're
27:01
adding metal to metal
27:03
and then that adds up yeah no it is
27:05
you're like you're not wrong
27:06
yeah it's true but i reckon if these
27:09
guys hadn't laughed you'd have taken 150
27:11
tons because i'm not sure you know what
27:12
a ton is that not the answer
27:14
that's not the answer
27:18
but something in that region yes no no
27:20
no no no
27:21
no no we're in that region okay i i
27:24
i don't know i'm afraid but there are
27:26
thousands and thousands of tents which
27:28
get abandoned yeah
27:29
and they need to pick them up because in
27:30
the past cows have been grazing on
27:32
these tent pegs and it can it can injure
27:34
them quite badly yeah
27:36
yeah well they yeah yeah they choke for
27:38
cows because he's got a very successful
27:40
dairy i didn't quite realize that
27:41
michael evas is
27:42
one of the most successful dairy farmers
27:44
in the area so the guy
27:46
who founded it yeah and that's why so
27:48
quite famously i think at the first
27:49
glastonbury ever
27:50
you got free pint of milk i think
27:53
it was one pound to get in wasn't it one
27:55
pound to get in you got a free bottle of
27:57
milk
27:57
yeah and then the most recent
27:59
glastonbury you could see pole dancing
28:01
robots
28:02
make a cucumber trumpet and jump off a
28:05
troller ship
28:05
shaped like a fish it's lost its way
28:08
hasn't it it's lost its way
28:10
no free milk do you get free milk still
28:12
no mate bloody hell
28:14
he does he's a judge of cheese
28:15
competitions though he's not from some
28:17
dairy
28:18
festival not at the festival no no i've
28:21
completely misunderstood what the
28:22
festival is like i think
28:23
i've never been um the very first one it
28:26
was in 1970 and it was called worthy
28:28
farm pop festival and the bieb had a
28:30
great article about the the
28:31
first glastonbury and they put up one of
28:33
the flyers for it and the flyers it was
28:35
so sweet they said
28:37
the the acts will include the kinks
28:39
wayne fontana
28:40
and at least six other groups
28:44
and in the event neither the kinks nor
28:45
wayne fontana turned out
28:48
wow did the six others turn up uh well
28:51
t-rex turned up to replace the
28:52
headliners so
28:53
yeah oh yeah and that's that's uh
28:56
famously where t-rex exploded into the
28:58
uh popular consciousness of the british
29:00
public
29:01
yeah i'd memorized that sentence from
29:04
the article that i read
29:06
um so what year was that 1970 1970 right
29:10
god so we're he's been going for he's
29:12
quite old now michael yes he's
29:13
he's 80s yeah he's very cool though so
29:16
he
29:17
everyone probably watched glastonbury
29:18
this year and he jeremy corbyn was there
29:21
and got up on stage so jeremy corbyn is
29:24
a parliamentary beard of the year
29:26
winner and actually michael evis if you
29:29
can picture him has a very impressive
29:30
beard to himself
29:32
and he um went up on stage with jeremy
29:34
corbyn jeremy corbyn gave him the labor
29:36
manifesto
29:37
and as that was being handed over there
29:39
were just two beard legends on stage
29:41
because michael evis
29:42
won beard of the decade in 2009
29:45
wow in the world so he beat fidel castro
29:48
to the top spot
29:49
you're kidding yeah you know there's a
29:51
secret underground piano bar
29:53
at glastonbury what yeah and a reporter
29:55
from the bieb went looking for it
29:57
uh at a recent festival and he reported
30:00
back that
30:01
there is no piano that i can see the bar
30:03
does not turn out to sell alcohol and
30:05
most of it
30:06
is not underground
30:10
and also not a secret now it's been it's
30:12
not a secret either though
30:14
he's against alcohol well he's not again
30:16
he's not a drinker is he the glastonbury
30:18
founder mike levis
30:19
no and he's never taken any drugs he's
30:21
anti-smoking
30:22
he's a real methodist it's i can't tell
30:25
if it's a disappointment or really nice
30:27
but um yeah and he always wears shorts
30:30
this is the thing he's famous for he
30:31
always
30:32
wears shorts whatever time of year it is
30:34
and do you know why he does that
30:38
let's keep his legs cool uh
30:41
that makes a lot of sense he's got uh
30:43
lovely
30:44
calf muscles yes it's that it is that
30:48
he um what he was a
30:51
he's a very famous kind of you know uh
30:54
liberal hippie campaigner and he was an
30:56
anti-thatcher march in the early
30:58
thatcher years
30:59
and he said his gp's wife was walking
31:02
behind me
31:03
and she said do you know michael you've
31:05
got the most amazing legs
31:06
and no one had ever said that to me
31:08
before and so i've worn shorts ever
31:09
since
31:12
i love the idea that baby affects
31:14
everyone so when he meets all the bands
31:16
coldplay will come up to him like hi oh
31:18
my goodness
31:20
what are those just everyone's
31:24
yeah stunned yeah nice and there's some
31:27
other cool festivals from
31:29
the world yeah um the untold festival
31:31
took place in transylvania
31:33
and you could pay with your blood whoa
31:36
yeah if you signed up to become a blood
31:39
donor you got a discount
31:41
and if you showed up in person at a
31:42
center nearby and then you would get a
31:44
free one day ticket on the spot
31:46
wow but wouldn't you be a bit tired to
31:49
enjoy
31:50
the festival yeah it doesn't it tight it
31:52
ties it out doesn't it
31:53
i mean i mean you can still hear music
32:00
yeah it's not too bad a problem i've got
32:02
one james i really like this is from
32:04
last year this
32:05
it was the newfoundland lobster festival
32:08
yeah um and what i like about it is that
32:10
due to a mess-up
32:11
of transporting the lobsters to the
32:13
festival um they didn't have any
32:15
lobsters at the festival
32:17
and so instead everyone had to eat hot
32:18
dogs
32:19
[Laughter]
32:21
it was on an airplane and the airplane
32:23
went to the wrong destination or they
32:24
put it onto the wrong
32:26
carrier yeah so it got delivered to a
32:28
whole different place and they're like
32:28
we're waiting for the lobsters
32:30
why if they have to get their lobsters
32:32
over by played why are they having a
32:34
lobster festival that's a very good
32:35
place i know i'm not sure um
32:37
because maybe they got it from a great
32:38
lobster place like florida or something
32:40
like that then have the festival in
32:42
florida yeah but they live in
32:43
newfoundland
32:44
they can't they can't just really don't
32:46
have the festival no but they want to
32:48
i don't i don't have a caribbean
32:49
festival in south london
32:51
do i yeah but you could because that's
32:54
what people do but why would i fly in
32:55
three tons of sand it doesn't look good
32:58
i just have a south london festival
33:02
okay that's true but where did the
33:03
lobsters end up do we know no i just a
33:05
different place and then the problem is
33:06
is by the time they got there this was
33:08
the complaint they said some of the
33:09
lobsters had died which is what i
33:11
thought you'd want
33:12
when you're about to eat one so that
33:13
shouldn't be a problem do you want oh
33:15
you want them alive right
33:16
now well you keep them alive in your in
33:18
your bath don't you if you buy a lobster
33:19
to eat then
33:20
yeah that's one of the other things
33:21
that's easier to do underwater is keep a
33:23
lobster alive
33:26
so there's three now
33:27
[Applause]
33:27
[Laughter]
33:30
you were just saying about transporting
33:32
these lobsters yeah um there was a mud
33:34
festival
33:35
in new zealand called mud topia and they
33:38
transported
33:39
um five tons of mud from south korea
33:43
wow those mud salesmen must have thought
33:45
all their christmases have come at once
33:48
well we've had another year of no orders
33:49
i guess it's time to shut down the
33:52
mud export business hello it's new
33:55
zealand
33:56
with like five tons of mud five towns
33:59
we've only got four tons we're back to
34:01
going out of business
34:05
that's true and basically i mean just to
34:07
finish it um they needed this mud
34:08
um for the mud festival and they said
34:11
the uh local councillor said i know
34:13
there's a perception that we have enough
34:14
mud ourselves
34:16
but you can't just pull any old mud out
34:18
of the ground and throw it at people
34:20
there could be anything in there that
34:21
might end up making people sick
34:23
so basically the south korean stuff had
34:25
had some kind of
34:26
stuff done to it to stop it making
34:28
people sick it's clean mud clean mud
34:30
wow which is amazing yeah do you know
34:34
that um
34:35
at the reading and these festivals this
34:36
year i don't know if anyone went
34:38
but there was pineapples were banned
34:41
um so there's a list of band stuff on
34:44
you know that you're not allowed to take
34:45
in
34:46
submachine guns or bombs or anything um
34:49
and then pineapples was added to the
34:51
list and that's because of this band
34:52
i've never heard of it probably everyone
34:53
else has called glass animals
34:55
but yeah they've just got a lyric in
34:56
their song which says pineapples are in
34:58
my head and so
34:58
whenever they have a gig everyone who
35:00
comes to the gig apparently brings a
35:01
pineapple
35:02
and they can cause a lot of damage and
35:04
so they have to put on the band list
35:06
what damage what damage can you they're
35:08
spiky yeah they're really really
35:10
super spiky they're really um yeah
35:13
they're really spiky
35:14
yeah you know i didn't think about it
35:18
that way when you said it james so when
35:19
dan back you up
35:21
fair play
35:25
they're spiky okay maybe in future shows
35:28
we can get everyone on the front row to
35:30
throw pineapples at you how would you
35:31
like that
35:32
yeah you've only ever seen them in those
35:34
chopped up cubes in marks and spencer's
35:37
i'm normally being presented them at an
35:39
ambassador's dinner yeah
35:41
in the 70s um did you guys do anything
35:44
on
35:45
magnets at all no yeah yeah yeah come on
35:47
well three out of four ain't bad um
35:50
just quickly have you guys heard of a
35:51
thing called the iron harvest
35:54
because i never heard of this this is
35:55
the thing that happens every year in
35:57
belgium and france
35:58
and it's a harvest literally of iron
36:00
from the first world war
36:02
and it's still turning up in farmer's
36:04
fields across belgium and france yeah
36:06
so um during the first world war for
36:08
every square meter of territory on the
36:10
western front a ton
36:11
of explosives was fired every square
36:13
meter
36:14
so it normally turns a lot down by the
36:16
way yeah
36:19
doesn't sound a lot um
36:22
and so in spring and autumn is when the
36:24
farmers plow their fields and that's
36:25
when the ground
36:26
slowly turns it up and the french mine
36:28
clearing department gets sent about 900
36:30
tons of unexploded bombs
36:32
every year wow a few years ago uh just
36:35
around apra
36:36
itself just around april they got 160
36:39
tons of metal
36:40
which is enough to fill five large
36:42
lorries all first world war stuff
36:44
wow that's crazy do you know something
36:46
they use
36:47
magnets for in the 1930s and early 20th
36:50
century that's quite
36:51
cool like a health thing or it is a
36:54
health thing it's for
36:55
eye problems so i i read this on boing
36:59
boing i think
37:00
which sounds not like a legit website
37:02
that's right
37:03
is brilliant is great it's just the way
37:05
you said it it sounded like a toy
37:07
i read it on boing boing
37:11
so what kind of eye problems might you
37:12
have so you'd have stuff caught in your
37:14
eyes so people used to get iron filings
37:15
caught in their eyes when they worked in
37:17
in industrial you know in factories and
37:19
stuff um and
37:20
there was invented in minneapolis this
37:23
piece of equipment that weighed 800
37:25
pounds so that is the weight of i think
37:27
about
37:27
five full-grown women and it was a
37:30
magnet
37:30
it had the pull of 10 horsepower it
37:32
involved 7 000
37:33
feet of wire and it came towards your
37:36
eye and you have you had a tiny bit of
37:37
metal stuck in the back of it and then
37:39
it sucked the metal out
37:40
wow but but surely it would suck it out
37:43
through your eyes i would have thought
37:45
as well i've only seen
37:47
the advertisements in the british
37:48
newspaper archive i think if you've got
37:50
something in your eye it's not going to
37:51
be directly behind your eyeball probably
37:53
at least
37:54
yeah i wouldn't risk it could come out
37:56
through the lid
37:57
i don't know 10 horsepower is more than
38:00
you need to suck a tiny bit of metal out
38:02
of your eyes
38:07
hey we need to move on to our final fact
38:08
of the show okay
38:10
it is time for our final fact of the
38:12
show and that is
38:13
chezynski my fact this week is that
38:16
uh during world war ii the owners of
38:18
foyle's bookshop
38:20
protected the store from nazi bombs by
38:23
covering the roof in copies of mein
38:25
kampf
38:26
[Laughter]
38:28
so good it's so nice yeah yeah this is
38:31
not that nice is it
38:34
nice is the wrong word yeah um but it
38:36
was it was fitting so this is william
38:38
foyle who
38:38
set out foils and so world war ii
38:41
he filled sandbags with all these old
38:44
books
38:44
and in order to kind of bolster the shop
38:47
against the bombs during the blitz in
38:49
london
38:49
and he said that he was covering the
38:51
roof with copies of minecamp and
38:53
newsreels at the time
38:54
said foils of london is stacked with
38:56
copies of mein kampf in the place of
38:58
sandbags
39:00
yeah so cool just for uh context for
39:03
overseas listeners um we make this
39:06
podcast usually in covent garden
39:08
which is in soho-ish area um
39:11
on sharing crossroad is foyles bookshop
39:14
which is a 15 minute walk from where we
39:17
work and it's one of the most iconic
39:18
book shops in london
39:20
it's a independent bookshop and it was
39:23
known for its eccentricities and it's
39:25
been going for a very long time
39:26
and it's still one of the iconic
39:28
bookshops of london
39:29
yep a minecamp was a book by hitler
39:37
oh what's he done now is it more
39:41
it's not even the only time that the
39:42
foils had a run-in with the nazis
39:44
so in fact earlier than that uh
39:47
christina foyle who was the daughter of
39:48
william the founder um when the nazis
39:51
held their book
39:52
burnings she wrote to adolf hitler
39:54
saying we'll give you a good price we'll
39:55
buy them don't burn them
39:57
which is good and then she the the reply
39:59
was negative but respectful apparently
40:02
yeah and then in 1939 uh christina also
40:05
invited hitler mussolini and stalin
40:08
to speak at one of her literary lunches
40:10
so they used to have these lunches with
40:11
incredible figures from the world of
40:12
literature
40:13
and she invited all three um wow hitler
40:16
replied that he had urgent business in
40:18
germany
40:18
mussolini in poland
40:26
um mussolini said that he might visit
40:28
when things quieted down a bit
40:33
stalin didn't reply didn't he rude
40:38
okay she was a character
40:41
actually and not in a massively positive
40:43
sense maybe
40:44
so she foyles has been through
40:48
some tough times partly because of her
40:50
so she wasn't really a fan
40:52
of her the people who worked in her
40:53
bookshop so she used to summarily sack
40:56
them
40:56
before they'd work for six months
40:58
because after six months you're entitled
41:00
to better employment rights so if you
41:01
work for foils then you get sacked after
41:03
six months
41:04
and this meant that you got quite not
41:05
very good staff and you got not very
41:07
dedicated staff
41:08
and there was a story of someone who
41:10
came in in the 60s or 70s and asked for
41:12
ulysses
41:13
and the person at the till replied that
41:15
ulysses had gone out to lunch but would
41:17
serve them as soon as possible
41:18
all right nice they do they have changed
41:21
that policy now by the way
41:23
i just want to say that because
41:24
hopefully they'll keep stocking our book
41:26
after they attack their hr policies
41:30
the other thing they've changed is uh
41:31
they've changed uh their payment system
41:34
and uh christina was quite uh concerned
41:36
about staff possibly stealing
41:38
uh from the shop um maybe because they
41:40
weren't paid very much but
41:42
um the old payment system designed to
41:44
stop stuff
41:45
designed to stop start stealing went as
41:47
follows you had to queue up
41:49
for the book and then you had to get a
41:50
docket for it from a staff member
41:52
then you had to queue up to pay for the
41:54
book then you would get the docket
41:56
stamped to prove that you had paid for
41:57
the book then you would have to queue up
41:59
a third time at the county you've been
42:01
to first to collect the book
42:02
wow yeah and also she didn't even
42:05
organize her books by
42:07
in any sensible way she organized them
42:08
by publisher didn't she yes
42:11
do you know who all your books are
42:12
published by because
42:15
we're random house by the way an
42:17
excellent company but no you don't
42:18
and you can do it alphabetically or by
42:20
genre no she didn't do you know when
42:22
that lasted until
42:23
that lasted till 1999. no
42:26
yeah we should say because it sounds
42:28
like we're slamming them
42:29
but falls are obviously amazing and also
42:31
all this information is on the most
42:32
brilliant page on
42:34
their website so they're one of these
42:35
sites that obviously has some
42:37
like amazing researcher working for them
42:39
and they've got a really good site for
42:41
his bookshop of their history and
42:42
stories and foils yeah
42:44
check it out she died in 1999 christina
42:46
and she really was the end of an era but
42:48
after she died they had a refit
42:49
in which they discovered a lift that
42:52
nobody knew about
42:54
wow yeah where did it go up and down
42:56
mostly
43:00
[Applause]
43:07
and it's it's just moved like a year ago
43:10
so it was in this iconic
43:12
spot on charing crossroads it's still on
43:13
sharon cross road but it's moved down
43:15
the road but apparently and i i've
43:16
i went to it many times i'm sure you
43:18
guys did as well um
43:20
it was a labyrinth of these different
43:22
weird
43:23
tiny crevices you could get you know you
43:25
find yourself hours going a new spot in
43:27
the bookshop you didn't
43:28
know existed and they had it was a sort
43:30
of in-joke amongst them at the shop
43:31
because they had an in-house staff
43:33
magazine
43:33
and they always had a lost property
43:35
section in the uh
43:37
you know found lost and found and uh one
43:39
of the things that they wrote was
43:40
found paul potter of made a vale after
43:42
wandering for an hour trying to find his
43:44
way out
43:45
that happened that happened a lot where
43:47
people
43:48
customers would just get lost and you
43:49
know the partners would be like have you
43:51
seen my husband they're like
43:52
do you have an hour because we will we
43:54
will flash as your husband because we
43:56
may have it
43:59
so christina ran the bookshop after her
44:02
father william
44:03
retired in 1945 and she ran it until the
44:05
90s and she claimed that
44:07
she read an entire book every day had
44:09
never done her own housework or cooking
44:11
and she only ever drank champagne um
44:16
she was asked what would happen if she
44:17
lost her chef and she said there was
44:19
always milk champagne and smoked salmon
44:21
in the fridge
44:22
[Laughter]
44:23
wow minecamp yeah no
44:27
really uh current bestseller rank on
44:31
amazon
44:31
yeah uh 1471
44:34
284 okay so they're beating us are they
44:37
[Laughter]
44:41
they the minecamp team
44:44
but it's not even in the top 700 in the
44:47
fascism category
44:48
oh
44:54
but fascism and nazi books do sell
44:57
there's a famous story about alan curran
45:00
the famous witch system father of
45:01
victoria corin
45:02
and he noticed that the most popular
45:04
titles in britain in those days were
45:06
about cats
45:07
golf and nazis and so he called his book
45:10
golfing for cats and put a massive
45:12
swastika on the cover
45:19
uh the one thing i didn't know about
45:21
minecamp is that it had an accompanying
45:22
picture book
45:25
not even kidding really it was called
45:26
the hitler nobody knows
45:29
and it was designed to improve hitler's
45:31
public image because
45:32
and his image was very very bad at the
45:34
start because obviously he was a thug
45:35
and you know he'd organized uh
45:36
pushes and things like that he didn't
45:37
get much better did he he didn't get
45:39
much better but
45:40
but this in germany turned around the
45:42
public image of him a lot
45:44
because it was it was like a family
45:45
album it began with photos of him as a
45:47
baby
45:48
and photos of him still had a tiny
45:50
little mustache
45:52
um ironically he looked like churchill
45:54
um
45:57
but it but it was massively popular it
45:59
sold over four hundred thousand copies
46:01
by 1942. and this was came along with
46:04
minecraft
46:04
no it was it was another of the works
46:07
designed to improve his public image so
46:08
it wasn't it wasn't a buy one get one
46:10
free thing or anything like that
46:11
because they've released a manga version
46:13
of minecamp now
46:16
and someone here is a huge fan
46:20
so is hitler portrayed as japanese in it
46:23
um
46:24
i think he is yes i assume he is
46:27
so this is whitley in japan and turkey
46:30
there are manga versions of mein kampf
46:32
and it was introduced a few years ago in
46:34
japan and it sold 45 000 copies
46:36
which bizarre and then in india there's
46:38
a version
46:39
which is used for business and
46:41
management students who advise to read
46:43
it it seemed very different over there i
46:45
think because they were quite
46:46
geographically detached from
46:48
the things that happened in world war ii
46:49
in europe and they don't really get
46:51
taught about the holocaust as much as we
46:53
do and stuff like that so they just see
46:54
it completely differently
46:56
so in india they have a hitler cafe a
46:58
hitler fashion store
47:00
and hitler ice cream really yum
47:06
uh we need to wrap up uh very shortly do
47:08
you guys have anything before we do i
47:09
have one more story it's about foils
47:10
though
47:10
yeah yeah it's christopher foyle who
47:12
took over from his aunt christina
47:14
uh it's just an anecdote he told about a
47:16
time when he was working in the shop and
47:18
he wrestled a shoplifter and i just
47:20
wanted to tell you it because i love it
47:21
um he said he chased him out of the shop
47:23
he saw him leaving
47:24
and they got into soho square right
47:26
nearby and he he said i was very calm
47:28
very friendly
47:29
i said excuse me i think you might have
47:30
some books there you didn't pay for
47:32
would you like to come back to foils and
47:33
we'll just discuss it anyway at that
47:35
point they usually come back quietly or
47:37
they lash out or run away or whatever
47:38
this chap lashed out i remember he kept
47:41
on trying to kick me in the groin
47:42
so what i did was with one hand i held
47:44
him away from me by the knot of his tie
47:46
by the other i held him by the end of
47:47
his tie
47:49
anyway we ended up grappling and i
47:50
remember we were rolling around in the
47:51
gutter and the next moment i found
47:53
myself being hauled to my feet by a
47:54
burly policeman and he by another
47:56
the curious thing about this man was
47:57
there were books on breaking codes and
47:58
ciphers
47:59
it turned out he was an officer in mi5
48:06
okay should we wrap up guys we're gonna
48:09

49:11

01:43
this week coming to you live from
01:45
coventry
01:46
[Applause]
01:54
my name is
01:58
my name is dan schreiber and i am
02:00
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
02:02
hunter murray and james harkin and once
02:05
again someone is still clapping what is
02:07
going on there
02:09
and once again we have gathered around
02:10
the microphones with our four favorite
02:12
facts from the last seven days and in no
02:14
particular order here we go starting
02:17
this week with my fact my fact this week
02:20
is that in the annual lady godiva parade
02:23
which famously celebrates a lady who
02:25
rode naked through coventry not only
02:28
does the rider always wear clothes but
02:30
one year even the horse wore trousers
02:33
[Laughter]
02:35
it's a trousered horse
02:38
how did the horse wear the trousers
02:40
did it wear them over its back end or
02:43
did it wear the bottom four legs it had
02:45
on four it had all four legs
02:47
there's a photo you can see it so it
02:49
actually worked two pairs of trousers
02:50
yeah it wore two pairs of jeans yeah
02:53
yeah that's true
02:54
yeah that's amazing and that was it was
02:56
in the early 20th century right it was
02:58
1919 yeah it was a lady godiva parade
03:01
and uh and amazingly there's these
03:03
beautiful photos that you can see of the
03:05
event they are i think she was an
03:06
actress called gladys mann which is
03:08
ironic because she's a woman and she
03:12
but actually wasn't it true that the
03:13
first um lady godivas who did these
03:16
things were all men
03:17
were they i think they were yeah the
03:19
first one that was um we know he was the
03:22
son of james swinton don't know what his
03:25
name was wow do you know when it was
03:27
what an irritating thing to be called
03:28
going through life
03:30
hello i'm the son of james swinderton
03:32
do you have a name yes that's my name
03:34
[Laughter]
03:36
i always pay 15 shillings to do that but
03:39
they have it's been kind of sporadic
03:40
hasn't it that lady godiva parades
03:42
throughout history and they've been
03:44
variously like banned and then dropped
03:45
and they've come back and in the 19th
03:47
century i think they really caught on
03:49
and people were parade through the
03:50
streets and in the
03:52
1840s they really became a big thing
03:54
again and there'd be someone cast as
03:55
lady godiva every time and at first it
03:59
would be someone who was made to appear
04:00
like she was naked so in 1842 there was
04:03
an actress or a performer who was
04:05
wearing a tight-fitting flesh-colored
04:07
dress like a kind of a onesie but to
04:10
make it look like she's naked and then
04:11
people were outraged there were all
04:12
these complaints and i was looking at
04:14
the british newspaper archive and they
04:15
were saying um it's depraved you know
04:18
it's encouraged the profligate youth of
04:20
coventry to gratify a depraved taste any
04:23
profligate youth of coventry in tonight
04:27
ah they referred to her as a brazen
04:29
harlot the poor poor woman who dressed
04:31
in a onesie on horseback i read someone
04:33
referred to it was the bishop of
04:34
worcester who referred to her as a
04:36
birmingham being paraded through
04:38
the streets
04:40
and it seemed like he was more bothered
04:41
that she was from birmingham than
04:42
anything else
04:45
um we should very quickly say who lady
04:47
good diver
04:48
wasn't so the idea is just for anyone
04:50
listening overseas uh she was a noble
04:52
woman and in protest against her husband
04:54
raising taxes she rode through the
04:57
streets of coventry
04:59
naked except for her very long hair
05:01
which she had woven into a kind of hair
05:04
bikini no that's not true but
05:07
so that's the idea and that she was
05:08
trying to persuade him to lower the
05:09
taxes well we don't think it happened no
05:11
no
05:12
it's probably a myth it was
05:14
it was in the 11th century but i think
05:15
the first reference to it was about 200
05:17
years later but it's a myth that's you
05:19
know very much still celebrated in them
05:21
for the olympics um
05:23
there was a 20-foot tall lady godiva
05:26
built um and it traveled on a
05:28
purpose-built 50-seat bicycle because it
05:31
was transported down to london and then
05:33
back again uh it briefly got stuck going
05:36
around the ring road on a tight bend
05:39
and the woman who ran the company said
05:41
that lady gaga had suffered a little bit
05:43
of whiplash from tree branches and
05:45
suffered rain damage and some scratches
05:47
and she added she looked like she'd had
05:49
the best night out
05:53
the other thing about it being a myth is
05:54
that basically it was against taxes but
05:57
people have looked back at what coventry
05:59
was like back then and probably the
06:01
people who were here weren't really
06:02
bothered about taxes and one person said
06:05
that um in those days coventry was just
06:07
an inconsequential group of serfs living
06:10
in single-story hovels
06:13
um whereas coventry now has two story
06:15
buildings i think right
06:19
very bold
06:20
i know
06:21
so brave i literally was about to pack
06:24
my stuff up and go okay that's the
06:25
evening over
06:27
um so you were saying about the skin
06:29
type clothing um being seen as a bit of
06:31
a disgrace i read a story that it was it
06:34
caused a lot of chaos because
06:36
people thought that she was naked
06:38
therefore everyone who came to see the
06:40
parade suddenly really wanted to get
06:42
close to see the parade and riot sort of
06:44
broke out and people fought each other
06:46
because they thought there was a naked
06:47
person on a horse yeah yeah that was one
06:49
of the reasons i think it was considered
06:51
so immoral in victorian era yeah because
06:54
these riots started everyone got really
06:56
pissed and they stared at this maybe
06:57
naked women and then they all got really
06:59
drunk and descended into debauchery at
07:01
night apparently wow and every year
07:03
they'd be like this year she's
07:04
definitely going to be naked and she
07:06
never was
07:07
have you heard of pru peretta
07:10
no has ever heard of pru peretta
07:12
yeah so for 25 years in a row she was
07:14
the same lady godiva she was the lady
07:17
godiva more than the original lady
07:19
godiva who only did it once pre-pressed
07:21
it 25 times or even no times
07:23
lady gaga diver didn't even do it bru
07:25
beretta is the real lady godiva and she
07:27
got an mbe for her troubles yeah she's
07:30
only recently retired from what did they
07:32
pin it to
07:37
i guess that there might be quite a lot
07:39
of godiva businesses in coventry
07:42
so i checked on the internet and i was
07:44
not disappointed
07:46
there's um godiva fire extinguishers
07:49
godiva granite godiva insurance cadiver
07:51
windows godiva fish shop godiva dentists
07:55
animal care chiropractors glass wines
07:57
hypnotherapy plumbing fencing cafe news
08:01
gun shop
08:03
barber's carpet and godiva tailoring wow
08:08
which i love
08:09
someone who has no clothes so brilliant
08:10
yeah
08:12
yeah let's get your clothes off to get
08:13
those measurements you're done yes
08:16
i also think a very clever thing i don't
08:18
know if godiva windows has done this but
08:20
what i would have done is
08:22
the whole point of a godiva was that all
08:24
the people who lived in coventry had to
08:26
go inside and not look at her right and
08:28
the story of peeping tom comes from the
08:30
lady godiva story because he snuck out
08:32
and did try to catch a glimpse and then
08:33
he was blinded um and so if you were
08:36
making godiva windows you should
08:38
actually make opaque windows
08:40
and i don't know if they do that as a
08:42
business i don't know if that would be
08:43
particularly fruitful but that's what i
08:44
would do
08:46
like doors basically
08:52
those door windows
08:54
maybe that's what they call doors in
08:56
coventry
08:57
um i i did a little bit on naked
09:00
protests oh okay okay so
09:03
because people keep on protesting um as
09:05
lady godiva so this may in gloucester a
09:08
woman called anna dart rode a horse
09:10
dressed only in body paint she was
09:12
dressed in body paint
09:14
not the horse the horse didn't even
09:16
bother wearing body paint disgusting
09:18
[Laughter]
09:19
to protest against gloucestershire
09:21
county council's planned new incinerator
09:26
in 2011 a man dressed as lady godiva and
09:28
he rode through the lancashire village
09:30
of halton to protest against new haitian
09:32
to m6 link
09:34
road and my favorite one in 2006 a dozen
09:38
people in a canadian town it's called
09:40
leader in saskatchewan they posed naked
09:44
in potholes on a local highway and then
09:46
made a calendar a nude calendar of
09:48
themselves in these potholes to spread
09:50
the message that they wanted the council
09:51
to fix the potholes
09:54
and the local organizer the organizer
09:56
the guy behind it said that most of the
09:58
people in the calendar were very
09:59
reluctant but he did add there was one
10:01
guy we couldn't get him to keep his
10:02
clothes on
10:05
and the guardian reported that just four
10:07
years later the highway was repaired
10:11
so it absolutely works like a charm
10:14
i read a thing about in france there's a
10:16
small town that's been having a problem
10:17
with their naked hero which is uh
10:20
heracles and basically they have a
10:23
statue of him naked but the town seems
10:26
to have a lot of cheeky vandals who keep
10:28
chiseling the penis off of the naked god
10:31
and so
10:32
what they did was they kept replacing it
10:35
and then they'd come back a few you know
10:37
days later or whatever someone again
10:39
cheeky chiseler comes along and takes
10:42
away the penis and they were like we
10:43
don't know what to do so what they ended
10:45
up doing because it was a very important
10:46
spot where they do a lot of ceremonies
10:48
they made a sort of
10:50
extra special penis that they then
10:53
whenever they do a ceremony just before
10:55
the ceremony starts they come up to it
10:57
put the penis on and you're like
10:59
there's going to be a ceremony today and
11:01
they guard it and then they do the
11:02
ceremony and once whatever the ribbon's
11:04
been cut or whatever they go thank you
11:05
or good night and then they take the
11:07
penis off again and bring it back to the
11:09
office so it's a ceremonial penis that
11:11
is constantly
11:12
attached for important days did you say
11:14
that was in france yeah it was i
11:17
it was a town called arkansas sure
11:21
and just because i just have um just a
11:23
coincidence about france and germany and
11:26
that is that the pioneers of the
11:28
naturist movement in france were called
11:30
albert and christine lecock
11:34
and one of the leading lights of german
11:36
naturism was called adolf
11:39
no way yeah and they're both basically
11:41
the most important naturists in france
11:43
and germany are called and the
11:45
wow that's great do you know actually
11:47
speaking of adolfs
11:50
we've reached the hitler point in the
11:52
show ladies and gentlemen i'm trying to
11:54
get it into every live show of our tour
11:56
um
11:56
hitler banned nudism and then
11:58
immediately reintroduced it so it was
12:01
quite a big thing in germany in the
12:03
early 20th century and the nazis thought
12:05
that it wasn't very good and so they
12:07
banned it in 1933 and then they shut
12:09
down all the nudist clubs across germany
12:11
and then in 1934 they immediately
12:12
changed their mind and allowed people to
12:14
just attend nazi approved nudist clubs
12:17
so even he softened on that one
12:20
one thing
12:22
what yeah i think it's a bit late to
12:24
reclaim the reputation anna
12:27
okay why don't we move on to our second
12:29
fact of the night and that is james
12:32
harkin okay my fact this week is that
12:34
the worst basketball coach in the
12:36
history of the university of kansas
12:39
is james naismith the man who invented
12:42
basketball
12:44
it's amazing
12:46
he is the only coach of that university
12:49
who has a losing record every single
12:51
other person was a winner and he
12:53
invented the game yeah oh but he was
12:55
just learning how to do it i mean but so
12:57
was everyone yeah that's true he was
13:00
against coaching wasn't he which partly
13:03
explains it so one of his students went
13:06
on to be one of the greatest basketball
13:07
coaches ever someone called fog allen
13:09
and when he told his shooter naismith
13:12
who invented basketball that he was
13:13
going to try and coach it nice mistress
13:15
said you cannot coach basketball you
13:17
just play it uh and so yeah he didn't
13:20
believe in it it was a slightly
13:21
different game in those days um there
13:24
was nine against nine and they used a
13:26
football a soccer ball instead of a
13:27
basketball because they hadn't been
13:29
invented yet and dribbling wasn't
13:31
allowed so he's a bit more like netball
13:33
actually um and there was no hole in the
13:35
bottom of the basket was there
13:37
yeah yeah they just put a load of peach
13:39
baskets up there and they put it through
13:40
it in and then he had to climb up and
13:42
get it out and then play again yeah and
13:44
did you know he thought naismith thought
13:46
the introduction of the hole in the
13:47
basket was a grave error you thought
13:49
that was a mistake yeah can you imagine
13:52
michael jordan getting a ladder every
13:54
time he gets a point
13:56
the first ever game of basketball ended
13:57
in a massive brawl in fact i had a brawl
14:00
after about five minutes so uh he
14:02
invented it because he was teaching uh
14:03
school boys and his class were really
14:05
badly behaved they're very naughty and
14:07
they the weather was bad so they
14:08
couldn't go outside and let off steam so
14:10
he invented the game and he just gave
14:12
them one rule he said the only rule is
14:14
to get the ball in the basket and
14:16
immediately they started a fight with
14:18
each other he said they started tackling
14:20
kicking and punching and before he
14:21
managed to intercede several had black
14:24
eyes one had dislocated his shoulder and
14:26
another had literally been knocked out
14:31
oh my god
14:33
um so in america at the moment there's
14:35
quite a lot of controversy with um
14:36
basketball in schools and the reason for
14:39
that is
14:40
coaches keep getting fired for their
14:42
teams winning by so much really so they
14:45
have this thing in american sports where
14:47
once you're winning by a certain amount
14:49
you should really stop trying
14:51
and you shouldn't keep what they call it
14:53
is running up the score so there was a
14:56
guy who won 100 nil recently who was the
14:58
head of his team he got fired there was
15:00
someone who won 161 too
15:03
and they got fired as well and it's the
15:05
idea that you're not teaching them to be
15:06
good sportsmen exactly yeah i love it i
15:09
really like that yeah i could see who
15:11
was at sports at school
15:15
you know we think of basketball as an
15:18
american sport predominantly but there
15:20
are so many countries around the world
15:21
that play it
15:22
in a very big way and the one that
15:24
surprised me most when i was looking
15:25
into this is bhutan
15:27
the royal family of bhutan are obsessed
15:31
with basketball and i read an article
15:33
where the current queen of bhutan uh
15:35
they followed a match that she played so
15:37
she's in a team and when she when she
15:39
comes to the match when she comes out
15:41
through the locker to the to the locker
15:43
rooms to the main court they roll out a
15:45
red carpet yeah and they have a like a
15:47
throne-like thing there so they have to
15:48
roll out the red carpet all over the
15:50
court as she moves around yes they gotta
15:51
stay in front of her just peddling it
15:54
out yeah no and so she she played a
15:56
match this is the match they observed
15:58
and she scored 34 points in that match
16:01
three rebounds and four assists if you
16:03
know the scoring system of basketball
16:05
that's incredibly high um and so they
16:07
were like either she's incredibly
16:09
amazing at basketball or it may have
16:12
something to do with the fact that
16:13
bhutanese custom forbids citizens from
16:15
touching the royals without any
16:17
invitation
16:19
therefore any time she's got the ball
16:20
people have to be like oh no
16:23
but isn't basketball a non-contact spot
16:25
anyway i don't know it's very kind i
16:26
mean you you're kidding yeah technically
16:28
it is but you're it's a very aggressive
16:30
sport and there's a lot of blocking and
16:31
there's a lot of stuff like that and um
16:33
there's a quote from someone who they
16:34
interviewed afterwards saying you know
16:37
the queen's really good and and how did
16:39
you find it because the one person they
16:40
interviewed actually fouled the queen
16:42
which goes against the rules of the
16:44
country and uh yet she said i failed the
16:46
queen once i was a little scared but she
16:48
said it was okay um and she said she
16:51
wants us to check her and she gets mad
16:53
if we don't she thinks we're scared of
16:55
her we are very scared
16:58
but do you know that that's not the
17:00
bhutanese royal family's favorite sport
17:02
actually their favorite sport is darts
17:04
really yeah because in bhutan darts is
17:07
like the national sport but they are
17:09
massive darts they're about you hold
17:10
them in your hand like this i mean not
17:12
great for podcasters
17:14
but you hold them with your full palm
17:16
and then you launch them and it's about
17:18
the same distance as this stage and you
17:20
throw it from one side to the other and
17:21
they have like um like an archery target
17:23
that you have to throw it into
17:25
and one team stands next to the target
17:27
and tries to insult the other guys
17:28
before you throw it why don't you do
17:30
that i don't do that at all i know it's
17:32
unbelievably dangerous say encouraging
17:34
things to them to encourage them to keep
17:36
on aim yeah but then you want to win as
17:38
well right yeah i can think of a way of
17:40
winning kill the other guys with your
17:41
dog
17:42
what are they going to do
17:44
at worst that's a foul you know
17:47
i read do you guys remember the film
17:48
space jam yeah michael jordan michael
17:51
jordan and and bugs bunny it's a looney
17:53
tunes film with some humans in like um
17:55
who framed roger rabbit last year there
17:57
was a journalist called jaylen cook who
17:59
analyzed the space jam film through
18:01
actual nba rules and it's just a very
18:03
funny writer so he said one minute 31
18:06
sylvester the cat tries to swallow
18:08
tweety bird his own teammate whole
18:12
there is nothing in the nba rulebook
18:13
that explicitly says you can't eat your
18:15
teammates while a game is in progress
18:18
one minute 50. foghorn leghorn is
18:20
incinerated by barry
18:23
that is easily a flagrant two foul it is
18:25
also attempted murder
18:29
you know so michael jordan was in that
18:30
film obviously and as people say the
18:33
greatest basketball player of all time
18:35
but he's also a great leader in
18:37
basketball fashion because if you watch
18:40
basketball now they've all got these
18:41
really baggy shorts on and that's
18:43
because of him so until he played then
18:45
everyone wore quite tight shorts and
18:48
then he thought that it was good luck
18:50
for him to wear his old uni his old
18:52
college shorts underneath his basketball
18:54
shorts so he never played a single game
18:56
without wearing two pairs of shorts and
18:59
i imagine boxers which i count as short
19:00
so three pairs of shorts michael jordan
19:02
is always wearing and that meant that
19:04
the nba had to make his shorts baggier
19:06
so they could fit these you know two
19:07
other pairs of shorts underneath it i am
19:09
wearing three pairs of pants now
19:11
yeah two right otherwise
19:13
otherwise people aren't safe
19:18
i was reading about someone else called
19:19
jason terry who is an nba player and
19:22
he's there there's a lot of superstition
19:24
in sport obviously and jason terry plays
19:26
at the moment but he has to sleep in his
19:28
opponent's shorts the night before a
19:30
match
19:32
and they need while the opponent's
19:33
wearing them yeah well
19:35
they need to be shorts from the opposing
19:37
team that have been played in and so
19:39
apparently he has contacts throughout
19:41
the nba so he can email them and be like
19:44
sorry could you send me your shorts you
19:46
know my thing um and they and he has
19:48
shorts from all the opposing teams so he
19:50
can sleep in them before the match i'd
19:51
like to clarify i'm not wearing anyone
19:52
else's pants right now
19:55
is it kind of so that once he's
19:57
been in their shorts he knows how to
19:59
beat them or i don't know
20:01
let's not talk about beating in someone
20:02
else's shorts i don't know
20:06
he didn't justify it
20:08
wow
20:09
just quickly a weird thing that i saw um
20:11
in canada this year a basketball player
20:14
finally got the right to use his surname
20:16
on his jersey which has been very
20:18
contentious he's from brazil uh he got
20:21
transferred over and uh there's been
20:23
huge problems with it and um yeah he
20:26
he's been in the news for as a result uh
20:28
the quote he said is um it's my last
20:31
name i'm proud of it doesn't matter if
20:33
it means something bad he says it's
20:35
pronounced fuki
20:37
and that's how he's trying to get i mean
20:39
maybe it definitely probably is right i
20:41
think he knows his name but um he was
20:43
censored for ages so he wasn't allowed
20:45
to wear a jersey and finally because the
20:47
team's doing well they're like okay you
20:48
can have it so now that's going back and
20:50
forth on a basketball court
20:52
wow yeah
20:53
it just reminds me just slightly off
20:56
topic but there is a college footballer
20:58
who will probably go into nfl soon in
21:00
america whose name is lion king
21:03
oh that's so cool
21:04
imagine if you're mr mrs king
21:08
what should we call our son mufasa
21:14
we should move on to our next factor
21:16
right okay it is time for fact number
21:18
three and that is andy my fact is that
21:20
blowing out the candles on a birthday
21:22
cake increases the number of bacteria on
21:25
it by 1 400 percent
21:29
yeah next time you have a birthday think
21:31
about this so there were a lot of
21:32
scientists who wanted to test uh that
21:35
you know what happens when you breathe
21:37
out and whether as they said bioaerosols
21:40
in human breath expelled from the mouth
21:42
may be a source of bacteria so they
21:44
simulated a birthday party among
21:45
themselves which i would kill to have
21:47
been
21:47
[Laughter]
21:51
they ate some pizza to get their
21:52
salivary glands going and then they um
21:54
they had a cake set up and they they
21:56
blew all over it blowing the candles out
21:59
and that's just the average was one
22:00
thousand four hundred percent so that's
22:02
not the worst in one case someone
22:04
breathing out and blowing out all the
22:05
candles increased the bacteria on the
22:07
cake by twelve thousand percent
22:10
120 times as much i mean how is that guy
22:13
blowing yeah yeah
22:17
yeah
22:19
but then we don't think that this is
22:21
that dangerous do we no we don't
22:23
yeah well just because basically these
22:25
are bacteria probably that unless
22:27
someone's got the plague or something or
22:29
you know someone's really ill these are
22:31
just bacteria that we all have that are
22:33
kind of you know just because there's
22:34
more bacteria on something doesn't
22:36
necessarily mean it's more dangerous
22:37
you're right and a lot of the um the
22:39
scientists who were told about this said
22:41
actually you know the fact that you're
22:43
reaching a lot of cake is a lot more
22:44
important than the fact it's the
22:46
bacteria right yeah like obesity is
22:48
obviously more of a problem than just
22:50
the odd little bacterium yeah but there
22:52
is a solution to it which um there's a
22:54
lady in america who's selling this now
22:56
and she was at her aunt's 100th birthday
22:59
and as a result when they were blowing
23:01
candles a lot of candles and as a result
23:03
of the lot of candles they had three
23:04
generations of family members blow out
23:07
the candles and so she was stood
23:09
watching it and as a result of watching
23:10
it she just saw a sort of tidal wave of
23:12
spit just come over the cake and thought
23:15
oh that's i'll have a piece of that but
23:17
and then later thought i need to solve
23:20
what this thing is and so what you can
23:21
buy in america now is a sort of before
23:24
you blow out the candles it's like a
23:26
cake plastic sheet that you put over
23:28
your cake yeah so what you do is you
23:30
place that over the cake you blow out
23:31
the candles and then you take that off
23:33
but it's see-through so you can see your
23:35
cake underneath it um so it stops all
23:38
the bacteria from going on it that is i
23:39
know people say health and safety gone
23:41
mad and they're annoying but i find that
23:44
that is health and safety gone mad
23:46
it's not dangerous i mean it's something
23:48
like 12 percent of bacteria are related
23:50
to being harmful at all to us isn't it
23:52
and and a lot of bacteria are good you
23:55
have in in the average hair brush you
23:58
have 3500 bacteria colonies per square
24:02
inch so different colonies of different
24:04
types of bacteria one hair follicle
24:06
contains 50 000 individual bacteria wow
24:10
but they're mainly fine they are fine
24:12
they are fine the important thing to
24:13
remember is the bacteria are basically
24:14
fine so there were loads of headlines
24:16
this year saying um beards are full of
24:18
fecal bacteria
24:19
so 20 beard owners in the room the kinds
24:22
of bacteria they're finding are
24:23
absolutely not harmful they're the kind
24:25
of bacteria that might be found in the
24:26
gut but they might also not be found in
24:28
the gut so
24:30
and also everything is covered in fecal
24:32
bacteria there's one message you take
24:34
away from tonight
24:36
that's true actually i read that study
24:37
about um toothbrushes do you know when
24:39
they say don't keep your toothbrush in
24:41
the bathroom because you might get that
24:43
fecal bacteria stuff on it yeah well it
24:45
turns out that the fecal bacteria is
24:46
everywhere anyway it's all over the
24:48
place you can keep your toothbrush in
24:50
the toilet if you so
24:52
that's the other thing it always says
24:53
there is more bacteria here than in your
24:56
toilet like on the chopping board or
24:58
something like that but you don't use
24:59
bleach on your chopping board do you and
25:01
you use bleach on your toilet so you're
25:03
basically killing all the bacteria all
25:05
the time so but a lot of people use
25:07
bleach on their bum and so probably it's
25:09
removed bacteria before that's true
25:11
sorry whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa who has
25:14
ever put bleach on their bums
25:17
guys
25:18
[Laughter]
25:24
what are you talking about i thought
25:25
that was a thing
25:26
it's
25:28
yeah i thought oh that's completely
25:30
different than to just having a bot
25:32
that's not why there's a bottle by the
25:34
loo you know that
25:39
oh my i mean bleach is very toxic don't
25:41
do that it's not a lure replacement i
25:44
think
25:45
i'll stop jesus actually
25:48
if you're gonna take anything away from
25:50
tonight's show that's the thing you need
25:51
to do
25:53
james told me in fact ages ago it was
25:55
probably my favorite fact of all time
25:56
we're talking about bacteria in the gut
25:58
um apparently uh bacteria inside your
26:01
gut are farting all the time they lit
26:04
out little little farts tiny little
26:06
farts and when you i'm talking about
26:08
everyone listening and everyone here in
26:09
the room when you fart
26:11
you're not farting all you've done is
26:13
collected a huge batch of bacteria fart
26:17
and you've just released it in one
26:19
massive go isn't that insane
26:22
isn't that nuts that's like that you
26:23
know the scene in the death star when
26:25
they're about to shoot and kill a planet
26:26
and it's all those lasers going
26:29
that's that inside you just fight five
26:31
fights
26:32
and then you go out
26:34
and you let out
26:36
what it's true james told me
26:40
don't applaud that don't applaud it
26:42
james absolutely denies telling you the
26:44
death star bit of the fact which
26:46
needlessly we get it
26:48
it's like sweat i mean yeah so bacteria
26:50
are the things that make us smell not
26:51
ass it doesn't go down well on a date
26:53
when you explain that so it's a
26:54
pointless piece of information for you
26:55
to have
26:56
there's these little things farting at
26:58
you and then and then just in one you
27:00
collect it and then you release it sure
27:03
has anyone got stuff on birthday cakes
27:07
literally nothing let's hear it
27:09
um so
27:10
okay here's the thing when you blow out
27:12
a candle
27:13
what is the mechanism that's making it
27:15
go out uh you blow and the flame falls
27:18
over
27:20
and it dies
27:22
uh
27:23
it's the you're rejecting carbon dioxide
27:25
into the air and sucking the o2 away
27:27
from it it's a good guess but it's not
27:28
right okay
27:30
uh so done let's say your extremely
27:32
intelligent guest is definitely gonna be
27:33
crazy
27:34
analogy that's like blowing out a
27:35
birthday cake
27:37
it's uh it's like the reverse of a
27:40
lightsaber whereby you're bringing no i
27:43
don't know um it's pretty simple
27:45
actually so fire needs three things it
27:46
needs oxygen fuel and heat and when you
27:49
blow is the temperature going down
27:51
enough
27:52
so your the air pressure is causing the
27:55
temperature to go down which causes the
27:56
fire to extinguish but so how can when
27:58
people do that thing where they go
28:00
and they can put it out with just like a
28:02
like a judo chop again it's just moving
28:04
the air isn't it which changes the
28:05
pressure levels
28:07
and the idea of blowing out candles it
28:09
has happened quite a lot but it only
28:11
really became a proper thing after a
28:13
kodak advertisement
28:15
showed some people blowing out some
28:16
candles i think it was in the 50s or 60s
28:19
yeah wow that's only when it became
28:21
absolutely massive that's amazing oh
28:23
yeah because there used to be those sort
28:24
of candle thimbles that you would sort
28:25
of say good night and you would put out
28:27
the candle
28:30
are you saying at a birthday parties
28:31
people would ceremonially
28:33
drench each candle in order on the
28:35
ground yeah you know it's like on a
28:36
stick
28:38
talking about
28:39
we still use them
28:40
what that's the thing you're advised to
28:43
use them because it's less dangerous
28:44
you're advised to use yeah by like fire
28:46
safety officials i've read that
28:48
somewhere i mean not on a birthday cake
28:50
yeah no yeah
28:52
fire officials don't use that to fight
28:54
fire do they
28:56
oh it's a big one all right
28:58
oh we need longer sticks and bigger
29:00
thimbles
29:03
um just one more thing on birthday cakes
29:06
yeah most expensive birthday cake of all
29:08
time
29:09
75 million dollars whoa um it was bought
29:13
by an an unnamed buyer in the united
29:15
arab emirates for his daughter's
29:17
birthday party and she was a joint
29:19
birthday and engagement party also
29:21
really it was only 37.5 million dollars
29:23
each time great yeah but it's a bit of a
29:26
trick because um the cake is pretty big
29:28
and obviously did cost a little bit of
29:30
money but it also has 4 000 diamonds
29:33
on it yeah so i mean if you're just
29:35
gonna pour diamonds on something and say
29:36
that's the most expensive you know this
29:38
is my most expensive shoe of all time
29:40
because i poured a load of diamonds in
29:41
it yeah it's not part of the cake if you
29:43
can't eat it it's not part of the cake
29:45
yeah did you know that there's a fish
29:46
you can use as candles
29:49
what what what yeah there's a fish
29:51
called the eulecton fish um which some
29:55
people say is where the word hooligan
29:57
comes from although that is quite dodgy
29:59
etymology yeah no it's not um but it's
30:02
also called the candle fish and that's
30:04
because it's got so much fat in its body
30:06
um and during spawning that you can
30:08
literally light one end of it and it
30:10
burns like a wick like a candle and so
30:12
like when we first went to north america
30:14
it exists in north america and when
30:16
it was first discovered by westerners
30:18
yeah then people used to catch these
30:20
fish and use them as candles
30:22
imagine the kids birthday party where
30:24
you come into the room with that
30:26
eight fish a light on the top of your
30:28
cake
30:29
but didn't they also have um birds that
30:31
they used as yeah are they full mars or
30:34
no venezuela in venezuela and they're
30:36
called oil birds and they used to just
30:39
light one end yeah they're so fatty oh
30:42
is that because um brian blessed told me
30:44
about this because he explored venezuela
30:46
and he said if you're if you run out of
30:48
wood or anything you grab one of these
30:49
birds and you ring them like a wet cloth
30:52
and they leak the uh the oils and then
30:54
you light so you don't actually have to
30:56
hurt you probably hurt the bird in the
30:57
ringing process actually
31:00
but that's doable i have a fact that
31:02
combines birthdays and bacteria that's
31:05
not the original fact wow
31:07
all right
31:08
[Laughter]
31:10
just it was there was a doctor being
31:11
interviewed by the telegraph uh this is
31:13
a few years ago but it he he was giving
31:15
health advice for how to avoid the
31:16
spread of bacteria he recommended that
31:18
the best place to sneeze is into your
31:20
sleeve
31:21
um because that's hygienic and also that
31:23
while washing your hands you should sing
31:26
happy birthday twice over
31:29
and i can confirm that if you do that in
31:31
any kind of public bathroom
31:34
you get really weird looks
31:36
but when it got to the bit happy
31:38
birthday dear
31:39
what did you say
31:40
my hands
31:47
that's great because the second time
31:48
around the guy next to you could be like
31:50
my hand
31:53
it's both of our hands birthdays on the
31:55
same day
31:56
the chances
31:58
we should move on to our final fact oh
32:00
okay do you want to go for something
32:02
before we do i've got some interesting
32:04
stuff
32:04
okay let's move on to our final factor
32:07
yeah go for it well there's a bacteria
32:09
called um palagobacter ubique
32:12
and there are so many of these things it
32:15
is unreal if you take part of the ocean
32:19
and at least some parts of the ocean
32:21
half of all the living cells will be
32:23
this particular bacteria
32:26
okay there are two times 10 to the power
32:28
of 28 of them in the world
32:31
which means if every grain of sand on
32:33
earth was a planet which contained the
32:35
same number of humans as there are on
32:37
earth that would be how many of the
32:39
bacteria there are
32:43
if every grain of sand on earth was a
32:45
planet which had seven billion people on
32:47
it
32:48
and the total number of all of those
32:50
people on all of those is the number of
32:52
bacteria that there are of this species
32:54
in the world
32:56
what you're saying
32:57
he's saying that it's a lot
33:00
thank you anna for putting it into terms
33:01
i could understand
33:03
can i just i my favorite bacteria is
33:05
this we've all got one we have one
33:08
but bacteria are amazing but they're
33:09
quite hard to envisage sometimes but
33:11
this is is the second largest bacteria
33:13
on earth people usually think it was the
33:14
largest uh it's a site about the size of
33:16
a full stop if you're reading a word
33:18
document so that's you can imagine that
33:20
which is quite exciting and it's called
33:23
the official sony bacteria it's called
33:26
epilopischium official sony and the
33:28
reason it's called epilepischium is
33:30
because it only exists in the intestines
33:33
of surgeon fish so bacteria are very
33:36
specific they only live in very specific
33:38
environments so this one only lives in
33:40
fish so that's why it's called
33:42
epilepischium because piscas means fish
33:45
in latin but its other name is fishal
33:48
sony and by sheer coincidence that's
33:50
because it was discovered by a man
33:52
called lev fishelson
33:55
so it's the bacteria that live solely in
33:56
fish and then it was named by someone
33:58
called peggy pollock
34:02
that is amazing and did you know this
34:04
first paper that we were just talking
34:05
about about the birthday cakes um one of
34:07
the authors of that paper was called
34:09
jonathan baker
34:10
oh
34:12
what a nice book end to this fact part
34:15
yeah it'd be nice to have had a laugh
34:17
but
34:18
oh there we go all right
34:21
okay uh it is time for our final fact of
34:23
the show and that is chozinski my fact
34:26
this week is that the first person to
34:28
swim the atlantic said never again as
34:32
soon as he was finished
34:35
he is now planning to swim the pacific
34:37
[Music]
34:39
this is um this is amazing it's this guy
34:41
called benoit lecompte and this is in
34:43
1998 he swam the atlantic and he came
34:47
ashore in brittany he'd swum 3 800 miles
34:51
basically from cape cod in massachusetts
34:53
and literally his first words as he
34:55
emerged from the water were never again
34:57
and now he's planning his specific trip
34:59
it's going to happen in the next couple
35:01
of years now do we think he actually did
35:03
the atlantic thing it's a little bit
35:04
controversial isn't it how far is that
35:07
it's literally the number of miles that
35:08
anna just read out
35:10
so if you rewind quickly on the podcast
35:12
when you're listening back yeah that's a
35:14
lot or if you just listen in the first
35:16
place then that will also tell you how
35:18
far it is
35:19
it's 3 800 miles thank you anna so
35:22
there's a bit of controversy about
35:23
whether he swam the whole thing because
35:26
obviously there are currents which might
35:27
have helped him along a bit and
35:29
his average speed was eight miles an
35:31
hour the whole way which is about three
35:33
times as fast as other
35:35
swimmers manage over long distances
35:38
but he was definitely in the water for a
35:40
very long time yeah he did well and he
35:42
was raising money for charity um so he's
35:44
always a huge amount of money for
35:46
charity and that's what he's doing again
35:47
now
35:48
but he and the way he does it is that he
35:52
stops for the night he spends about
35:53
eight hours a day starts the night the
35:54
boat takes a gps position of where he
35:56
was and then no matter how far the
35:58
boat's drifted it has to go back to the
36:00
position he was at and then drop him in
36:01
the next morning right because there was
36:03
a guy called guy delage
36:06
who was the first to swim across with
36:08
the help of a kickboard and a kickboard
36:10
is one of those floats that you have in
36:11
the swimming pool and you hold them and
36:13
then you you know when you can't do the
36:15
arm bits of your swimming but you're
36:16
just pressing the leg bit so he did it
36:18
with that but when he wasn't swimming he
36:20
was sleeping on a raft which didn't have
36:22
this gps thing and the raft would just
36:25
float towards where he needed to go all
36:27
the time
36:28
and basically the longer he was sleeping
36:30
the longer he didn't have to swim
36:33
which if it was me i would just have
36:34
slept the whole way
36:38
and he had us i think he guy had a small
36:41
sale on his raft as well yeah but he was
36:44
still cool and i i think he's great as
36:46
well a bit of a hero because he did it
36:47
to escape debt so he basically had no
36:50
money left and he was like what can i do
36:51
what's the obvious way i can raise money
36:53
swim the atlantic and when oh he wasn't
36:56
just leaving the country to escape
36:58
that's what i thought yeah sorry
37:00
no he was good and he had a shark phobia
37:02
guy delage so i don't know i think shark
37:05
phobia is the wrong way of putting that
37:07
isn't it because a phobia has to be
37:08
something that you know there's no real
37:10
reason you should be scared of it
37:12
whereas sharks
37:13
if you're swimming in the atlantic yeah
37:15
you're quite right to be scared of chefs
37:17
yeah if you don't have shark phobia you
37:19
would say um he is an insane man
37:23
do you know how uh marathon swimmers
37:24
keep themselves going during the uh the
37:26
race um no you mean because they get
37:29
tired or they get tired and so if you're
37:31
swimming a marathon you know it's lots
37:32
of kilometers um there was an interview
37:34
with a russian uh
37:36
open water swimming champion called
37:38
evgeny bezrujenko and he wrote an
37:41
article sharing the secrets of marathon
37:43
swimming and he revealed that you need
37:45
food and you normally need a
37:46
concentrated gel you know like really
37:48
really massive dose of sugar but the
37:50
only place obviously you're swimming
37:52
you're in trunks there is only one place
37:54
you can keep it and that is inside your
37:56
trunks as you swim so all the swimmers
37:58
you see doing marathons have little
37:59
packets of food basically tucked
38:02
[Music]
38:03
and they into their
38:03
get them out over the course of the race
38:05
that's awesome they should invent like
38:07
trunks with pockets
38:09
do they not have pockets yeah there's
38:10
normally a little one for your locker
38:12
key but i think
38:14
at the competitive level they may not
38:16
even have those
38:18
did you know that the the u.s navy have
38:19
their own secret military swimming
38:22
stroke
38:24
yes they do they don't do you
38:27
they do they don't they do
38:30
mate
38:31
so u.s navy seals they have this stroke
38:34
called the combat swimmer stroke and it
38:36
looks so daft but it's a combination of
38:39
breaststroke and freestyle which i did
38:41
not know was a thing but is it breast
38:43
felt legs and free stroke um
38:46
basically you have to go on your side in
38:48
the water and then you kick in a in an
38:50
odd way and then you use your arms in
38:52
another way but basically it makes you
38:53
harder to spot underwater and it's
38:55
called the combat swimmer stroke
38:58
it means that if you're trying to
38:59
influence harder to spot because you're
39:00
basically sinking because you can't swim
39:02
like that
39:03
yes
39:04
can i just say a combination of
39:05
breaststroke and freestyle is just
39:06
freestyle because the whole point of
39:08
freestyle is that it's anything you want
39:09
it just happens that freestyle is the
39:11
fastest stroke so if i'm swimming
39:13
breaststroke am i also swimming
39:14
freestyle you sure are if you're
39:15
swimming that in a race you're a
39:17
swimming freestyle and be an absolute
39:18
idiot but yeah
39:20
in a freestyle race you're allowed to go
39:22
anywhere you want really so what you're
39:23
thinking of is front crawl
39:25
that's what i thought i thought
39:26
freestyle was front crew it is front
39:27
crawl because that's the fastest but why
39:29
did you think it was called freestyle
39:31
oh yeah you're not gonna go i'll do
39:33
breaststroke on this one yeah
39:35
can i stick up for breaststroke well
39:37
it's the fastest swimming stuff the
39:39
fastest but is the nicest yeah but when
39:41
you're in the olympics
39:43
there's no points for niceness
39:45
you're joking
39:47
[Laughter]
39:49
you were at spot at school
39:52
do you know
39:53
bats when they swim uh they tested to
39:56
see if bats could swim first of all yeah
39:57
i didn't know that yeah so bats can swim
39:59
obviously they don't do it out of um
40:01
just a daily exercise they do it in
40:03
circumstances where they're suddenly in
40:05
water for reasons they shouldn't be um
40:07
right have i explained myself well
40:09
enough perfectly they do the butterfly
40:12
so they with their wings bats do
40:14
butterfly
40:15
butterflies do bat do the bats
40:20
they do bat stroke yeah oh
40:23
so the longest ever journey swimming uh
40:26
was
40:27
5268 kilometers and it was down the
40:30
amazon river um through peru and brazil
40:33
and it was done by a guy called martin
40:35
strell who's from slovenia and he is
40:38
pretty awesome um after he did it they
40:40
asked him about it and he said you know
40:42
they're like how did you manage this and
40:43
he says well my body's pretty special
40:47
wow he says i'm never hurt or sick and
40:50
if everyone will like me all of the
40:51
hospitals around the world will be
40:53
completely empty
40:55
and he says he drinks either one or two
40:58
bottles of wine every day
41:01
but it's special slovenian wine that you
41:03
can't buy outside slovenia and it just
41:05
helps you be an awesome swimmer does it
41:07
yeah and he said do you know what the
41:09
worst thing is if you're swimming the
41:11
amazon what the biggest danger is
41:13
uh getting your
41:15
legs chewed off by piranhas by piranhas
41:18
so he was attacked by piranhas a few
41:20
times um and he found a good way of
41:22
preventing them by pouring buckets of
41:24
putrid blood into the water and they
41:26
went for the putrid blood instead
41:28
he also said i i don't really believe
41:31
this because he said i learned not to
41:32
pee in the water because they're a
41:33
kandiru
41:35
and you guys probably know candiru
41:36
they're the tiny fish that are supposed
41:38
to swim up into your penis if you're
41:40
swimming but they don't do that but they
41:41
don't so i think he's been told a bit of
41:43
a i thought they did i don't think that
41:45
they did i thought the thing they didn't
41:47
do was if you're having a pee into the
41:48
amazon off the bank they don't swim up
41:51
the urine yeah yeah i think we can all
41:53
agree they definitely don't do that okay
41:55
so it's common ground but anyway he said
41:56
the candida was bad but the worst thing
41:58
apparently was um the women of the
42:01
amazon and he said you can often see 15
42:04
to 20 times more women than men and the
42:06
women are very aggressive and they try
42:08
and catch you and marry you
42:12
this and they're worse than the piranhas
42:15
this guy has a i must say a very high
42:17
opinion of himself
42:19
my body's great i've got magic wine and
42:21
the ladies of the amazon cannot get
42:23
enough
42:26
hey we need to wrap up shortly do you
42:27
guys have anything before we do can i
42:29
just say a fact that we got sent
42:32
actually in the interval and it's
42:34
amazing and it's about swimming and it's
42:36
from a guy called theo
42:38
uh who all i know is you're called theo
42:40
and you're age 12. yeah are you here
42:44
okay great hi theo so this fact is
42:47
incredible
42:48
tigers always get in the water backwards
42:51
because they love swimming but they hate
42:54
getting their eyes wet
42:57
isn't that amazing i've checked it i was
42:59
like that must not be true i must know
43:01
it do they put these two paws up on the
43:03
bank and then just kick with their back
43:04
legs
43:06
like old ladies at the swimming pool
43:11
all right amazing flag fia uh should we
43:13
wrap up okay that's it that is all of
43:16
our facts thank you so much for
43:17
listening if you'd like to get in
43:18
contact with any of us about the things
43:20
that we have said over the course of
43:21
this podcast we can be found on our
43:23
twitter accounts i'm on at schreiberland
43:25
andy at andrew hunter m james at james
43:28
harkin and josinski you can email
43:29
podcast at qi.com yep or you can go to
43:32
our group twitter account which is at no
43:34
such thing you can also go to no such
43:35
thing as a fish.com that's our website
43:37
we have the links to all of our previous
43:39
episodes we also have a link to our book
43:41
the book of the year which is out now
43:42
and we're about to give a copy away to
43:44
one of the members of this audience here
43:46
in coventry who sent us a fact that we
43:48
have picked out who's got the fact i
43:49
have it um it's a shame after you just
43:52
read out that really cool taiga one
43:54
because this is quite low brow
43:57
but i can only blame the people of
43:59
coventry
44:00
and it is that places in canada
44:03
include shaggers cove dildo
44:06
and bowls falls
44:14
um come and see us after the show and we
44:16
have a book for you
44:17
yeah yes come and collect your friends
44:19
words of advice about your vocabulary
44:23
thanks so much guys for being here we
44:25
see you again next week

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qy offices in
00:21
covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
00:24
here with james harkin
00:26
anna chazinski and andy murray and once
00:29
again we have gathered around the
00:30
microphones with our four
00:31
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order
00:35
here we go andrew hunter murray i saw
00:38
your face
00:41
starting with fact number one and that's
00:43
my fact my fact this week
00:45
is that scientists have finally worked
00:47
out why
00:48
the four of us and all humans are
00:52
not constantly leaking they started with
00:54
the four of us didn't they
00:55
we were the guinea pigs and they
00:57
extrapolated yes
00:58
exactly no this is this is we've just
01:00
worked out actually i say just
01:02
actually and also i think andy you are
01:04
leaking are you oh sorry yeah
01:07
we've already had these chairs
01:08
upholstered once this weekend come on
01:11
this is uh this was discovered or
01:13
published at least in november of 2016.
01:16
and i didn't know this but scientists
01:18
have been desperately trying to work out
01:20
desperately is a bit of a really it's a
01:21
bit of a stretch why we don't constantly
01:24
leak because
01:25
we shed more than 500 million cells
01:27
every 24 hours so basically in a two to
01:29
four week period our entire body
01:31
of outer layer skin is completely
01:33
replaced in the process of that
01:35
happening we should just be suddenly you
01:37
know
01:37
a bit of arm skin goes and suddenly
01:40
blood's spreading out or sweat or
01:42
we should be like just sprinkler systems
01:44
non-stop but we're not
01:46
and they don't know why except for now
01:48
they do
01:49
and why is it then james it is
01:52
so easy to explain i'm not even going to
01:55
bother
01:56
why don't you try okay what it is is
01:59
we have effectively three layers of skin
02:01
which i think works a bit like a
02:02
conveyor belt
02:03
you know how like shark's teeth get
02:05
replaced the further they go forward
02:07
so the top layer is just the dead skin
02:09
almost it's really flaky and it goes all
02:11
over the shop then there's this middle
02:12
one which is a bit fluidy and that's
02:13
really
02:14
that's really nice um and then we have
02:17
an original layer which is sort of like
02:19
the real
02:19
the real meat of the cake of the meat
02:22
cake oh yeah um
02:24
excellent metaphors yeah i didn't
02:26
realize it was this easy to explain i
02:28
have to say
02:30
and so what happens is they all shift up
02:32
one place and what they didn't know was
02:34
how it was that no holes were being
02:36
revealed when the
02:38
flakes of skin were disappearing what
02:40
was plugging the gap and what they've
02:41
discovered is what effectively is kind
02:43
of like a pretty stick glue it's like a
02:44
temporary glue
02:45
not good not as good as super glue which
02:47
eventually comes to the second layer
02:49
but that original layer has a sort of
02:51
pritt stick glue which holds
02:52
holds the gaps closed so it holds all
02:54
the stuff in so it's like a meaty cake
02:56
with pritt stick on it
02:58
yeah in at the bottom layer and don't
02:59
forget there are three layers of shark's
03:01
teeth on the top layer
03:02
yeah i didn't realize that we were
03:03
completely dead on the outside no we're
03:05
not dead
03:06
some of us are dead on the inside no
03:09
the very outermost layer of skin cells
03:11
are dead yeah we're just we're
03:12
we're wearing death
03:15
what are you wearing today it's just
03:17
death that's the worst bits of me
03:20
that is weird isn't it the cells are
03:21
there and they're full of um keratin
03:23
which is also in your you know your
03:24
fingernails and your
03:25
your hair and things but none of the
03:26
cell machinery is in that outermost
03:28
layer
03:28
yeah that is bizarre yeah so this study
03:31
has found the
03:32
structure of that second layer uh down
03:34
the second layer is called the stratum
03:36
granulosum
03:38
and that layer has got a special
03:40
structure that they've just found out
03:41
and that's the reason that they've
03:42
worked out that we're not leaking right
03:44
this structure is an extremely efficient
03:47
way to pack together shapes
03:49
and it was first discovered by lord
03:50
kelvin and it is
03:53
tetradecahedrons which means it's
03:55
objects with 14
03:56
faces and our cells are made of these
03:59
shapes so they
04:00
really pack together nicely which means
04:01
nothing can get through yeah although
04:03
i've been so confused by this
04:05
and i know mine was way easier as an
04:07
explanation
04:08
what was that tetradectrojunction the
04:11
thing is
04:12
tetrodecahedrons you would have thought
04:13
if that is good at plugging gaps
04:15
then the ones with 16 faces are going to
04:17
be even better and shapes with 18 phases
04:19
gonna be even better it can't be that 14
04:20
faces
04:21
is the maximum goodness of plugging but
04:24
then
04:24
think about a cube that fits together
04:27
perfectly yeah but then
04:28
an object with five faces isn't quite as
04:31
good as a cube is it
04:32
i don't really know okay but i'll take
04:35
your word for it
04:36
but what are you saying that um nature
04:38
should have selected
04:40
a better decahedron i'm just saying
04:43
it's interesting that this 14 faced
04:45
shape seemed to be the
04:46
ideal shape for our skin to be okay yeah
04:49
it's the same shape as the new one-pound
04:50
coin
04:51
is it now so in extremis could you
04:54
plug a gap or a wound in your skin with
04:56
a one pound coin yes
04:57
but hang on no is it the same shape of
04:59
that i thought it's a three d it would
05:01
be if it was a 3d
05:02
um it's the same shape as that because
05:04
the new one-pound coin has 12 sides
05:06
around the edge and then it has two
05:07
sides on front and back i mean it's the
05:09
same shape it's not exactly that it's
05:10
got the same number of bases
05:11
yes yeah because it's more like a like a
05:13
rubik's cube
05:14
but with more faces it's more
05:17
equilateral i think the one in the skin
05:18
compared to the pound coin
05:20
but basically as you say andy when i
05:22
seriously wound you later
05:24
you can shove a one pound coin in there
05:25
and see how much good it does
05:28
and so lord kelvin back in the day he
05:30
was trying to work out what is the
05:32
best way that foam can work so if you
05:35
have a load of bubbles what's the
05:37
absolute most efficient way that they
05:38
can
05:38
pack together and he came up with this
05:40
particular shape and then it's only
05:42
recently that we found out it's in the
05:43
human body
05:44
that's amazing that's really cool why
05:46
was there a problem in the 19th century
05:48
with
05:48
foam being inefficiently packed well no
05:52
so he was um he was studying mathematics
05:55
and there's a really interesting
05:56
thing in maths which is if you get a lot
05:58
of bowls and put them together
06:01
how do they pack nicest and the way it
06:04
turns out is the same way as green
06:05
grocers do it with oranges so you put
06:07
them all down then you put
06:09
spears in all the gaps and that's the
06:10
most efficient way of packing it
06:12
and they've done it with four
06:13
dimensional five-dimensional
06:14
six-dimensional it's a really
06:16
interesting kind of mathematical thing
06:17
that they do have you guys heard of
06:20
matt tech no it's a lab in america and
06:23
its business is growing human skin so
06:26
there's an incredible feature about them
06:28
in wired
06:29
i really recommend reading it they grow
06:31
two humans worth of skin
06:32
every week but in thousands of little
06:35
coin
06:36
forms and basically it's so that you can
06:38
test shampoos
06:39
or or cosmetics or anything you like
06:42
detergent or little cleaner or suntan
06:44
lotion
06:44
on these little coins of skin yeah and
06:46
they grow them so what they do
06:48
is they get uh off cuts from hospitals
06:50
so if you've been circumcised in boston
06:52
your skin may have been your foreskin
06:55
may have been going to two football
06:56
pitches in size
06:58
and then cut up for experiments wow
07:01
so is it so shampoo will have the same
07:03
effect on someone's foreskin as it were
07:04
on someone's scalp can we be sure of
07:06
that
07:07
no okay we cannot take it
07:10
i think it's the thing that says on the
07:11
bottle no it's been tested on
07:13
foursquares
07:13
so they know what they're doing yeah um
07:16
all the other operations as well like a
07:18
tummy tuck or breast surgery or
07:19
various things like this yeah wow i know
07:21
and they grow it and
07:23
so imagine that um someone else who
07:24
experimented on skin
07:26
is a guy called brown secart who i
07:28
reckon we talked about uh before he was
07:30
a scientist in the 19th century who was
07:32
always experimenting on himself
07:33
and he wanted to know why we needed skin
07:35
and whether we'd be fine without it
07:37
and so to do to find out whether we'd be
07:39
all right with our skin
07:40
no he didn't do the disgusting thing
07:42
you're imagining
07:43
he covered his skin completely from head
07:45
to toe in fly paper varnish which
07:47
completely blocks it up
07:48
so it was to find out if the skin's
07:50
actually having a useful interaction
07:52
with the outside world
07:53
and almost died because it turns out we
07:54
do need ours yeah that's like goldfinger
07:56
yeah the lady who um not the villain it
07:59
was the lady
08:00
in the um movie she was covered in gold
08:03
and she died and there was a room
08:04
did she though i think was that not a
08:05
rumor i no in the movie she died oh in
08:08
the movie she died yeah yeah
08:10
i think i don't go to the movies and
08:12
just listen to the rumors afterwards
08:15
i see everyone who dies with me but like
08:16
did he really die
08:18
it was a rumor he did it would be a
08:19
bigger bit of film trivia if one of the
08:21
bond movies had killed an actress by
08:23
painting her goals
08:24
that was one of the great myths about it
08:25
is that in real life it
08:27
she suffered from that and she died i
08:29
thought it was a real myth that if that
08:30
happened you would die but i thought
08:32
they had left a something like a patch
08:34
of skin on her back unpainted
08:35
and she breathed through that
08:38
that was a rumor but we don't know
08:41
the absolute truth about this bond lady
08:43
i don't think based on that conversation
08:45
except she definitely didn't die
08:47
um right don't know she's alive she's
08:49
fine
08:50
but yeah bronzer card did that and he
08:52
did nearly die and you can if you do
08:53
that and his student burst in and found
08:55
him completely unconscious in the corner
08:56
of the room covered in varnish and so he
08:58
got some sandpaper
08:59
and started sandpapering this spot yeah
09:02
he sanded him down
09:03
and then when he regained consciousness
09:05
must be a better way
09:07
did he then cover him in a layer of
09:08
t-coil and slowly work that in with the
09:10
grain
09:11
yes is that a carpentry joke kind of
09:13
yeah okay
09:14
who jokes a bit much um
09:18
but yeah and he was really pissed off
09:19
brown cigar when he regained
09:20
consciousness he said you've ruined the
09:21
experiment
09:22
we were going to find out if it could
09:23
kill somebody that's amazing the student
09:25
was like no it can
09:26
he's the same guy who uh he ate a
09:28
patient's vomit once to give himself
09:30
cholera so he could prove that lordnam
09:31
worked
09:32
and then he almost died from that as
09:33
well actually um and had to be revived
09:36
this is the same student who's just
09:37
saving him
09:39
comes into work each day hey oh jesus
09:42
covered in rats what's going on
09:46
um you know uh house mites yeah so they
09:49
live on our
09:50
skin and they eat skin and
09:53
do you know what they also eat they also
09:54
eat their own skin do they yeah
09:57
so housewives are as much of a problem
09:58
for themselves as they are for us
10:00
basically do
10:00
dung beetles eat their own dunk don't
10:02
know you
10:04
would wouldn't you you would if you were
10:05
into dung yeah it's the most readily
10:07
accessible dung you can get isn't it
10:09
yeah yeah but the thing about house
10:10
mites is that they have skin and then
10:12
when it flakes off they eat it but then
10:13
and they also excrete it and then eat it
10:15
several times wow to get all the
10:16
nutrition out of it
10:18
clever yes i know um i read a
10:22
fact that i found pretty astonishing uh
10:24
today which is that we
10:26
have a microbiome so we're covered
10:28
obviously every
10:29
apparently centimeter of our skin is
10:31
covered in thousands of different
10:32
species of bacteria
10:34
so we are literally housing a planet in
10:37
the same way that
10:38
our planet is housing life we're doing
10:41
the exact same thing just on our own
10:42
body with bacteria
10:43
and um the article said that if you were
10:46
to if if there was a scientist who
10:48
decided
10:48
to grind up a single person uh and
10:51
sequence
10:52
all the dna from that guy would grind up
10:54
himself
10:56
he's got one foot in the grinder
11:01
[Laughter]
11:03
so yeah so the article was saying if a
11:06
sadistic scientist like him um
11:08
did decide to do that grind up and
11:10
sequence all of that dna
11:11
that was on our entire body either in
11:13
our body or out on top of our body
11:16
only two percent of the genetic material
11:18
that he would find would be
11:20
us the human and the rest of us all the
11:22
bacteria
11:24
98 we're carrying 98 something else
11:27
other than us filthy yeah that's very
11:30
cool
11:35
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:38
that is
11:38
james okay my fact this week is that the
11:40
iconic green code at the start of the
11:43
matrix movie
11:44
is made from sushi recipes
11:48
so cool um so this is a fact it's been
11:51
on the internet a little bit over the
11:52
last few weeks but i really like it
11:54
and it was an interview with cnet by
11:56
production designer simon whiteley
11:58
uh and he said that these little things
12:00
that are going up and down are made of
12:01
reverse letters numbers and japanese
12:03
katakana characters which are from sushi
12:06
recipes
12:07
yeah it's his wife's sushi recipe book
12:09
wasn't it he scanned it in
12:11
and uh took all of the yeah the writing
12:14
so
12:14
cool so do you think there's anyone who
12:16
just watches the matrix when they need
12:17
to
12:18
cook a japanese meal for their friends
12:21
where is that dvd i also think i've only
12:24
eaten sushi i've never made it there
12:26
can't be much
12:27
in the way of recipes take some fish
12:30
take some rice
12:31
wrap it up eat it um so the matrix we
12:34
all live in the matrix
12:36
oh yeah it's an exciting theory isn't it
12:38
yeah actually a
12:39
relatively mainstream theory these days
12:42
that we might live in the matrix
12:43
it is but like i was reading a lot of um
12:46
articles about it off the back of you
12:48
putting this fact forward and
12:50
uh there's a lot of conferences with big
12:52
scientists talking about it and
12:54
even i who love this kind of thing was a
12:57
bit like
12:58
guys this is wasting your time
13:01
but then
13:01
i have a physics degree and i actually
13:03
believe it do you yeah
13:05
do you know what the problem is i this
13:06
is what i noticed you had these big
13:08
scientists neil degrasse tyson uh was
13:10
the
13:10
host of this big conference and a lot of
13:12
scientists talking about it and i
13:13
realized the difference is
13:14
is that stoners say this stuff all the
13:17
time
13:18
no one takes it seriously but if you're
13:20
able to like say an equation at the end
13:21
of your sentence suddenly the world is
13:23
really interested
13:24
and that's what that was that was a
13:26
stoner conference
13:27
with maths maybe every time you say
13:30
something stupid if you just say y
13:31
equals x squared
13:33
exactly do you just only like conspiracy
13:35
theories before they get mainstream
13:37
i think you're kind of a hipster for
13:41
yeah nonsense yeah the jfk assassination
13:43
is so hack
13:44
so one of the most basic ways of looking
13:47
at this is
13:48
we think it's probably possible for us
13:49
to make a simulation of the universe
13:52
at some stage in the future it will be
13:54
and when that happens
13:55
it will be done and it'll be done more
13:57
than once and we wouldn't know if we're
13:59
in here or if we're in the simulation
14:01
and so likelihood is there's one reality
14:03
and loads of simulations so
14:05
statistically we're more likely to be in
14:07
one of the simulations
14:08
although i have a problem with that
14:10
slightly because i'm not quite sure how
14:11
we know there's only one reality and
14:13
then there's like a kind of
14:14
multiverse theory and a parallel
14:15
universe theory yeah so there could just
14:17
be infinite numbers of simulations and
14:19
realities
14:20
and it's true although it could be that
14:22
each of the realities has
14:24
a load of simulations god of course you
14:26
can have different levels of infinity
14:28
you can have higher infinities and lower
14:29
infinities
14:32
hand it over man give me a hit of that
14:36
elon musk i think says and i know he's
14:39
got
14:40
he's a bit wacky but he does say that
14:42
that he thinks there's
14:44
a billions to one chance that we're not
14:46
living in a simulation
14:48
um you say that i don't know if people
14:50
really believe it you know
14:52
intellectually it's probably true
14:54
but do you really think we're in
14:55
someone's video game i think it's more
14:57
likely than not but then i also think
14:59
that it doesn't make any difference
15:00
why was it about to ask what what can i
15:02
do
15:04
if we're in a simulation what am i to do
15:07
about it you can hire in silicon valley
15:09
to tech billionaires who have remained
15:11
anonymous have hired
15:13
a bunch of scientists to try and work on
15:15
breaking out of the simulation
15:16
it must be musk right it must be him
15:18
who's one of them
15:20
so i don't want to spread rumors about
15:21
it have people been given money to try
15:23
and break us out of the simulation that
15:25
we're in
15:25
that was a that was two sentences i
15:27
think in a new york article right
15:29
and no one has followed up on who these
15:31
people are
15:32
but it sounds like it's a good job
15:34
though isn't it what a job being a
15:35
scientist just sorry yeah still nothing
15:37
but we'll need another grant i'm afraid
15:39
yeah
15:40
yeah we haven't been in the boss on
15:41
level three yet so do you think they
15:43
would just play the sims and try and
15:44
work out how to get the sims out of
15:46
their simulation
15:47
that's such a good idea yeah can you
15:49
make the sims play sims when you're
15:51
playing the sims
15:52
i don't know because if you can do that
15:54
i'm with you and your theory only alex
15:56
bell who almost came on this podcast
15:57
today would know the answer to that
15:59
because he's a sims fanatic
16:00
and he's not here yeah oh well there was
16:03
an engineer from mit who worked out
16:06
how much computer memory it would take
16:07
up to simulate the universe as it is now
16:09
so the universe is massively complicated
16:11
and he looked into the size of the
16:12
computer that would be needed to get in
16:14
all this information and he worked out
16:17
that the computer itself that is running
16:19
our simulation would have to be bigger
16:20
than the universe so that's impossible
16:23
but then what is he using windows
16:26
it looks like you're trying to build a
16:28
universe
16:30
then he upgraded his system and it turns
16:32
out it's fine
16:33
because you would just put on that
16:34
little star screensaver with the stars
16:36
wouldn't you
16:37
yeah that's basically good enough for a
16:39
first step see i think a lot of people
16:40
think that's not good enough and
16:42
there's more to the universe maybe we're
16:43
not even the computer game maybe we're
16:45
the screen saver
16:48
how embarrassing the point is
16:51
we don't require much computer memory
16:53
because uh it's not like there's an
16:55
entire universe that's been simulated
16:56
they've only simulated the bits that
16:58
we're
16:59
clever enough to spot so we're too
17:01
stupid to see all the massive gaps in
17:03
this computer system
17:04
so it's like every time we study the
17:05
movement of stars or something then in
17:07
this computer simulation they go okay
17:08
the humans are looking at it now we
17:10
better provide some information for them
17:11
here
17:11
but the rest of the time they don't have
17:13
that information there and that saves on
17:15
computer memory
17:15
and that's why there is a computer
17:17
that's the right size to run this
17:19
simulation that we're all in
17:20
and that's why in quantum physics things
17:22
only change when you actually observe
17:24
them
17:24
yes because we're all in a computer
17:27
that's the thing like does
17:28
you don't see the you know i haven't
17:31
played sims but presumably
17:32
there are there are people in it other
17:33
people in it yeah yeah you build a
17:35
family and they have jobs and
17:36
so you don't see the family suddenly
17:38
sitting around dinner going do you think
17:39
we're in a
17:40
simulation because if we are the
17:42
simulation has started to
17:43
question itself there is a philosophy
17:45
expansion pack of the same swear
17:49
they do do that so it's really good
17:52
so one way you might be able to tell if
17:53
you're in the matrix is if there's a
17:55
glitch
17:56
in the matrix this is a thing isn't it
17:58
it's like a little meme
17:59
if you're going to read it you can go
18:00
onto reddit.com glitch in the matrix
18:03
and you can see examples of when people
18:06
have spotted spotted it
18:07
right um so some of them i only read the
18:10
headlines
18:11
because i read a few of them of the
18:12
actual explanations they were a bit
18:14
boring
18:15
but someone said three eggs have
18:17
disappeared
18:18
in my fridge glitching the matrix guys
18:22
it's the matrix where is my sandwich
18:26
glitch in the matrix i think i heard
18:29
perfect by ed sheeran in 2008 or
18:32
2009. wow come on guys
18:35
if that isn't evidence it's irrefutable
18:38
there's a famous one as well which i was
18:40
told about by our buddy
18:42
joel um who is one of the writers of the
18:44
those ladybird
18:46
books and he's he's very much convinced
18:48
that this is the glitch
18:49
and it's that there used to be a series
18:51
of kids books which i used to read as a
18:52
kid called the berenstein
18:55
what's that we've never heard that
18:57
before oh we got a bit close to reality
18:59
guys
19:01
which alert which alert
19:05
they're going for men in black come in
19:08
there yeah so
19:10
um the berenstein bears uh there it was
19:12
a series of kid books
19:14
and the the glitch is that everyone
19:16
seems to remember
19:17
that they're called the berenstein bears
19:19
but in fact they're called the
19:20
berenstain
19:21
bears the authors were baron stain and
19:25
genuinely there's a whole thing on the
19:26
internet of people talking about i swear
19:28
to god i grew up on these books my whole
19:30
childhood
19:31
it had an e not an a in steen not st
19:35
and the glitches the books have suddenly
19:37
just all
19:38
changed themselves to a different name
19:40
that's like walker's crisps everyone
19:42
thinks they remember walker's cheese and
19:43
onion crisps being the blue flavor
19:45
or the whatever flavor they're not the
19:48
green flavor they are the blue flavor
19:49
yeah they are the blue flavor and
19:50
everyone thinks that they used to be the
19:51
green
19:52
flavor and they never were but that
19:53
sounds like it's another glitch yeah
19:55
and it's like what happened to my
19:56
sandwich guys
19:59
so many glitches in the matrix the
20:03
creators of it were quite keen that
20:04
everyone who was involved got to grips
20:06
with the philosophy weren't they
20:08
so it was the wachowski brothers who
20:11
are in fact both the wachowski sisters
20:12
now so it's the wachowski brothers who
20:15
wrote the screenplay for and directed
20:16
the matrix and they are both transgender
20:19
and they wow
20:20
are both now lana and lily wachowski
20:23
um but they uh you know cited as their
20:25
influences for the matrix like homer
20:27
and hitchcock and dostoevsky and this
20:29
whole array of
20:30
kind of different sources so why neo
20:32
always goes
20:34
you think it's the first part of the
20:35
word dostoevsky
20:45
wow we're really on different planes
20:48
aren't we
20:49
sorry um anyway during the filming of it
20:53
everyone who worked in it all the actors
20:54
were made to read three books they were
20:56
made to read three books of philosophy
20:58
so simulacra and simulation by jean
21:02
who's like a sociologist and philosopher
21:04
and then they were made to read out of
21:05
control
21:06
by an ex-editor of wired and they were
21:08
made to read introducing evolutionary
21:09
psychology
21:10
so they had to really come to terms with
21:12
the philosophy that they were exploring
21:14
yeah interesting it doesn't have come in
21:16
very handy during the massive gum fight
21:17
scene in the lobby
21:21
um so the warner brothers they didn't
21:22
trust the wachowski brothers at first
21:24
because the wachowski brothers had very
21:25
little experience making films and this
21:27
was a very big idea
21:28
so they told them they had to go away
21:30
and direct another film first
21:32
okay they just said go away make a
21:33
different film and if that wasn't
21:34
successful we'll let you make them make
21:35
what was the other one they went and
21:36
made a film called bound which is
21:38
described by the new yorker as a lesbian
21:40
thriller with a happy ending
21:42
it just doesn't sound very close to the
21:44
matrix it doesn't seem like a perfect
21:45
proof of concept
21:47
no it's they've you mean they've set
21:48
them sort of a bad job interview there
21:50
yeah but it was a success and then they
21:52
said all right you can go and make the
21:53
matrix
21:54
and did they do a sort of classic happy
21:56
ending or did they misinterpret it as a
21:58
massage uh happy ending i haven't seen
22:01
bound
22:01
i'm just curious if i was trying to make
22:03
a movie with a happy ending
22:05
you would do that would you though it
22:08
doesn't fit in with the plot but they
22:09
told me to do it oh my god
22:12
every disney film would end in a
22:13
masturbation scene
22:17
well we saved the day we're just gonna
22:18
have a quick message
22:22
it's very weird that you hear happy
22:24
ending and that's the first thing you're
22:25
seeing
22:26
the matrix would not have been made if
22:28
you were the one
22:35
okay it is time for fact number three
22:38
and that is chezinski
22:40
my fact this week is that the longest
22:42
ever kayak trip
22:43
was completed by a man who couldn't swim
22:46
this was a really good article in vanity
22:48
fair over some time in the last couple
22:50
of weeks it's about a guy called oscar
22:51
speck
22:52
who's just this amazing guy he was
22:53
german and in 1932
22:55
he climbed into a kayak his business
22:57
wasn't going very well like germany was
22:59
in the doldrums then uh for because of
23:02
the depression and because of the
23:03
versailles treaty combination of the two
23:05
and so he got in a kayak thought sod
23:07
this got onto the danube
23:09
and he kayaked for 30 000 miles all the
23:11
way to australia where he arrived in
23:13
1939.
23:14
and when he arrived and when he arrived
23:16
he was immediately put in prison because
23:18
the world war ii had started
23:20
he was german but he enjoyed it so much
23:22
that he decided he was going to go to
23:24
australia that was never the plan
23:25
so he would kayak kayak during the day
23:27
and then he would dine
23:28
in the evenings with ambassadors and and
23:31
the rich of every place that he was
23:33
staying
23:34
in fact he even and this is maybe
23:36
potentially why he was arrested when he
23:37
got to australia
23:38
just he was german obviously but at one
23:41
point he met up with a nazi officer
23:43
who gave him money funding the next leg
23:45
of his kayak trip
23:46
and he had a nazi flag on the front of
23:48
the kayak as he was going they probably
23:50
thought they were being
23:51
invaded by the smallest ever german
23:53
bosses
23:54
[Laughter]
23:56
you wait till the other guys get here
23:59
yeah he didn't think he was going to go
24:01
to australia his um he had a vague goal
24:03
of reaching cyprus to work in
24:05
the copper mines yeah that was his big
24:07
dream wasn't it he wanted to work in a
24:09
mine
24:10
that was his and he realized it yeah so
24:13
he
24:13
ended up by kind of coincidence i guess
24:16
uh kind of north of sydney
24:17
in a big opal mining area and he really
24:19
did make his living from then on
24:22
with opal mining so he had this fantasy
24:24
about mining and he was always sending
24:25
random as a rock home to his family
24:27
and saying i think this is really
24:28
precious and they just go it's a lump of
24:30
rock mate
24:30
keep kayaking and but he really did make
24:33
his fortune in opal
24:34
mining and he never went back home i
24:36
don't think or he didn't go back home
24:37
until 1970
24:39
never saw his parents again spent the
24:40
rest of his days out in
24:42
australia well seven of them were spent
24:44
in a prison
24:45
of war he was he was we should add um he
24:47
stayed in australia
24:49
post-war but for the entirety of world
24:51
war ii he was
24:52
uh in jail yeah so he was he arrived was
24:55
arrested and spent world war
24:56
ii although he did escape twice did he
24:59
get recaptured because he insisted on
25:00
going with his kayak
25:03
just look for any waterways suitable for
25:05
a kayak could be one of those
25:07
um he got arrested in india on the
25:11
theory they believed that his kayak was
25:13
also a submarine
25:16
oh really yeah yeah and they thought
25:18
they thought he was a spy
25:20
right they thought he was a spine that
25:21
he was um kind of scouting for the
25:24
for the nazis yeah i've been um canoeing
25:26
or kayaking
25:27
and for a lot of the time my kayak was a
25:29
submarine
25:32
i had the problem where i went um i
25:34
think it was kayaking with my wife
25:36
uh both of us in the same kayak but i
25:39
sat at the back and she sat at the front
25:41
and i'm a lot heavier than she is and so
25:43
she was paddling in mid-air
25:45
and i was just sinking
25:49
so the one thing i didn't read and all
25:51
of this stuff about him is that he
25:52
couldn't swim
25:53
did that change at all when he was no he
25:55
never learned to swim he never learned
25:57
to swim
25:58
because there's huge stretches of just
25:59
ocean like dangerous
26:01
high wave ocean well there wasn't i mean
26:04
there were stretches where he'd go for
26:05
like 50 miles or whatever but actually
26:07
if you look at the road he did hug the
26:08
coast as much as he could as you would
26:10
also he didn't really reach australia he
26:13
reached
26:13
an island that the australians had
26:16
colonized and
26:17
and it wasn't mainland but it's still
26:19
australia i would argue that you would
26:21
have
26:22
quite a journey to then get actually to
26:25
the coast of oz
26:26
he'd been all the way around papua new
26:28
guinea as well by that point and dropped
26:29
down yeah he landed in saibai
26:31
which was australian i'm impressed like
26:33
it's it is
26:34
let's see you do it dan i'm just saying
26:36
but it's interesting the the
26:38
non not being able to swim thing is
26:40
extraordinary because
26:41
as soon as you're even this far away in
26:44
a pool from a legend you can't swim
26:45
that becomes dangerous you know yeah a
26:48
kilometer is dangerous if you can't swim
26:50
yeah it's mad yeah he was probably a bit
26:53
mad
26:53
i'm bigging him up here yeah
26:56
so britain sells kayaks to the inuits
26:59
now
27:00
um yes because a school trip went there
27:03
a few years ago
27:04
with a few kayaks and then by the end
27:06
they didn't need the kayaks anymore they
27:07
were going home
27:08
and so they said to those guys do you
27:10
want these and they were like oh yeah we
27:12
we ran out a few decades ago we'll take
27:14
some back and then the company that
27:15
makes them now send a few over every
27:17
year
27:18
that's very cool that's very nice uh
27:19
pope john paul ii loved kayaking
27:21
today yeah he got he was in a race and
27:23
he was winning it and just before the
27:24
finish line he got a hole in his boat
27:26
and he sunk
27:27
just holy that's so good
27:36
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:38
the show and that
27:39
is andy my fact is that male butterflies
27:42
use fake sperm to trick each other into
27:45
thinking they're extra fertile i'm glad
27:48
we've got a happy ending to this podcast
27:52
um 90 of butterfly sperm is fake
27:56
what so what's it what is it plaster of
28:00
paris
28:02
it's it's just filler poly filler it's
28:05
not poly
28:06
it's it's completely bogus sperm it's
28:09
sperm
28:10
look-alikes which have no nucleus they
28:12
carry
28:13
no proper genetic information that can
28:15
be passed on in a mating sense
28:17
90 percent wow so a sperm without a
28:19
nucleus
28:20
yeah so it's just a it's a dummy it's a
28:23
dummy do they
28:24
do they know that as in but
28:27
no no the butterflies
28:34
i don't think they even know they're
28:35
butterflies yeah
28:37
they don't know anything the animals
28:38
okay they don't know what they're doing
28:40
i think they know they do know what
28:42
they're doing here because when they're
28:44
mating
28:44
right male butterflies this is a bit
28:47
gross but they use their penis to
28:49
measure
28:49
inside the females how full she is are
28:51
you whether she's mated before
28:53
and it's like using the dipstick in a
28:55
car's oil tank
28:57
is the closest analogy yeah okay yeah
28:59
they then decide
29:01
so sorry do they pull it out and see
29:02
where the line is i don't know what they
29:03
do but they
29:04
okay i don't know exactly how they but
29:06
they then decide how much sperm to
29:07
deposit based on the females mating
29:09
history
29:10
and it's much cheaper for them to
29:12
produce non-fertile sperm
29:14
right cheaper in form as far as energy
29:16
is concerned actually it takes a lot
29:18
less results money
29:19
yeah so if the female is nearly empty
29:22
then the male will inject lots of
29:24
fertile sperm but then loads and loads
29:25
of fake stuff which is designed to put
29:27
off future
29:27
males who might make with the females
29:29
because then they they do the dipstick
29:30
they come along and they'll say oh then
29:31
there's females made up of
29:32
males and there's less of a chance that
29:34
my um genetic material will get passed
29:36
on to the next generation
29:38
so they might be deterred from mating
29:40
yeah yeah
29:41
so that's why they have this these huge
29:43
amounts of phony
29:44
sperm they also eject maybe this is the
29:47
same thing that they eject actually it's
29:48
something called methyl
29:50
salicylate which is also called oil of
29:53
wintergreen which i think is that
29:54
substance and it smells really really
29:56
strong
29:56
and that's what tells the males don't uh
29:58
mate with this one she's already been
30:00
mated with
30:01
yes and it's the same anti-aphrodisiac
30:03
yes um
30:04
deodorant exactly they spray all the
30:06
females it turns you off yeah okay
30:08
but it's in um it's in mouthwash and
30:11
in chewing gum and in various things
30:14
that we use
30:15
that's why you never have butterflies
30:17
trying to mate with your mouth
30:18
yeah and thank god
30:19
[Laughter]
30:21
so can i just get my head around this
30:23
whole animals don't know what they're
30:24
doing thing
30:25
um so
30:29
they don't know that they've put the
30:31
filler in i don't know that we know what
30:33
they know
30:33
but what no no they must not know that
30:37
they put the filler in
30:38
because otherwise they would then put
30:40
the dipstick in to
30:41
someone and be like i reckon that's all
30:44
filler
30:45
no because if they if the if they find
30:47
that the females
30:48
tank is already full they inject a more
30:51
potent mixture to compete
30:53
more with the other males so they have
30:54
different tactics depending on
30:56
the mating situation basically and why
30:58
would you not just go for your
31:00
most potent sperm because it takes the
31:02
initials it takes a lot of resources
31:04
okay so it's easier to use the fake
31:07
stuff
31:08
i know what you mean i don't know what
31:09
you mean i don't understand why they
31:10
haven't evolved to instinctively think
31:12
when they go in and then they dip in
31:14
and they realize that she's full up
31:16
instinctively evolved to be like well
31:19
i do that a lot and it's not real that's
31:21
my trick
31:22
yeah exactly maybe the other guys have
31:24
caught on so they don't know they don't
31:26
know that they're
31:26
all filler maybe some of them do maybe
31:28
they're not doing it as much as they
31:29
were
31:30
a few thousand years ago um so the
31:32
females if they don't want the
31:34
um sperm they will eat it because they
31:37
have a stomach
31:38
next to their vaginas um which will eat
31:41
the
31:41
sperm so this is specifically to male
31:44
cabbage whites
31:46
and when your male comes in he might do
31:48
a blockage
31:49
in the vagina to stop anyone else coming
31:51
in right but obviously that's not good
31:53
for the female because she wants as much
31:54
genetic material as possible
31:56
and so they found that she has something
31:58
called a bursa copulatrix
32:00
inside her reproductive tract which is
32:02
basically a second
32:04
stomach which means she can digest stuff
32:06
that's in there
32:07
how are you so she can eat through her
32:09
mouth and her vagina
32:11
it's quite the party trick
32:15
no but there are drawers she's got jaws
32:18
down there
32:18
because the stuff the male deposits is
32:20
surrounded by an incredibly hard shell
32:23
which th which which is designed to
32:25
block up the entire thing so that other
32:26
males can't mate with her
32:28
so she has evolved incredibly tough jaws
32:30
to chew through this thing
32:32
there's a film where um jaws yeah with
32:34
chats
32:36
there's a few that's not the one i'm
32:39
thinking of
32:40
he's a giant butterfly vagina
32:46
vaginas have jaws yes yeah yeah
32:49
i think it's a bee movie i don't think
32:50
it was a spielberg obviously a b movie
32:53
as opposed to a butterfly movie
32:56
um but yeah it is good to eat isn't it
32:58
so the semen can actually
33:00
contain useful stuff and the men know
33:02
that and so they do that this thing
33:03
called puddling
33:04
male butterflies where they suck salts
33:07
off the ground so the way butterflies
33:08
drink is
33:09
they drink through a straw in their
33:10
mouth this long proboscis which they
33:12
uncoil
33:13
and the males will go along the ground
33:16
sucking up lots of salts lots of sodium
33:18
and then this goes into their sperm and
33:20
when the woman
33:21
the woman when the female butterfly eats
33:23
that then that creates good
33:25
offspring so what happens when it's
33:28
winter
33:30
and there's loads of ice and we put
33:31
loads of salt on the roads
33:33
and the butterflies come down and eat
33:34
loads of salt what happens then anna
33:37
you get super super butterfly that's
33:39
what you get yeah you get do you
33:40
actually you do
33:41
you get one you get males with extra
33:44
muscles
33:44
and females with bigger eyes and bigger
33:46
brains
33:48
wow i don't see many butterflies in
33:51
winters in gyms
33:53
i thought they all um i didn't think you
33:55
got many flying around in winter yeah so
33:57
you can get let's say
33:58
you you might salt the roads when it's
34:00
not winter or you might salt them in
34:02
higher places when it's cold or whatever
34:04
but basically they found out
34:06
recently that if you salt the roads and
34:09
the butterflies eat the stuff then the
34:11
next summer
34:12
they have extra muscles bigger eyes
34:14
bigger brains
34:15
and they asked the scientist who is
34:18
involved so
34:19
surely that means that road soul is good
34:21
for butterflies
34:23
and she said i do not want that to be
34:25
the take-home message
34:27
why not yeah well i think because
34:31
basically you are changing nature in
34:33
some way and generally speaking we think
34:35
that
34:36
doing that is probably not a goal
34:38
there's gonna be some there's always
34:39
something isn't there
34:40
or i would love to see muscular
34:42
butterflies flying around with big arms
34:46
did you did you i didn't read more on
34:48
this because i didn't think it would be
34:49
a
34:50
good topic to talk about but in
34:51
fukushima there were
34:53
mutant butterflies off the back of the
34:55
radiation that were
34:56
super strength butterflies again the
34:59
take-home messages not
35:00
that give a load of radiation to
35:02
butterflies is good
35:03
um just quickly on this burst of copula
35:05
tricks that are talking about james
35:06
so it's the the the the chewing
35:10
and uh digesting organ it takes 36 hours
35:13
of constant chewing by the female to get
35:15
through it
35:16
that's how tough that's a lot of chewing
35:17
even with your mouth exactly
35:19
yeah exactly
35:23
well it's plunging it's a whole new ball
35:25
game
35:28
so oh god
35:31
but no a team of scientists looked into
35:32
how the the super strength
35:34
spermatophore and they could only break
35:36
it down by
35:37
boiling it in concentrated sulfuric acid
35:40
oh that is how tough
35:41
this thing that the male produces wild
35:43
and the males the spermatophore
35:45
the actual package that they give to the
35:47
female is up to 13
35:49
of the male's weight it's amazing isn't
35:52
it it's all just a fight
35:53
basically the males are just going to
35:55
make it harder and harder and more
35:56
difficult to break down and the
35:58
females are just going to learn more
36:00
tricks to break it down
36:01
yeah yeah yeah crazy it's amazing it's
36:04
the battle of the sexes
36:06
we're all fighting it yeah we were james
36:09
and i were talking to
36:10
our our group buddy leaven skyro who's
36:13
been on the podcast a bunch of times and
36:14
he was saying there's a new report that
36:16
just came out
36:16
which showed that the butterfly mouth
36:20
and tongue predate flowers
36:23
and so you kind of go well that's what
36:25
were they
36:26
eating beforehand if it wasn't that and
36:28
the suggestion from this new study
36:30
is dinosaur tears
36:33
yeah i mean that's very cool isn't that
36:35
amazing so they dip
36:37
into the so they've got this proboscis
36:39
that we think has evolved to go into
36:40
flowers but actually it's evolved to dip
36:41
into the dinosaur's eyes
36:43
yes no no yeah i guess these sockets
36:45
themselves yeah
36:46
i didn't i didn't i'm just remembering
36:48
james and i literally saw him yesterday
36:50
yeah so
36:51
even now um butterflies will eat the
36:53
tears of animals i think we all probably
36:55
knew that
36:56
um but yeah the idea is that because
36:58
they existed before flowers
36:59
they must have been eating the tears
37:01
before they even the flowers came along
37:03
well you would think if you were
37:05
trying to gain sustenance from drinking
37:07
animals tears that you would be more
37:08
subtle than a massive
37:10
butterfly yeah you know what i mean
37:12
they've got big colorful wings
37:13
if something like that landed on my eye
37:15
i would notice i suppose that you could
37:17
say
37:17
that i don't know what these animals are
37:19
because i haven't seen the study but i
37:20
imagine that they didn't look exactly
37:22
like butterflies like with the big
37:24
shaped wings and stuff yeah yeah but do
37:26
you think the butterflies had to evolve
37:27
to make the dinosaurs cry
37:29
like developments to say hurtful
37:31
comments yeah yeah
37:34
otherwise how do they do it or to punch
37:35
them maybe that's why they have those
37:37
superhuman butterflies then
37:39
just float like a butterfly sting like a
37:42
butterfly
37:44
punch like a butterfly
37:51
okay that is it that is all of our facts
37:54
thank you so much for listening if you'd
37:55
like to get in contact with any of us
37:57

38:17
got the links to our tour which is
38:19
still going on 2018 we're going to be
38:21
going around the uk we're going to be
38:22
doing ireland we're also going to
38:24
australia in may so check that out if
38:26
you're down under

new zealand as well we have a link to
38:29
our book which is on amazon and we also
38:31
have
38:32
as we said at the top of the show a link
38:33
to our new behind-the-scenes documentary
38:35

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:21
qi offices in covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:25
here with james harkin
00:26
anna chazinski and andrew hunter murray
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four
00:32
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with you james
00:39
okay my fact this week is that due to
00:41
climate change
00:43
nine out of the 21 cities that have
00:45
hosted the winter olympics
00:46
will be too warm to do so by 2050.
00:50
i was glad to see that you put climate
00:51
change and air quotes there james just
00:53
for this
00:55
so-called climate change yeah
00:58
sure i did not do that people at home i
01:01
wouldn't do that
01:02
um but this is about the winter olympics
01:04
and i'm really excited because the
01:06
opening ceremony is happening now
01:07
as we're doing this podcast is it really
01:09
just right now and by the time this goes
01:11
out it'll be one week into the olympics
01:13
and britain will be top of the medals
01:15
chart probably wow
01:18
i've heard things about australia having
01:20
a good year so
01:21
are they yeah have you got a lot of snow
01:22
in australia no but
01:24
apparently nowhere does any more so
01:27
it's actually playing to our favor just
01:29
on who's going to be where the metals
01:30
charts there's a guy from tonga
01:32
have you heard of him no he's really
01:34
good his name and i hope i pronounce it
01:35
right is peter
01:36
tafa tofua and he tried to learn
01:39
cross-country skiing in a year he's the
01:41
only tongan athlete ever to have been in
01:42
the summer and the winter olympics
01:44
wow which is a rare switch he did all
01:46
his training on rollerskays and paved
01:48
roads he's basically a one-man cool
01:49
runnings
01:50
[Music]
01:52
he hates it as well is the other thing
01:54
he said every time i ski
01:55
i feel like i die a little inside i i
01:58
still haven't had a race where i felt
01:59
completely happy
02:00
oh no um so even though this
02:03
you know the climate is gonna warm and
02:06
it's gonna be all ruined by 2050 at the
02:08
moment everyone's really whining about
02:09
how cold it is aren't they
02:11
in pyeongchang apparently it's really
02:13
absolutely freezing but
02:15
to an extent that people don't really
02:16
like so i think it's meant to be about
02:18
-10 but the windchill factor there
02:20
because it's so windy
02:21
brings it down to -25 wow and they're
02:24
all tweeting that they can't do anything
02:25
and
02:26
um what the australian olympic athlete
02:28
called lydia lassila
02:29
uh was asked to be flag bearer in the
02:31
ceremony and she said it's too cold it's
02:33
bad for my knees i'm not gonna be flag
02:34
bearer for my country sorry
02:36
wow is she going at all yeah yeah she's
02:38
going but she's just saying if you go to
02:39
the winter olympics
02:41
you should know what you're letting
02:42
yourself in for which is that it's going
02:43
to be cold just wear an extra jumper
02:45
you're wearing an extra jumper yeah
02:46
maybe bring some gloves
02:47
i have no sympathy pyeongchang is 700
02:49
meters above sea level
02:51
uh and they call that the happy 700 and
02:54
they say that it's the optimal altitude
02:56
for humans and animals to live
02:58
really apparently according to locals it
03:01
is the coldest place on earth for its
03:03
altitude
03:04
is that right yeah wow and i think it's
03:07
too
03:07
is it kind of too cold for it it doesn't
03:08
snow very much so it's very dry and it's
03:10
mostly using fake snow i think well this
03:12
guy from tonga's gonna be right at home
03:14
isn't he
03:15
he's gonna be the only guy who could do
03:16
it yeah they stockpile
03:18
fake snow yeah so uh in sochi when sochi
03:22
had the winter olympics it was quite
03:23
warm there they had the opposite problem
03:24
to what they have now
03:25
and they stockpiled 60 million cubic
03:27
feet of snow
03:28
just so that they could layer it
03:30
properly and people could ski on it
03:32
sochi's definitely one of these that
03:33
will be 2-1 by 2015. in fact he's
03:35
probably too warm now
03:36
it was probably too warm when it
03:37
happened i think you're right well have
03:39
you seen all the reports of the 2022
03:41
olympics
03:42
the winter olympics this is in beijing
03:44
so beijing won it and the photos that
03:46
they showed
03:47
of dead in the middle of their winter
03:49
was of the mountain range where it's
03:51
going to be taking place
03:52
and it's just green the whole thing
03:54
there's just no snow at all
03:55
and so they're going to be using a lot
03:58
of fake snow
03:59
as well and they won it off um almaty um
04:02
which is kazakhstan or yeah um almaty in
04:05
kazakhstan and their
04:06
slogan to rub it in was keeping it real
04:09
because they were like we've actually
04:09
got snow
04:10
for this winter olympics and they still
04:12
lost do you know
04:14
in 1960 for the 1960 wing tour olympics
04:16
one of the cities that bed was karachi
04:19
no in pakistan wow um
04:22
so do you have himalayas there i guess
04:24
not in karachi actually
04:26
they do have it in the north of the
04:28
country but they don't have it there
04:29
um they have no traditions of any winter
04:31
spots uh
04:33
it's a tropical city on the arabian sea
04:36
and the coldest temperature it has ever
04:37
had
04:38
its entire history is zero degrees never
04:42
ever gone below zero
04:43
wow they didn't win that's the thing
04:45
about china though is that there's no
04:47
tradition of skiing there
04:48
and as a result china has with classic
04:51
chinese efficiency just said right
04:52
everyone is going to learn to ski now so
04:54
they've created 800 ski resorts and they
04:56
want
04:57
in the next four years to get 300
04:59
million people skiing
05:01
china has more um statues of footballers
05:05
soccer players than any other country
05:06
apart from britain
05:08
does it really yeah just of chinese
05:10
footballers or i think they're mostly
05:11
not chinese footballers
05:12
yeah i've been mainly british ones
05:14
weren't it oh europeans yeah or
05:16
brazilians
05:16
why why do they do that because they
05:19
like statues
05:20
yeah and they like football fair enough
05:22
so they've taken
05:24
three things story checks out
05:27
um did you hear about the norwegian team
05:30
at the
05:30
winter olympics this year no no every
05:33
team apparently i didn't know this they
05:34
take their own chefs
05:36
to cook for you and the norwegian team
05:38
chefs ordered
05:39
for the team's feeding for the next
05:40
fortnight uh 1500 eggs from a korean
05:43
delivery service unfortunately
05:45
they made a slight mistake in
05:47
translation and they got 15
05:49
000 eggs delivered to them wow yeah i've
05:52
done that on ocado before
05:54
they said yeah the truck arrived and
05:56
they just kept bringing eggs in
05:58
and basically they got half a lorry full
06:00
of eggs what are they going to do with
06:01
them
06:02
well what's funny is i did find this
06:04
story actually there's a quote where
06:06
everyone's trying to make a massive
06:07
story out of it but all the quotes that
06:08
they come back with are just like
06:10
they'll probably use them i guess i
06:11
don't know maybe the people that supply
06:12
them will take them back i don't know
06:14
it's not a big issue
06:15
no one cares come on give us something
06:19
i bet the people who had to heave the
06:21
eggs all the way inside and then we're
06:22
told to remove them again care quite a
06:24
lot
06:25
yeah dan it's a big story for those guys
06:30
think about the poor delivery guys um
06:33
i was looking into um sports at the
06:36
winter olympics
06:37
uh that no longer exist because i
06:40
remember ages ago we did an
06:41
actual summer olympics episode and we we
06:44
found some things that used to be a part
06:45
of it
06:46
there's quite a few good ones as well on
06:47
this um they used to do figure skating
06:49
on skis
06:51
did they yeah wow so you would yeah it
06:53
was like ski ballet i think
06:55
uh it was either nicknamed or officially
06:56
called and so you could use the poles
06:59
of the cross-country skiing poles to do
07:01
flips and
07:02
so on and it featured in two uh winter
07:05
olympics but
07:06
uh no longer done yeah they used to have
07:08
a medal for
07:09
mountain climbing did that well they
07:11
once had an award given out for mountain
07:13
climbing
07:14
so the end of the very first winter
07:15
olympics uh pierre kubertan the
07:18
father of the olympics he gave out a
07:20
medal for alpinism
07:21
uh which is mountaineering to charles
07:23
granville bruce and he had led an
07:25
expedition to mount everest two years
07:26
before
07:27
and it was to say good on you all right
07:30
wait so it was to say good on you for
07:31
the everest thing it wasn't actually
07:32
because he'd won mountain climbing
07:34
that guy didn't make it to the top of
07:36
everest did he he did not so why did he
07:37
get a medal
07:38
well he tried it's a consolation prize
07:40
yeah okay what was his name sorry
07:42
charles granville bruce right okay um
07:45
ski
07:46
drawing used to be a thing didn't it it
07:48
was in
07:49
the 1928 olympics in samarit
07:52
and it's dog dog pulled sledding yes
07:55
where the dogs basically compete on your
07:57
behalf i don't really know why we don't
07:59
still do this it seems great and it's a
08:00
commonly done thing across kind of
08:02
northern scandinavia it wasn't just dogs
08:05
it was horses
08:05
you could be pulled by horses yeah would
08:07
you have dogs against horses i don't
08:08
know couldn't find that out did you
08:10
manage to find that i think you've got
08:11
to assume that you couldn't no so there
08:13
was one of those one of those is going
08:14
to be better than the others
08:16
exactly whichever one's better you
08:18
wouldn't choose the other one but it
08:19
only appeared once and both horses and
08:21
dogs competed so did they do separate
08:23
races was it the
08:24
the dog race you could calculate how
08:26
many dogs equaled one horse
08:28
and then have a rough rule of thumb for
08:29
that because some horses are better than
08:31
other horses
08:32
yeah you could have shetland ponies
08:33
against greyhounds and then actually
08:35
that would probably even out
08:36
i don't think greyhounds are strong
08:37
enough what if you had two hundred
08:39
greyhounds
08:41
it's very hard to fit them on the podium
08:42
i think that's why they didn't do it
08:44
afterwards
08:45
but then could you just do that with any
08:46
animals like with
08:48
you know five thousand snails or half an
08:51
elephant
08:52
yeah half an elephant
08:55
james you've come to regret your half an
08:57
elephant
09:01
have you guys heard of the ice masters
09:05
no they're real people and they control
09:08
the snow and the ice for winter olympic
09:10
games
09:11
and uh there's an amazing article about
09:13
them in the smithsonian
09:15
and before the games they will spray
09:17
onto like the bobsled tracks for example
09:19
hundreds of paper thin coats of ultra
09:21
purified water
09:22
so it makes it completely smooth so
09:24
there are no bubbles there are no
09:25
impurities
09:26
so because you can't just send a zamboni
09:28
down the
09:30
loose track you can't just you can't
09:32
zamboni yet so you can cheat in the
09:34
luge and the way that people have
09:37
cheated in the loops before is by
09:38
heating their sleds
09:39
so in 1968 the east german women's team
09:42
heated the bottom of their sled and so
09:43
that slightly melts the snow as you're
09:45
going down and it reduces friction
09:46
wow but it used to be legal i think in
09:49
the very earliest games it was
09:50
unorthodox
09:51
people would call you a maverick but it
09:52
wasn't explicitly banned is that right
09:54
yeah do you know in golf you're allowed
09:56
to heat your balls before the game
09:57
starts
09:58
but you're not allowed to artificially
09:59
heat them during the round
10:02
what's the advantage of heating your
10:03
balls and golf well you know they
10:05
stick to your thighs less i guess
10:08
stick to your eyes wow
10:12
never knew that was an issue dad does a
10:14
lot of nude golfing
10:18
um they might fly further
10:22
i don't know i don't think anyone
10:23
actually does this but it is technically
10:25
legal
10:26
what qualifies as artificially heating
10:29
them if they're just in your pocket
10:31
that's fine could you tuck them in your
10:33
armpit
10:36
it would it would mess with your stroke
10:37
wouldn't it yeah it would
10:39
but your caddy could took them in his
10:40
armpit yeah
10:42
the u.s have heated jackets this year
10:45
yeah ralph lauren have designed their
10:47
jackets
10:47
and they've got this super high tech
10:49
design where they contain apparently
10:51
electronic conductive
10:52
inks which are printed inside their
10:54
jacket in the shape of the american flag
10:55
and they're attached to a battery pack
10:57
and so it means that all the u.s
10:59
competitors in the winter olympics
11:01
are um artificially heated you don't
11:04
wish harm on anyone but i really
11:06
if if those batteries do happen to
11:09
overheat the satellite
11:11
oh imagine just having a massive
11:13
american flag stars and stripes tattoo
11:15
on your back
11:16
what happened ralph lauren happened
11:20
that's quite nice though because if
11:21
everyone's outside having a sigi can
11:22
everyone just gather around the
11:23
americans to
11:24
get heat off them i'm not sure during
11:26
the winter olympics everyone goes
11:27
outside for a second
11:32
you know eddie the eagle yes yeah our
11:35
british
11:36
celebrity who competed in the 1919 the
11:39
1988 olympics for anyone who doesn't
11:41
know and
11:42
he was the only ski jumper to have
11:43
competed for the uk
11:45
and he was terrible he meant they had to
11:47
change the rules of the olympics to make
11:48
sure
11:48
such terrible people couldn't qualify in
11:50
future but he
11:52
was a plasterer when he entered and he
11:54
still works as a plasterer in stroud
11:56
cool which i just find so weird he's
11:57
such a known name
11:59
to everyone in britain yeah just hanging
12:01
out in stroud being a plasterer
12:03
it must be weird to have a life where
12:05
you're just a plasterer all the time
12:07
and then just for two months you're the
12:09
most famous person in the whole of
12:10
britain
12:10
yeah when you went to the olympics and
12:12
then you're a plasterer again so bizarre
12:14
so when they made that movie of him do
12:15
you think he arrived at the cinema
12:16
thinking
12:17
finally my plastering career is going to
12:19
see it
12:20
oh what they picked that one event
12:26
okay there's time for fact number two
12:28
and that is
12:29
zazinski my fact this week is that
12:32
canada has a strategic
12:34
maple syrup reserve and in 2012 a
12:37
quarter of the maple syrup in it was
12:38
stolen
12:40
and i love this i only just found out
12:42
about this but um this is
12:43
in quebec so canada taps 75 at least of
12:47
the global supply of maple syrup
12:49
and so it provides a lot of jobs for
12:51
people and so in the same way that like
12:52
there needs to be an oil reserve in the
12:54
u.s because of fluctuations in the
12:55
market
12:55
or if the maple trees suddenly die or
12:58
whatever in canada
12:59
they have a massive reserve so that the
13:01
prices can stay stable and so that the
13:03
supply can stay stable
13:04
stable or artificially high or
13:07
artificially high
13:08
if you believe the whole cartel this is
13:10
a mafia kind of argument
13:11
which yeah some do some do i don't
13:15
no no you wouldn't want to get in
13:16
trouble with those guys no but this was
13:18
the largest theft ever investigated by
13:20
quebec police
13:21
in their entire history that's kind of
13:23
nice that it got to be something a local
13:25
product isn't it yeah
13:26
yeah it was 30 million dollars worth
13:29
was stolen which i think you think it
13:31
was about 6 000 barrels
13:34
it was enough maple syrup to put one
13:35
tablespoon on 183 million flapjacks
13:40
okay would you put maple syrup on a
13:41
flapjack i think that maybe now i read
13:43
that because i thought it said pancakes
13:45
and then i read it and it said flapjacks
13:47
so there are two options here one i've
13:49
written down the wrong word
13:50
or more likely i've copy-pasted that
13:52
word and the word flapjack means
13:53
something different in canada
13:55
ah anyway there are these guys the
13:58
federacion de producta
14:00
ericol de quebec which is the as you say
14:02
the syrup producers union and basically
14:04
they do they run the whole show you
14:06
can't you're not legally allowed to sell
14:08
maple syrup
14:09
to anyone except them and then they
14:11
stockpile it
14:12
so that if the farmers have a really
14:14
good year buyers can't buy it really
14:15
really cheaply and then screw the
14:16
farmers over the next season yeah
14:18
however a lot of farmers want freedom
14:20
too they do because they can do things
14:22
like i i didn't quite realize that this
14:24
is how cartels work but the farmers
14:26
don't get paid until
14:27
the stockpilers have actually sold their
14:29
syrup so if they just decide that
14:31
there's been a lot of maple syrup made
14:32
that year so they're not going to sell a
14:34
very high proportion of it then the
14:35
farmers aren't going to get paid for
14:36
their maple syrup
14:37
until it's gone out into the market
14:38
which does seem a bit frustrating so why
14:40
haven't they done what happened in
14:42
america
14:42
in 2002 a farmer called marvin horn
14:46
decided that he was not going to hand
14:47
over his raisins anymore
14:49
so the government since world war ii had
14:52
been stockpiling
14:53
excess raisins from farmers because
14:56
it was the market was flooded basically
14:58
with raisins and
15:00
they didn't know what to do so they they
15:02
they stopped farmers had to give any
15:04
extra raisins that they had just over to
15:06
the government
15:06
and um this guy marvin horn he said he
15:09
wasn't going to hand them over anymore
15:11
the government sued him for six hundred
15:12
and eighty thousand dollars but he won
15:14
the case
15:14
in the end yeah one after thirteen years
15:16
of grinding lawsuits yeah legal battles
15:18
i mean
15:19
i know doesn't everyone just do that
15:21
there just needs to be one
15:22
tree sapping farmer who's gonna spend
15:26
13 years for the cause of maple syrup in
15:27
canada i guess i think no one really
15:29
wants to be the first one to do that
15:31
but the raisin reserve is unbelievable
15:34
yeah
15:34
it's a real thing and it still exists
15:36
they're not even sure if they're going
15:37
to go back to doing it because this
15:38
lawsuit has
15:38
thrown up everything up in the air and
15:40
they might cancel it now
15:42
i can't believe there's been a massive
15:43
raising stockpile well this is but this
15:45
is why this huge theft of all the maple
15:47
syrup happened as well it's groups who
15:48
are kind of objecting to
15:50
this mafia like hold they have over the
15:51
market and it's discovered in july
15:54
2012 when they just did a routine check
15:56
of this massive reserve
15:57
and they realized that one of the
15:58
barrels kind of tipped over too easily
16:00
and they looked inside and they realized
16:01
it was empty
16:02
and then they inspected all the barrels
16:04
and so many loads of them were filled
16:06
with water
16:07
and they realized that somehow someone
16:08
had been siphoning out maple syrup
16:11
and they found the people eventually had
16:12
done it and it turned out they had hired
16:14
some space out in
16:15
the big storage in the big warehouse and
16:18
they'd just been gradually siphoning the
16:20
maple syrup
16:21
so when you siphon petrol you have to
16:23
suck a little bit out don't you
16:24
and then you spit it out of your mouth
16:26
if i only know this from movies
16:28
and then you can siphon it by using the
16:30
physics of siphons
16:31
yes is it the same with maple syrup and
16:34
if so would you spit it out probably
16:36
not no you'd spit it out but only onto a
16:37
nearby pancake
16:39
or flapjack or flapjack uh and the other
16:42
thing is
16:43
once you steal all these barrels of
16:45
maple syrup
16:47
what do you do is there like a black
16:48
market of maple syrup
16:50
yes a guy down the pub says i've got a
16:52
barrel here there's a big black market
16:55
that's what the rebels do yeah black
16:56
market maple syrup dealing is an issue
16:58
in canada
16:59
and that's how people are getting around
17:00
it so there are quite a few that's
17:02
interesting
17:03
apparently um the price of a barrel of
17:05
maple syrup is around two thousand
17:07
dollars
17:07
thirteen times the price of crude oil
17:10
wow so it's extremely expensive
17:12
and tastier to suck out of a siphon yes
17:15
but less good for
17:16
running a car yeah look they've both got
17:20
their advantages and disadvantages
17:21
it would be a boring world if we were
17:23
all alike but here's a thing
17:26
if you are showing some pancakes
17:29
or flapjacks on television for an advert
17:31
and you want to put maple syrup on it
17:33
they often use motor oil no because it
17:36
looks better on camera than maple syrup
17:38
but what about the demonstrator lady who
17:39
then has to start eating it
17:44
you see her you see her take it and she
17:46
shoves it into a card exhausted
17:49
is that what you do with your monster
17:51
oil
17:52
my car doesn't work it's really weird
17:59
so maple syrup i didn't really know that
18:01
you could just cut
18:02
a cup into the side of a tree and it
18:04
just comes out not any old tree
18:06
good point it has to be a maple tree yes
18:09
um weird though isn't it
18:10
yeah i mean it's because trees store it
18:12
in their roots for winter and then
18:14
they convert it to sugar they still
18:15
start and then they convert it to sugar
18:17
and then that's the sap
18:18
yeah and then you have to die um you
18:19
have to concentrate it about 50 times
18:21
because it just comes out as a much
18:23
thinner liquid
18:24
and the algonquian aborigines would
18:27
concentrate it they would either drop a
18:28
hot stone in
18:29
so that boils off the liquid or they
18:31
would let the sap freeze overnight and
18:34
then at the top
18:34
all the water has turned to ice you just
18:36
get rid of the ice wow
18:37
it's got concentrated maple syrup that's
18:39
so cool wow and then that's it that's
18:41
just
18:42
as good as i think you have to do it
18:43
quite a lot of times
18:45
because these days it's really
18:46
concentrated stuff yeah it's 66 percent
18:48
sugar
18:49
but you can only do it at certain times
18:51
of the year can't you you can only do it
18:53
when it's freezing
18:54
during the night time and warm during
18:57
the day
18:57
so that's when the sap starts flowing up
19:00
and down and that's when it'll tap
19:01
out and i think that's why the reserve
19:03
is so important because it has these
19:05
really specific conditions that it
19:06
flourishes in so it's really easy to
19:07
have a bad season
19:09
but they've invented this amazing new
19:11
way of getting maple syrup out which is
19:12
actually gonna
19:13
increase the yield they think tenfold
19:15
when they master it and it's vacuuming
19:17
so what they've done is they've attached
19:19
vacuum vacuums
19:21
to these maple trees and then they
19:22
connect all the vacuums with a pipe
19:24
and it sucks the syrup out but it's
19:26
incredible it literally sucks the sugar
19:28
almost straight up out of the ground
19:30
so someone described it as being like a
19:32
sugar straw so
19:33
it basically is a way of sucking all the
19:35
stuff out of the ground and then the
19:36
tree
19:37
turns it kind of into the syrup that you
19:39
want on the way up and then you can dump
19:40
it in your big vat feels very unnatural
19:42
all that to me
19:43
it's not authentic is it no it feels bad
19:45
for the tree it must be bad for
19:47
something
19:48
yeah it doesn't it doesn't sound
19:49
sustainable does it because the old
19:51
method where you just drill a hole in
19:52
and then
19:53
people just hang plastic bags off yeah
19:55
just it just drains
19:56
you just leave a bucket like it's a like
19:58
there's a leak does that feel natural to
20:00
you james
20:01
well drilling james just eats the tree
20:05
i think drilling is slightly unnatural
20:07
but i think attaching a massive vacuum
20:09
cleaner to something
20:10
is the next level you're right you're
20:11
right yeah it's a few levels above i
20:13
would say
20:14
um china has more than 200 000 tons of
20:19
frozen
20:19
pork just kind of hanging around
20:23
and that's because they do the same
20:24
thing as canada is doing with its maple
20:27
syrup
20:27
so they have a strategic pork supply
20:30
and that's because they have more pigs
20:32
than the next 40 pot producing countries
20:34
combined
20:35
next 40 years yeah and they're so
20:37
massively dependent on this one
20:39
commodity because loads
20:40
like some people it's like 70 of the
20:42
protein comes from pork
20:44
and so they need to keep the prices
20:45
steady and this is one of the best ways
20:47
to keep prices steady
20:48
and they needed it actually in 2016
20:50
didn't they they already had to draw on
20:52
it yeah they had a
20:53
pork issue a pig issue what happened
20:56
lips
20:56
lips yeah sure apocalypse pork
21:00
chocolates
21:02
apocalypse is better um america uh sort
21:06
of
21:06
similarly um has a reserve of helium
21:11
because in 1921 they thought the blimp
21:13
was going to be the ultimate
21:15
um war weapon for them uh so they built
21:18
these huge factories for all the helium
21:19
that they were keeping for
21:20
their blimps but they got rid of the
21:22
blimps but they kept the helium so they
21:24
still have in
21:25
amarillo texas there's an 11 billion
21:27
cubic feet
21:29
reserve of uh helium that they've kept
21:31
and it's just there
21:32
it's just waiting but it's it's
21:34
embarrassing i think for the people who
21:35
were initially working on it
21:36
when they were asked what they did and
21:38
they'd say i worked for the military
21:39
storing helium and then 10 years later
21:40
it was i work for children's birthday
21:42
parties
21:44
a lot of clowns were seen leaving the
21:46
media in reserve the biggest heist of
21:48
the century
21:49
how many heal how much he didn't think
21:51
you'd have to inhale before you could
21:52
float away
21:53
out of the helium too much an unhealthy
21:58
amount
21:58
yeah i think you need to pump it your
22:00
body full of it basically okay
22:02
hey we need to move on we do need to
22:04
move on uh just one more thing
22:05
yeah um so the eu famously especially in
22:08
the 80s had butter mountains and wine
22:10
lakes
22:10
for exactly the same reason there was a
22:13
building in wiltshire that
22:14
was holding enough butter to spread on
22:16
50 million slices of toast
22:18
and the monster raving looney party um
22:21
suggested that we should turn it into a
22:23
butter mountain
22:24
turn the butter mountain into a ski
22:25
slope for eddie the eagle to practice on
22:28
oh because of the soft landing
22:32
because it's a bit like snow because
22:34
it's a mountain a bit like snow
22:36
and he needed somewhere to practice yeah
22:37
but i just also think that butter would
22:39
be a really nice substance to fall off
22:40
don't try and impose logic on the
22:42
monster raving looney party's policy
22:44
platform
22:45
you're right
22:53
okay it is time for fact number three
22:56
and that is
22:57
andy my fact is that when russia invaded
22:59
finland in 1940
23:01
they were so convinced that they will be
23:02
welcomed with a celebration that they
23:04
took musical instruments with them as
23:05
they invaded
23:08
and they were not they were not welcome
23:10
no um
23:11
so this is a thing called the winter war
23:13
it was between the soviet union and
23:14
finland and uh it was part of the second
23:17
world war so
23:18
the sacramento was in full swing and the
23:20
soviet union had i think wanted a bit of
23:22
finnish territory
23:23
and finland said no we don't want to
23:26
lease you this land or
23:27
or for you to have it so russia invaded
23:30
and
23:30
it was this very very asymmetrical war
23:33
um soviet union had a lot of resources
23:35
finland had almost none
23:36
and all right the soviet union did win
23:39
the war sure
23:40
but it was a very they managed to really
23:43
drag out the campaign
23:44
and it was uh and they lost way more
23:46
people so i think they lost five times
23:48
as many troops in the winter war didn't
23:49
they
23:50
union the soviet union and it was a
23:51
disaster for them it was one of those
23:52
wars that they
23:53
maybe they officially won it because in
23:55
the end the finland had to seed this bit
23:57
of land that they wanted
23:58
but it was a disaster because they
24:00
hadn't expected it to be so rough which
24:02
is weird because the main thing they
24:03
weren't expecting according to all
24:05
accounts was
24:06
the terrible weather and the freezing
24:07
cold yeah you would have i mean that's
24:09
what everyone else
24:10
the problem everyone else stumbled into
24:11
when invading russia so you would have
24:13
thought the russians
24:14
would know and be prepared well they
24:16
probably thought like a winter olympian
24:19
i know cold how cold is that going to be
24:22
they probably thought they had it
24:23
covered
24:23
and it was another level yeah i was
24:26
reading into the winter war
24:27
knew nothing about it and uh you know
24:30
you when you do this kind of research
24:31
your eyes get
24:32
sort of caught by things like sausage
24:34
war and and you think oh that's going to
24:36
be funny
24:36
and it's not because it's war um and it
24:39
basically what it was is
24:41
the soviets had managed to get into
24:43
finnish
24:44
enemy lines and snuck up on them from
24:46
behind and so
24:48
they caught them completely off guard
24:49
and they were taking out a lot of their
24:50
troops as they were heading towards
24:52
their camp but from the direction they
24:53
came
24:54
they arrived at the bit of camp where
24:56
the chefs
24:57
had just been making a massive meal for
24:59
all of the troops so it was a ginormous
25:01
tent full of just freshly made sausages
25:03
and these poor uh soldiers who'd been
25:06
starved and were freezing
25:07
were so taken by the smell and and the
25:10
fact that they'd not eaten that they
25:11
just went in and they ate all of the
25:13
sausages
25:14
and while that was happening the
25:15
finished troops were able to regroup and
25:17
get back in time to defend it so no one
25:19
officially i think won it necessarily
25:21
it's just a little episode in the i
25:22
think the
25:23
soviets got completely routed didn't
25:24
they yeah that is quite funny i think
25:28
they kind of lost because they were too
25:29
busy modging sausages yeah i know the
25:31
war though it's a skirmish
25:33
it's a sausage skirmish that's not so
25:35
skirmish yeah
25:36
um do you know that the finish had um
25:38
saunas on the front line
25:39
no get out they took um every
25:43
finnish soldier for every two or three
25:45
days was allowed to go to one of the
25:46
saunas
25:47
who had to carry the saunas with them as
25:49
they were advanced so they had a few
25:51
mobile saunas
25:52
which i guess probably on wheels i'm
25:55
guessing about that or skis
25:56
yeah and they also utilized the saunas
25:59
in villages around
26:00
finland cool and it was really good not
26:03
just because it was saunas and finished
26:05
people of saunas
26:06
but also because it prevented frost
26:07
bites and it helped kill bacteria
26:09
so they didn't have nearly as many
26:11
problems medically as the russians did
26:12
for that reason
26:13
oh clever that's very good it was a it
26:16
was a guerrilla war basically yes and
26:18
they took advantage of the fact like in
26:20
loads of guerrilla wars the
26:21
infrastructure wasn't really there so
26:22
there were very few roads into finland
26:24
and either side of the roads that you
26:26
had were incredibly thick forest
26:28
so you would have a column of tanks and
26:29
you might mine the road
26:31
so then the tanks have to stop because
26:32
one of the front ones has you know been
26:34
damaged
26:35
and then from that point on the fins
26:38
just kind of appeared through the
26:39
woodlands and constantly
26:41
you know harassed the soviet troops on
26:43
skis
26:44
mostly on skis and there were much
26:45
better skiers because they had trained
26:47
to ski because they didn't have
26:49
this infrastructure at all so that's the
26:50
only way you could get through so i
26:51
think the soviets would just talk to
26:53
where skis stand up
26:54
fire a gun whereas the fins could
26:56
actually dart about and the soviet skis
26:58
were just kind of ones that they kind of
26:59
cobbled together whereas the finnish
27:01
people were all using their own skis
27:02
and so the soviet skis were so bad that
27:05
when the finish
27:06
kind of captured them they just were no
27:08
use and they just used them for firewood
27:10
oh really wow wow and at the winter
27:13
olympics people have been throwing away
27:14
their skis haven't they have they
27:16
yeah oh yeah because it's too cold so
27:18
cold apparently that the
27:20
the first time you try skis on practice
27:21
runs they
27:23
one of one of the coaches said that they
27:25
just turned to garbage the skis because
27:26
they get damaged by it being too cold
27:28
it warps so the snow adheres i think and
27:30
then it's too cold and it warps the ski
27:32
wow yeah i was just looking at um
27:35
wars where people have had way too high
27:37
expectations that
27:38
have turned out to be wrong so these
27:40
guys in finland you know they had this
27:42
band
27:43
because they really thought that they
27:45
they'd got the victory yeah
27:46
and similarly in the bull war i was
27:48
reading about uh when british soldiers
27:50
uh in the second boer war were they
27:53
mounted this to this really good
27:54
strategic point called
27:55
scion cop and it was this hill and they
27:58
got up quite
27:59
easily and they realized there were very
28:00
few casualties and they were fighting
28:01
the balls on all sides they made it to
28:03
the top of this hill
28:04
and it was brilliant and they thought
28:05
we've like achieved this massive victory
28:07
uh we're going to be fine the leader of
28:09
those troops sent a message back to the
28:11
general
28:11
saying he could expect his position to
28:13
be held until doomsday against all
28:15
comers
28:16
because they were at the peak of this
28:17
really important hill and they dug
28:18
trenches in
28:19
planned to stay there so that was in the
28:21
evening and there was a big fog
28:23
uh hanging over them and the next
28:25
morning the fog lifted
28:27
and it was one of those things where you
28:28
think it's the peak of a mountain but
28:30
then the fog lifts and there's actually
28:31
loads more peaks around it
28:33
and the fog lifted and there were three
28:35
more peaks on all sides and all the
28:37
balls just sitting on them
28:38
waiting looking down at them going you
28:40
bunch of idiots
28:42
that and that um that is where the name
28:45
of the cup
28:46
liverpool's football ground you know one
28:48
of the stands is called the cup
28:50
really because it was named after that
28:51
because it was originally there
28:55
no a lot of um stadiums were built
28:57
around this time was it late 19th
28:58
century was it
28:59
and um it was kind of this was a slanted
29:03
bit of land and all these places where
29:05
people were watching football from were
29:06
slanted bits of land so there were
29:07
a few of them were named cops and
29:09
liverpool's the one that's kind of stuck
29:10
around
29:10
oh wow that's very interesting very
29:13
interesting yeah yeah
29:14
do you guys know about simo haiha
29:17
who i'm almost certain that's not how he
29:19
pronounces that in fact
29:20
i'm gonna come out and say it that's not
29:22
how you pronounce his name
29:24
he was finnish uh he has the most number
29:27
of confirmed kills of any soldier
29:29
in history wow uh 505 with his rifle
29:32
alone
29:33
and possibly um 200 plus more uh
29:36
and the soviets were so worried about
29:38
him because he was like a sniper just
29:40
taking people out
29:41
they would send artillery strikes in
29:43
order just to kill him
29:46
he killed probably 0.6 of all the soviet
29:49
fatalities in the winter war were down
29:50
to him
29:53
and he had a full white camouflage suit
29:56
um so no one could ever see him uh and
29:59
so they couldn't see his breath
30:00
he used to put snow in his mouth so that
30:03
his
30:03
breath would be cold so that they
30:05
wouldn't be able to see him that
30:07
why wasn't all winter army uniforms just
30:10
white they were
30:11
they were all the fins were all this
30:13
skis were
30:14
in the uh they didn't eat snow no but
30:17
the um
30:17
russians didn't they came in khaki so
30:19
that was one another one of the problems
30:20
yeah they were
30:22
they got the wrong that's a bit
30:23
different big arrows above the
30:25
same enemy here um
30:28
the a lot of immigrants from america
30:32
and canada finnish immigrants to
30:34
american canada returned home for the
30:35
war
30:36
they sort of came back to sort of help
30:38
finland out
30:39
um and they had a lot of volunteers as
30:41
well who did that one of which was
30:43
the actor christopher lee who fought in
30:45
the winter war
30:46
what what yeah sarah mann from the
30:48
hobbit movies count dooku
30:50
from the second star wars salamanca from
30:52
the man with the golden gate we know the
30:54
filmography
30:55
he didn't know he fought in the winter
30:56
war yeah it doesn't say that on his imdb
30:58
doesn't it no it's yeah um he was not on
31:01
the front line but he was he
31:03
he went back for the effort and he was a
31:05
volunteer he finished helped
31:06
no he was he was just getting started he
31:08
was oh my god
31:12
you're better than that i'm not sure
31:18
no he was american he was just
31:19
volunteering
31:22
uh dan do you know there's a conspiracy
31:23
theory that finland doesn't exist
31:25
[Laughter]
31:28
bringing another one into the mix that's
31:30
the reasoning the idea
31:32
is that it was made up by the soviet
31:34
union and
31:35
uh japan and the reason was that the
31:38
fishing is so good around the baltic sea
31:40
area
31:40
they wanted other countries to think
31:41
there's no point sending boats there
31:43
because there's a massive country in the
31:44
way
31:44
oh wow and so the idea is that there is
31:47
no such place as finland
31:49
and all the people who think that
31:50
they're finnish are actually living in
31:52
estonia and
31:53
you know other countries around there uh
31:56
and
31:56
according to the conspiracy theorists um
31:58
the fact that it's called finland is a
32:00
clue because fish have fins
32:02
that's very good yeah built on
32:06
solid reasoning so who's buying all the
32:09
saunas if it's not
32:18
okay it is time for our final fact of
32:20
the show and that is
32:21
my fact my fact this week is that greek
32:23
gods of the ocean
32:25
include poseidon triton oceanis
32:28
and doris doris the god
32:32
who just brought them all tea and
32:33
biscuits in the afternoon
32:36
yeah so they're all oceanids uh doris is
32:38
an oceanide um
32:40
she doris is poseidon's mother-in-law um
32:42
do you want to when do you say an
32:43
oceanide as if that's just a word that
32:45
we casually use in day-to-day life yeah
32:48
i should i should explain what it is uh
32:49
an oceanid is like a cryptid
32:51
uh cryptid being yetis and stuff and
32:53
oceanid is a
32:54
specific god of the ocean is that right
32:58
yeah oceanic maybe or i don't know
33:01
oh yeah maybe oceanic all the ancient
33:03
greeks are dead so no one is going to
33:05
write it
33:07
but yeah i just love that as a
33:09
poseidon's mother-in-law
33:10
yeah so she's associated with a lot of
33:12
very famous names that you would know if
33:14
you know basic greek
33:15
godology um that i am certain is not a
33:19
word
33:20
i think we should just apologize now for
33:22
all our pronunciations
33:23
for everything for the last four years
33:25
yeah yeah
33:26
especially this for the next four years
33:28
yeah yeah doric is a
33:30
is a greek word obviously and most
33:31
mostly famous for doric architecture so
33:33
everyone is always
33:34
knows how to spot a direct column
33:38
so there was a area called doris which
33:40
is where the direct architecture was
33:41
from
33:42
which i yeah can you tell us how to
33:45
recognize a doric
33:46
column i don't know how to do that i
33:48
always i'm going to get it wrong
33:50
i always thought it was the ones so
33:52
they're wider at the bottom
33:54
than at the top which often you don't
33:56
notice that because it's further away at
33:57
the top anyway got it
33:58
and they've got those little grooves in
34:00
them so you know columns that have um
34:02
grooves so they're quite plain what's
34:04
really funny is that you and i are
34:05
discussing this and andy actually knows
34:06
that he's really trying to get it to
34:09
come in here
34:10
no i don't think we've got time right
34:12
guys basically
34:13
doric is the absolute vanilla of columns
34:15
it's got the grooves it's got a couple
34:16
of round bands at the top
34:17
nothing fancy then there's ionic which
34:19
has got the curly scrolls
34:21
and then corinthian are the crazy crazy
34:23
ones which have got
34:24
flowers and bursting pineapples at the
34:26
top those are the really fancy ones
34:28
right that's what i said then you get
34:29
some composite ones as well but we don't
34:30
have time for that
34:32
no please no no no um
34:35
doris was felt like she was the god of
34:38
the kind of rubbishy part of the ocean
34:40
so
34:40
she was specifically the god of the
34:43
mouth of rivers where the fresh water
34:45
mingles with the brine and it gets
34:46
really briny and salty
34:48
uh so she was really just that specific
34:50
part that she managed and she
34:51
represented the fertility of the sea
34:53
that's quite a good bit i think yeah it
34:55
was a fishing ground so if you're into
34:56
fishing it was like mangroves and stuff
34:58
like that right yeah yeah
35:00
it does feel a bit like she was at the
35:02
back of the queue when the
35:03
bits of the ocean were being handed out
35:04
to all the gods there was a god called
35:06
akulas who was the patron god of the
35:08
accolas river
35:09
and that was the largest river in
35:10
ancient greece that was quite important
35:11
but i like the thing about him was that
35:13
he created the river by crying
35:15
he was the justin timberlake of his time
35:17
wasn't he cry me a river
35:20
good old-school reference there come on
35:23
compared to ancient greek gods
35:26
there are still um loads of things today
35:28
that are named after the gods so
35:30
there was one article uh you know
35:31
quartz.com yes they're really good there
35:34
was an article
35:34
all about uh hedge funds which are named
35:36
after the gods
35:38
and it did it mentioned an analysis
35:40
which found that if you add a word which
35:41
conveys gravitas to the name of your big
35:44
financial body
35:45
like zeus or aries or poseidon or the
35:47
roman equivalents oh doris
35:49
well i'm not sure about doris that is
35:51
the thing
35:52
if you had a gravitas word it adds 250
35:55
000 of income each year wow but
35:59
it also pointed out that almost all of
36:01
these uh
36:02
names are really badly chosen so hermes
36:05
is chosen for loads of them he was the
36:07
god of swindlers
36:08
there's medea who murdered her
36:11
ex-boyfriend's sons
36:12
as icarus who famously flies too high
36:14
and then crashes
36:15
uh into the ocean and then there's
36:17
tantalus who is good because he's
36:19
wealthy
36:20
but he also when the gods visited him he
36:22
killed his own son and roasted him to
36:24
impress the gods
36:25
so they punished him to eternal um
36:28
hunger but they all have the odd
36:29
skeleton in their closet don't they
36:30
these gods
36:31
that's true you know they often do good
36:33
stuff but then they you know eat their
36:35
children or whatever but there's always
36:36
something for all of you yeah
36:38
it's the weird thing to do to impress
36:39
someone is to roast and eat your own sun
36:44
um just on names i found that the elder
36:46
cyclops of gaia
36:48
was called bronte and bronte
36:51
uh was for the thunder god of the
36:53
thunder so
36:54
you've got the brontosaurus or thunder
36:56
lizard which gets its name from the
36:58
brontes
37:00
there's a theory now i'm getting this
37:02
from stephen fry's mythos book
37:04
um and so this is a footnote which is a
37:05
theory he's putting forward that someone
37:07
has come up with
37:08
um the bronte sisters are actually named
37:11
after
37:12
this greek god bronte and it's because
37:15
their father was born brunty
37:18
b-r-u-n-t-y but changed it to bronte
37:20
either
37:21
as a tribute to the classical greek god
37:23
or
37:24
in honor of admiral nelson who was made
37:26
the duke of bronte
37:27
uh and that juked um was located on the
37:30
slopes of aetna and that was believed to
37:32
have been derived from the cyclops name
37:33
bronte so the bronte sisters
37:35
are possibly a tribute name to a greek
37:38
god
37:38
really that's very cool that's pretty
37:40
cool eh um some more gods from that big
37:42
list on wikipedia of gods
37:45
um kaya mighties is the demigod of the
37:48
bean wow
37:50
not even the god of the bee ouch
37:53
um akrata potees is the god of unmixed
37:57
wine
37:58
and incontinence and
38:01
hypocrites i quite like him he is the
38:03
god of silence
38:05
and a lot of people thought that harpo
38:08
marx got his name
38:09
because he was always silent um but
38:12
actually he got his name because he
38:13
played the heart
38:14
he played it's just a coincidence um
38:17
there was a god
38:18
called anna idea and
38:21
the anna idea was a spirit of
38:23
ruthlessness
38:25
yeah yeah i condone that shamelessness
38:27
and unforgivingness
38:29
oh that does sound a bit harsh
38:32
have you do you know carder who's the
38:34
roman goddess of door hinges
38:37
cool quite a quite low rung well no it's
38:40
interesting i wouldn't have known they
38:41
had hinges back then
38:43
the doors okay well well done greeks
38:48
it was roman i was roman sorry roman he
38:51
was romanian
38:52
i think also the greeks might have had
38:53
hinges on doors we don't know that
38:57
it's so annoying because i can't prove
38:58
to you that we do know that in the
39:00
moment
39:00
i think we do know that that must be
39:02
annoying um
39:04
there are still people who worship the
39:05
ancient greek gods other not many
39:07
no i'll say that but in greece in 2006
39:10
according
39:11
athens officially unbanned their worship
39:13
but only about two thousand worshippers
39:15
and the story in the guardian quoted a
39:17
christian priest in greece who said
39:19
they are a handful of miserable
39:20
resuscitators of a degenerate dead
39:22
religion
39:23
who wish to return to the monstrous dark
39:25
delusions of the past
39:27
that's harsh for what it's just a bunch
39:29
of harmless eccentrics isn't it i think
39:30
so
39:31
yeah um do you know the word atheos
39:33
where we get atheism comes from
39:34
without god or god forsaken or abandoned
39:37
by god that's what it originally meant
39:40
and we got the word from the french and
39:42
in english it predates the word theism
39:44
by over 100 years
39:45
so atheism was the first thing and then
39:47
we got theism afterwards
39:48
oh wow oh that's interesting that is
39:51
interesting that is
39:52
absolutely the opposite of what i
39:53
thought would have been i think that's
39:55
why
39:56
you know i think that's why i've
39:57
mentioned it if
39:59
all my facts were exactly what you
40:00
thought they were gonna be then this
40:02
would be a very boring podcast well
40:04
maybe
40:04
you finally said something i didn't know
40:11
[Music]
40:12
okay that is it that is all of our facts
40:14
thank you so much for
40:16
listening if you'd like to get in
40:17
contact with any of us about the things
40:19
that we have said over the course of
40:20
this podcast

00:00
hey everyone before we start this week's
00:01
show we just want to remind you that we
00:03
have a little documentary on the
00:05
internet don't we we sure do
00:07
it's not quite as hard-hitting as louis
00:08
theroux but there may be a couple more
00:10
gags in it
00:11
it's the behind the scenes look at our
00:13
tour from last year
00:15
uh when we were stalked with a camera
00:16
and they filmed us doing japes and stuff
00:19
yeah there's loads of behind the scenes
00:21
bits and pieces there's loads of
00:22
interviews with us there's little bits
00:24
from the show
00:24
it's really really fun you can get it on
00:26
the internet it's called behind the
00:28
gills
00:28
you can get it on apple google amazon
00:31
ask jeeves
00:32
myspace and all those places where you
00:35
get stuff from
00:36
yeah okay i'll win the show
00:43
[Music]
00:48
[Applause]
00:50
[Music]
00:52
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:54
no such thing as a fish
00:55
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:57
qi offices in covent garden
00:59
my name is andrew hunter murray and i'm
01:01
sitting here with james harkin anna
01:02
tajinski and alex bell
01:04
and once again we have gathered around
01:06
the microphones with our four favorite
01:07
facts from the last
01:08
seven days starting with
01:12
james okay my fact this week is that if
01:15
all the bacteria in the world
01:16
disappeared we wouldn't notice for about
01:19
a week
01:21
would scientists notice in a lab if they
01:23
were studying bacteria
01:28
oh they must be down the other end of
01:30
the petri dish
01:32
but i think i'm talking more of the
01:34
day-to-day you know person going about
01:36
their life right
01:37
so this anyways from a paper it's called
01:39
life in a world without microbes by jack
01:42
a gilbert and josh d neufeld and it's
01:45
absolutely brilliant i love it
01:47
um in this paper they say it would take
01:48
us nearly a week to realize what had
01:50
happened
01:51
uh and then that they predict complete
01:53
societal collapse
01:54
only within a year or so oh so the first
01:58
week
01:58
you don't notice anything and then 51
02:01
weeks later that's all downhill
02:02
the whole of society collapses so that
02:05
51 weeks is really horrible
02:07
i reckon it would be probably get
02:08
progressively worse yeah and you know
02:10
the end is nigh
02:11
you know yeah they say then annihilation
02:14
of most humans and non-microscopic life
02:16
on the planet would follow a prolonged
02:17
period of starvation disease
02:19
unrest civil war anarchy and global
02:22
biogeochemical asphyxiation
02:24
but we're doing 90 of that already with
02:26
the bacteria that's true
02:28
but for the first week it's fine we're
02:30
okay
02:31
yeah so the thing is you have let's
02:34
think what
02:34
is that that we need microbes for and
02:36
bacteria so they're in your stomach
02:38
right and they help you digest things
02:40
okay but i found it really weird that
02:42
they you don't need
02:43
humans don't actually need exactly we
02:45
could be unwell without them or we could
02:46
find it hard to digest things but we can
02:48
survive without bacteria i read that and
02:50
i couldn't quite believe it because i
02:51
thought
02:51
surely we must need them i think we just
02:54
get constipated wouldn't we
02:55
yeah yeah so but there are some animals
02:57
which do need them aren't they yes
02:58
although no one has said that okay for
03:00
the first week we might be constipated
03:02
okay but at least it's not prolonged a
03:04
period of starvation disease unrest
03:06
civil war anarchy and global
03:07
biogeochemical asphyxiation
03:09
depends how bad your constipation is as
03:11
well you know
03:12
um so yes animals do need it so cows
03:15
would need it for instance because they
03:16
can't
03:18
digest cellulose without microbes and a
03:20
few other
03:21
animals would as well um but basically
03:24
eventually what would happen
03:25
is all the nitrogen wouldn't be able to
03:27
be fixed the nitrogen cycle would stop
03:29
which is something that we need for life
03:31
uh so also
03:32
what does that the plot all plants use
03:34
that and then so the plants are gonna
03:35
die out
03:36
yeah basically that life needs nitrogen
03:39
and it goes around in the cycle like
03:40
water does but without the microbes that
03:43
would stop
03:44
um which means that the oceans would get
03:45
full of nitrogen which means all of the
03:47
fish would die
03:48
we'd struggle to make oxygen as well
03:50
because a lot of microbes make oxygen so
03:52
a lot of bad things would happen
03:53
but i know and this one week two it's in
03:55
week two
03:56
and this in the whole entire time
03:57
everything is dying and so nitrogen
04:00
isn't being produced but all the dead
04:01
things just stay there
04:02
well yes it basically means that we need
04:05
the mushrooms and i hate to say this we
04:08
need the fungi if all the microbes die
04:10
and they can't break anything down the
04:11
only thing left to break things down is
04:12
the mushrooms they step
04:14
in and save us who'd have thought it
04:16
it's not it's not an action film
04:17
i especially want to see um would your
04:20
poo
04:20
stop smelling well and your sweat i
04:22
think that's one of the real bonuses of
04:24
week one
04:25
is that the smell of sweat is just
04:26
caused by all the bacteria
04:28
and so we would smell great from you're
04:30
constipated
04:31
so it doesn't really matter whether your
04:32
poo smells or not
04:35
now that is true that would happen um so
04:38
louis pasteur
04:39
the famous guy scientist guy um
04:45
he thought that we needed bacteria to
04:48
live in microorganisms otherwise we'd
04:49
all die
04:50
and then a bit after him two guys came
04:53
along ten years later two guys came
04:54
along called george nuttall and hans
04:56
thurfelda and they disproved it by
04:59
getting a guinea pig and getting rid of
05:01
all its bacteria and microbes and the
05:03
guinea pigs still managed to live
05:05
how did they do that well i reckon there
05:08
was probably a lot of antibiotics
05:09
involved
05:10
oh they didn't just give it a shower i
05:13
reckon there was a shower involved
05:14
yeah you might as well soap it down
05:15
there must have been right yeah and this
05:17
is called nobiotic
05:18
living um gno nobiotic
05:22
um get this there is a place in the
05:24
world where this has kind of happened
05:25
your horror scenario james so it's in
05:28
chernobyl
05:29
lots of microbes and fungi got
05:33
contamination and they died and as a
05:34
result um
05:36
there are loads of trees in this place
05:37
called the red forest which is where all
05:38
the trees turned red and dyed and
05:40
they're not decaying
05:42
so there was a there's leaf litter you
05:44
know the sort of leaf mulch on the
05:45
ground
05:46
it's three times thicker in the hottest
05:47
bit of chernobyl radiation-wise than it
05:49
is
05:50
in areas without rain it's quite cool
05:51
isn't it because leaf litter is quite a
05:53
nice thing to walk through and kick it
05:54
up in the air
05:55
yeah you can go for some really nice
05:56
awesome walks
05:58
because it's still going to be raining
06:00
so it's still going to get wet and soggy
06:01
and nasty it's just not going to break
06:02
down to dust yeah he's right
06:04
it's going to be really gross yeah it's
06:05
going to be mulch isn't it it is
06:07
multiple that's not a romantic walk
06:08
through the woods is it when you kick it
06:12
um so bacteria are really cool right and
06:14
you do actually when you do our job you
06:16
get really bored actually of reading
06:18
the all the journalists get bored of
06:20
reading
06:21
we have to do too much of it but all
06:22
journalists say everyone thinks bacteria
06:24
just disease-causing bastards and
06:26
actually some of them are really great
06:28
but some of them are really great and
06:29
some of them are just cool so i
06:31
learned about this one which is the
06:33
let's see if i can pronounce this
06:35
acidic theobaculus and you find it in
06:38
caves and it only comes like a lot of
06:40
bacteria in kind of microbial mats so
06:43
they hang out together bacteria often
06:44
work together comes in these microbial
06:46
mats uh with you know many millions of
06:48
them all squashed up together and it
06:50
hangs off the ceiling and it looks
06:51
exactly like a stalac
06:53
mite tight skate i always thought tight
06:56
was off the ceiling and then someone
06:57
told me it was the other way around
06:58
no it's tight's come down yeah that's
07:00
what i always thought and someone told
07:01
me i was wrong
07:02
we're telling you you're right start
07:04
tight hold on tight exactly and start
07:06
might mighty because it grows up
07:07
or might poke you in the bum yeah it
07:10
might fall on your head
07:11
oh yeah yeah yeah tighter the
07:16
mnemonics are hard well anyway this
07:19
stuff looks like a stalactite
07:20
and it hangs off the roof of caves but
07:22
it's got the exact consistency of
07:24
bogeys and if you read about it is that
07:27
scientific term
07:28
yeah because bogeys have lots of
07:29
different consistencies of a healthy
07:31
bogey james
07:33
a country bogey not one of these
07:34
horrible london polluted boats what
07:36
would happen to your boogies if all the
07:37
bacteria disappeared
07:38
great question if they get stuck in your
07:39
nose like your poo no um
07:45
what i'm asking um they would not be
07:47
colorful
07:49
like bogeys are now i know your pink
07:50
bogeys have always impressed me
07:52
but the colors are the bacteria aren't
07:54
they yeah so you would still have mucus
07:56
but it would be
07:57
really see-through yeah but what would
07:58
it gather around i thought the bacteria
08:01
was the start of a mucus party
08:03
yes well you might have hairs in your
08:04
nose i have got hairs on my nose
08:06
they could be used as a nucleus yes i
08:08
see that now but
08:09
i mean it's clear it's cleaner it's
08:11
you're that first week of your body is
08:13
great you don't smell
08:14
no no you're just like pulling like you
08:16
always got yourself stopped
08:17
it's brilliant you've got glasses okay
08:20
we've gone off topic sorry we haven't
08:22
strayed so what i'm saying is
08:24
this stuff is lots of bacteria which are
08:26
basically bogeys hanging from the
08:27
ceiling and if you read journal articles
08:28
about them
08:29
they're referred to snotites as in
08:32
stalactites
08:32
so you know scientific journals it's
08:34
talking about the snotites and they're
08:36
actually really cool because they
08:37
um excrete sulfuric acid and that
08:40
dissolves the limestone and it makes the
08:42
caves go sparkly
08:43
so you get really sparkly caves um
08:44
because it creates gypsum
08:46
which is like you know gypsum crystals
08:48
it's very cool sparkle but they are
08:50
called snotites
08:51
that sounds like an ancient people it
08:53
does isn't it
08:55
they were fighting against the hittites
08:58
um so i looked up a few other what ifs
09:01
oh good idea so this is a bit off topic
09:03
i know but um i just basically went to
09:05
google and started
09:06
going through what it i just what if x
09:08
happened and um
09:10
there are loads of amazing results so
09:11
what would happen if there was no number
09:13
six
09:14
this is on five thirty eight dot com
09:16
just go straight from five to seven
09:18
well no this is the i would you might
09:20
but basically this was a question asked
09:22
by a child who was five and a half years
09:23
old and clearly
09:24
oh yeah interested in what happens next
09:26
and they went to mathematics professors
09:27
at duke university
09:29
and they said well everything would fall
09:31
apart they said
09:32
i imagine they said stop wasting my time
09:34
i have a more important research to be
09:35
getting on this they said it's really
09:36
interesting because basically if there's
09:37
no
09:38
six there can't be any numbers higher
09:40
than six i can't
09:41
think that's true is it this is a math
09:43
professor who said all the other
09:45
integers are out it's very detrimental
09:47
if you think about it how do you define
09:48
six uh one more than five
09:52
how do you define seven two more than
09:54
five then you're fine
09:56
exactly so if you define it as one more
09:58
than six you're in trouble but if you
10:00
define it as two more than five you're
10:01
absolutely fine yeah
10:02
but then if you start working that way
10:04
how do you define 11
10:06
um six more than five yeah there's no
10:09
six
10:09
so now eleven's in trouble exactly this
10:12
is an actual math professor who said
10:13
we are screwed if we lose six i think to
10:16
reassure him
10:18
risk is low the risk is low you just
10:20
bump seven down don't you
10:21
and then you bump eight down everyone
10:22
gets bombed down one
10:25
or you could promote everyone from zero
10:28
to five
10:28
and you promote zero to one yeah zero's
10:31
always wanted to be one yeah
10:32
zero is just sitting there uselessly the
10:33
concept of zero is a useless one as
10:35
established
10:36
by poor man it didn't exist until
10:39
you know it wasn't about the seventh
10:41
century how did we get to the seventh
10:42
century without zero
10:43
it's impossible exactly it was the sixth
10:45
century then all the eight
10:47
[Laughter]
10:49
um anyway i was looking at some what if
10:51
stuff as well mainly because you said
10:53
you were
10:53
and i thought i'll copy andy that's what
10:56
i do
10:56
um so there's the what if everyone
10:58
thinks about if we all jumped at the
10:59
same time what would happen and if we
11:01
all gathered together in the same place
11:02
and jumped at the same time then we
11:04
would push the earth in the opposite
11:06
direction to the way we jumped by a
11:08
hundred the radius of a hydrogen atom
11:10
which i think is actually decent
11:15
yeah i think that's not bad is it worth
11:17
the organization required
11:19
yeah that's not i think that's not much
11:20
actually i don't know we could jump
11:22
yeah also because as soon as you can as
11:25
soon as you come back down the earth
11:26
comes back up to meet you doesn't it yes
11:28
it's not long
11:28
it's a very rare circumstance in which
11:30
we need the earth to move that
11:32
little distance for that shorter time
11:33
would everyone at the other end of the
11:35
earth go
11:35
what was that no one's even there to
11:39
experience it would be amazing alex
11:41
if you were the only person on the other
11:42
side of the earth yeah he just done it
11:44
as an elaborate product
11:45
where is everyone i must have missed a
11:46
memo
11:49
you're like where is everyone and why
11:50
have i just moved one half of these
11:59
[Laughter]
12:09
um i didn't know if you shot a
12:12
powerful gun uh like a sort of a cannon
12:14
gun but a gun that exists today a modern
12:16
gun on the moon
12:17
you can shoot yourself in the back
12:22
it's an elaborate suicide method isn't
12:23
it yeah if you want to fox the
12:25
detectives
12:25
because one of agatha christie's later
12:27
brainstorms that he never wrote
12:29
the man is found dead alone on the moon
12:33
nothing just saying does the bullet go
12:35
all the way around the moon
12:36
it does so the moon's small enough that
12:37
the gravitational pull isn't too much
12:39
basically goes you have to be
12:40
on top of a halo on a mountain yeah and
12:43
it kind of stays in
12:44
very very low orbit if you get the right
12:46
velocity you obviously have to
12:48
you have a very precise shot to make
12:51
sure you do hit yourself does it only
12:53
work its way on once but if
12:54
you if you shot it and then you felt it
12:56
go past your ear would it go around
12:57
again so you'd have time to stand one
12:59
thing for that no
13:00
i think you've only got one chance
13:02
because then you'd lose momentum
13:03
wouldn't you and then
13:03
it does still have a gravitation yeah it
13:05
might still hit you but it might hit you
13:07
lower down like in the testicles
13:11
man is found shot in the testicles on
13:13
the moon alone
13:16
that is a great what if that's
13:18
incredible
13:20
it's probably all from randall monroe
13:21
who knows when you're looking at stuff
13:22
hypothetical stuff on the internet how
13:24
many of them were originally randall
13:25
monroe so we should credit him just in
13:27
case
13:27
random monroe basically invented the two
13:29
words what and if
13:30
he did yeah yeah no he that's ridiculous
13:33
james he just invented
13:34
putting them together what if he did
13:39
okay it's time for fact number two and
13:40
that is my fact my fact is the world's
13:43
largest wine cellar has tunnels 150
13:46
miles long
13:47
and it's so big it has to have traffic
13:49
rules for people who drive through it
13:51
that is very cool yeah it's incredibly
13:53
cool it's in moldova
13:54
and it's got streets and all the streets
13:56
are named after different grapes
13:58
and you can drive a car through it and a
14:00
lot of employees there they just cycle
14:02
around all the time
14:03
uh which is something it's called it's
14:04
called molesti michi and it's in
14:07
it's near the capital of chisnow
14:10
yeah it's incredible yeah who knew
14:13
i mean james obviously but who knew of
14:15
the rest of humanity about moldova's
14:17
wine industry i know because i've had
14:19
moldovan wine
14:21
yeah you don't you love it well i do not
14:23
rate it very highly
14:24
on my list of um wines by country i must
14:27
say
14:28
drink a lot in russia they drink it yeah
14:30
and the same way they drink um george
14:32
and wines i was reading that they
14:33
really messed up the moldovan wine trade
14:36
in fact in
14:37
i think it was about 2005 when putin
14:39
imposed some sanctions on moldova and he
14:41
banned
14:42
all imports of their wine from going
14:44
into russia because they were a bit too
14:45
pro-eu for him or i think he said it was
14:47
some other reason but i think it was
14:48
because they were too pro-eu and they're
14:50
just loosening it
14:51
so that really damaged their wine trade
14:53
because about 40 of their exports went
14:55
to russia that's so weird because um
14:56
vladimir putin he
14:57
has his own cave in the second largest
15:00
wine cellar in moldova
15:02
that must really piss him off no no no
15:04
it's fine that's only 120 kilometers but
15:06
he has his own cave there and lots of
15:08
celebrities or wealthy people have their
15:09
own special zone oh it's like beverly
15:11
hills
15:12
but for wine yeah but he had his 50th
15:14
birthday party
15:15
in that second largest wine cellar it's
15:17
in crick over circle
15:18
the wine cellar at krakova have you
15:20
heard about this they have a race there
15:22
no so um it hosts a 10 kilometer race
15:25
around the wine cellar
15:27
and you wear a headlamp because
15:28
obviously it's quite dark a lot of the
15:30
place
15:30
and at the end of it you get a glass of
15:32
mulled wine but
15:34
during the race they hire someone to
15:36
dress up as the grim reaper and chase
15:38
you
15:38
no way it sounds to me like
15:41
the prize is getting the wine right yeah
15:44
kind of but you're running around
15:46
next to a load of wine yeah yeah no one
15:49
ever gets to the end
15:50
of building an olympic stadium out of
15:52
gold medals
15:56
we should say that the second largest
15:57
wine tunnel or cave or cellar in moldova
16:00
is also the second largest in the world
16:03
it majors in this thing of having big
16:05
wine cellars and this one
16:06
the biggest one molesti mitzi uh two
16:09
million bottles
16:10
it has um which is more than the next
16:12
ten sellers combined
16:14
wow it's a big seller mate
16:17
that is really big try some
16:20
we are actually drinking wine now aren't
16:22
we to celebrate this fact
16:24
we are i was thinking it to celebrate
16:26
nice one james you've earned yourself
16:27
another glass for that
16:29
that's good that's really gonna help my
16:31
performance later on
16:32
um i'll cave in and have a glass too
16:35
very
16:36
strong alex have you got a pond that
16:37
will earn you a glass of this red wine
16:39
i don't have to have one because i'm the
16:41
banker
16:43
i've got nothing oh well well we've got
16:46
some beer here yeah
16:47
what else can we say so in moldova you
16:49
will find the world's largest building
16:51
in the shape of a bottle
16:53
uh and it is it hosts the strong
16:56
drinks museum wow it sounds like an
17:00
awesome museum right here
17:06
[Laughter]
17:12
[Music]
17:14
when do you say the largest building
17:16
shaped like a bottle it's not that it's
17:17
the largest building in the world and
17:18
it's shaped like a bottle no mate
17:20
it's just that there are some buildings
17:21
in the world shaped like bottles and
17:22
mold over has the biggest one
17:24
yeah so the largest building in the
17:25
world is somewhere in dubai or something
17:27
isn't it you know taipei
17:28
and we would probably know if it was
17:30
shaped like a while awesome they kind of
17:31
are
17:32
aren't skyscrapers all shaped a bit like
17:33
wine bottles
17:35
it's a great philosophical point for
17:36
another time yeah the
17:38
gherkin isn't uh no that's true
17:41
that's shaped like a gherkin the
17:43
walkie-talkie no true the empire state
17:45
building is shaped like a novelty
17:46
liqueur bottle i would say
17:48
the shard is shaped like a tiny bit of
17:49
broken wine bottle
17:50
[Music]
17:52
but we didn't bottle wine until 1860
17:56
i think it was so it was illegal to sell
17:59
wine by the bottle
18:00
between 1636 and 1860 and the reason was
18:04
that people who were doing it before
18:05
that when glass first came in
18:07
it was really easy to cheat on the size
18:08
so you could sell someone a bottle that
18:09
wasn't enough wine
18:11
so you sold it by the barrel and then
18:12
you took it home and you put it in your
18:13
own bottle there were bottles of wine
18:15
yeah they existed yeah yeah they had
18:16
them at home
18:17
i don't know how you siphon it in you
18:19
couldn't buy a bottle yeah because i get
18:20
a bit annoyed when there's not
18:22
a reasonable size option at a bar and if
18:24
i had to choose between a glass of wine
18:26
and a barrel of wine i'd be very annoyed
18:28
i'd like a large glass please no we
18:30
don't do that 125 mils or a barrel
18:35
i'll have a barrel and i'll be like have
18:36
you heard about the government's wine
18:37
cellar
18:38
no the government of this country has a
18:41
wine cellar and it's for
18:43
when they host parties or receptions or
18:45
dignitaries or big dinners you know they
18:46
do loads of official occasions
18:48
and so they have to have a wine cellar
18:49
and it's got about 34
18:51
000 bottles of wine in it valued i think
18:54
about
18:55
800 000 pounds but it's really clever
18:57
they try and
18:58
self-fund by selling off every year or
19:01
every few years they sell off some
19:02
really good wines
19:03
you know they sell one bottle of a great
19:05
wine which allows them to throw an
19:06
entire party with rubbish
19:10
and they've got and during the second
19:11
world war that one of the first um
19:13
aggressive actions of britain in the
19:14
entire war was to requisition the wine
19:16
from the german embassy
19:18
similarly i didn't know about the
19:20
bolshevik revolution
19:21
and it's running into wine problems
19:24
um so this was when the bolsheviks
19:27
stormed the winter palace
19:28
the winter pirates obviously had this
19:29
enormous wine cellar
19:31
which they all discovered all the red
19:32
guard had been sent in and they got
19:34
really drunk
19:35
immediately was there a rose guard as
19:37
well who were not as popular
19:40
um so yeah they went and got really
19:42
drunk and then they'd send others in
19:44
so the leaders the bolshevik leaders
19:45
your lenins uh they're quite annoyed
19:47
because they really want to get on with
19:48
the job
19:49
and they keep sending in more guards and
19:51
more people in their revolutionary lot
19:52
and they kept getting drunk and i was
19:54
reading an extract from this guy
19:56
called antonov offsienko who was a
19:58
bolshevik commander
20:00
and he remembered repeatedly sending
20:02
troops in and them succumbing
20:04
eventually he said we sent armored cars
20:06
to drive away other crowds but the
20:07
armored cars started weaving
20:09
suspiciously after a short amount of
20:11
time
20:11
and then he said they tried to flood the
20:14
cellars so that this wine issue was
20:15
totally removed
20:16
and the firemen they deployed to flood
20:18
the cellars ended up getting drunk so
20:20
they failed to do that
20:21
there was just havoc that is amazing
20:24
yeah very undisciplined that's so funny
20:26
um have you heard of uh octavian vaults
20:30
no it's a it's another mine actually and
20:32
it's in wiltshire
20:33
and it's got five million bottles of
20:35
wine in it what oh
20:36
no so but this one that's the world's
20:39
biggest has got two million
20:40
no you're right i'm looking at that and
20:41
doubting it now but it's under caution
20:43
in wheelchair i mean it's not wait
20:45
caution's where the secret nuclear
20:46
bunker is as well well they've got a lot
20:48
on the ground there
20:49
it's basically for um you know wealthy
20:52
people or famous people but it's it's
20:54
the size of 20 football pitches
20:56
and they hold a huge amount of wine
20:57
there which people have as investments
20:59
and things like that i think i should go
21:00
and check it out yeah for a research
21:02
purpose yeah if i don't come out for a
21:04
while anna come along
21:05
just make sure i'm okay i think they'll
21:07
send me something alex as well
21:10
an armored car anna's finished
21:13
the only way to end one of these things
21:15
if anna had been in the russian
21:16
revolution it would have all been over a
21:17
lot faster
21:19
what i quite like about wine is how
21:20
french wine has just always been the
21:22
best wine
21:23
so it's just the wankiest thing you've
21:25
ever said on the podcast
21:29
the best one when the greeks first met
21:31
the ghouls
21:32
and tasted what the grapes were like
21:33
what the wine was like they were like
21:34
this is obviously the only wine we're
21:36
gonna drink the same with the romans
21:37
from the start of the roman empire
21:38
the invasion of the ghouls in like the
21:40
50s bc they immediately started making
21:43
sure all their wine was imported from
21:44
there
21:45
to the extent that by 92 a.d the emperor
21:48
domitian
21:49
said that he wasn't going to allow um
21:51
any new planting
21:52
in france so they had they possessed
21:54
france and france by that point he said
21:56
you're not allowed to plant vines here
21:58
because it's ruining the industry back
21:59
home it's ruining the roman industry
22:01
because people only want to drink french
22:03
wine
22:04
so there must be a there's an objective
22:06
quality to french wine
22:08
this must be better well there's an
22:10
objective quality to moldovan wine that
22:12
says it's not as good
22:15
in my opinion they weren't banning any
22:17
moldovans from growing their own vines
22:19
and exporting them
22:20
sure feel free to try to send us your
22:22
wine yeah
22:24
so obviously wine sellers can have rat
22:26
problems um
22:28
yeah they can as in because they're
22:29
sellers um and a lot of french
22:31
wine cellars have rat problems um and
22:33
you get populations of alcoholic rats
22:36
to the extent where there is a
22:38
traditional bordeaux
22:40
recipe for rat that you want real
22:42
alcoholic rats it specifies alcoholic
22:44
rats as part of the recipe
22:46
because they they've drunk right how do
22:49
you
22:50
identify whether a rat is an alcoholic
22:52
or not
22:53
if you notice the right drinking in the
22:55
morning is that when you know that you
22:57
can cook the wrap yeah
22:58
it's they've got shaky paws can they rat
23:02
identify that it's an alcoholic i think
23:03
this is
23:08
admitting you have a problem is the
23:10
first step
23:15
well stage 12 the cooking is um is you
23:18
skin them and eviscerate them
23:19
brush them with a thick source of olive
23:21
oil and crushed shallots and grill them
23:23
over a fire
23:23
fire of broken wine barrels so i mean
23:26
it's there is a sort of element of
23:27
romanticism about the wine including
23:29
there because you have to find a wine
23:30
barrel as well
23:31
but like that's kind of cool right
23:32
that's very
23:35
it romanticism sound post-apocalyptic as
23:37
well
23:38
i think it's a shame valentine's day is
23:40
over otherwise we'd all be serenading
23:42
our partners
23:50
okay it's time for fact number three and
23:53
that is
23:54
anna yeah my fact this week is that
23:56
before they settled on the name
23:58
windsor surnames that were considered
24:00
for the royal family
24:01
included gelf whipper wettin
24:05
tudor stewart and england
24:09
i like tudor stewart because it's like a
24:11
double barrel where they've taken the
24:13
both sides of the family i know but i
24:15
think they were worried it might sound a
24:16
bit posh and the royal family knows how
24:18
they like to not give that impression
24:23
i like gulf and wetton especially i've
24:25
been in a lot of uh you know first idea
24:27
brainstorming meetings where
24:28
it's just there's no bad ideas and that
24:30
really sounds like in one of those
24:32
how do you spell golf so it's
24:34
g-u-e-l-p-h so i don't know if that's
24:36
the right pronunciation actually
24:40
wealth the house of guelph sounds so
24:42
rubbish
24:43
so there was reasoning for all of this
24:44
this was in 1917.
24:46
so the royal family descended from queen
24:47
victoria who'd married albert were
24:49
really officially the sax cobra gotha
24:51
family which had a bit of a german ring
24:52
to it and in 1917 for obvious reasons
24:55
uh germany wasn't everyone's favorite
24:56
country and they decided to
24:59
change their name and they changed it to
25:00
windsor and all of these other names
25:03
genuinely were justified so albert's
25:06
house the saxon royal house had the
25:08
names wettin
25:09
and whipper in it and then guelph came
25:12
from the hanoverian royal house
25:14
and then yeah people threw in tudor
25:15
stewart why not everyone loved the
25:16
tudors everyone loved this shirt
25:17
fingers hannover is in germany
25:21
right so people would have picked up
25:22
that's probably why it was dismissed
25:23
quite early on
25:24
i think you've buried the most hilarious
25:26
lead in the story and that they took the
25:28
name from windsor castle so
25:29
the raw family is named after wins the
25:31
castle rather than vice versa oh yeah i
25:33
think that's insane
25:34
that is very weird it's so funny but
25:36
nobody knew what the official surname
25:37
was
25:38
because it had never been used they
25:39
didn't really know if they had a surname
25:40
or not yeah and when they got rid of the
25:42
surname it wasn't just the surname it
25:44
was
25:44
the use of degree styles dignitaries
25:46
titles and honours of dukes and
25:47
duchesses of
25:48
of saxony and princes and princesses of
25:50
the sacks coburg and gotha
25:52
and all other german degree styles
25:53
dignities titles honours and
25:54
appellations
25:55
because they have all this crap like at
25:57
the beginning at the end of their name
25:58
so they had to completely rebrand
25:59
themselves it's not just case changing
26:01
your name
26:01
but isn't the queen now windsor
26:02
mountbatten yeah yeah
26:04
because you have philip took he wanted
26:07
no it's her favorite cake
26:14
[Laughter]
26:22
that is weird though because the
26:23
mountbattens were the battenburgs but
26:24
they changed the mountain patterns of
26:25
phillips family
26:26
and at the same time they thought we
26:28
need to sound a bit less german so they
26:29
changed to mountain bound
26:30
so get this do you know the exact thing
26:33
which prompted them to change
26:34
because yeah we've had three years of
26:36
total war against germany before they
26:38
thought oh maybe we should be found and
26:39
said german
26:40
the thing which prompted it was there
26:41
was a bombing raid on london this
26:43
and before that there were some bombs
26:45
from zeppelins but this is the first
26:46
time there was a bomb a heavy bomber
26:48
plane dropping bombs on the british
26:49
population
26:51
june 1917 and the bomber planes were
26:54
called
26:54
gotha planes that was the name and
26:56
people looked and thought
26:57
hang on if they're called gothic rights
27:00
and those guys are called the saxocomba
27:02
gothas
27:03
something's not right and so and it was
27:05
a within a month
27:06
they changed the name that was how fast
27:07
the turnaround was which is quite a
27:08
speedy we still have goths
27:11
yeah that's true yeah why didn't they
27:12
rebrand is that what you're saying
27:14
imagine oh look there's a pack of
27:16
windsors over there on the street
27:18
but the other thing is why didn't the
27:19
germans then just rename their
27:21
planes windsors every time the queen
27:24
changed her name
27:25
they just renamed the player i don't
27:26
think the the priority of the german
27:28
luftwaffe was to gently troll the royal
27:30
family
27:32
into submission i think they were trying
27:34
to just blow up the whole country i
27:35
agree with that but then on the other
27:36
hand there is a certain
27:38
kind of propaganda thing that they're
27:39
trying to do all the time isn't it
27:41
so i reckon it would work that i do
27:43
agree they missed the trick
27:44
yeah um do you know why elizabeth is
27:46
windsor man baton rather than just
27:48
windsor which was the suggestion
27:50
no it's mountbatten something to do with
27:52
prince philip or something it certainly
27:53
is but they were the windsor house and
27:55
actually when they were born
27:56
charles and anne weren't born winds of
27:58
mount baton but then
27:59
a what's described as an expert amateur
28:02
wrote to the royal family or wrote to
28:03
the government
28:04
and said if this prince andrew who is
28:07
about to be born if this baby that the
28:09
queen's pregnant with
28:10
is born not with his father's name then
28:13
he will have
28:14
the badge of bastardry upon him
28:17
because it's a bit embarrassing to not
28:19
have your father it implies your parents
28:20
might not be married
28:21
um and this caused this huge
28:23
consternation and there was an official
28:25
parliamentary investigation into it
28:26
where they decided eventually
28:28
that they had to add mountbatten to the
28:30
name because otherwise it people would
28:31
just assume prince andrew was a bastard
28:33
born out of wedlock i mean and of course
28:34
clearly people knew didn't they the the
28:36
he
28:36
was literally his parents were the queen
28:38
and prince philip
28:39
you would have thought that point on the
28:41
royal family went on to avoid any
28:42
controversy
28:43
heritage thank god
28:46
[Laughter]
28:47
but um prince charles calls himself
28:49
charles wales doesn't he
28:51
yeah they still play pretty fast and
28:53
loose with their surnames don't they
28:54
which would have been even more
28:55
embarrassing if they'd been called
28:56
england
28:56
yeah yeah yeah you're right would you
28:59
have hyphenated to england wales
29:06
what was that thing that you said they
29:07
would have if the child was born with
29:09
at the badge of bastardry that weirdly
29:12
is my
29:13
only boy scout achievement
29:14
[Laughter]
29:17
all the other lads clubbed together and
29:18
got over me pretty proud wasn't that the
29:20
guy was
29:21
what was he an amateur or what's he
29:23
called amateurs
29:26
i feel like we get quite a lot of those
29:27
actually writing into qi and we love
29:29
them by the way
29:30
he had he was something like he was a
29:32
real expert wasn't it as in he'd i think
29:33
he'd previously embarrassed the
29:34
government on other occasions by
29:35
pointing out actually
29:36
uh if you do that then genealogically
29:39
you're screwed so he was
29:40
he was good yeah and always in that tone
29:42
of voice which everyone enjoyed
29:43
um did you know that another royal
29:45
surname stuart uh
29:47
way further back like mary queen of
29:48
scots to kind of um was originally
29:50
steward
29:51
as in like an air steward as in stuart
29:54
that's where you got it from
29:55
yeah exactly for ryanair didn't you yeah
29:57
he would
29:58
uh after his coronation he would push
30:00
the royal trolley all the way down
30:01
westminster abbey offering duty-free
30:03
on the left and the right to the pews
30:06
yeah
30:08
so mary queen of scots changed her name
30:10
from stuart to stuart s-t-u-a-r-t yeah
30:13
because the french wouldn't have been
30:14
able to pronounce they would have
30:15
pronounced the w as a v it would have
30:17
been stupid
30:18
and she said she would have beaten this
30:20
mary stupid are you serious that's why
30:22
stuart doesn't have a w now yeah
30:24
that's amazing and she and they just it
30:25
was just because people weren't
30:26
pronouncing it correctly so they were
30:27
like well fine
30:28
but the french wouldn't pronounce the d
30:30
or the t at the end of that word would
30:32
they
30:32
because they miss out so it doesn't
30:35
really matter if it's stuart or stuart
30:37
no it's weird that you change the d to a
30:38
t um no yeah that makes sense but then
30:40
it should be too hard it's
30:42
too hard but maybe it was just those
30:44
rhino jokes that just got to her at the
30:45
end
30:47
i think there may be a change in the
30:50
royal family's name coming up soon oh
30:51
hello
30:52
i'm not certain about this okay but i'm
30:54
sorry you do say that
30:56
i know i do go on we do what we were
30:58
saying the other day
30:59
that i said i use the word hello to
31:01
sometimes to mean
31:03
oh hello did you do that i didn't
31:05
believe him
31:06
yeah i do sometimes but i think that
31:09
that was the original meaning of the
31:10
word hello wasn't it
31:12
yeah i'm not making a point it's just
31:14
what i said no i know i just didn't
31:15
believe you and i'm really sorry for
31:16
interrupting you
31:17
when you guys are quite finished so when
31:19
the throne is inherited from a queen
31:21
i.e down a matrilineal line right the
31:24
royal house
31:25
often changes to reflect the patrilineal
31:28
descent of the pneumonic okay it's a bit
31:29
naughty but
31:30
so prince so queen elizabeth is in the
31:33
western dynasty as you say
31:34
from a branch of the house of the sax
31:36
cobra gotha line okay
31:38
but prince charles his father's line is
31:41
prince philip obviously
31:43
and prince philip is a member of the
31:45
house of schleswig-holstein sonderberg
31:47
glucksburg
31:49
so genealogically he won't have the
31:50
german problem again
31:53
so charles william everybody down that
31:56
line because of that sort of ancient
31:58
slightly sexist
31:59
you know traditionally the patriarchal
32:00
thing they are all members of that
32:01
dynasty they probably will not change to
32:03
make themselves the schleswig holstein
32:05
sunderburg glucksburgs
32:06
but there's an outside chance that's
32:08
like all of the names they brainstormed
32:09
put together
32:10
but into one big pseudonym it's really
32:12
weird that they have a hype like their
32:13
surname is a hypothetical surname
32:15
they're like this is what i thought it
32:16
would be if we ever really
32:17
yeah because they don't use them do they
32:18
don't because they have time they
32:19
literally never use them so
32:20
this the whole thing is pointless don't
32:22
need them it's like madonna don't need a
32:23
surname
32:24
yeah same thing
32:30
hey in royal news this is the thing
32:33
that's happened this week which you
32:34
probably read about is the uh
32:36
thing about prince henrik who was the
32:38
danish queen margaret's
32:40
husband who died this week or last week
32:42
um
32:43
but it's just a thing that's in the news
32:44
this week so i was reminded of it
32:46
but i find it really weird that prince
32:48
henrik of denmark has been annoyed his
32:50
whole life that he hasn't been promoted
32:51
to
32:52
the same level as his wife like he has
32:54
made no secret of the fact
32:56
that he's furious that he's not king
32:57
consort he's prince consort
33:00
he doesn't have the same status as his
33:02
son or his wife so he's just died
33:04
and he has refused to be buried next to
33:06
his wife
33:07
uh the danish queen margaret because
33:10
he's like well if you don't think we're
33:11
equal in life i guess we're not equal in
33:13
death
33:13
wait she's still alive yeah well i think
33:15
she can make the decision
33:17
now i'm sorry to be crude about it but
33:21
she's been she's done the graceful thing
33:23
and allowed him not to be buried
33:24
but will in their graves you could have
33:26
a compromise and he would just be buried
33:27
facing away with his arms crossed
33:31
clutching the tv remote
33:32
[Laughter]
33:34
did you know all spanish people have a
33:36
secret surname
33:38
i'm not even joking is it the same for
33:39
everyone no it's different for everyone
33:41
right okay
33:42
different for everyone well no logically
33:45
i've boxed myself into a corner you know
33:47
the thai
33:47
uh in thailand sorry to interrupt we'll
33:49
get back to that but in thailand every
33:52
family has to have a different surname
33:54
you just knocked andy off the fax stool
33:56
with your feet and then jumped on it
33:58
this is it's extremely relevant yeah
34:00
okay you don't know if it's relevant or
34:02
not i haven't told you
34:03
i think that would have been a nice
34:04
follow-on fact had andy finished his no
34:06
it was irrelevant to the little stupid
34:08
joke that i made in the middle of andy's
34:09
thing which wasn't really relevant
34:11
yeah yeah but a single family has to
34:13
have a given family name but it's not
34:14
allowed to be the same as anyone else
34:16
wait so everyone's got a different
34:17
surname how do you know if someone's
34:18
your cousin
34:20
you don't oh wonder they're gonna run
34:22
out well they're quite long thai names
34:24
aren't they
34:25
they aren't that's why they're so that's
34:26
probably why they're so long yeah it's
34:27
like your password for your computer
34:29
long enough no one else is gonna have
34:31
the same we all live with this issue
34:32
online every day we just have unique
34:34
codes for it but you then have to have a
34:35
surname plus one two three and then your
34:36
cat's name
34:38
what's your name it's andrew smith 1986.
34:43
right did you know that all spanish
34:44
people have a secret second surname that
34:46
no one outside spain knows about
34:48
yeah so children inherit two surnames
34:52
okay one from their mother one from
34:53
their father
34:54
so there are spanish people who are
34:55
called you'll have heard of them raphael
34:57
nadel pereira
34:58
enrique iglesias presler and fernando
35:01
alonzo diaz these are all their
35:03
actual names so those third ones why
35:05
aren't they why don't we know about the
35:06
third ones
35:07
um it's it's not common it's not
35:09
reported it's and how did you get this
35:11
scoop
35:13
okay well here's the interesting thing
35:15
is that until recently automatically the
35:17
first one would be
35:18
from the husband from the male parent
35:20
and the second one
35:21
uh from the female parent the mother and
35:24
children would only inherit
35:25
properly the first surname of each
35:28
parent so there's over time there's
35:30
a trend towards keeping male surnames
35:31
and not female ones
35:33
and as of last year parents get to
35:34
choose so that will now be balanced out
35:36
of that true in russia as well they have
35:38
secret
35:38
secret surnames um so um vladimir
35:42
vladimirovich putin
35:44
that's his real name i can see why he
35:45
cut the unnecessary
35:47
basically yeah that's why russian novels
35:49
are so confusing to read yes
35:50
so many different bloody names the
35:52
spanish was quite interesting because
35:53
it's kind of like
35:53
a natural selection through surnames
35:55
because the nicest surname from now on
35:57
the nicest surname will be picked so
35:59
you'll get
35:59
lovely surnames that's true actually
36:01
always because it's unlikely you're
36:02
going to be called
36:03
you know [ __ ] cockhead and then like
36:05
you've got our two [ __ ] names to
36:07
pick from which one they do yeah that is
36:09
an unlikely name
36:11
rude names are dying out so in 1881
36:12
there were 3
36:14
211 [ __ ] in the uk and now there are
36:17
only 785
36:18
and they're all in the house of commons
36:20
yeah that's a joke it's 650 capacity so
36:23
it doesn't work
36:24
doesn't make any sense wow only 785 yeah
36:28
same with a lot of a lot of surnames
36:29
like shuffle bottom that's massively
36:31
declined
36:32
only 322 of those left dafts are going
36:35
down
36:35
about 75 percent decline in these names
36:37
that's a shame oh i tell you where to
36:39
protect
36:39
a name is by giving people money to have
36:42
the name
36:43
um the university of glasgow how much
36:45
money would you need to be called
36:47
alex [ __ ] that's a good point
36:51
if i gave you um ten thousand pounds but
36:54
you had to keep alex [ __ ] for the rest
36:56
of your life
36:56
no you're serious are you kidding james
36:59
i'll do it for a tenner
37:01
oh i'm not gonna bargain that's a tenner
37:03
immediately we have a winner oh okay
37:06
great
37:12
like in bolton that's just a nice way of
37:14
saying hello to anna
37:15
all right okay um yeah that sounds like
37:18
the kind of thing you're telling me now
37:23
anyway the city the university of
37:25
glasgow offer a grant of up to 500
37:27
pounds for anyone with a surname graham
37:29
it's called it's called the graham trust
37:31
and they offer it because traditionally
37:33
graham was a name for poor people
37:34
a long time ago are you joking i know
37:38
you still get that it's just on their
37:39
website and there's a paragraph saying
37:40
that
37:41
uh the original aim from 1759 was the
37:44
distribution to persons of the name of
37:45
graham or descendants of persons of that
37:47
name
37:48
such sums that they shall just requisite
37:50
and to put poor boys of the same name or
37:51
descendants
37:52
of such blah blah blah to enable them
37:54
but then it's not a poor name now
37:56
is it no but it's carried on you can
37:57
still do it is it so it's
37:59
for how much money 500 pounds well
38:02
heather graham if you're listening
38:04
and we know you do your quid's in now
38:07
former arsenal manager george graham
38:10
yeah yeah for another reference i guess
38:12
you didn't get the hello graham one
38:15
do you know any of the graves i was
38:16
trying to think of like a rich graham i
38:18
can't really think of anything
38:19
i thought the graham's gonna be worth a
38:20
bobble too i don't know who that is how
38:22
the graham's
38:22
um austin powers she's in the second
38:24
austin powers film she plays felicity
38:25
shagwell
38:26
that's an unusual set
38:27
[Laughter]
38:30
there aren't that many shag wells these
38:32
days actually if you're called shagwell
38:34
you can get a 50-pound grunt from the
38:37
university of keele
38:47
okay it's time for fact number four and
38:49
that is alex
38:50
my fact this week is that in 2012
38:53
thieves stole
38:54
an entire ski lift from the czech
38:55
republic
38:57
i'm glad that you specified it was
38:58
thieves because imagine if it was
39:00
law-abiding people who stole
39:02
and it has to be thieves yes i'm sorry i
39:04
don't know yeah that's amazing
39:05
how so one sorry just one of the things
39:08
on the lift or the
39:09
entire whole thing so all of the pylons
39:11
the cables
39:12
all of the gondola chairs on it the
39:14
whole thing um
39:16
taken away overnight yeah isn't that
39:19
crazy was there another
39:20
ski was there another ski resort that
39:22
opened its magical new lift
39:23
two days later i reckon but the thing is
39:25
okay i reckon more than one person was
39:28
involved in this theft right
39:29
yeah i would i would be pretty
39:31
impressionable around james i just don't
39:33
think so
39:33
james walking around with his notepad
39:34
and his faces i think this is
39:36
working more than one person certainly
39:38
i'm putting my sherlock holmes hat on
39:40
but i think
39:40
you know you can't do it on your own no
39:44
that would be another great agatha
39:45
christie where poirot calls them all
39:47
together in the drawing room
39:48
actually you all sculpted her
39:52
and where is the shell of now on the
39:54
moon
39:57
um that's incredible yeah i don't know
40:00
how they did it and then surely you'd
40:01
need sort of like jumbo jet to take it
40:03
away and stuff or huge lorries it's
40:04
unbelievable i think if well i think
40:06
because if you think about ski lifts um
40:08
you can take them apart because you have
40:09
the right equipment and you're able to
40:10
chop up all the pylons
40:12
um a lot of it if you have the right
40:13
equipment you can take anything apart
40:14
that's true that's true but it is it's
40:16
all like if you think about it they're
40:17
quite simply made things they're huge
40:19
just bit lots and lots and lots of metal
40:20
it's not
40:21
unbelievably complicated dense stuff
40:22
you've got hollow pylons you've got
40:24
a long long strands of of cable and that
40:27
you can lots of individual stackable
40:28
gondolas you can just wind up the cable
40:30
onto a reel or something can't you well
40:32
i'd wind it around one of the gondolas i
40:33
think it's probably using like when
40:34
christmas lights
40:38
but as soon as you put it away it gets
40:40
knotted and then you open it up
40:42
that's why they haven't set it up yet
40:43
they're still trying to get it apart
40:45
they sort of got all the pylons together
40:47
and tied it together with a string
40:48
yeah um yeah so that that happened are
40:51
we going to talk about ski lifts or
40:52
massive things that have been stolen
40:54
can i tell you my one favorite amazing
40:56
my favorite fact about
40:57
lifts um and then that's the only thing
40:59
i've got and then ski lifts
41:00
yeah uh well cable cars specifically
41:02
because there's no skiing involved in
41:03
this one but
41:04
the this is potentially my favorite fact
41:07
if it's true
41:07
and i rang tfl to find out today and
41:09
they haven't got back to me yet so coco
41:10
may yet run in with a note
41:12
uh telling me it's true although it's
41:13
the last fact so
41:15
yeah it's not looking good for this
41:17
confirmation well either way it's a cool
41:19
idea and it's sort of half interesting
41:20
anyway
41:21
is that the emirates cable car emirates
41:23
airline the gondola which goes
41:24
from uh greenwich to the docklands over
41:26
the river thames
41:27
um it's about 90 metres above the water
41:29
the fact that i read
41:31
was that that's tall enough for most
41:32
ships to go under but you know just like
41:34
with tower bridge they have the
41:35
capability to lift the
41:37
uh road for taller ships to get through
41:38
the same capability exists with this
41:40
cable car which is that
41:41
if you take off all the gondolas off the
41:43
cable car then the
41:44
reduction in weight means that the cable
41:47
raises by a few meters
41:48
meaning that even ships that are taller
41:50
than that can get through i would say if
41:51
you're wanting to steal that cable car
41:53
yeah then you turn up and you take all
41:55
of the bits first don't you you take all
41:57
of these bubbles first and you say oh no
41:59
i'm just doing it
42:01
and because after that all you have to
42:02
do is wind up the rope yeah i think the
42:04
easy way would be to put a hook on top
42:06
of a 90 meter high ship and just
42:08
drive it as fast as you can and then
42:11
pull it
42:11
and actually to be honest if this is
42:13
we're doing this in a cartoon universe
42:15
then you probably would stretch and then
42:16
you go
42:16
[Music]
42:18
straight back into central that's the
42:19
old dog taking a string of sausages
42:22
all you need is one of the sausages to
42:24
be in your mouth um i googled biggest
42:26
things ever stolen
42:27
and the internet seems to think it's a
42:29
mountain
42:31
a mountain called hunter pahad uh which
42:34
is in eastern india
42:35
and apparently what's happened is locals
42:37
have just climbed up there and start
42:39
chiseling bits off the top
42:41
so now if you go there it's like got a
42:43
flat top but it used to have a peaked
42:45
top
42:46
and so they've stolen the difference
42:47
from stealing the whole mountain though
42:48
they've stolen some of them
42:50
that's like stealing one gondola and
42:51
saying i've stolen the holes you've got
42:52
to make a start somewhere
42:54
not all these things can be stolen
42:57
wasn't overnight
42:57
in a day um actually scarfell pike had a
43:00
bit of a
43:01
theft problem as well speaking of
43:03
stealing mountains yeah
43:04
there was this is in 2015 and an artist
43:06
took the top of scarfall pike
43:08
he took uh he took a bit of rock which
43:12
i think was about an inch squared it was
43:14
in an art exhibition called the intruder
43:16
about how humans like imposed our own
43:18
categories on nature
43:20
and so he mounted this rock they had
43:22
taken from the
43:23
top of scarfell pike and he got a nice
43:24
trouble for it like the head of cumbria
43:27
tourism said
43:28
this is taking the mickey and we want
43:29
the top of our mountain back yeah yeah
43:31
what are you going to say if you're the
43:32
head of cumbria tourism what are you
43:33
going to say yeah come on have a bit
43:34
more of cumbria yeah
43:36
he's got to preserve cumbria is
43:52
finally you're missing one b it's not
43:54
unreasonable to think that he's going to
43:55
be pissed off with yes
43:57
um headline from the bomb mafeko in
43:59
2013.
44:02
a stolen prosthetic arm discovered in
44:04
secondhand shopping
44:08
no it's true in 2012
44:12
police apprehended a woman after she
44:15
hobbled to the exit from a shop
44:16
in oslo in norway and she was wearing a
44:19
long skirt covering a 42-inch television
44:22
that she was carrying between her legs i
44:25
think you go for a smaller tv don't you
44:27
i think her eyes are bigger than her
44:29
groin in this case
44:33
in 2012 jamie oliver complained that 30
44:36
000 napkins were stolen from his
44:37
restaurants every month
44:39
and so i was looking at restaurant
44:40
thefts and people do steal stuff in
44:42
restaurants so the jamie oliver wants
44:43
just to say they have his branding on
44:45
don't they they're like
44:46
they're nice kind of they look a bit
44:48
like tea towels but they've got jamie
44:49
yellow branding
44:50
so the police should go for this for
44:51
people who are also called jamie oliver
44:53
no no it's people who like jamie oliver
44:55
not people who are named
44:58
jamie you know it's not a name tag jamie
45:00
oliver doesn't put that name in all his
45:01
towels
45:02
so that if he loses and they get
45:03
returned to him do you put um your name
45:05
on all your napkins
45:06
yes i put them on i put it on all my
45:08
tissues
45:11
it takes ages to monogram it and then
45:12
you play those ones
45:16
um have you heard of the south american
45:17
endoscopy gangs
45:19
are they thieves they must because
45:20
they're in this section and what are
45:22
they stealing with their endoscopes well
45:24
no
45:24
they are stealing endoscopes oh this is
45:26
a gang who go around hospitals
45:28
in europe stealing specifically
45:31
endoscopy equipment i.e things that you
45:33
put up people's bottoms to look inside
45:34
them are they really daring thefts like
45:36
while they're in use
45:37
no they're not that's weird i'm not
45:39
getting a feed on there
45:41
wait a second it's like when all the
45:44
lights come out
45:44
so all the feeds go down and then in the
45:46
hospital they've just got a massive bank
45:47
of money they're all going out one by
45:48
one
45:52
what's going on i mean that is the worst
45:54
security guard job in the world
46:00
2005 in york 300 000 pounds worth of
46:03
endoscopes leicester the same year 250
46:05
000 pounds
46:05
how much are they do you reckon i don't
46:07
know they must be expensive but 2017
46:09
last year
46:10
a gang took 1.2 million i think it was
46:12
canadian dollars worth of
46:14
kit 2014 to 17 16 million what are they
46:16
doing
46:17
with germany well what they think is
46:20
that it's so that you can check that
46:21
drug mules have swallowed the drugs
46:24
wow i know i was thinking who's getting
46:27
backstreet endoscopies in this
46:29
game every endoscopies are back alley
46:36
um should we wrap up yeah like jonathan
46:39
one amazing thing about ski lift i would
46:40
like to know that yesterday
46:42
okay cool so one amazing thing about a
46:44
ski lift i learned is that
46:46
in the last couple of years a snowballer
46:47
got stuck on a ski lift he was stuck for
46:49
six hours and this was in the austrian
46:50
alps it was incredibly cold it was minus
46:52
18 degrees
46:53
he was going to be he didn't know how
46:54
long he's going to be stuck for they
46:55
closed it for the night
46:57
so yeah he's been there for six hours
46:59
and he's
47:00
getting really really cold he said he
47:01
kept falling asleep into some cold
47:02
induced stupor
47:04
and he realized that he had a lighter on
47:06
him so the only thing he could do was
47:07
burn anything flammable on him and so he
47:10
started burning everything he had so
47:11
he burned he had a bunch of tissues he
47:13
burned them then he burned some business
47:15
cards he had
47:16
and then business cards on a
47:17
snowboarding trip well you might meet an
47:19
[Laughter]
47:22
executive
47:25
he must have had them in his wallet or
47:27
something right yeah yeah
47:28
but i mean you probably will meet an
47:30
executive you're on a skiing holiday i
47:31
agree
47:32
right you start off with tissues less
47:34
important than business cards yeah right
47:36
both my tissues and my business cards
47:37
have my name and phone number monogram
47:43
okay so that what did he burn next then
47:44
he had about 100 euros in banknotes and
47:46
he burned each banknote one by one
47:48
and he was on the last banknote when
47:50
someone on a snowmobile saw him
47:52
the bad news is he was then stolen by
47:54
some guys from the czech republic
47:59
[Music]

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:22
covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:25
sitting here with james harkin
00:27
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four
00:32
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with you ciazynski
00:39
my fact this week is that the dome of
00:40
the taj mahal is held together with
00:42
sugar
00:43
fruit juice and egg white it's actually
00:46
just a pudding recipe that they
00:48
accidentally turned
00:49
into a mausoleum this is also with
00:51
bricks
00:52
there are conventional building
00:53
materials in there as well so it's
00:55
actually a mixture of lime
00:57
which is probably delicious yeah it's
00:59
sounding more and more like a caipirinha
01:01
yeah sorry it's the other kind of lime
01:04
you know the one they built buildings
01:05
with limestone
01:06
um lime uh and it's mixed together with
01:10
fruit juice and sugar and egg and it's
01:12
called
01:12
tuna c-h-c-h-u-n-a
01:15
it's all very food stuffy i know um with
01:18
some shells bits of shells and some gum
01:20
and yeah this was the plaster that's
01:21
used on the inside of the dome of the
01:23
taj mahal to hold it all together
01:25
and it actually turns out that egg white
01:26
especially was quite a common building
01:27
material
01:28
this is used in lots of places yeah i
01:30
think so so i heard something in passing
01:32
on the radio and i ended up looking into
01:33
egg whites in buildings and
01:36
there's quite a lot on it in like
01:37
vaguely obscure books so there's an
01:39
essay by
01:40
a filipino food researcher who has an
01:42
essay called
01:43
eggs in philippine church architecture
01:45
and it's cuisine as if cuisine is just a
01:47
leftover
01:48
i reckon that you're the only person
01:49
who's ever read that book i think i
01:52
maybe
01:52
it's
01:54
[Laughter]
01:57
what's her name give her a shout out
01:58
she's called pia lim castillo
02:00
so it's not obscure however if you're uh
02:03
if you're a devout chef in the
02:04
philippines
02:06
it's a massive seller in that community
02:08
maybe and also if you are filipino and
02:11
you know about traditional filipino
02:12
recipes this is really interesting a lot
02:14
of them
02:15
contain just egg yolk so in a lot of
02:17
traditional filipino food it's just egg
02:19
yolk and that's because
02:20
they had so much leftover egg yolk
02:22
because millions and millions of egg
02:24
whites were being used to build their
02:25
churches no way
02:26
this is for centuries absolutely true so
02:29
there's traditional food like brioche a
02:30
thing called yema which is egg yolk
02:32
sweets
02:33
and it's just because there's loads of
02:35
you flying around
02:36
that sounds extremely untrue doesn't it
02:38
well that's amazing
02:39
take it out with pia lim castillo so
02:43
um here's a fact the taj mahal was built
02:45
by 22 000 workers
02:47
and it took 17 years to complete and 22
02:50
000 workers is the same number of
02:52
workers as facebook has
02:54
and they've been going for 14 years wow
02:58
that is very good they also had a
02:59
thousand elephants working in
03:00
construction i don't know if they were
03:02
sorry i'm talking about the taj mahal
03:03
now not facebook
03:07
uh yeah they did didn't they dragging
03:08
all the building materials and i think
03:10
they had some elephants operating
03:11
pulleys
03:12
to lift you know to lift those are the
03:15
especially trusted elephants that were
03:16
working the pulley system because
03:18
absolutely
03:19
i don't fully understand pulleys pulleys
03:21
are a really simple concept god if you
03:23
don't understand pulleys i do worry
03:24
about what else you're missing
03:28
and there was the story wasn't there
03:29
that they cut off all the sculptors
03:31
hands after they built it
03:33
yeah and so they couldn't build anything
03:35
else really
03:36
yeah did they tell you that at the start
03:38
of the gig
03:40
probably not ironically they do ask you
03:42
to sign something at the beginning
03:43
there's no request but what if they made
03:45
a mistake and of course they said oh
03:47
dear we're gonna have to get the second
03:48
gallery redone um can you get the guys
03:50
who made the second gallery in they turn
03:51
up
03:51
sorry yeah i don't think they actually
03:53
did do that there's also a theory that
03:55
they blinded them so they wouldn't be
03:56
able to
03:57
build anything as beautiful but that
03:59
kind of myth is for lots of different
04:01
buildings like saint basil's in
04:02
moscow has the same myth so i have my
04:05
place uh i have my flat repainted
04:07
recently
04:07
i did the same thing at the end of it
04:09
you know i cut my hands off and i
04:10
blinded him and
04:12
yeah there was also a tale that they use
04:14
brick scaffolding that's not a tale
04:15
that's true which is quite unusual they
04:17
usually would use like
04:18
bamboo or something but it was said that
04:20
they did it to conceal what was
04:21
happening as they built it so it would
04:22
be a big surprise when it came down
04:24
um and then there was another thing the
04:27
brick scaffolding
04:28
uh shah jahan who was the emperor
04:31
who commissioned the whole thing and it
04:32
was a muslim for his favorite wife
04:34
he was told that the brick scaffolding
04:35
would take five years to dismantle
04:38
and so he had the bright idea of telling
04:40
the workers that if they dismantled it
04:41
as fast as they could they could keep
04:42
whatever bricks they removed
04:44
and it came down overnight supposedly
04:46
yeah
04:47
that it was like made of delicious
04:48
chocolate or something
04:51
is it true have you guys heard about the
04:53
architecture being
04:54
angled at such a case and built in such
04:56
a way that should it topple over
04:58
it would fall perfectly away from the
04:59
tomb itself
05:01
well supposedly the minarets there are
05:03
four minorities around the outside and
05:04
supposedly they are angled to fall
05:06
outwards rather than inwards but i would
05:08
presume that
05:08
they're just built not to fall over at
05:11
all totally
05:12
yeah i think it would be weird building
05:14
in a structural floor that meant that
05:16
they only fall over in one direction
05:18
yeah i know but at the same time you've
05:19
made half your building with eggs and
05:21
flour and fruit juice
05:24
so you know how he was saying that it
05:25
was built for his favorite wife
05:27
um so it was what's his name again shah
05:29
jahan it was his second wife mumtaz
05:32
mahal
05:32
that it was built for and but there is a
05:35
mausoleum for his first wife
05:37
on the other side of the river which
05:38
i've seen a picture of it and it's
05:40
currently covered in black mold and cats
05:43
oh black mold and cats yeah it's just
05:45
cats everywhere oh just they're there
05:48
it's just full of cats cat person well
05:51
that's what they say now
05:52
like the locals say well all the cats
05:54
are here because she was such a lover of
05:56
cats well she also a black mold person
06:01
that's quite cool though just um uh i
06:03
read about how they clean the taj mahal
06:06
so that one's covered in black mold um
06:08
uh that one needs a cleaning but the taj
06:10
mahal in order to clean it they don't do
06:11
a classic
06:12
sort of water based clean they give it a
06:14
mud bath
06:15
effectively it's like a spa treatment
06:18
and that gives it the glistening white
06:20
wow and then a massage to follow yeah
06:24
yeah put some cucumber that's why there
06:27
are no lights
06:28
allowed on it at night you're not
06:29
allowed to have big spotlights lighting
06:31
it up because it would look beautiful at
06:32
night but they don't do that because
06:33
that would attract
06:34
insects which would then poo all over it
06:37
and these particular insects poo green
06:39
and that's partly why it's been looking
06:41
a bit grubby in recent years
06:42
yeah it's it's just constantly battling
06:44
against excretion from insects
06:47
nearby yeah and air pollution is getting
06:48
so bad now that they think the mud bath
06:50
is not enough now they're gonna have to
06:52
have a shower post mud bath
06:54
um i was talking to some stuff about
06:57
building materials
06:58
um i thought this was really interesting
07:01
that so
07:02
first of all hair is added to plaster to
07:04
make it stronger
07:05
and actually you will have seen this so
07:09
it genuinely adds proper extra strength
07:11
it's added to lime plaster
07:12
so any bit of lime plastic has got lots
07:14
of hair running through it you can order
07:15
horse
07:16
or goat or cow hair from just
07:18
construction supplies companies
07:20
and actually if you imagine like a
07:21
broken off bit of plaster
07:23
you know you because when i see little
07:24
threads coming out that i always thought
07:26
i don't know
07:28
together that's just that's just actual
07:30
hair yeah
07:31
look it up google like broken off
07:33
plaster and then there's you'll see the
07:35
goat hair
07:36
wow isn't that weird that's very weird
07:38
yeah also sugar is used as a concrete
07:40
retarder
07:41
which is a thing that stops concrete
07:43
from solidifying too fast
07:45
so if you need to properly shape
07:47
concrete you pour it down and
07:49
maybe it's like a particularly hot day
07:51
so it will bake really fast
07:53
if you add lots of sugar to it which a
07:55
lot of builders do then that slows down
07:57
the
07:58
setting process is why builders always
08:00
want lots of sugar in their tea
08:01
they then whip it out so they can stick
08:03
it in the concrete um
08:04
have you heard of the english equivalent
08:06
of the taj mahal it's
08:08
a memorial to a wife by a grieving
08:09
husband and it's this thing called the
08:10
eleanor crosses
08:12
oh yeah so yeah oh yeah there's one just
08:15
down the road
08:15
yes exactly so they were built by edward
08:17
the first in 1290
08:19
queen eleanor died and he wanted to
08:21
commemorate her and she died up in
08:22
nottinghamshire
08:23
and he commissioned a huge spire cross
08:26
everywhere her funeral procession
08:28
stopped on the way from nottinghamshire
08:29
to london
08:30
he commissioned one of these huge
08:31
crosses so there were 12 of them they're
08:34
only three remaining
08:35
and outside charing cross there's a
08:36
restored victorian replica
08:38
and it looks very cool like a little
08:39
space needle it's got three statues of
08:42
of a woman and it was eleanor of castile
08:44
wasn't it yes
08:45
that's why yeah and she had a triple
08:47
burial it was rare
08:49
so her heart was buried at black friday
08:52
station i think it was something else
08:53
before it was blackfire station
08:58
they've just renovated fire station
09:00
haven't they oh yeah i wonder if they
09:01
found the heart when they were doing
09:03
that maybe
09:04
you'd probably miss that wouldn't you
09:05
yeah with your big truck i don't think
09:07
you'd spot a
09:07
shriveled thousand-year-old heart
09:10
but maybe it helps the concrete to set
09:12
it does that's what happens put a heart
09:14
in every brick
09:16
um and her organs went to lincoln
09:18
cathedral and her body went to
09:19
westminster abbey
09:20
so where would you go to grieve at her
09:22
graveside
09:23
where it's closest i guess i guess
09:26
that's
09:27
the true convenience of it good point i
09:29
think you would go to
09:30
black fridays because of the heart would
09:32
you an easy train connection
09:38
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:40
that is my fact
09:41
my fact this week is that there is an
09:43
ice golf championship
09:45
held each year in greenland 600
09:48
kilometers north of the arctic circle
09:49
however
09:50
because of the constantly shifting ice
09:52
shelf no players hold any records on
09:54
that course
09:55
because it changes on a daily basis
09:58
is that nuts so there must be no guide
10:00
as to how to play the course well is
10:01
that right there's a there's a lot of
10:03
guidance on how to play it well because
10:05
uh it's you're playing on icy terrain um
10:08
you're allowed things that you're not
10:09
allowed in a normal game of golf for
10:10
example you're allowed to clear
10:12
the path yes exactly
10:15
you can yeah you can sort of just make
10:17
it nice and a bit softer
10:19
um the par is much higher i don't really
10:21
play golf or
10:22
understand the rules so it's a power of
10:23
36 per hole
10:25
wow okay so in normal golf you wouldn't
10:27
go above five
10:29
right are you sure it's 36.
10:32
it's maximum handicap of 36. ah okay is
10:34
that different
10:35
um that basically means that you get
10:37
more shots taken off
10:39
right basically oh okay all right
10:41
otherwise the power of 36 would just be
10:43
so tediously long gold studious enough
10:45
anyway
10:45
imagine if it was 36 shots per hole i
10:48
mean is that what we're going to say
10:49
that golf's tedious
10:50
i've got some stuff about that
10:51
[Laughter]
10:55
so just a bit of explanation about this
10:57
this is played
10:58
in a town called umanak it's set up by
11:02
a man called arne neiman he's a hotel
11:05
manager
11:06
and it's this tiny tiny town it's got
11:08
it's got you know over just over a
11:10
thousand residents
11:11
um there's more dogs there than there
11:13
are people by a factor of three to one
11:15
at least
11:16
because you get everywhere by dog
11:17
sledding that's the mode of transport
11:19
um so yeah and so he set this up in 1997
11:22
it's an annual event except for when
11:24
it's too cold and the course has to be
11:25
closed because it's just too icy and
11:27
impossible and
11:28
you'd get frostbite the moment you step
11:30
out maybe if it got too hot they'd have
11:32
to cancel it as well
11:33
yeah that's true yeah yeah and the ball
11:35
is red isn't it
11:36
the ball is red so that they can see it
11:38
um the
11:39
the hole that you hit the ball into is
11:42
twice the size
11:44
so there's lots of different rules that
11:45
get played but it's seen by golfers i
11:48
know you're a golfer and you probably
11:49
didn't know about it necessarily
11:51
beforehand but a lot of golfers talk
11:52
about it as the craziest course you
11:54
could ever play so
11:55
they actively fly out to this remote
11:58
place to
11:59
yeah to be uh a part of this odd game
12:02
and it has uh all the holes are a bit
12:04
closer together because the cold
12:06
air is more dense and so there's more
12:08
drag so i didn't realize this and
12:10
the golf balls move a bit slower through
12:11
cold air that does happen if you play
12:13
golf you know that when the cold
12:14
weather's on it just doesn't go as far
12:16
i played golf once in the himalayas
12:18
where the air is really
12:19
thin and it just goes miles really
12:22
really that's the best place to play
12:23
golf by the way
12:24
because it's not having to tussle its
12:25
way through a load of air molecules all
12:27
the molecules that's it
12:28
the molecules get in the way well this
12:29
is what's confusing because cold air is
12:31
more dense
12:32
because um the molecules aren't moving
12:33
as fast so there's more drag
12:35
but you would have thought as you say
12:36
once you get at altitude and it's cold
12:38
because there are just fewer air
12:39
molecules it must move faster because
12:41
they get in the way
12:42
so it moves slower through some cold air
12:44
but then faster altitude sounds like
12:46
this is why golf is such an interesting
12:48
game
12:50
is this what the commentary is like if i
12:52
ever bothered to turn it on
12:55
do you know the um i was reading about
12:57
the dimples inside the golf balls that
12:59
doesn't really have a proper science to
13:00
it does it
13:01
it's just it what do you mean by that
13:03
what do you mean it works outside the
13:05
laws of physics no
13:06
i i guess i guess you would look at any
13:09
sort of sporting equipment and you would
13:10
assume
13:11
that uh the design and the shape was for
13:14
a
13:14
specific purpose and tests and it sounds
13:16
like original golf balls didn't have any
13:18
of these dimples but golf players prefer
13:20
to play with ones that had little
13:21
indentations on them
13:23
right as far as i know but you might
13:24
know better there's no exact
13:26
reason why it's that many dimples no i
13:28
don't know why it is
13:29
it's easier to pick up a golf ball with
13:31
dimples than it is to pick up a golf
13:32
ball without dimples yeah they're like
13:34
finger holes
13:35
if you're a lilliputian
13:38
but then ping pong balls are easy to
13:40
pick up yeah i think i don't find that
13:41
actually
13:42
ping pong is almost impossible
13:44
[Laughter]
13:45
you should play with sticky gloves
13:47
that's a good idea
13:49
but then you'd never let it go for the
13:51
serve which would be a problem what i do
13:53
is i put the ball on a bit of string
13:55
to solve the problem
14:00
i think you would get more grip on the
14:01
ball to get spin on it yeah
14:03
and there might be a thing about
14:04
vortices but i just
14:06
you know i don't know what that is but
14:08
okay james here's a question
14:10
have you found that golf has been
14:11
getting harder because you've been
14:12
playing for some years
14:13
um how many years would you say you've
14:15
been playing uh
14:16
30. wow okay so supposedly development
14:20
you've been playing since you were 32.
14:23
it's just a joke about you being old
14:25
sorry
14:26
yeah i actually got the hurtful comments
14:33
so supposedly developers have been
14:34
building longer and harder courses
14:36
because um professionals were getting
14:38
really good in the 90s and 2000s and i
14:40
think there was a conflation between
14:41
pros playing on courses and amateurs the
14:44
equipment's a lot better though
14:45
right and it used to be do they but yeah
14:47
so apparently there are a load of quite
14:48
hard courses now these days and people
14:50
who might not
14:50
want a very hard game of gold for saying
14:52
i can't be bothered with that is that
14:54
right i don't know but there's a theory
14:55
it's hard for me to remember back so
14:57
long
15:00
when i started playing it was just
15:02
sticks of wood
15:04
and golf ball stuffed with duck feathers
15:08
and i remember on the first round i said
15:09
to mary queen of scots
15:12
we should put dimples into these balls
15:16
do you guys know about the most
15:17
southerly golf club in the world no of
15:19
course uh so this is called scott based
15:21
country club and it's 13 degrees above
15:23
the south pole
15:24
and if so there are a lot of skewer
15:26
birds around
15:27
so if you have your ball stolen by a
15:29
skewer you get a one shot penalty
15:31
which seems harsh because they're always
15:32
stealing the balls it does seem harsh
15:35
yeah
15:35
but if you hit one it counts as a birdie
15:37
so i it's the one instance where if you
15:39
hit a bird
15:40
you get a birdie i think that sounds
15:42
cruel though isn't it
15:44
do you mean hit it while it's trying to
15:45
steal your ball or you hit it as part of
15:47
a hit
15:48
and it's in the sky no it's part of a
15:49
hit in the sky i don't think you see it
15:50
trying to steal your ball when you
15:51
attack it with your golfers what happens
15:53
when you do that because you don't want
15:54
the penalty
15:55
you get arrested i don't know ah okay
15:57
this is a confusing game
15:59
i mean you could just try and hit the
16:01
skewer bird into the golf ball hole
16:03
but it's probably too big we really
16:06
don't know the
16:12
it's good to be the expert for once
16:15
i heard tell james of a thing about golf
16:17
i read that until january this year
16:20
you were allowed to ring up a tournament
16:22
if you were watching at home and report
16:23
a rule violation
16:24
yeah uh i know that that has happened
16:26
that happened last year yeah and they've
16:28
they've just brought it to an end have
16:29
they yeah oh i didn't know that lots of
16:31
the tours have come together and said
16:32
guys
16:33
stop phoning in we'll just have some
16:34
officials watching who know all the
16:35
rules but this used to be a major thing
16:36
and
16:37
and also if you committed a mistake and
16:39
someone phoned it in
16:40
um and you didn't know you would then at
16:43
the end of the
16:44
day or the end of the round you fill in
16:45
a scorecard don't you and there's a
16:46
penalty for filling in a scorecard
16:47
incorrectly yeah
16:48
so you get the penalty for making the
16:50
mistake which you didn't know you made
16:52
yeah and then you get a double penalty
16:53
for filling in your scorecard
16:55
exactly there's so much disqualified
16:57
from tournaments i think lexi thompson
16:59
had that done to her yes yeah it was
17:01
unfair as the skewer bird thing
17:03
yeah can you imagine if someone rang in
17:06
and goes
17:06
i'm pretty sure he hit that skewer bird
17:11
do you james as a former accountant do
17:13
you prefer golf for the admin side of
17:14
things
17:15
or for the sport itself or does it
17:17
combine the two loves it's my two loves
17:19
yeah spartan admin
17:20
wow filling in that form yeah what's
17:23
crunching numbers a lot of the time
17:25
well it's mostly just adding one every
17:27
time you hit a ball
17:28
apparently apparently a lot of high-end
17:30
professionals can't even manage to do
17:32
that
17:33
yeah um almanac
17:36
this place just one or two tiny little
17:39
facts about this very very small place
17:41
um they have notable people with for
17:44
such a tiny little town
17:46
you would think that wouldn't be the
17:47
case but miss greenland was
17:49
from uh from that place
17:52
she's married to an actor uh called
17:55
nicola costa waldo
17:57
who you know better as jamie lannister
18:00
from the game of thrones yeah
18:01
uh tv show so yeah jamie lannister's
18:04
wife
18:05
is from this very tiny town where ice
18:06
golf has played yeah
18:09
that's my fact that's a good fact yeah
18:12
well you know it's very tiny tiny places
18:14
lots of ice in game of thrones
18:15
lots of ice yes yeah winter is always
18:18
there
18:19
not much golf no well we haven't seen
18:22
the last series yet
18:23
very true they're gonna have to put in a
18:25
lot of golf to make up for the deficit
18:26
the last few years
18:28
wouldn't it be great if the last series
18:29
is just golfed by all the characters it
18:31
would be amazing
18:32
i might start watching and then whoever
18:34
wins the golf tournament gets the throne
18:37
yeah brilliant perfect uh my money's on
18:40
brienne of tough oh goodness
18:42
but then cersei lannister gets penalized
18:45
because she
18:46
illegally uh moved the ball when no one
18:48
was looking
18:50
a skewer bird dies that's the grand
18:54
finale
18:55
[Applause]
18:57
[Music]
19:00
okay it's time for fact number three and
19:02
that is james okay my fact this week is
19:04
that in the 14th century
19:06
you could be executed in france for
19:08
whirring stripes
19:10
because they were the clothing of the
19:12
devil oh
19:13
really there was a cobbler in the town
19:15
of rouen
19:16
and he was also part of the local clergy
19:19
and apparently he got caught in stripe
19:21
clothes
19:21
and he got condemned to death it's such
19:24
an easy
19:25
condemn to death to avoid isn't it i'd
19:27
have to really
19:28
really like stripes you are wearing
19:30
stripes today that's true
19:32
but that's only because i'm not in 14th
19:34
century france yeah
19:36
i just wear something plain so i read
19:38
this in a review in the new york times
19:40
of a book called the devil's cloth a
19:41
history of stripes and striped fabric by
19:44
michelle pastero and it looks like an
19:47
amazing book from the review
19:48
i gotta say and they think that maybe it
19:51
was from the bible
19:52
in the bible it says you will not wear
19:54
upon yourself a garment that is made
19:56
from two
19:57
and maybe in medieval france they
19:58
thought that that meant you can't wear
20:00
stripes and so they would send you to
20:01
death if you did
20:03
wow yeah just it's such a it's such an
20:05
extreme reaction against something
20:06
relatively
20:08
that we think is innocuous supposedly
20:10
the even zebras
20:11
i also read the the same review the
20:13
zebras were included in satan's bestiary
20:15
yeah they were thought to be a satanic
20:17
animal so was all zebras were put to
20:19
death
20:20
that's right were they really that's why
20:21
we don't have any zebras anymore that's
20:22
correct they used to be
20:24
huge in france no they would um they
20:27
would make bestiaries wouldn't they and
20:28
they put the animals in different
20:30
places in the books and the zebras would
20:33
be in the evil part
20:35
it's such a it's so mean to animals to
20:37
just call them evil for no reason i
20:39
guess we still do it a bit but it seems
20:41
like 14th century france was just
20:42
you would be executed for a lot of
20:45
things that would seem ridiculous like
20:46
you would be executed if you were
20:48
a naughty pig for example like pigs were
20:50
taken to court
20:51
actual animal pigs yeah and tried in
20:54
court although they were sentenced to
20:55
death
20:56
we do execute pigs now yeah even the
20:58
even the nice ones
21:00
we don't take them to court no to charge
21:02
yeah we don't have
21:03
lawyers they deserve a trial
21:06
you're right actually we've gotten worse
21:08
that's true baker's going to get a lot
21:10
rarer if every pick has to go through a
21:12
full judicial process
21:13
the appeals process imagine that
21:17
it's weird that stripes have often been
21:19
had negative associations though because
21:21
stripes obviously were the
21:22
attire of prisoners for since the
21:25
19th century and so that was seen as a
21:27
badge of shame and in fact it was so
21:29
much so that
21:30
by the mid 20th century prisoners had
21:32
stopped wearing stripes and that's where
21:33
the jumpsuit came on
21:34
that all one color jumpsuit because it
21:37
was kind of unfair because it was so
21:38
associated with this shameful thing
21:40
right and weirdly um they are coming
21:43
back in
21:44
i think maybe it's a sign of the
21:45
direction that america is going in but
21:46
because it shows you're tough on crime
21:48
if you introduce stripes because it's a
21:49
proper badge of i'm a prisoner
21:51
and um so it's like stripes of the new
21:53
orange which it
21:54
is the new black distracted the orange
21:56
absolutely right supposedly the the
21:58
stripes in prisons thing is not
21:59
connected to this 14th century france
22:01
thing as in um
22:02
the author of this book uh mr pastor
22:04
just hasn't has found no direct link so
22:06
there's no guarantee
22:07
but um prostitutes used to wear stripes
22:10
yep
22:10
and um jugglers jugglers prostitutes and
22:13
jugglers
22:15
two most dangerous groups in society
22:17
clowns hang men
22:19
lepers it's like it's a mixed feast
22:21
isn't it hangmen and clowns
22:23
is this britain or is this france um
22:25
this is going to be europe
22:27
so you've got prostitutes jugglers
22:29
clowns hang men lepers cripples
22:31
heretics jews africans bastards and the
22:34
condemned
22:35
wow did you book the clown for uh for
22:37
our daughter's party
22:38
no but i got a condemned man a leper
22:42
bit of a bastard
22:43
[Laughter]
22:46
yeah it's all people who are outside
22:47
society wasn't it that was kind of
22:49
jugglers come on juggling is not a
22:53
normal social profession
22:56
i tell you what if you got condemned to
22:58
death for juggling
22:59
then that's an easier thing not to do
23:01
than wearing stripes
23:02
it's very easy not to do oh
23:05
my god although if you accidentally
23:07
dropped something
23:09
yeah and then you caught it just as it
23:11
was falling
23:11
[Laughter]
23:16
i like um that in france in the 14th
23:18
century they tried to band
23:19
those long-toed shoes that you see
23:23
almost as parodies this is my favorite
23:25
facts ever
23:26
really because they banned um
23:29
specifically banned shoes shaped like
23:30
penises
23:31
yes that's right yeah yeah because they
23:35
got bigger and bigger and bigger
23:36
and more pointy and pointy and pointy
23:39
and then someone thought
23:40
i'm gonna make mine look like a penis
23:44
and then they're like we're gonna have
23:45
to put a stop to this
23:47
that's so good you don't get shoes
23:49
shaped like penises now do you
23:50
no so they got they did it worked
23:52
[Laughter]
23:54
so the long pointy shoe thing uh they
23:57
tried to ban that in france
23:58
and in england uh you could get them in
24:01
the 14th century sort of as long as two
24:02
feet
24:03
uh in length that that sort of long
24:06
point
24:06
and they were very fashionable and cool
24:08
but they were never practical if you had
24:10
to
24:10
suddenly make a a dash you know if
24:14
someone was chasing you
24:15
or whatever so what they used to do is
24:17
if they knew that they were in trouble
24:18
they would cut off the fronts of them
24:20
and then that would they would dash off
24:22
nice like a lizard yeah exactly
24:24
so cool yeah that's amazing you couldn't
24:27
have a mullet either
24:29
uh in the 13th century you couldn't have
24:31
an irish hairstyle which it turns out
24:32
irish hairstyles were having the top of
24:34
your head shaved and then long hair down
24:35
at the bottom
24:36
wow like a mullet like a bullet like a
24:39
bullet
24:39
a bold mullet like a bold mullet oh yeah
24:42
i thought that
24:43
a mullet that was a name for the bald
24:45
head is it no a mullet was more like
24:47
short on top and longer
24:49
back whereas completely bald on top like
24:52
like the bill bailey style yeah why
24:55
weren't you allowed an irish style
24:56
it was a classic kind of racism you know
24:59
they thought the irish were a bit
25:00
barbaric and then they had this weird
25:01
hairstyle so don't do the hairstyle
25:03
otherwise you're a barbarian
25:04
they had something this week where
25:06
there's a school that's banned them meet
25:07
me at mcdonald's haircut
25:09
which is the opposite of that a mullet
25:12
which
25:12
is like kind of curly and long on top
25:14
and then shaved on the sides
25:16
oh that all the kids have why is it
25:18
called meet me at mcdonald's i don't
25:19
think anyone knows
25:20
i think actually yeah people under the
25:22
age of 20 know and then people of our
25:24
age
25:24
are just like why did they call it that
25:26
and they're refusing to tell us
25:28
in the elizabethan era only royalty
25:30
could wear leopard
25:31
leopard skin completely limited to
25:33
royalty yeah i mean there weren't many
25:35
there were thousands of leopards around
25:36
which
25:36
you know depends on the availability
25:38
really good yeah and uh
25:40
yeoman's wives were there was there were
25:42
due to these sanctuary laws yeoman's
25:44
wives were only allowed to wear
25:46
lamb rabbit fox or cat fur
25:49
nothing else leopard is a type of cat
25:52
oh yeah i'm just saying if i was a
25:54
yeoman and my wife wanted to wear
25:56
leopard
25:57
i'd let her wear her leopard and then
25:59
just argue well she'd be
26:00
she'd be arrested and put in prison then
26:02
she'd blame you because she said are you
26:04
sure i'm okay to wear this outside and
26:05
you said yeah it's officially a cat
26:07
they'll find that out in 500 years
26:13
i'm a terrible husband
26:24
okay it is time for our final fact of
26:25
the show and that is andy
26:27
my fact is that victorian britain had
26:29
such a fern mania for so many years that
26:32
some species were almost completely
26:33
wiped out
26:35
yeah there was this massive fern craze
26:38
and it lasted 50 years victoria and
26:41
britain
26:41
they all the other stuff they did they
26:43
were basically just killing time in
26:44
between collecting more phones
26:46
so people would go on these huge
26:47
collecting parties into the countryside
26:49
and they'd collect phones for their
26:50
homes and there were so many
26:52
collectors going out that there's one
26:54
species called the kilani fern
26:56
which was almost uh wiped out in the uk
26:58
and it's
26:59
it barely clung on to survival so it's
27:02
huge
27:02
it was a huge problem well it was a
27:04
problem but on the other hand they were
27:05
doing lots of um
27:07
cross breeding so they invented a whole
27:08
load of new species so actually by the
27:10
the end there were more species than
27:12
where you started that's cool
27:14
yeah um so for example
27:17
um custard creams the biscuits yeah they
27:20
have ferns on them
27:21
you know that curly design on a custard
27:22
cream yeah that's a fern
27:24
yeah it's probably from phone maniacs
27:27
yeah
27:28
is that this isn't actually that useful
27:29
for a podcast but i think we've got a
27:31
fern in this
27:32
very room haven't we is that a fern is
27:33
that a fern i don't think it is
27:35
i don't think it is but it's not a food
27:36
it looks like just a pot plant for me
27:38
because ferns have got these kind of um
27:41
fractal
27:42
yeah bits coming off i'm a little bit
27:43
more intricate aren't they sorry andy's
27:45
giving me a look like literally i just
27:46
saw a dog and said look at that lovely
27:48
horse
27:48
[Laughter]
27:51
coming from a guy who doesn't know how
27:52
polly's work it's literally named after
27:55
the thing you do you just pull it
27:57
and he turns up with the pulley and just
27:59
pushing what's going on
28:02
and with fern mania they marketed it as
28:05
something that only appealed to
28:06
intelligent people
28:09
that's really good bit of marketing yeah
28:10
isn't it it's so clever oh
28:12
yeah and the the other nice thing about
28:14
it was um
28:16
railways were spreading across the
28:17
country so you could go on more
28:19
expeditions than you could before
28:20
literally travel was easier and you got
28:22
to maybe talk to the opposite sex
28:23
without a chaperone
28:24
so that was a big draw well that seemed
28:26
to be the big thing from the bits of
28:28
reading that i did about it
28:29
the big thing was ferns no no ferns was
28:33
ferns was tinder ferns allowed you as
28:35
andy says to talk to the opposite of sex
28:37
and go on adventures right you always
28:39
say this
28:41
opposite sex yes
28:45
the opposite of sex is marriage yes
28:51
um just on the flirting thing yeah i
28:53
think it was also kind of liberating for
28:54
women
28:55
so it was quite an important phenomenon
28:58
for women's liberation because it was
28:59
something that was deemed acceptable for
29:00
them to do on their own
29:02
so it wasn't really acceptable for women
29:03
to go out without a chaperone for many
29:05
reasons
29:05
at all but fern mania was particularly
29:08
attractive to the ladies because
29:09
whatever they like collecting plants
29:11
and so they could all go out on on their
29:12
own and collect them so it gave them all
29:14
this independence and this adventure and
29:16
really
29:16
caused suffrage wow
29:19
i've made a big leap you're going to
29:21
stick to it
29:24
yeah it sounds like um it sort of just
29:26
took over well let's say
29:28
london even just every theater suddenly
29:31
became
29:31
packed with the orchestra pits um they
29:33
just used to just turn it into basically
29:35
a botanical garden
29:36
it was just the orchestra were just
29:39
covered in ferns as they were playing
29:41
but people loved it because they were
29:42
there for the ferns more than the music
29:44
even
29:44
yeah i think that that was the prince of
29:45
wales theater was that's where they did
29:47
that turned into a fernery
29:48
and it was we should say it was all
29:50
because of this thing called the wardian
29:52
case
29:53
which is which andy looks really excited
29:55
about already but this was invented in
29:57
1829 by dr nathaniel bagshaw
30:00
ward and it was basically he
30:02
accidentally discovered that in a glass
30:04
airtight jar ferns could survive and it
30:07
meant that ferns which wouldn't have
30:08
been able to cope with the british
30:09
climate until then
30:10
when they've been imported from sort of
30:12
china or australia or whatever could
30:13
suddenly survive in these jars
30:15
and these wardian cases became really
30:17
fashionable so
30:18
if you were anyone in high society you
30:20
had to have this big beautiful
30:22
wardian case full of fun sitting on your
30:24
dining room table can you still get them
30:26
do you think
30:26
oh maybe antique ones i don't know if
30:28
you can buy new ones
30:30
or maybe you can because i'm looking at
30:31
kind of decorating my spare room
30:34
with curiosities and stuff so i thought
30:36
like a wardian case would be really good
30:38
fill it with ferns yeah
30:40
they're really lovely looking i think
30:41
that's a great idea they do look
30:43
gorgeous
30:44
i think nathaniel bagshaw ward might be
30:47
the man who won the second world war oh
30:49
god
30:51
so fern's got us suffrage and winning
30:53
the second world war
30:54
pretty much okay so basically did he
30:57
also invent facebook
30:58
yes he did um so
31:02
his whole innovation he discovered it
31:03
kind of a little bit by mistake
31:05
but when he realized that these
31:07
hermetically sealed things uh you could
31:08
keep a firm fern alive in them
31:10
he built two custom-made cases hired a
31:13
carpenter and he sent them to sydney
31:14
full of ferns okay so they were on the
31:16
boat for six months they got there
31:18
they were alive they're all fine so that
31:19
was incredible so then he filled his
31:21
case up with australian ferns
31:23
which previously they'd never been able
31:24
to get to the uk and they returned so
31:27
they arrived about 18 months later
31:29
a very very long journey and it
31:31
completely changed the entire
31:33
um world history of botany basically so
31:36
it meant that tea plants could be
31:38
transplanted to india
31:40
from china so that created the british
31:42
empire in a
31:43
no small way wow it very it contributed
31:46
to the british empire's rise
31:47
smashed the chinese tea monopoly and it
31:50
meant that rubber trees could be brought
31:52
from brazil to kew gardens in the uk and
31:54
then
31:54
to malaya and sri lanka and that created
31:57
the british colonial rubber industry
31:58
which was very significant in the second
32:00
world war but then i think it also
32:02
sounds like you're saying he invented
32:04
colonialism
32:05
it massively changed the imperial
32:07
project
32:08
that's true that's the diplomats
32:12
response
32:14
well it's just like huge unintended
32:16
consequences i guess
32:18
of this of this hermetically sealed case
32:20
which just meant that suddenly you could
32:21
move plants around the world like ever
32:22
before
32:22
also russia and america played a big
32:24
part in winning the second world war i
32:25
should make that clear it was
32:26
just it wasn't just this one guy no but
32:29
you know yeah that's pretty no that's
32:31
pretty cool it's often
32:33
very uh amazing and mind-blowing to hear
32:35
how a tiny
32:36
invention somehow impacts the world in a
32:38
way that
32:40
you previously thought it was just
32:41
flirting
32:43
i thought okay that's all it was all of
32:45
your notes on tinder dan
32:47
it's amazing that tinder helped us win
32:49
world war iii
32:52
do you know how fans have sex so they're
32:55
really spores
32:56
which is known but then they sprout into
32:58
a specific sexual
33:00
generation which looks nothing like a
33:01
fern so it's a specific organism called
33:04
a prothalis
33:05
and that grows independently for several
33:07
weeks and then that grows its own sex
33:09
organs
33:10
and they produce the eggs and the sperm
33:11
and then that sporo fight
33:14
it produces grows into a new fern yeah
33:16
but it's like if we had sex and then
33:18
we gave birth to something that wasn't a
33:20
person yeah and then that person then
33:22
produced a person
33:23
yeah it is weird the double stage you
33:26
don't want to be i don't think
33:27
in the crap generation that's only got
33:29
half the right number of chromosomes
33:31
and that just its job is to make the
33:33
sperm in the egg which then create the
33:35
real one
33:36
it's like if we if we give birth to
33:38
penises
33:39
no it's like if we gave birth to testes
33:42
and
33:42
ovaries yes it is yeah and then the
33:46
human grows
33:47
off of it well then the testes and the
33:48
ovaries would hang out together
33:50
and then they'd bump into some more
33:51
testes and ovaries and then they'd
33:53
create
33:53
humans again wow that is weird every
33:55
analogy breaks down eventually
33:57
that one was pre-broken down i think
34:01
that helped me understand that more but
34:02
what i find amazing is in this
34:05
the crappy stage where they're the thing
34:06
that creates a sperm in the egg the
34:08
sperm
34:08
swim so this is why ferns only survive
34:11
in damp environments because they need
34:12
to swim through water to find themselves
34:14
an egg
34:15
so you've got little fern sperm swimming
34:18
around everywhere looking for eggs
34:20
that's very cool that's weird but they
34:21
didn't know how it worked for ages did
34:23
they
34:23
and they thought it must be seeds um but
34:25
they couldn't find these seeds so they
34:27
thought the seeds were invisible
34:29
and what they thought was if you could
34:31
find a fern seed
34:33
and carry it on you it would make you
34:34
invisible
34:36
because they thought weird in the
34:37
old days didn't they but that was it was
34:39
the idea that if you you know if you eat
34:41
a walnut because it looks like a brain
34:43
then it will help your brain and in the
34:45
same way if you managed to find an
34:46
invisible fern seed it would make you
34:47
invisible
34:49
so how do you find an invisible well
34:51
they don't exist
34:52
no i know but like if you were peddling
34:54
that as an idea do you think people ever
34:56
thought they'd found one
34:57
that's what i mean would you say would
34:59
there be a guy in the you know the
35:00
alleys going i've got
35:02
yeah some seeds like magic beans isn't
35:04
it yeah exactly just a bag of
35:05
invisible fern seeds and then i think it
35:07
would be really fun if it
35:09
in like a medieval truman show way to
35:11
have an entire village
35:13
persuade someone that they were
35:14
invisible
35:16
so if you let someone sink you've got
35:18
some fern seeds and then he buys them
35:19
and then everyone just pretends they
35:20
can't see him for the rest of his life
35:22
yeah in 2015 there was a fern found in
35:24
the french mountains
35:25
which was the offspring of two groups of
35:27
ferns which haven't interbred in
35:29
60 million years they split into
35:32
separate lines of descent that long ago
35:34
and one of the authors of the paper on
35:35
this is called kathleen pryor she said
35:37
reproducing after such long evolutionary
35:39
breakup is akin to an elephant
35:41
hybridizing with a manatee or a human
35:43
with a lemur
35:45
but she did she did also say although to
35:47
most people they just look like two
35:49
ferns
35:50
um that is incredible and it also
35:52
implies that are we all gonna start
35:54
interbreeding with other species until
35:56
we go back to being a single-celled
35:57
organism oh wow
35:59
yeah wow that's an interesting idea
36:02
isn't it
36:03
certainly feels like that's the obvious
36:04
conclusion isn't the problem that a lot
36:06
of the people who we'd have to
36:08
interbreed with have died out so really
36:10
we'd have to breed with some
36:12
neanderthals first
36:13
yeah and then the homo erectus and then
36:15
the monkeys and then the lemurs
36:17
and then and then some like old fish
36:19
eventually yeah but some of them aren't
36:20
there anymore
36:22
the the theory's falling does this
36:24
work it's such a cool theory it's like
36:26
the uh big crunch
36:27
comparison to the big bang yeah it's
36:29
imagine that's how it all goes back what
36:31
sorry what's the benefit
36:33
there's no benefit it's just benefit and
36:35
just life
36:36
it's just the way or you just think this
36:38
is this is how evolution's gonna be
36:40
that's just a great sci-fi idea it's
36:41
just inevitable
36:42
it started with the ferns and it ends
36:45
with you having sex with the sealer camp
36:47
i'm not sure they'll be saying as we
36:49
de-evolve i can't believe they didn't
36:51
spot this with those
36:53
the clues were there they should have
36:54
known
36:57
um fern mania there was also tulip mania
37:00
wasn't there
37:00
i didn't know there was also rosemania
37:02
hyacinth mania
37:04
dahlia mania and cactus mania really
37:06
yeah incarnation mania
37:09
when were were these around the same
37:10
time no cactus mania
37:12
in the usa in the 1830s uh rosemania in
37:15
ancient rome highest
37:16
mania in holland in the 1730s dalia
37:19
mania in
37:20
england in the 1820s just seemed to be a
37:23
thing where
37:24
every now and then everyone would just
37:25
love a plant and just go crazy for that
37:26
plant
37:27
and then stop and we haven't had a mania
37:29
for ages for plants
37:31
well no but we have manias don't we i
37:32
think maybe they just had less stuff
37:34
back then
37:34
they didn't have bitcoin did they
37:36
exactly they didn't have tamagotchis
37:37
they didn't have pokemon go
37:38
but they did have an abundance of rare
37:41
plants
37:42
have you heard of orchid delirium yeah
37:44
so that still exists
37:46
does it well as in everyone's still into
37:47
orchids i would say that's the longest
37:48
lasting mania
37:49
you could still if you find a rare
37:51
orchid the police will look after it to
37:53
make sure no one steals it and stuff
37:55
really yeah wow that happened on the
37:57
golf course that i used to play on
37:58
yeah as in the orchid was found in
38:01
nature in the golf course
38:02
yeah right the orchid was just by the
38:04
side of the
38:05
of the golf course yeah and then they
38:07
had a policeman there kind of looking
38:08
after it wow
38:10
that's so weird why
38:13
because you otherwise if you damage it
38:15
then you've destroyed an entire species
38:17
because it was like
38:18
extremely rare oh but couldn't you can
38:20
dig it up and just cultivate it
38:21
somewhere else
38:22
well they're quite difficult too right
38:23
yeah exactly that they die basically if
38:25
you try and do anything with an orchid
38:26
it just
38:27
it does not matter okay just gonna die
38:29
it's almost drawing attention to it to
38:30
have a policeman standing next yeah
38:32
you know what i did play golf a lot on
38:33
that golf course i was a member and i
38:35
never saw the policeman
38:36
oh he was very good he had some of those
38:39
fern seeds
38:42
on um really rare plants and how mad we
38:44
go over them yeah uh
38:46
in 20 in 2010 uh a group of botanists
38:49
were doing this routine plant survey
38:51
on ascension island you know it's the
38:52
tiny island in the south atlantic
38:54
um and they saw what looked like a tiny
38:58
mini parsley sprig on a sheer cliff face
39:01
like sticking out of a rock
39:03
and apparently they both of them two of
39:05
them saw it they
39:06
instantly recognized it as a fern that
39:08
had been described first in 1876
39:11
only seen two more times in history the
39:13
last time in 1958.
39:15
so instantly both of them were like oh
39:16
my god wow
39:18
check that out um so it'd been declared
39:20
extinct in 2003 so obviously they
39:23
abseiled down to it to check it out and
39:24
then they thought we've got to preserve
39:26
um this fern this is really precious so
39:28
they abseiled down every day or a couple
39:30
of times a week to water it and to weed
39:32
it and to care for it
39:33
until it produced spores because it was
39:35
so valuable
39:39
and then when it finally produced spores
39:41
that was obviously an incredibly
39:42
exciting day because they could collect
39:43
them
39:44
so two of them went down and they have
39:45
only 24 hours before the spores won't be
39:47
useful anymore yeah
39:48
and they had 24 hours to get them to cue
39:52
gardens and so from ascension island
40:00
well they had some extra help put on so
40:03
they rushed them to this airfield where
40:05
they were flown immediately to raf bryce
40:07
norton in oxfordshire
40:08
and a car was specifically waiting for
40:10
them there to drive them straight to the
40:12
gardens and then they got on the
40:14
district line and
40:16
sat at else caught for four hours wow
40:19
and they sit there now
40:20
still there and it's produced a few
40:22
offspring and yeah hanging out
40:24
it's so cool that's the cheapest i've
40:25
been i've seen films in the last week
40:27
that were not as good as that
40:29
[Music]

oh
00:18
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:21
no such thing as a fish
00:23
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:25
from the brighton
00:32
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
00:35
here with anna chazinski
00:36
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:38
and once again we have gathered around
00:40
the microphones with our four
00:41
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:43
and in no particular order
00:44
here we go starting with you jacinsky
00:48
my fact this week is that until the 17th
00:50
century
00:51
mothers hung their babies up on hooks
00:53
while they worked
00:57
that's amazing you just hung them up
00:58
like a coat
01:00
were they is it yeah is it like everyone
01:03
who works at the same place has a number
01:04
above their book
01:07
yeah yeah like if you go to the
01:08
restaurant do you just leave your baby
01:09
in the cloak room yeah and if you lose
01:11
your ticket you're absolutely buggered
01:14
can you describe it well it is small
01:16
it's not got much hair and it looks like
01:17
winston churchill
01:20
um this but this is genuinely true so
01:22
this babies used to be swaddled for long
01:24
periods of history it was thought that
01:25
it was good for them to be very tightly
01:27
swaddled you know like
01:28
wrapped up in material so their limbs
01:30
could grow straight
01:31
that was the belief and once they were
01:33
swaddled then they would just be
01:35
latched onto a hook that was maybe in
01:37
your house if you're doing the housework
01:38
or sometimes mothers would be working
01:40
out in the fields doing agricultural
01:42
work and you could hook them onto a tree
01:44
uh like a bit of twig and
01:47
that was how they did it wow and this is
01:50
is that where um
01:51
like the rocker by baby kind of thing
01:53
comes from
01:54
you're not rocking them really you're
01:56
swinging them if you're doing anything
01:57
because he's on a tree top
01:58
right it is he's in a he's definitely in
02:00
a vessel
02:02
lying down comfortably no just a small
02:04
baby from the tree side yeah
02:08
keep hold of your ticket or baby will uh
02:11
disappear
02:12
[Laughter]
02:15
um so this used to happen all over the
02:17
place the um
02:18
in sweden women would carry their
02:20
children in what was called a bog
02:22
just put your baby in the bog baby bug
02:25
what was that what was it it was a bag
02:28
sounds like a typo
02:32
yeah it's where we get the word bag from
02:34
but it was it was a leather container
02:35
shaped into a bag
02:36
oh really yeah same principle there's
02:39
there's actually still a thing today
02:40
in amongst indigenous north americans
02:42
where there's a thing called cradle
02:44
boards and these have been a thing for
02:45
hundreds of years
02:46
and they're sort of flat boards that you
02:48
strap a baby to
02:49
and in a very similar way you can then
02:51
hang them on a tree or lean them against
02:53
a tree
02:54
and they were very commonly used and
02:55
there are a few tribes like the shu or
02:58
the iroquois or the cherokee who are all
03:00
kind of
03:00
bringing them back in a sort of artisan
03:02
way they're really beautiful
03:03
if you look them up um and they're
03:05
hanging babies up and actually they
03:06
think that carrying babies or having
03:09
like
03:09
bugs or bags or whatever to put babies
03:11
in is probably one of the biggest
03:13
inventions in the history of mankind
03:15
wow it's up there with like you know
03:17
writing and the wheel and fire and all
03:19
that kind of stuff
03:20
is it apparently well it meant that
03:23
mothers could carry food
03:24
as well as carrying a child so once you
03:26
had a child if you just had to hold it
03:28
the whole time
03:29
basically you weren't able to do
03:30
anything else but this meant that they
03:32
could carry food they can go
03:33
hunter-gathering as well
03:35
wow uh so prams used to
03:38
not really be a thing and uh if you did
03:41
have a premium that's actually true of
03:42
everything that was invented
03:46
iphones didn't used to be a thing really
03:49
yeah that's fair and that's it
03:52
[Laughter]
03:56
but basically in germany when it was
03:58
invented
03:59
and particularly mothers used to pull
04:00
along prams and obviously you can't see
04:02
if the baby's fallen out so
04:04
the push pram was it was a genuine
04:06
innovation but in germany until 1888 you
04:09
had to have a license to take a child
04:10
out in a pram
04:12
and this was so the police knew you had
04:14
to permission to be out with a basically
04:16
a small vehicle
04:17
and you had to name the baby you had to
04:19
say
04:20
i'm going to be taking jeff out in the
04:22
pram
04:23
wait so if you're taking a different
04:24
baby out in the pram then you lose your
04:26
license or whatever you're six months
04:28
six months prison prison no i don't know
04:32
and the other thing is around the same
04:33
time in britain uh
04:35
any vehicle with four wheels was counted
04:37
as a road vehicle
04:39
okay so they got the new prams which had
04:42
like a bassinet and they had four wheels
04:44
the previous ones only had three
04:45
and those four wheelers you could get
04:47
arrested
04:48
for walking down the street with one of
04:50
those and people did people got
04:51
prosecuted
04:52
if you walked on the pavement with them
04:53
instead of the road so responsible
04:55
advice push your baby along
04:57
in the middle of the road wow another
05:00
pregnancy thing actually giving birth
05:02
thing
05:03
there is a medical text from the 12th
05:04
century called the trotula
05:07
and one of the instructions in there is
05:08
if you're giving birth you should
05:10
induce sneezing to the woman because
05:13
apparently when you sneeze
05:15
it helps to contract your womb and push
05:17
the child out
05:18
and they genuinely did this wow that
05:20
would be i mean it's an unpleasant
05:22
process anyway i've heard but having
05:23
someone pour pepper into your nostrils
05:25
sounds like it would
05:26
make the whole thing even worse well
05:27
they also said that the womb reacted
05:29
differently to different kinds of smells
05:31
so the womb would push towards sweet
05:33
smells and away from unpleasant smells
05:35
what so if you're giving birth near a
05:37
baklava stand you'll just be drawn
05:39
magnetically over to it
05:43
and i don't know why baklava stand was
05:45
the first thing i thought
05:49
what's the goodness only isn't it
05:50
metropolis
05:52
[Laughter]
05:56
so women didn't used to be allowed to be
05:58
at birth
05:59
so there was a long tradition of only
06:01
women being
06:02
except for the woman involved there was
06:06
one woman allowed at every birth
06:08
so for many centuries doctors weren't
06:10
allowed
06:11
at birth because men weren't allowed to
06:13
see a woman giving birth because it was
06:14
thought to be improper
06:15
so actually the only people that you
06:17
would be allowed to have when you were
06:18
giving birth were midwives
06:20
after a while and astrologers because
06:22
some women were astrologers so you
06:23
couldn't have a doctor to tell you it
06:25
was going to be okay you could have an
06:26
astrologer to give you a prediction of
06:27
whether the baby was going to survive
06:29
and then when doctors started taking
06:32
over in the 19th century
06:34
it was decided that actually women
06:36
couldn't handle being in the room
06:37
with other women giving birth even
06:39
though i guess they are the ones that do
06:40
it in the end
06:41
but the lancet medical journal wrote in
06:44
1868
06:45
that women are too delicate to watch
06:47
someone else giving birth and only men
06:49
could brave the revolting scenes of
06:51
childbirth
06:53
wow we just can't hack it because we
06:56
actually never have to see it
06:58
right i think you're just lay there
07:00
going can anyone smell back liver
07:06
that is such a sagittarius thing to say
07:08
this
07:10
um do you know what just i was looking
07:11
at medieval child rearing oh yeah
07:14
so what happened in medieval europe was
07:17
you basically once you got to the age of
07:20
14 you would just be sent away
07:22
on a french exchange forever you
07:25
you'd be sent for to be a servant in
07:27
someone else's house for
07:29
seven to ten years was it always in
07:32
france
07:32
it wasn't always in france actually it
07:33
was always not in france it was never in
07:35
france
07:35
it was
07:38
so you were sent on a french exchange
07:42
trip forever
07:43
which was not in france and only lasted
07:45
seven years yeah
07:47
i can see i'm gonna be accused of sexing
07:49
up this fact i was trying to
07:50
think of an analogy basically you'd do a
07:52
swap every everyone just sent away their
07:54
child to someone else's house and then
07:55
you would get someone else's child being
07:56
a servant in your house yeah and
07:58
everyone did this right up to the
07:59
aristocracy
08:00
because they thought that it was easier
08:02
to bring up someone else's child didn't
08:04
they
08:04
oh wow yeah that's cool um have you guys
08:07
heard so again around the sort of
08:09
medieval period
08:10
of the groaning cheese
08:13
this is really this is really cool it
08:15
was just a tradition that people
08:16
uh would do and the idea was that when
08:18
you got pregnant you knew you were
08:20
pregnant
08:20
you would mature a wheel of cheese for
08:22
the nine month period
08:23
that you were pregnant and then once the
08:25
baby was born
08:27
you would share out the cheese amongst
08:28
family and friends and you would all eat
08:30
the cheese but it would leave
08:32
the outer rind of the of the cheese
08:35
and on christening day they would pass
08:37
the baby through away
08:40
through like and that's where we get the
08:42
tradition of the woman bursting out of
08:44
the cake
08:44
isn't it yes yes no
08:49
but yeah that was the groaning cheese
08:54
how bizarre um did you on uh buggies and
08:57
ways of pushing children around
08:59
did you see the survey that was done by
09:02
skoda
09:02
but it was seeing what fathers thought
09:04
about pushing buggies around
09:06
it's quite recent it was it discovered
09:08
that 33
09:09
of fathers said they were embarrassed by
09:11
their pram or push chair so they felt
09:13
emasculated pushing them around
09:14
76 of dads said they'd be more likely to
09:17
push a pram if they had access to a
09:19
stylish high-spec buggy
09:21
that could go and so there's this one
09:23
guy called colin furs
09:25
who in 2013 yeah colin first has broken
09:28
a load of records
09:29
uh so he likes breaking records and he's
09:32
broken the record for the world's
09:33
fastest pram
09:34
so he found out his wife was pregnant
09:36
and he thought the way to be supportive
09:38
was to attach a motorbike engine to a
09:41
pram
09:44
and create something that can go up to
09:46
80 kilometers an hour
09:48
which it does you can't put a baby in it
09:52
because that would be really dangerous
09:54
but he says he does put dolls in it just
09:57
to freak out onlookers
10:01
wait but hang on is he is he wearing
10:03
roller skates no but
10:04
he has a little skateboard attached to
10:06
the back that he can stand on so it
10:08
pulls him along as well
10:10
it's really cool that's incredible it's
10:12
really cool but his wife is still having
10:14
to push the baby along in a normal pram
10:16
some way behind him okay
10:20
it is time for fact number two and that
10:23
is
10:23
james ah yes my fact this week is that
10:26
there's a man in brazil
10:28
who's been living in a sandcastle for 22
10:30
years
10:33
he has to constantly water his house to
10:35
prevent it from collapsing
10:37
[Laughter]
10:39
it's extraordinary so this is just a guy
10:42
he lives in rio he lives in brazil he's
10:44
he's known as king marcio and he has
10:47
this really awesome looking
10:49
sandcastle it's like just imagine like a
10:51
really ornate sandcastle it's quite
10:53
small on the inside it's only about
10:55
three square meters
10:57
and it's full of books because he has
10:59
two hobbies reading and beach golf
11:02
yeah beach golf yeah it's just one big
11:05
bunker i guess
11:07
um but he lives there and he basically
11:09
if you go to rio and you go to his house
11:11
he has a little scepter
11:12
and he has photos taken with um with
11:14
tourists and stuff like that
11:16
that's very cool it has a roof right
11:18
because none of my sand castles ever had
11:20
roofs
11:20
did they not well no they'd just be
11:22
basically a wall isn't that the standard
11:24
sandcastle
11:25
yes unless you just do the upturned uh
11:27
bucket
11:28
in which case it's all roof
11:31
a lot of sand castles like these really
11:32
ornate ones you see on
11:34
you know they do competitions don't they
11:36
and stuff like that and the way that
11:37
they do that is they
11:38
super compact it so they really really
11:40
really compact the um the sand and this
11:42
is an ancient way of building things
11:44
so actually the great wall of china a
11:46
lot of that is made like this so it's
11:48
basically just one big sand castle
11:50
joking honestly that's amazing except
11:53
they use different materials
11:54
well some of it for some of the great
11:56
world china they just it's just kind of
11:58
mountains and that's just
11:59
literally sand compacted really hard
12:01
what happens when the tide comes in
12:04
it tends not to in the middle of china
12:07
doesn't quite reach that's where all
12:09
kids are going wrong is building them on
12:10
bloody beaches
12:13
but they've also worked out the exactly
12:15
perfect way now to build a sandcastle
12:17
and when i say they i mean physicists
12:19
but it's actually quite surprising so
12:21
this is a couple of years ago
12:23
there was some experimenting there were
12:24
some studies and it was found out that
12:26
the strongest sandcastle will be 99 part
12:30
sand to one part water
12:31
which i think is not very as much water
12:34
as i was probably doing
12:35
and the person who did this study is a
12:37
guy called dr bond who's a physicist and
12:39
he said the best way to do it is to tamp
12:40
wet sand into a mold
12:42
uh but a mold that's like open at the
12:44
top and the bottom so like a bucket
12:45
without a bottom
12:46
and then thump it at least 70 times
12:49
before which no one has the time for on
12:51
a beach
12:52
um do you know actually the best place
12:54
to build um a sandcastle the best sand
12:57
for a sand castle is on titan the
12:59
largest moon of saturn
13:01
whoa really yeah it's the best place in
13:04
some ways to do it
13:05
in other ways i wouldn't recommend it
13:07
you get that i've forgotten the bloody
13:08
bucket
13:09
[Laughter]
13:10
right turn it around well this is
13:14
amazing they have sand dunes on titan
13:16
but their sand has got static
13:18
electricity in it and so it
13:20
self adheres whoa do you know what i
13:22
mean so you kind of put it together
13:24
and it's never going to fall apart
13:25
because that all sticks together with
13:26
static electricity that's amazing that's
13:28
really cool that is cool
13:30
it's worth going for that um
13:33
you can be fined for stealing sand from
13:35
sardinia even if you take a small
13:37
drinks bottle full of sand you can be
13:39
fined a thousand euros
13:42
and this is a big problem because people
13:43
keep on stealing sardinia basically and
13:45
people
13:45
are worried about it in the summer
13:47
months of 2015 they seized five
13:49
tons in smaller and bigger consignments
13:52
but lots of it was just little bottles
13:53
which people take as a souvenir
13:55
wow yeah that's good and that's because
13:57
we're running out of sand right
13:58
yeah which is a weird sentence in its
14:01
own right but
14:02
we are running out of sand on earth have
14:04
you guys heard of the great
14:05
sandcastle dispute of 1900 no no
14:08
um so this was uh the it was like the
14:11
original first world war
14:13
except it happened in real in north
14:15
wales and it was quite a small deal
14:17
but um it was
14:21
basically boveril which was a relatively
14:23
new company at that point sponsored a
14:25
sandcastle building contest
14:26
and it was the idea was that you had to
14:28
build a sandcastle that was extremely
14:30
impressive and you had to have bob
14:31
will's logo somewhere on it
14:33
and so some people picked up on the idea
14:35
and in the same place in north wales
14:38
uh this alcohol merchant copied it
14:40
copied the whole idea
14:41
and had a lot of kids come to the beach
14:43
and compete over who could build the
14:45
best sandcastle
14:46
and include the name of his whiskey on
14:49
the sand castle so he was encouraging
14:50
lots of kids to advertise his whiskey
14:52
basically
14:53
and so then this spiraled out of control
14:55
because temperance movements got really
14:57
upset at the fact that they were using
14:58
kids as a vehicle to advertise extremely
15:00
strong liquor
15:01
and so these temperance movements ran a
15:04
rival contest for who could build a
15:06
sandcastle
15:07
that denounced drink and alcohol in the
15:09
strongest possible terms
15:12
poor kids so torn that's amazing wow
15:16
that's awesome um i found the thing
15:18
which uh really surprised me um this was
15:21
from 1990 it was a
15:22
scientific report that was looking into
15:25
there's always the thing of um
15:26
you know vending machines kill more
15:28
people than sharks do per year
15:30
so does sand castles more than sharks
15:32
per year
15:33
sand castle sand tunnels uh so anything
15:36
where you're trying to construct
15:37
via sand and the collapses is very
15:39
dangerous so in 1990 they found
15:41
16 people died of it as opposed to 12
15:44
which is how many were
15:45
killed by sharks in that year wow yeah
15:48
what a way to go running ashore thinking
15:50
oh finally i've avoided that shark wow
15:55
pretty good day for me thanks sandcastle
15:58
yeah well lifeguards have to
16:03
watch out for people digging two deep
16:05
holes on beaches
16:07
so this is they have fewer complaints
16:09
about going out and having to save
16:10
people from sharks and they do
16:12
about going and having to tell kids or
16:14
adults to stop building such a deep hole
16:16
um i was reading something by a
16:18
lifeguard called annie howe
16:19
uh who was saying she's been like for
16:21
nine years and she often has to warn
16:23
beachgoers that in her words their
16:24
excavations are getting out of control
16:27
and she says that no hole should be more
16:29
than knee-deep for the smallest person
16:31
in the group
16:32
so i think we have all surely
16:34
controversial yeah because that's right
16:36
the fun isn't it trying to dig to
16:37
australia
16:38
exactly is is it sorry it's not so that
16:41
people don't dig to australia
16:44
i presume no it's an anti-immigration
16:47
thing because i think the australians
16:48
will come back
16:50
sorry i should add for what i said
16:52
earlier about sand castles
16:54
and uh tunnels being the fatality thing
16:56
it's actually majority people digging
16:58
holes
16:59
so when people are walking at night on a
17:01
beach not knowing there's a massive hole
17:02
right
17:03
that's how they no way yeah no the main
17:06
danger is sand falling in on you
17:08
it's not a danger people walking at
17:09
night falling into the holes but
17:11
i think the other's right i think it's
17:12
like the holes collapse it's not people
17:14
no no no no no
17:15
it's very it's got the muscle power to
17:17
dig a hole so big that it falls in on
17:19
you
17:20
it's not no it's about the foot i almost
17:21
killed my grandmother that way she
17:25
better love next time i did i didn't
17:27
intend to
17:28
i was i was at her house and i dug a
17:30
hole in the garden and i didn't tell her
17:32
and she went out at night
17:33
and she um she ended up in hospital and
17:35
but she's okay
17:36
but didn't you grow up in australia yeah
17:39
are you trying to dig to the uk
17:43
yeah uh okay it is time for fact number
17:47
three
17:47
and that is my fact uh my fact this week
17:50
oh boy
17:51
um my fact this week is queen
17:55
elizabeth the first was a man
17:59
according to the dracula author bram
18:02
stoker
18:04
yeah isn't that amazing this is the fact
18:06
that the year before
18:08
i mean he was writing fiction quietly
18:10
and he was writing fiction but the year
18:11
before he died
18:12
he wrote a non-fiction book and it was
18:15
called
18:15
famous imposters and the idea was to
18:17
expose con artists and it was to expose
18:20
hoaxes and so on however there's one
18:22
chapter in it
18:23
in which he claims and he did proper
18:25
investigation into it
18:26
that queen elizabeth the first was a man
18:30
and he actually published that and
18:32
obviously it's it's not true but it's so
18:34
crazy
18:34
let's not reject it that's a lot of
18:37
compelling evidence let's hear the
18:39
evidence
18:40
well he said things like for example uh
18:42
she never married
18:43
uh um she used to wear a lot of wigs he
18:48
said
18:48
someone's trying to hide a bald spot she
18:50
used to wear one wig at a time
18:54
but she didn't wear a stack of wigs yeah
18:57
the issue constantly famously according
18:59
to him was wearing wigs
19:01
um the story is that basically when the
19:03
original this is according to
19:05
i need to specify this is not my theory
19:08
this is a very famous author bran stoker
19:10
um he said that when queen elizabeth was
19:12
uh 10 years old she was visiting bisley
19:15
which is in gloucestershire and while
19:16
she was there the plague was very rife
19:18
and she
19:19
got ill and she passed away the
19:22
the place busley thought that they were
19:24
going to suffer the wrath of
19:25
henry and so they quickly had to replace
19:28
her however
19:29
they didn't find a girl who is anyone
19:31
still listening
19:32
[Laughter]
19:35
so they couldn't find a girl that would
19:37
match her complexion
19:39
to fool henry and so they did find this
19:41
one boy and they said you're gonna have
19:42
to now be
19:43
elizabeth and he said okay and
19:47
and then and it worked and he was like
19:49
yeah it worked and we're gonna have to
19:50
stick with this
19:51
and so uh okay it's time for fact number
19:53
four
19:55
this is basically the class hamster has
19:57
died theory
19:58
of english history
20:01
because actually if you because i read
20:03
that book um today
20:04
and he says that because uh the people
20:07
of bisley still believe it
20:09
that it must be true right because he's
20:11
like if it wasn't true there's no way
20:13
they'd still believe that
20:14
yeah and for a long time there used to
20:16
be a thing where they would dress boys
20:18
as queen elizabeth and so the idea was
20:20
that there was a local vicar who
20:22
started this rumor um what's interesting
20:25
is that bram stoker effectively was a
20:26
conspiracy theorist which is
20:28
very bizarre for the time as well and
20:30
and he was no one believed him obviously
20:32
at the time but it is well they did
20:34
because as in it was a theory that had
20:36
existed for
20:37
since queen elizabeth and he popularized
20:39
it so there were people who genuinely
20:41
thought that and there are people who
20:42
put together lots of evidence about it
20:44
like the fact that um her writing style
20:47
changed apparently
20:48
as soon as she left bisley so um when
20:51
she was seven years old
20:52
yeah so everyone's different she started
20:54
writing in cursive
20:55
she must be a man james 10 years old
20:59
oh sorry yeah no it did change and
21:02
yeah that was pretty much it from a
21:05
young girl's diary to just football
21:06
schools
21:07
every week
21:10
can't wait to soup up my pram
21:16
so the times reviewed the book as tommy
21:18
rot
21:19
yep um the original manuscripts is
21:21
signed bs
21:23
but it was by bram stoker
21:27
but that's just as good evidence as the
21:29
stuff you're giving but it's just not
21:30
true right hang on again it's not my
21:32
evidence
21:34
but it is true that bram stoker was a
21:35
conspiracy theorist and that is
21:37
the key thing and i've had a look at the
21:39
book and it's got loads of other hoaxes
21:41
that have happened in history some he's
21:42
just reporting
21:43
so there's one called the cat hoax of
21:44
1815 uh
21:46
which is where napoleon was about to be
21:48
sent to saint helena
21:50
uh it's a very distant island and it was
21:53
supposedly overrun with rats
21:54
and people put up signs around the city
21:56
of chester saying that the government
21:58
desperately needed lots of cats to wipe
22:00
out all the rats on saint helena to make
22:02
it fit for napoleon right
22:03
and if you bring your cat to this
22:05
address tomorrow
22:06
the government will give you quite a lot
22:08
of money for it and it was mayhem
22:11
it was absolute people brought hundreds
22:13
and hundreds of cats
22:14
so was it a hoax that it was just some
22:16
random person who you didn't like and
22:18
they went there is that it it was an
22:19
empty house
22:20
so no one knows exactly why it was it
22:22
wasn't although that would be a hell of
22:23
a prank i know
22:24
it's like ordering a pizza to someone
22:26
but with cats yeah
22:30
but bram stoker did write some
22:32
questionable stuff didn't he a lot of
22:33
it's been discovered recently
22:35
so a book of his notes
22:39
was discovered in the 90s and basically
22:41
he loves puns and he loves really rude
22:43
jokes so there's there's a really good
22:45
joke um i'm just going to see if it
22:47
works
22:48
you for this joke to work you do
22:49
actually have to know what a canticle is
22:53
does everyone know what a canticle is i
22:54
don't know what one is cool oh
22:56
yes yes we've got some churchgoers in
22:58
the audience
22:59
it's like a religious song it's like
23:01
it's like a hymn isn't it um
23:02
so this is really funny joke why is
23:04
death like a psalm i don't know why is
23:08
that is it
23:09
canticles
23:10
[Laughter]
23:13
james you've absolutely nailed it
23:16
because
23:16
i'm going to cut out the bit where you
23:18
said you need to know what canticles
23:21
look like an absolute genius um no it's
23:24
quite clever
23:24
because kicking the bucket resembles a
23:27
can
23:28
tickle yeah well
23:31
that's that's great it just shows that
23:34
comedy changes i suppose
23:37
so uh dracula just briefly on dracula
23:39
yeah did you know the first adaptation
23:41
of dracula for the stage happened before
23:43
the novel came out
23:44
really no yeah way so he worked for many
23:47
years as the
23:48
manager to the actor henry irving who
23:51
was incredibly famous in victorian times
23:53
cumberbatch levels of famous and he ran
23:56
his theater the lyceum which is in
23:57
london it's in the west end
23:59
and uh stoker had been writing this
24:01
novel for a very long time
24:02
and it debuted at the lyceum theatre
24:04
where he worked and stoker had been
24:06
working on it for seven years
24:08
it was only performed once and after the
24:10
performance he asked his boss henry
24:12
irving the incredibly famous actor what
24:13
he thought
24:14
the the only word irving said in reply
24:16
was dreadful
24:19
i know but i think it may have been you
24:21
know it was full of dread
24:22
because it's a very spooky story so and
24:25
a lot of people say to me after giggs
24:26
andy that was dreadful
24:29
and i think that's why that'll be it
24:32
and so when they say it's awful it's
24:34
because they're full of awe exactly
24:36
yeah and when they say
24:38
[Laughter]
24:42
can't win them all
24:47
we should say that um he was not famous
24:50
in his own time so i went back through
24:51
the british newspaper archive
24:53
uh looking for his obituary and when he
24:56
died
24:56
all the obit said he was the manager of
24:59
henry irving so as andy says
25:01
henry evan was the cumberbatch and
25:03
literally it was just
25:04
an addendum at the end of the year it
25:06
would be and he wrote a number of novels
25:08
but henry irving what a guy and henry i
25:10
think was
25:11
quite an exciting guy and a really nice
25:13
person
25:14
as far as i could tell and um he had
25:17
this lovely coincidence where
25:19
he was an actor and his last work he
25:21
performed on stage was the day that he
25:23
died this was in 1905
25:25
and his last words on stage were into
25:27
thy hands o lord
25:29
and then he had a stroke that night and
25:31
he died and then all the newspapers
25:33
reported it as
25:34
pathetic end to a great career
25:37
which pathetic meant a different thing a
25:39
hundred years ago but now it just looks
25:41
incredibly
25:42
harsh i don't know a lot of people say
25:44
to me andy that was pathetic
25:48
did you know um just on boys dressed as
25:51
girls and girls dressed as boys
25:52
in the elizabethan theater all the roles
25:55
of girls were played by boys
25:57
but i didn't know this you could be
25:59
officially legally kidnapped
26:01
if you were a child and put in a play
26:05
yes this was not illegal
26:08
so theaters if they had a license could
26:11
abduct
26:12
children and put them in place
26:15
wow this is real so you'd get back to
26:18
your meat hook and you'd be like where's
26:19
my
26:19
kids queen elizabeth granted permission
26:23
to theaters
26:30
[Applause]
26:32
yeah um it was originally so they could
26:34
get choristers for the royal chapel but
26:36
the theatres all did it too and no one
26:38
really minded there are legal cases
26:39
surviving of people saying i quite like
26:41
my son back
26:44
i can't was there just not enough
26:46
interest in their profession no
26:49
right okay well i think we've got a
26:51
shortage of teachers at the moment
26:52
haven't we
26:53
in this country it's something to think
26:55
about um we're gonna have to move on to
26:57
the final fact soon
26:58
anything before we do can i give you
27:00
another brown stoker joke
27:01
oh my god do you want to save it to
27:04
close the show
27:06
we might need a big one at the end i
27:08
felt like these guys appetites they
27:10
couldn't wait
27:10
okay let's let's do it now do you all
27:12
know what a chassis is
27:13
good you do actually need to know what a
27:17
prince consort is
27:21
come on brighton so the question is
27:25
why is the letter p like a prince
27:27
consort
27:29
anyone no okay i'll give you the answer
27:31
um
27:33
because because it makes a queen
27:36
regnant a queen pregnant
27:40
oh yeah you also have to know what queen
27:41
ragnan is
27:45
that actually got quite a good response
27:47
it's all right isn't it
27:48
that's that's probably the first time
27:49
anyone's said that joke on a stage
27:51
since bram stoker yeah yeah yeah
27:55
um should we move on to our final fact
27:56
on the night yeah yeah okay it is
27:58
it is time for our final fact of the
28:00
show and that is andrew hunter murray
28:02
my fact is that when a computer tried to
28:04
come up with romantic messages for
28:06
loveheart sweets
28:07
based on existing ones it came up with
28:10
bear wig
28:11
meet mate bong love
28:14
and you are bag
28:16
[Laughter]
28:19
in sweden it was you are bog wasn't it
28:23
they're great aren't they well no yeah
28:26
if they were great it wouldn't be a good
28:28
fact
28:30
so there is a researcher i think she's
28:33
american she's called janelle shane
28:34
and she specializes in building neural
28:37
networks
28:38
so this is where you feed a machine a
28:40
load of information and you try and
28:41
encourage it to come up with more things
28:42
that are like it
28:44
uh with varying degrees of creativity so
28:46
you can dial it up or dial it down to
28:47
get them
28:48
more accurate or or more imaginative and
28:51
she did this with love hearts you fed in
28:52
a load of love hearts
28:54
and some of them were really good so
28:56
there was a cute kiss
28:58
and uh my bear it's quite sweet yeah
29:00
that's good
29:01
some of them were okay i'm good
29:06
you are babe they're all right but then
29:09
there were others
29:10
which included um pinner face
29:14
sweat poo
29:18
and my favorite one love 2000 hogs yeah
29:23
it's hard to imagine them fitting that
29:25
on the suite isn't it yeah
29:27
i also saw um stank love
29:30
my hag hole
29:32
[Laughter]
29:35
and you hack you
29:39
that's one to give to bram stoker after
29:41
his set
29:44
and this were overseas uh listeners
29:46
because i didn't i didn't know they were
29:47
called lovehearts uh i've called them
29:49
sweethearts which i think in america is
29:50
what they're called so it's the same
29:52
sometimes conversation hearts as well
29:54
yes yeah so it's it's a little sugary
29:56
heart with a message on it for
29:58
yeah and apparently i think in the 80s
30:00
in britain at least
30:01
they wanted to get drop dead gorgeous on
30:03
the suites but it was too long
30:06
and so they instead went with drop dead
30:10
because what do you remember i remember
30:12
growing up and seeing drop dead
30:14
and always i thought it was just like
30:16
you know russian roulette of you know
30:17
you're gonna get
30:19
you're just gonna get one bad one and
30:21
you never know like you give someone a
30:23
sweet and it might be a nice one
30:24
it might be not not a nice one might be
30:26
you are bag
30:27
[Laughter]
30:30
um so there obviously they have to
30:33
change it as this
30:33
as the years go go round so in the 1950s
30:36
they phased out hey daddio
30:39
i know it's ready for a comeback isn't
30:41
it i think so
30:43
right wikipedia claims that fax me is
30:46
still on the list
30:47
which i cannot believe that's me there
30:50
is one that's
30:50
grow up and that was actually
30:54
the cause of a complaint that the love
30:56
hearts company received from a man
30:57
who was trying to replicate his wife
30:59
after a row and he gave her achievable
31:01
hearts and the first message that she
31:02
saw was grow up
31:05
and she left him
31:08
the article said grow up is still in
31:10
production so
31:11
they obviously didn't think that was a
31:12
good enough reason to discontinue wow
31:15
grow up that's not that is one of those
31:17
like not good ones though isn't it
31:18
yeah i can't think of a good way that
31:20
grow up could be used
31:22
um with me grow up with me grow older
31:26
grow old with me
31:29
um some more recent ones from 2014 on
31:32
the love hearts
31:33
um skype me is now one um yolo
31:36
is one tote hillaire
31:42
and this is a good one for me oriep pet
31:45
oh that's great yes that's a good one
31:48
isn't it yeah oh you can fax me
31:52
um so the the very original love hearts
31:54
they were called conversation lozenges
31:56
that was the original name i know it's
31:59
so good
31:59
um and they date from the 1820s these
32:01
are seriously old things
32:03
um and they they originally had the
32:05
message on the wrapper and then
32:06
eventually the message migrated onto the
32:07
suite
32:08
but the messages said things like can
32:10
you polka
32:11
do you flirt or the highly flirtatious
32:15
no i won't ask mama no
32:21
but then the the temperance movement got
32:23
hold of the loveheart
32:24
and they started putting on messages
32:26
like misery sickness and poverty are the
32:28
effects of drunkenness
32:32
they ruin everything
32:35
it was a real fashion in the victorian
32:37
era for sweets that had a message on
32:39
them
32:39
and the lrb pointed out that the rage
32:42
for sweets with a message was initially
32:44
delayed by the illiteracy prevailing in
32:46
the market
32:47
but successive education acts did for
32:49
readable suites
32:50
what they also did for penny dreadfuls
32:52
and newspapers so they became more
32:54
popular but sticks of rock with a
32:56
message inside
32:57
which we are familiar with today right
32:59
were popular in the 1800s
33:01
and the first mention of sticks of rock
33:03
with a message came in the 1860s
33:05
where it was mentioned in someone's
33:06
diary and messages inside sticks of rock
33:09
included
33:10
do you love me do you love sprats
33:13
and sir robert peel who was
33:17
a recently deceased prime minister
33:21
i'm just sucking on a stick of rock and
33:23
saying theresa may's name
33:24
being spelled out and so the american
33:27
ones
33:28
are not made by swizzles they're made by
33:30
neko and ecco
33:32
which is a new england candy company and
33:34
they also make candy buttons
33:36
and javelin mints and a few other things
33:38
but there are a few things that they
33:39
don't make anymore
33:40
uh including whorehound ovals
33:44
jujube monoplanes wang bees
33:48
and climax mint patties whoa
33:54
they sound great don't they i mean i'd
33:57
love to at the end of a meal would you
33:59
like a climax mint patty
34:01

34:03
potter sweet shop
34:05
when you go behind the door yeah wang
34:08
bees
34:09
well just on the topic of ai sort of
34:13
uh generating this new stuff and
34:15
bizarrely harry potter you mentioning
34:17
that um
34:17
i found an amazing ai generated harry
34:20
potter book the other day
34:21
uh it's made by this online company
34:24
called botnick studios they're online
34:26
artists who do
34:27
they're really cool really fun stuff and
34:29
what they did is they fed into this
34:30
machine
34:31
all seven books of harry potter and they
34:33
understood the language and
34:35
and so on and kind of got their heads
34:36
around it and it pumped out an original
34:38
harry potter book
34:40
um and uh yeah it's it's an amazing book
34:42
i'll read this a couple do you know what
34:44
it was called
34:44
yeah i i i thought i had the title here
34:47
i'm missing it at the moment i'll see if
34:48
i can find it before the end of the show
34:50
but
34:50
um i'll give you a couple of extracts
34:52
from it this is from chapter 13 the
34:53
handsome one
34:54
it's called um leathery sheets of rain
34:58
lashed at harry's ghost as he walked
34:59
across the grounds towards the castle
35:02
ron was standing there and doing a kind
35:03
of frenzied tap dance
35:06
he saw harry and immediately began to
35:09
eat hermione's family
35:14
and then this is that's a bit from the
35:16
order of the phoenix
35:18
this is the very next page harry could
35:20
tell that voldemort was standing right
35:21
behind him
35:22
he felt a great overreaction
35:24
[Laughter]
35:26
harry tore harry tore his eyes from
35:30
his head and threw them into the forest
35:32
in fellas that is an overreaction
35:34
[Laughter]
35:36
voldemort raised his eyebrows at harry
35:38
who could not see anything at the moment
35:43
run through his wand at voldemort and
35:45
everyone applauded
35:46
ron smiled ron reached for his one
35:49
slowly
35:50
not so handsome now thought harry as he
35:53
dipped hermione in hot sauce
35:59
that is amazing the whole granger family
36:01
is edible in this
36:02
yeah they are not they are not like this
36:04
is an amazing bit as well
36:06
voldemort you're a very bad and mean
36:08
wizard harry savagely said
36:09
hermione nodded encouragingly the tall
36:12
death eater was wearing a shirt that
36:14
said
36:14
hermione has forgotten how to dance
36:16
[Laughter]
36:19
so hermione dipped his face in mud
36:23
i mean it reads awesomely
36:26
i read one um it might not be as good as
36:28
i read one
36:29
um about um fortune cookies so they used
36:33
ai to find some fortune cookie things
36:35

38:04

00:04
[Music]
00:11
hello
00:11
and welcome to another episode of no
00:14
such thing as a fish no
00:16
weekly
00:19
coming to you live but heavily edited
00:22
from
00:23
oxford
00:28
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:30
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:32
murray and james harkin and once again
00:34
we have gathered around the microphones
00:35
with our four
00:36
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:37
and in no particular order
00:39
here we go starting with you anna my
00:42
fact this week
00:42
is that the victorian soldier major
00:45
charles ben dyer
00:46
once braved enemy fire to get an egg
00:49
from a tree
00:50
then held it in his mouth while he
00:51
climbed down and on finding that it was
00:53
stuck
00:54
inside his mouth removed one of his
00:56
teeth to free it
01:00
it's amazing and this is just egg
01:02
collecting or egging
01:03
in fact was a really popular pursuit in
01:06
the 19th century
01:07
and still some people do it today and
01:09
yeah he was an egger
01:10
and it was uh thought of as quite a
01:12
manly pursuit it was very dangerous
01:14
because like birds lay their eggs in
01:17
precarious positions on cliff faces or
01:19
really high up trees and stuff
01:20
so yeah major charles bendire got up
01:23
there to prove his manhood
01:24
and he had to have his tooth removed and
01:26
he was being attacked by apaches wasn't
01:28
it
01:28
yes this was in america um he was trying
01:31
to get an egg of a zone-tailed hawk
01:33
and i looked to see how big those eggs
01:36
are and they are about
01:37
three inches by two inches okay so if
01:40
you can imagine that what i've got my
01:41
phone here
01:42
the width of my phone this is an iphone
01:44
6s plus
01:46
[Music]
01:47
[Laughter]
01:50
this is about the same width as the egg
01:52
so i'm going to put it in my mouth okay
01:57
for listeners at home this is incredible
01:59
stuff this is
02:02
it's i mean the people of oxford have
02:03
never seen anyone deep throw tonight
02:09
nobody has
02:12
please no one texts me right now
02:16
but anyway that gives you an idea of how
02:17
big the egg was that's so that's the
02:19
uh that's the width of it yes um so
02:22
that's the length actually and the width
02:24
is two inches so it's a bit smaller
02:25
width wise
02:26
it's egg shaped wait so
02:31
you therefore put it in kind of with the
02:34
long
02:34
end because you put it in the wrong way
02:36
round i know but you're a terrible egg
02:38
but my feeling is that charles bender
02:40
might have done it that way right
02:41
because surely that's how it must have
02:43
gotten stuck
02:43
maybe yeah well i think also his jaw
02:46
swole up
02:46
swelled up due to being under fire it
02:48
was a very tense situation
02:50
and i think that made his draw swell up
02:51
a bit meaning that is that what happens
02:53
that's one account i read and he had to
02:55
get he so his men took it out
02:56
under threat of court martial he said i
02:59
will caught martial if you don't uh
03:04
yeah and his tooth broke didn't he so it
03:06
may not have been an entire tooth
03:08
uh and his but his tooth broke as it was
03:10
on the way out or he insisted that it
03:12
was broken to ensure that he retained
03:14
the egg so
03:15
bird birders no sorry eggers who had
03:17
dangerous times
03:19
there was another guy called francis j
03:21
britwell i'm pretty sure this is 19th
03:22
century
03:23
he was strangled by his own climbing
03:25
rope climbing to reach a nest in a tall
03:27
pine tree
03:28
on his honeymoon oh
03:32
yeah sad honeymoon the other thing is
03:34
that guy i googled him see if there was
03:36
anything else about him
03:37
and that seems to be literally the only
03:39
thing we know about him
03:41
imagine that that's all you're known for
03:42
trying to get an egg on your honeymoon
03:44
and
03:45
he died doing what he loved but not
03:48
doing who he loved which is what
03:49
honeymoon's all about
03:53
miss the entire point yeah but they get
03:56
really obsessive don't they
03:57
these collectors yeah and they still
03:59
happen so there's a society called the
04:00
jourdain
04:01
jordan jordan society which is named
04:03
after an egg collector of the 19th
04:05
century
04:05
and uh this sort of still exists
04:08
although they're honorary members now
04:09
because it's actually illegal to take
04:11
eggs out of bird's nest because
04:12
it kind of damages buzz uh procreation
04:15
cycles
04:16
but yeah there are loads of them around
04:18
so um there's actually one of the
04:20
uk's most prolific egg collectors called
04:23
colin watson who i think had
04:24
more eggs than anyone else in the late
04:26
90s and then they all got seized by the
04:28
police
04:28
but he died falling out of a tree in
04:31
2006. oh yeah
04:33
so again still a very risky and he's
04:35
supposedly been retired for years right
04:37
yeah because he kept he kept getting
04:38
arrested so he said i'm no longer in the
04:40
game
04:41
and then but he was on a on a watch list
04:43
of
04:44
300 egg collectors yes so they're
04:47
constantly
04:48
there's a list where they come and they
04:50
they
04:51
if they think you have it they raid your
04:52
house i know there was one guy
04:54
who had 3 600 eggs in his house and when
04:57
the
04:57
rspb smashed his door in and with the
04:59
police he said to them
05:01
thank god you've come i can't stop so
05:03
this is a real obsession that people
05:05
have
05:05
yeah that's right and often it's the
05:07
wives or the family who call the police
05:09
don't they'll call the rspb
05:11
because they're worried about their
05:12
husbands and it always is husbands
05:15
literally every single person on this
05:16
list is a male
05:18
aged between 25 and 45
05:21
no woman has ever been convicted of eggs
05:25
i guess if they're just better at it
05:29
[Applause]
05:30
i do it all the time no one's ever
05:32
caught me there was a guy called mervin
05:34
shorthouse in the 70s
05:36
and so there's an egg collection at
05:37
tring uh you know which uh
05:39
walter rothschild collected thousands
05:41
maybe i think hundreds of thousands of
05:43
eggs
05:43
uh he broke in and he posed as a
05:46
wheelchair-bound invalid
05:48
and he stole over the course of three
05:49
years ten thousand eggs
05:52
ten thousand i think that's about ten a
05:54
day for three years
05:55
every day yeah including christmas and
05:57
your birthday yeah
05:58
um and then he mixed up all the labels
06:00
to apparently cover the theft i'm not
06:02
sure how that covers the theft because
06:03
you've been having
06:04
ten thousand eggs in your house i've
06:05
heard that with any museum thefts
06:07
and um any any general theft where
06:10
there's a label involved
06:11
the biggest problem that any scientist
06:14
cares about
06:15
is they don't care if a thing is stolen
06:16
because most likely it will be recovered
06:18
down the line
06:19
a black market trade will reveal it
06:20
somewhere some will spot it in a house
06:22
it's when you remove the data that says
06:24
what it was where it was and how it was
06:26
found
06:26
that's the most important thing that
06:28
goes missing the little label yeah
06:29
yeah so we're saying steal what you like
06:31
but keep the labels yeah steal the
06:34
labels that'd be even worse
06:38
imagine going into a museum where
06:40
nothing was labeled you were just
06:41
looking at yourself going
06:42
what the is that no it is it
06:45
ancient egyptian
06:46
is it 1920s there was it is quite
06:49
gangster there's this amazing new yorker
06:51
article which i would really recommend
06:53
which kind of
06:54
goes through the long history of egging
06:56
kind of in the modern day
06:57
and one of the things it describes is a
06:59
raid in 1994
07:00
and this was by the rspb the
07:03
investigator of the rspb who was
07:04
specifically
07:06
out to catch egg thieves and he raided
07:08
this hotel in
07:09
salisbury in 1994 and there was this
07:12
because he knew that there was this
07:13
drawdown society dinner taking place
07:15
and the rspb actually planted an
07:17
attractive female employee at the bar
07:20
at the meeting of the egg thief to try
07:21
and get secrets out of them did they
07:23
think they were going to get laid
07:29
there's another thing when you go to
07:30
prison and people have been to prison
07:32
it's illegal to collect
07:33
uh bird eggs they get a hard time in
07:35
prison according to one investigator
07:36
because it just seems very weird as a
07:38
crime
07:39
yeah and some of them some of them will
07:41
only speak on the radio if their voices
07:42
are disguised
07:44
like they're a terrorist yeah oh yeah
07:48
there's one who's called mr x who's a
07:49
known egg
07:50
for eggs oh
07:53
that's what he's done
07:54
[Laughter]
07:57
eggers and you two have the same sense
07:58
of humor um
08:00
but he goes around wearing a crow mask
08:01
all the time to disguise his identity
08:03
because
08:04
he disguises himself by wearing a crow
08:06
mask
08:09
because the conveyor he's climbing up
08:10
trees though
08:14
i think both other crows and humans
08:15
would rumble him immediately
08:20
have you have you guys heard of the
08:21
national egg collection
08:23
no this is cool this was a first world
08:24
war thing basically there were lots of
08:26
wounded soldiers and sailors and the
08:28
country had just had a massive egg
08:29
collecting drive to send to the
08:31
soldiers and sailors they collected a
08:33
million a week
08:34
a million eggs a week and they sent them
08:36
to the front which is a very dangerous
08:37
place for an egg
08:40
but people wrote their names and
08:41
addresses on each egg with a message for
08:43
wounded people so if you're a soldier
08:45
lying in hospital near the front you
08:47
would get an egg delivered to you with a
08:48
message saying well done and
08:49
and this is from me and this is who i am
08:51
oh yeah i didn't know anyone got married
08:53
off the back of it because that would be
08:54
very
08:54
romantic i think a similar thing of
08:57
writing on eggs have you guys heard of
08:58
clown eggs
08:59
if you're a clown you have a unique
09:02
pattern of uh
09:03
painting on your face and in order to
09:06
trademark your face
09:07
you need to paint it on an egg and you
09:09
give that egg to this warehouse in east
09:11
london there's a few more now but
09:12
initially it was in east london and that
09:14
would trademark your face officially as
09:16
a thing
09:16
and there's thousands and thousands of
09:18
eggs it's an amazing tradition well if
09:19
you're a bold clown
09:21
with no makeup and no features
09:25
like that guy on twitter
09:28
he is a isn't he yeah he's so
09:31
rude
09:33
can i do some stuff about sticking
09:35
things in your mouth
09:37
um yeah is it post curfew yeah
09:41
go on um so there's a guy called dinesh
09:44
upadhyaya
09:45
who's a science teacher from india and
09:47
he holds 48 world records for stuffing
09:50
objects into his mouth
09:52
impressive so he's put five golf balls
09:54
in there
09:56
he's 79 grapes 92 pencils
09:59
seven um pencils 92 pencils
10:03
they must have been heavily sharpened
10:05
surely
10:06
you couldn't go you can't get one pencil
10:08
in your mouth yeah
10:10
don't tell james what he can and can't
10:11
do i don't know
10:13
oh not all the way in just yeah so
10:15
they're kind of if you can imagine at
10:17
home
10:17
putting a pencil in your mouth but not
10:19
sideways like the the
10:21
like you're smoking a cigar yes exactly
10:23
like that so he does that 92 times
10:26
uh he's done 12 lit candles in his mouth
10:29
and he says that daily practice was the
10:31
key to his success
10:34
and he says he aims to break all
10:36
possible mouth-stuffing records as soon
10:38
as possible
10:41
he sounds great doesn't he i don't
10:44
reckon he's got much competition
10:46
i think that's amazing he could have
10:47
just put two candles in his mouth no one
10:49
else is doing it
10:52
also if you're if you're competing and
10:54
putting lit candles in your mouth
10:55
you absolutely need to specify on that
10:57
record which way you've inserted it into
10:59
your mouth
11:00
because if it's just lit end facing
11:01
outwards that's not remotely impressive
11:03
yeah you're right it's just you put a
11:04
bit of wax in your mouth oh no because
11:07
it's at you know the longer you take to
11:09
put more in the closer
11:11
the flame gets to your head what do you
11:13
mean it burns down
11:14
yeah it would burn towards your head
11:16
you'd have to be pretty slow putting
11:17
them in
11:17
you would yeah i know it would be like a
11:20
very very slow
11:21
james bond villain-esque happy birthday
11:25
mr bond
11:29
what budget bond films have you been
11:31
watching
11:35
now mr bond i expect you to age one year
11:43
[Music]
11:49
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:51
that is james
11:52
okay my fact this week is that if a
11:54
woman left her husband in 18th century
11:57
england the husband would often put a
11:59
lost and found advert in the local
12:01
newspaper
12:03
and this is the thing that happened and
12:05
it's a thing that happened um in the
12:07
1700s
12:08
but it happened all the way to 1980. but
12:11
the golden age of it
12:12
was in i mean golden age yeah what's the
12:15
opposite of a golden age
12:17
shitty age the shitty age of it was the
12:20
1700s
12:21
and there's a blog called
12:24
georgenera.blogspot.com
12:25
and they've collected a load of examples
12:27
from history so they've got one from the
12:28
leeds intelligentsia
12:30
from 1797 one from the chester chronicle
12:33
of 1799
12:34
and basically for more than 300 years if
12:37
your wife left you
12:38
you might put an advert in the newspaper
12:40
saying you basically be no longer
12:42
responsible for her debts
12:44
yeah basically because husbands
12:46
basically were responsible for paying
12:47
for their wives at all times weren't
12:48
they so if your wife
12:49
screwed up like that then you were like
12:51
i'm not responsible for it yeah and the
12:53
thing was people did this thinking it
12:55
was a legal thing that would help them
12:56
out actually it had no legal basis
12:58
whatsoever
12:59
maybe in colonial times in america for a
13:01
short amount of time it might have
13:02
worked but certainly not in 1980 it
13:04
wouldn't have worked
13:05
um and the phrasing was always the same
13:07
as my wife is not here anymore she's
13:09
left the house i will not pay for any of
13:11
her debts
13:12
um it's a bit like you know um you know
13:14
on twitter where it says like
13:16
retweets and not endorsements and
13:18
everyone thinks that's a legal thing
13:19
that will
13:20
save them if they do anything i don't
13:22
know and it absolutely won't
13:24
oh this is exactly the same thing what
13:27
i've been retweeting some pretty bad egg
13:28
based accounts
13:30
and they they did all have the same
13:32
wedding but some of them got pretty
13:33
funky with the language only a few
13:35
so i found one from 1841 which said
13:37
whereas fanny martin has without cause
13:40
left my habitation
13:41
and is floating on the ocean of
13:42
tyrannical extravagance
13:46
prone to prodigality taking a wild goose
13:48
chase
13:49
and kindling her pipe with the coal of
13:51
curiosity
13:52
[Laughter]
13:57
amazing that's a great tagline for our
14:00
show isn't it
14:01
oh yeah was it kindling your pipe with
14:03
the coal of curiosity
14:06
but the women used to get understandably
14:08
quite annoyed because often they'd left
14:10
their husbands for
14:11
totally justified reasons um even though
14:13
in all of these ads as james says
14:15
they all the ad said without just cause
14:17
and so the women started coming back
14:20
from the very early days and posting
14:22
their own ads in newspapers
14:23
actually explaining why they'd done this
14:25
so for instance in 1810
14:27
there was a woman called elizabeth dick
14:29
and her husband had put this advert out
14:30
saying no it's not a funny name come on
14:35
her husband had said that she'd gone
14:37
without just cause and so she posted an
14:39
advert in the paper a couple of weeks
14:40
later saying
14:41
it is true that i left my husband's bed
14:43
and board but not before he made several
14:45
attempts to murder me
14:49
they used to do weird things my favorite
14:51
thing that i read about this if there
14:52
was a sort of marital dispute there used
14:54
to be a thing which was marital
14:56
jewels have you heard of that so it's
14:59
it's you know classic pistols at dawn
15:01
except this was
15:02
husband versus wife to sort out an
15:04
argument and there were specific rules
15:06
about the marital jewel that you had to
15:08
adhere by
15:09
so the basic rules were that um you
15:11
would go to the place there would be an
15:13
adjudicator
15:14
the wife was armed with three rocks and
15:17
she could wrap them around in cloth to
15:19
swing and hit the husband with
15:21
um and this is in the 1200s the man
15:25
basically had uh wooden clubs
15:28
but he had to have a disadvantage to the
15:30
fight so his disadvantage was
15:31
he had to have one arm tied behind his
15:33
back and he had to fight the jewel from
15:36
within
15:36
a three-foot hole in the ground
15:40
so he would be sat whacking away
15:43
and she could stand he could never leave
15:46
the hole and she could run around
15:48
and smack him with her rocks and that
15:51
was a real thing
15:52
there's countless accounts of uh of the
15:54
marital jewel happening
15:56
we should bring that back
15:59
as a married man i don't think we should
16:01
bring that back
16:02
yeah why did i say that we should
16:04
certainly bring it back as a game i mean
16:05
that is a fun game
16:06
you're standing in a hole you've got
16:08
maybe let's make the club out of foam or
16:09
something
16:10
it's like a channel five game show isn't
16:12
it yeah by the way i forgot to tell you
16:14
guys um
16:14
i had a marital uh argument this morning
16:18
oh you forgot to tell us something i
16:21
didn't realize i did i woke up in the
16:22
morning
16:23
and i was like you okay and she said you
16:25
slept talk last night
16:27
i was like did i what did i say and she
16:29
said you said
16:31
i have many secrets
16:37
and that was it she was up for the rest
16:41
of the night okay
16:42
secrets dan she knows about the
16:46
egg stealing
16:48
um so i was looking up uh classified
16:50
adverts in the newspaper
16:52
that that's the thing that happens so
16:54
there were loads so classified adverts
16:55
were an enormous
16:57
thing you know they they kept loads of
16:58
newspapers going in the days before
17:00
craigslist
17:00
and um whatever people use these days um
17:03
but the
17:04
london review of books used to have the
17:06
greatest
17:07
personals adverts to find love out of
17:09
any publication
17:10
and people used to collect these and
17:11
read them avidly um so they included
17:14
things like
17:15
this these are all complete ones by the
17:17
way angry trollope
17:18

17:51
[Laughter]
17:54
so you mentioned craigslist they have
17:56
some really funny postings that have
17:57
gone up and a lot of them are jokes but
17:59
some of them
18:00
i was reading through you know their
18:01
most you know the best ones they've had
18:03
and some of them i think are real and
18:05
incredibly sad so this was one posting
18:07
on craigslist a few years ago
18:08
i need someone to hide easter eggs in my
18:10
apartment when i'm not there
18:12
they are small and filled with candy i
18:14
would like to find them myself on sunday
18:16
i am willing to pay
18:17
serious inquiries only you want someone
18:20
to i know
18:20
i mean it sounds like someone weaning
18:22
themself off exterior doesn't it
18:24
yeah please please please ignore the
18:27
room full of ten thousand eggs with
18:28
mismatched labels
18:31
and the man dressed as a crow in the
18:32
corner
18:35
there was another one did you there was
18:37
one about a man
18:38
who claimed that he'd robbed a woman's
18:40
purse but then
18:42
he'd caught her eye as he was rubbing it
18:43
so he mugged a woman he then he put him
18:45
out on craigslist saying
18:46
hi i mugged you the other day but then i
18:49
caught your eye there was a quick moment
18:50
when our eyes met
18:51
and i felt something strong i think you
18:53
felt it too
18:55
if i wasn't so shy brackets also
18:58
committing a crime
18:59
closed brackets i would have asked your
19:01
name
19:02
i of course later got your name from
19:03
your driver's license
19:08
so jennifer if you'd like to get
19:10
together for a drink please call me
19:12
inside your friend do you know that guns
19:16
and roses got together through a
19:17
personals advert
19:18
did they yeah so there was this used to
19:21
be a thing for bands getting together so
19:22
they're poster music magazines
19:24
and obviously whichever music you like
19:25
you post in that magazine so the advert
19:27
said bass player needed for band
19:29
influence by aerosmith alice cooper
19:31
call slash
19:35
and then they used to put those in the
19:36
enemy didn't they quite a lot i remember
19:38
when i was growing up and of course
19:39
that's closed down today just today
19:41
yeah what last issue goes out on friday
19:43
you're joking
19:44
no jokes last chance if you want to get
19:46
in a band andy
19:48
i thought i was in one so it was a weird
19:51
sort of vocal
19:51
band i think there's a problem with
19:55
classifieds right when people are
19:56
looking into the history of them because
19:58
you don't get any other extra
19:59
information so there's this really good
20:01
looking book which is called found
20:03
strange red cow
20:04
and it's called that because there it's
20:07
related to an advert that was placed in
20:09
the pennsylvania gazette
20:10
in the 19th century which said found
20:12
strange red cow
20:14
and it was about a cow that wandered
20:15
onto someone's property and will return
20:17
to owner who proves that they own it
20:19
but another example of one of the ads in
20:21
this book is
20:22
1892 in new york wanted a young lady of
20:26
german parentage
20:27
must be 36 inch bust and understand
20:30
bookkeeping on a small scale what job
20:34
requires
20:35
all of those very specific accounts i'm
20:37
willing to compromise on the bookkeeping
20:39
on the small scale
20:43
okay move on to fact number three and
20:46
that is my fact
20:47
my fact this week is that there is a
20:49
bell that's been ringing in oxford
20:52
non-stop for 178 years
20:56
yeah yeah you guys must be pissed off
20:58
about that yeah
21:00
sounds really annoying the hometown fact
21:01
to where we're recording or home city
21:03
fact it's um
21:04
this is in the clarendon laboratory it's
21:06
a 10 minute walk from where we are right
21:08
now
21:08
and back in 1840 they set this up with a
21:11
new experimental battery that they
21:13
wanted to test out
21:14
and effectively it's two batteries and a
21:16
little bell uh a little bell hanging
21:18
between and it
21:19
oscillates and just goes between the two
21:20
bells and they thought it would last for
21:22
a while
21:23
but since 1840 it has not stopped it is
21:25
still going i visited it today you can
21:27
go and see it
21:28
yeah i went and you look really close
21:30
and it's just it's just this tiny
21:31
hear it dinging no i made the noise uh
21:35
it's behind two bits of very thick glass
21:38
and then it's in a thicker bit of glass
21:39
even so
21:40
once you get to it but i don't know it's
21:41
dinging though because i made the noise
21:44
we don't know that we don't know if what
21:46
noise it's making if any but you can see
21:48
it
21:48
well it's likely to be a ding it's one
21:50
of those things when you see it you're
21:51
like
21:52
it's it's got the it's got the motion of
21:54
that and
21:55
uh yeah so this has been going and it's
21:57
battery-powered this is what's most
21:59
impressive it's not as if
22:00
it's a perpetual motion or anything
22:02
which would actually be more impressive
22:06
given given how that would break the
22:08
laws of the universe
22:11
no i don't i don't want to show this
22:12
over the science fair it's not the
22:14
perpetual motion thing i've built
22:17
the problem is is that because they
22:18
don't know the exact composure of what's
22:20
going inside it
22:21
they need to uh just leave it because
22:23
the experiment now is how long will this
22:25
go for
22:26
it's like schrodinger's battery if you
22:28
if you touch it and go in you ruin the
22:30
experiment
22:31
so yeah so they're just going to wait it
22:33
out it's a long-term experiment the best
22:34
guess is that it's 2 000
22:36
alternate layers of metal foil and paper
22:38
coated with manganese dioxide and honey
22:41
compressed into a glass tube and sealed
22:43
from humidity in a casing of sulfur
22:46
honey that is honey that's a good guess
22:48
isn't it
22:51
you were close but it was peanut butter
22:57
i just find it amazing that this stuff
22:58
doesn't erode which i know
23:00
like metals are uh very erosion you know
23:03
proof
23:04
but the clapper has struck the bell 10
23:06
billion
23:07
911 million 456 000 times
23:11
since it started that's like you know
23:14
almost 11 billion times
23:15
yeah they think that the physical bell
23:17
will break before the battery itself
23:19
breaks
23:20
yeah because there's a lot of metallic
23:21
dust at the bottom isn't that where it's
23:23
kind of eroded over time
23:24
yeah and you know what this experiment
23:27
is called the oxford dry pile experiment
23:29
and it's been going longer than physics
23:35
by which i mean that it was bought in
23:37
1840 like you say by reverend
23:39
robert walker uh and he was a reader in
23:42
experimental philosophy and that's what
23:43
they call physics back then
23:45
so it's before you had physics
23:46
professors yeah wow that's cool isn't it
23:48
that is cool
23:50
also the battery was effectively made in
23:52
1825 they started
23:53
ringing it as a bell in 1840 but volta
23:56
with the first batteries was
23:58
1800 so in 25 years they created a
24:01
battery that is still running today and
24:04
just nailed it i imagine when it stops
24:06
they'll be like have you tried rubbing
24:07
it
24:11
i think we should say i think there's
24:12
been a few moments where it has stopped
24:14
due to um humidity and stuff like that
24:16
but it's always come back on
24:18
does anyone else have a problem with dry
24:19
pile being away from this
24:21
i do have a terrible problem with
24:22
tripods
24:24
my notes are all about completely
24:26
different stuff actually
24:28
it's mostly a list list of pharmacists
24:30
that i visited
24:33
it's an unfortunate name for what is an
24:35
extremely important piece of you know
24:37
physical progress but the voltaic pile
24:40
uh invented by
24:41
uh volta of um voltage fame
24:44
is what is basically based on and i
24:46
didn't actually realize how they worked
24:48
but basically
24:49
it's just the voltaic pile is
24:51
alternating
24:52
layers of two different types of metal
24:54
and if you've got metals of two
24:56
different chemical components then
24:59
charge will travel between them if you
25:01
put like salty
25:02
watery paper between them so that allows
25:04
electricity to conduct because you've
25:05
got this watery salty paper
25:07
so the metal slightly dissolves into
25:09
that paper
25:10
and then when they touch each other then
25:13
the current travels through them and a
25:14
circuit is created
25:15
so it's just a pile of metal with some
25:17
wet paper in between it was bizarre
25:19
that's electricity
25:20
but and he's the guy who demonstrated
25:23
electricity first by electrocuting loads
25:24
of frogs
25:25
yes altar so he galvani as well
25:29
and galvani so these were the two
25:32
electricity pioneers of the early 19th
25:33
century
25:34
and they were kind of for this fight
25:36
because volta used to put two different
25:38
types of metal on a dead frog's leg
25:40
and the frog's leg would twitch and he'd
25:42
say look that shows these two different
25:44
metals are creating electricity and
25:45
galvani
25:46
from where we get the word galvanize
25:48
said no no
25:50
it's because the frog's leg is
25:52
generating electricity
25:53
and he thought that dead animal you know
25:56
bits
25:56
created electricity it turns out he was
25:58
wrong but we could have had a world
26:00
where instead of a battery you have to
26:02
shove a dead frog's leg into the back of
26:03
your torch a better world
26:05
[Laughter]
26:07
and you know volkswa did an experiment
26:09
just after he invented the voltaic pile
26:11
um where he found out that electricity
26:13
tastes sour
26:14
and the way that he did this was he got
26:16
a number of volunteers to form a chain
26:18
and they each pinch the tongue of the
26:20
per i won't do it andy don't worry
26:22
and the person next to them and so they
26:24
were all in a chain pinching each
26:26
other's tongue
26:26
and then he put some electricity going
26:29
through them and everyone could taste
26:30
the fingers
26:31
of the person next to them going sour
26:34
really
26:35
that's a good experiment but how do you
26:36
get the volunteers for that in your
26:38
classified ever
26:39
wanted what are the volunteers for wacky
26:42
stuff
26:43
first of all we don't have electricity
26:44
and you say come and taste my fingers
26:48
taste my finger was the victorian
26:50
equivalent of pull my finger
26:53
do you know just on how batteries work
26:55
and how
26:56
you know electrical current flows in the
26:58
19th century
26:59
there were a lot of cases of exploding
27:02
teeth and i know it sounds like those
27:03
two sentences are unrelated
27:05
but um they've realized people have
27:07
realized that the most likely
27:08
explanation for this is that people used
27:10
to have teeth that were made of metal
27:12
obviously
27:12
and they would often be two different
27:14
types of metal and there were all these
27:16
dentist records and doctor's records of
27:17
exploding teeth like people would be in
27:19
huge amounts of pain and they'd feel
27:21
like there was an electric current going
27:22
into their gums
27:23
and then their teeth would explode and
27:25
it's actually because they literally
27:27
were turning their mouths into a battery
27:29
so if you had these two different types
27:30
of metal and they were making contact
27:32
then there was a circuit running around
27:33
your mouth
27:34
wow and that's what happens if you have
27:36
a filling and you bite a bit of metal
27:38
you're making a tiny little battery
27:39
there aren't you that's why that's so
27:40
painful
27:41
really yeah it's not painful i've always
27:43
had perfect teeth
27:47
i was looking a bit into because this is
27:49
a long-term experiment that's been
27:50
going on i just looked into long-term
27:52
experiments and i found one which i
27:54
thought was really interesting
27:55
um there was a paper that was published
27:57
in 1998 and the title of it was
28:00
does knuckle cracking lead to arthritis
28:02
of the fingers
28:03
and this was written by a scientist
28:06
called
28:06
donald unger who basically for 60 years
28:10
cracked
28:10
his knuckles in order to work out if it
28:13
was arthritis that you would get off the
28:15
back of it he did it because when he was
28:16
a kid his mother and his aunties said to
28:18
him
28:19
stop cracking your knuckles you're gonna
28:20
get arthritis and he thought no i'm not
28:22
so he spent
28:22
60 years on the left hand alone cracking
28:26
his knuckles and then he didn't crack
28:27
his right hand exactly so he was
28:29
it started as a kid just was like every
28:31
day he would crack his knuckles
28:32
and he got to the end and his answer was
28:34
no it doesn't give you arthritis
28:36
although that seems like a very petty
28:37
thing to spite your mother
28:39
for 60 years yeah it was an unhealthy
28:42
relationship
28:44
i have done further papers and it turns
28:45
out the broccoli is not delicious
28:52
and it does i won't go blind if i keep
28:54
doing that
28:58
uh should we move on to our final fact
29:00
yep okay it is our final fact of the
29:03
show
29:03
and that is andy my fact is that king
29:06
edward vii
29:07
had a liqueur invented specifically for
29:09
him to drink
29:10
while driving
29:14
this was very pretty health and safety
29:17
um
29:17
so there's a drink it's called the
29:18
king's ginger because it was named
29:20
for him uh he was dry he was the first
29:23
monarch to
29:23
drive a car he was driving for about
29:25
1898. he was an early adopter
29:27
he became king in 1901 and um he was a
29:30
huge
29:30
fan of drinking but he was driving
29:32
around on quite chilly moors
29:34
open top cars and his doctor this is the
29:36
story of the drink
29:37
uh was worried that he might get cold
29:39
and chilly so
29:40
uh instead of giving him medical advice
29:43
he just
29:44
asked a wine merchant to invent a new
29:45
alcohol for him
29:47
and it's very gingery and it's called
29:48
king's ginger and it still exists right
29:50
it's still exist and actually i've
29:51
brought some along with me tonight
29:54
yeah my wine was literally about to run
29:56
out well
29:57
have you got a cup i've got uh i've got
29:59
four i did try and find shot glasses in
30:01
my house but due to
30:02
my lifestyle i've got one i've then
30:08
got two measure two measuring uh shot
30:11
glasses which are used
30:13
for cayenne pepper and
30:16
i've got one shot glass i borrowed from
30:17
the venue thank you very much
30:20
so if you'd like to oh cranky i'm not
30:23
driving home later am i still allowed to
30:25
drink it
30:27
we don't normally finish with uh alcohol
30:29
consumption on stage sorry i'm just
30:31
we normally start with it but um anna's
30:34
shot at it right
30:36
it was a shot glass
30:37
[Laughter]
30:43
[Music]
30:45
okay should we talk about facts and
30:46
stuff yeah sure yeah oh yeah edward the
30:48
seventh
30:50
he liked drinking he he liked generally
30:52
having a good time didn't he with the
30:53
seventh
30:54
so old bertie he one of the things he
30:57
was famous for was having a
30:59
uh siege d'amour or a love chair oh yeah
31:02
which is
31:03
uh an item which i think still exists
31:05
today but it was made for his own
31:06
personal use
31:07
at a brothel called le chaberne which
31:10
was a very famous brothel in paris
31:12
and if you should look it up the love
31:14
chair of edward the seventh and
31:15
apparently it's made him to have
31:17
sex with two women at the same time it's
31:19
a bizarre contraption it's got stirrups
31:21
on it it's got hand grips on it
31:23
i stared at it for about 45 minutes
31:24
today and i cannot for the life of me
31:26
work out how you could have sex with one
31:28
person
31:28
let alone two ah using this chair but he
31:31
was worried wasn't he because he
31:33
he got quite massive uh later in life
31:35
and so his main worry was
31:36
he didn't he was having a lot of sex
31:38
still with a lot of people and he didn't
31:40
want to crush them while he was having
31:41
sex
31:42
that was his that was his decision so
31:43
the the chair
31:45
gave him the sort of the uncrushability
31:47
that he was
31:48
looking for when having a menage a tour
31:51
yeah
31:52
um and can i just say quickly because i
31:54
i know we're in england and everyone
31:55
know who's who edward the
31:57
seventh is but yeah there's little else
31:59
spoken about these days like
32:01
contemporary national discourse but for
32:03
international listeners he was the
32:05
he was the son of queen victoria he was
32:07
born in 1841
32:09
which for context of this podcast was
32:11
one year after the belt started ringing
32:13
in oxford
32:15
um and he was yeah he was known as dirty
32:18
bertie he was
32:19
he was such a odd character but very
32:21
influential as well
32:22
a lot of things have gone through
32:24
history that are said to be uh
32:26
as a result of him one we know for sure
32:27
is the fact that the royals get two
32:29
birthdays the queen has two birthdays
32:31
that's down to him because his birthday
32:33
was at a bad time it was in a wintry
32:35
time so he said i want a more
32:36
a summery one so he gave himself a
32:38
second birthday so that's that's down to
32:40
him
32:41
um some royal drinks oh yeah um so um
32:44
you said queen victoria who was his
32:46
mother
32:47
yes um her favorite drink was whiskey
32:49
and red wine mixed together
32:52
yeah that's true that i think we found
32:53
out from gladstone didn't we a prime
32:55
minister of the 19th century
32:56
and yeah he did not like the idea he
32:59
wrote she has her claret strengthened
33:03
and
33:03
i should have thought spoiled with
33:05
whiskey but
33:06
that was her drink uh kate middleton
33:08
likes crack baby
33:10
sorry hey never call me baby again
33:16
it's a very legally contentious
33:18
statement james it's a cocktail
33:20
there's no crack in it it's got vodka
33:22
raspberry liqueur
33:23
passion fruit and champagne it's called
33:25
crack baby
33:26
that's one of her favorite drinks did
33:28
you know that there is a new drink
33:29
that's been invented called a voctail
33:31
this is from last year
33:32
it's by the university of singapore and
33:34
it's a virtual cocktail
33:36
so it's a special glass which can make
33:38
you think you're drinking alcohol even
33:39
though you're not
33:41
sounds awful it's got three methods so
33:43
you pour a liquid in you pour just
33:44
normal water in
33:45
and then you can there's a light that
33:47
goes on in the glass so already you
33:48
think oh it's a lovely red cocktail
33:50
whatever
33:51
then there are electrodes all around the
33:53
rim where
33:54
you can alter the sweetness or the
33:56
saltiness or the bitterness by
