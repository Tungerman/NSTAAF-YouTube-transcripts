00:00
hi guys just before we start this show i
00:02
wanted to say hope you're all doing okay
00:04
in this bizarre situation that we've all
00:07
found ourselves in
00:08
and i hope you're staying safe and
00:10
washing your hands a billion times a
00:12
minute
00:13
and not going near anyone else and
00:15
there's really nothing that we can tell
00:16
you about this virus that you can't
00:18
already learn
00:19
from the news and the medical advice
00:22
and all of that jazz but what we can do
00:24
is we can still
00:25
share with you our four favorite facts
00:26
from the last seven days and
00:28
fill your head with distracting nonsense
00:31
facts
00:31
which hopefully will distract you from
00:33
the fact you're stuck in a house with
00:34
your spouse or your kids or your mates
00:36
and you now all want to kill each other
00:38
and will distract you even from the
00:40
slightly more disconcerting global event
00:42
so as long as you guys continue to
00:44
listen we
00:45
am afraid are going to continue to
00:47
podcast every week
00:49
starting now okay on with the show
01:02
[Applause]

01:06
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:09
no such thing as a fish
01:10
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:12
qi offices in covent garden
01:15
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
01:16
here with andrew hunter murray
01:18
anna chazinski and james harkin and once
01:21
again we have gathered around the
01:22
microphones with our four favorite facts
01:24
from the last seven days
01:26
and in no particular order here we go
01:29
starting with my fact this week my fact
01:32
is
01:32
computer pioneer charles babbage once
01:35
cooked himself in an
01:36
oven for four minutes at 265 degrees
01:40
just to see what would happen wow what
01:43
was he trying to make at the time
01:46
a cooked babbage babbage cabbage
01:49
confusion
01:52
yeah so this was um as a result of an
01:54
artistic friend of him called sir
01:55
francis
01:56
chantery who was a sculptor and he made
01:59
big bronze statues
02:00
and he was doing a particularly big one
02:02
so they had to build this giant oven for
02:04
him
02:04
to build it uh to cook it in and so
02:07
babbage heard about
02:08
this and he was really intrigued and he
02:09
went to see it and while he was there
02:11
he was sort of talking to them and they
02:12
said why don't you go inside
02:14
be interested right and babbage said
02:17
yeah
02:17
that would be interesting so he went
02:18
along with another guy called captain
02:20
cater
02:21
and his description which he wrote in
02:23
his memoirs say
02:25
the iron folding doors of the small room
02:27
or oven were opened
02:28
captain cater and myself entered and
02:30
they were closed upon us
02:31
then the further corner of the room
02:33
which was paved with square stones was
02:35
visibly a dull
02:36
red heat the thermometer marked if i
02:38
recollect rightly 265 degrees
02:40
he talks about his pulse quickening he
02:42
talks about the perspiration
02:43
um and he says it was fine he says it
02:45
was absolutely fine
02:46
what is only there for how long four
02:49
minutes four or five minutes six minutes
02:50
he wasn't sure
02:51
the heat sort of made him bit dozy
02:52
probably there's one other thing he said
02:54
someone didn't go in with them
02:56
uh he says sir thomas lawrence who was
02:58
suffering from indisposition
02:59
did not think it prudent to join our
03:01
party in fact he died on the second or
03:03
third day after our experiment
03:07
wow oh thomas lawrence never got to go
03:09
it wouldn't have mattered if he had gone
03:10
in the oven probably
03:11
well maybe he should have gone in yeah
03:12
you never know perhaps that had some
03:13
healing properties
03:15
maybe yeah this is not sound medical
03:17
advice
03:19
it's amazing he but and he he went in
03:21
other hot places
03:22
well this it's thought that this was in
03:24
preparation for his next big trip
03:26
which was which was he went down a
03:28
volcano
03:30
an active volcano he went down vesuvius
03:32
one of the most famous volcanoes yeah
03:33
of all celebrity volcanoes did your mate
03:35
who died
03:36
die from falling into a volcano or what
03:39
like
03:40
it doesn't i don't think so no but he
03:44
he was obsessed with he wanted to
03:45
experience an earthquake
03:47
and he once found out he was in italy at
03:49
the time and he heard a town had been
03:50
destroyed by an earthquake
03:51
and he rushed there just in case there
03:54
were some aftershocks he could feel yeah
03:55
but he said my passion was disappointed
03:57
so i consoled myself by a flirtation
03:59
with a volcano
04:01
he didn't feel the earth mood
04:04
so did he go like dip himself in lava
04:07
what happened in the bottom there
04:08
he went into the crater you know there
04:11
are bits in
04:12
sort of in the lip of the crater of an
04:14
active volcano so he went in he saw
04:17
the uh lava below him and he observed
04:19
the bubbles of it
04:20
swelling up right and because it was
04:22
active at the time he
04:23
made a measurement of the eruptions he
04:25
said right those are every 10 minutes
04:27
and he said well
04:28
okay so i can go in for up to eight
04:31
minutes and he did he went in for six
04:32
minutes and he was lowered by rope
04:34
yeah yeah it's extraordinary and did he
04:37
eventually throw the ring into the lava
04:42
one thing he put he put his cane down in
04:44
a specific spot
04:45
and it happened to um hit i think a bit
04:48
of lava
04:48
so it burst into flames he had a flaming
04:51
cane as he was
04:51
trying to put it out yeah okay so first
04:54
of all
04:54
no second of all because we've already
04:56
done some stuff but who was charles
04:58
babbage then
04:59
charles babbage computer pioneer he's um
05:01
historically linked with ada lovelace
05:03
and he was the person who dreamt up
05:05
effectively
05:06
the original computer he's known as the
05:08
father of computing
05:10
and it was something he never got to
05:12
fully make in his lifetime
05:13
though in the hundreds of years since
05:15
we've actually finished his plans and
05:17
shown that his
05:18
his plans did work so he was a genius
05:20
this guy was a proper genius
05:22
although um you say he was the father of
05:23
computing but i quite like the
05:25
description
05:25
that is uncle of computing because
05:29
he didn't spawn anything and i hadn't
05:31
quite realized this about charles
05:32
babbage so he made this very famous
05:34
difference engine or he designed this
05:35
difference engine
05:36
in the 1820s early 30s and that was
05:39
essentially going to be a big calculator
05:41
and then he thought no no i want to do
05:43
this analytical engine
05:44
which was going to be a big computer and
05:47
kind of the difference being i think
05:48
about memory and storage
05:49
the ability to you know build on stuff
05:51
well so for instance the difference
05:52
engine could only do certain things but
05:54
the analytical engine you could program
05:56
to do lots of different things yes
05:57
um and that's where ada lovelace came in
05:59
with her ability to program
06:00
but he did all this never got made
06:02
because the government stopped funding
06:03
him because he kept not completing stuff
06:05
and essentially he had zero impact on
06:08
computing
06:09
so he's not the far he did he didn't
06:10
spawn anything because
06:12
everyone was just like well that was all
06:14
pointless it got sold for scrap or used
06:16
up a scrap
06:17
only one of the computing pioneers in
06:19
the 40s
06:20
knew about him really no one else did
06:23
and it was only in the 1970s when
06:25
they're going through his paperwork that
06:26
they actually discovered
06:27
oh yeah this babbage was sort of on to
06:29
this yeah it's something similar
06:31
it's amazing isn't it yeah he got two
06:33
the equivalent of two million dollars
06:35
from the government to make this
06:36
difference engine
06:38
and then there was a change of
06:39
government and he insisted on meeting
06:40
the new prime minister who was robert
06:42
peel
06:42
and he basically just turned up and
06:44
yelled at his face give me more money
06:47
and then peel went okay fine i'll i'll
06:49
talk to parliament and so peel went to
06:51
parliament and sort of discussed this
06:53
idea of giving him more money
06:54
and everyone just decided to make jokes
06:57
at his expense it's like oh the first
06:58
thing it's going to calculate is when it
07:00
might finally do something and stuff
07:01
like that so yeah right
07:03
sounds like it's up there with the
07:04
banter you see in the house
07:06
and then he tried to become a politician
07:08
didn't he yeah
07:09
um yeah but he couldn't get elected
07:11
because basically everyone said you just
07:13
took two million
07:14
dollars for nothing
07:17
during his speeches about this whatever
07:20
project he was doing and why he was
07:21
losing this money and it infuriated him
07:23
so much that he would abandon
07:24
whatever political speech he had just to
07:26
yell back at them going you don't
07:28
understand what i'm working on of a
07:29
genius kind of thing
07:30
to get more money he came up with this
07:32
brilliant scheme because he couldn't get
07:34
any more money from the government so he
07:35
thought what i'm going to do is i'm
07:36
going to create a computer
07:38
that can play notes and crosses and i'm
07:40
going to go around the country and play
07:41
knots and crosses against people for
07:43
money and get all their money off them
07:44
did he really yeah and then ada lovelace
07:46
said no that's a stupid idea
07:48
yeah he's extraordinary he had so many
07:50
of these little plans and
07:51
ideas that took him away from this great
07:54
big idea that he was trying to work on
07:55
there was
07:56
a crazy one i read about where he was at
07:58
the ballet and he was watching
07:59
this uh this show and he got really
08:01
bored and he thought this is just too
08:02
boring i could do better than this
08:04
so he dreamt up we all thought
08:08
he dreamt of an idea which was called
08:10
the rainbow dance
08:11
and he actually had this rehearsed he
08:13
had 60 female dancers
08:16
all represent they were dressed in white
08:17
and they represented fireflies
08:19
and they were all dancing and in the
08:21
background um there was a huge projected
08:23
hydrogen blow lamp that had color
08:25
filters on it
08:26
so he would put different colors
08:28
projected onto each of the dancers on
08:30
the stage so it would look like what he
08:31
called the rainbow dance that
08:33
sounds really cool it sounds really cool
08:35
the problem was
08:36
is that it was extremely dangerous so
08:38
when they did their first rehearsal they
08:40
had two fire engines standing by
08:42
because they were worried that the
08:43
theater would burn down and eventually
08:45
the theater owner said i'm not doing
08:46
this i'm not putting this live
08:48
flame in this theater while you try and
08:50
do this
08:51
we'll kill everyone so it was never
08:52
performed so the difference engine the
08:54
first
08:54
the first one he designed that would
08:56
have been a calculator basically
08:58
i didn't know why it was necessary to
09:00
build it
09:01
but it's so before that you just had to
09:05
use
09:05
if you were doing calculations for
09:07
various reasons you had a thing called a
09:09
ready reckoner
09:10
which was a table of basically sums that
09:12
other people had done
09:14
but they'd done them by hand and they
09:16
and
09:17
these were the early computers the
09:19
computers were the people who were
09:20
sitting in rooms doing basically boring
09:23
wage slave work with these primitive
09:24
devices
09:25
but they had loads of mistakes in them
09:27
because it was really badly paid and it
09:28
wasn't interesting work to do
09:30
okay i read this in two different places
09:31
and i can't quite believe it but
09:32
allegedly the first computers doing
09:34
these ready reckoner tables
09:36
were french hairdressers who had been
09:38
left out of work by the french
09:40
revolution
09:41
well because everyone had their head
09:42
chopped off and didn't need a haircut
09:46
or maybe like if you had long hair in
09:48
the french revolution you would just
09:50
put your head just at the edge of the
09:52
guillotine
09:53
so it would cut the long bit of your
09:55
hair off well i hope no one noticed it
09:57
was just the hair that was gone not
09:59
their head
10:00
the hair around to the crowd yeah
10:04
slink off back down the ladder so i have
10:07
no idea why these french hairdressers
10:09
were left short of work by the
10:10
revolution
10:12
it was definitely true that the french
10:14
were the best at having logarithm tables
10:16
and trig tables and stuff like that
10:19
and that was why he wanted to do this
10:22
difference engine because maybe it might
10:23
help us catch up with the french
10:25
because it gave them an advantage in
10:27
warfare because it's good for
10:30
working out which directions to go in
10:32
your ships and it's good for building
10:34
bridges and building things yeah yeah
10:36
right is it true i read somewhere
10:38
um actually no this was i remember this
10:39
was on a q a episode um
10:41
darrow breen made this point that when
10:43
he did the plans
10:44
he left sort of like mount weasels in
10:46
the plans
10:48
so that no one could build them so they
10:49
would never explain what amount was yeah
10:50
so a mount weasel is in a map
10:52
when you want to have copyright over a
10:54
map you put in a fake
10:56
town or a stop or it's just a little
10:58
detail that says anyone copies it
11:00
you know that they copied it you can
11:01
prove it by saying this place doesn't
11:03
exist we created it for our map and so
11:05
that's the same thing he put a few
11:06
mount weasels but these mount weasels
11:08
were designed to kill
11:09
the machine virus basically yes
11:14
is that just an excuse for cocking out
11:15
there it's i think
11:17
it's yeah yeah i must say if we get any
11:19
facts wrong in today's episode they are
11:21
mount wheezers
11:22
my six years of this podcast have been
11:24
mount weasels i think
11:26
a friend of mine has just written a book
11:28
about dictionaries uh it's not out yet
11:30
but
11:30
she's called ellie williams and it's a
11:31
book about it's about mount weasels
11:32
basically
11:33
and apparently i think one of the first
11:35
ever mount weasels
11:36
was someone in an encyclopedia it was an
11:38
entry about miss
11:40
somebody mount weasel oh is that where
11:42
it comes from yeah and she was
11:44
uh a sort of she was an intrepid
11:46
pioneering journalist she used to have
11:48
sex with weasels
11:49
that's right she did yeah and what was
11:52
that was the clue and in the original
11:55
encyclopedia biography i'm going off
11:57
memory so it's slightly wrong but it's
11:58
something like she was killed
12:00
by um an explosion when she was working
12:03
for
12:03
shrapnel magazine or something they made
12:06
up this really fun fake biography for
12:08
her
12:08
but talking about uh viruses and bugs it
12:10
would really be if we're talking about
12:12
actual computer viruses kind of the ada
12:14
lovelace department that was responsible
12:16
for those because she
12:17
joined him essentially didn't she so she
12:19
was byron's daughter and she
12:20
her coming out ceremony she when she was
12:23
18 or whatever she
12:24
met uh coming out had a different
12:26
meaning in those days it had a different
12:27
meaning yes
12:28
what's the meaning i i actually took it
12:30
to be no no
12:31
so people when they sort of came of age
12:33
young ladies they could be presented in
12:35
society posh young ladies
12:37
and it was basically saying my ladies my
12:39
daughter's on the market now
12:40
have your you know have a go and so if
12:43
you think you're harder though
12:48
yeah anyway she bumped into charles
12:50
babbage
12:51
who was impressed joined him wrote loads
12:53
of code for his engine
12:55
so i was reading a blog by a coder a
12:57
modern day code he wrote this a couple
12:58
of years ago
12:59
and he actually ran her code it was a
13:01
code for working out
13:02
bernoulli numbers and he ran her code
13:05
through his computer
13:06
and it didn't work and he went back
13:08
through her code
13:09
and i had a bug in it what's a bowie
13:11
knee number oh god don't know
13:13
don't ask that you know what uh i was
13:15
really good i thought
13:16
you know what i'll just have a really
13:18
simple way of explaining the new enough
13:19
things yeah
13:20
and i started looking into it and boy is
13:22
it complicated yeah
13:23
cool oh my days it's about number theory
13:26
and
13:26
um powers of numbers and adding them all
13:29
together
13:29
and them having certain relationships
13:32
between each other
13:33
okay sounds hot it's yeah
13:37
it's sexy stuff but yeah so that's the
13:39
first ever bug how cool has that been
13:41
for that coder who found the first ever
13:42
computer
13:43
that's amazing i know one of us he
13:47
might have struggled to get along with
13:49
ooh
13:50
based on something a line in his
13:51
biography who babbage yeah
13:53
okay did he hate men with beards
13:57
no remember you're looking at me
14:00
sorry sorry sorry glasses it's no
14:02
glasses did he hate northerners
14:04
he hated puns sorry guys
14:06
[Music]
14:08
he wrote that puns are detestable
14:10
because they just rely on
14:12
one word sounding like another word he
14:14
would have hated the babbage cabbage
14:15
joke at the top of the show
14:18
oh the best thing about babbage which is
14:20
always comes up with qi research
14:22
is how much he hated noise yes it's
14:25
so good like he just he was just so anti
14:30
any noise in london whatsoever and that
14:33
he had made
14:33
lists of whenever there was any noise
14:35
that put him off his work
14:37
he detailed 165 interruptions that he
14:40
suffered over 80 days
14:42
he made a list of encouragers of street
14:44
music
14:45
which included tavern keepers public
14:47
houses gin shops
14:49
children visitors to the city from the
14:52
country
14:54
and then basically his neighbors hated
14:56
him so much that they just started
14:58
playing tin whistles out of his outside
14:59
of his house and stuff like that
15:01
yeah i mean it sounds london sounds
15:03
horrific back then and he had
15:05
had it in especially for organ grinders
15:08
he said there are a thousand of them
15:10
and he was a bit xenophobic about it he
15:11
said they're all italian organ grinders
15:13
who've come over here to destroy the
15:14
peace
15:15
um and he spent all this money on
15:17
lawyers he went to the home secretary
15:19
and he got the law changed yeah he
15:21
actually campaigned for and won a change
15:23
in the law
15:23
he was the nigel farage of the early
15:26
19th century i don't think we could
15:28
change
15:28
that we can't go that far
15:30
[Laughter]
15:35
it's not a big leap yeah so like and
15:37
like i said people would like
15:39
tease him because they hated him about
15:40
them just him always saying turn it down
15:42
turn it down
15:43
and so at one stage there was a brass
15:45
band that played outside of his house
15:47
for five
15:47
hours and children would follow him down
15:50
the street making loads of noise
15:52
and he said um he was quoted as saying
15:54
in one case there were certainly above
15:56
100 persons
15:58
consisting of men women and boys with
16:00
multitudes of young children who
16:02
followed me through the streets
16:03
before i could find the
16:07
followed by a police people making a
16:08
load of noise he's like the opposite of
16:10
the pied piper family
16:13
he's not playing an instrument everyone
16:15
else playing instruments at him
16:16
as they chase him down the street wow oh
16:20
my god
16:20
he also believed in ghosts so he started
16:22
a ghost club at university
16:24
to prove their existence and the other
16:26
club that he set up with the same
16:28
sort of group of friends was the
16:29
extractors club and the extractors club
16:31
was dedicated
16:36
he wouldn't look like that
16:37
[Laughter]
16:42
yeah the idea was that they were
16:43
dedicated to liberating any one of their
16:45
members from a mad house
16:46
should they be committed yeah why is
16:50
that
16:50
i guess they were coming up with so many
16:52
odd ideas trying to summon the devil
16:54
maybe it wasn't funny yeah
16:55
so just quickly back on the relationship
16:57
with ada lovelace
16:59
um so she um was obviously very famous
17:02
at the time and very high in society
17:04
and he was an inventor who was obviously
17:07
a bit of a genius
17:08
but was not very good at completing his
17:11
inventions
17:12
and so she decided to write him a letter
17:14
saying that i would like
17:15
to kind of go into partnership with you
17:18
and i'll make sure that you get
17:19
everything done
17:21
but you just have to do it basically and
17:24
she wrote to one of her friends if he
17:25
does consent to what i propose i shall
17:27
probably be unable to keep him out of
17:29
much hot water
17:30
and bring his engine to consummation
17:33
um i shall be talking so dirty
17:37
she said i will be willing to be his
17:39
whipper in during the next three years
17:42
if i see fair prospects of success and
17:44
she gave him all these lists of
17:46
conditions that he would have to do if
17:48
they were going to go into partnership
17:50
and then babbage read her letter and
17:53
then wrote his own notes on that saying
17:55
saw aal this morning and refused all the
17:58
conditions
18:04
okay it is time for fact number two and
18:07
that is
18:08
james okay my fact this week is that the
18:11
manchester tree
18:12
is so toxic that if you park under it
18:15
and it rains
18:16
the drips from the branches can strip
18:18
the paint from your car
18:22
so this is a tree um you get it in the
18:24
caribbean
18:25
i have seen it i have to say when i was
18:27
in st vincent
18:28
and the grenadines and when you see it
18:31
there's always
18:32
um all the ones i saw there was a big
18:34
red mark on it saying don't go near this
18:36
tree
18:36
and a sign saying don't whatever you do
18:38
don't go near this tree although
18:40
it was in quite small fonts you had to
18:42
get quite close to the tree in order to
18:43
read it
18:44
but this is probably the most poisonous
18:46
tree on earth
18:48
and it says so in the guinness book of
18:49
records that it's the most poisonous
18:51
tree
18:51
and everything about it is poisonous so
18:54
if you eat the fruit
18:55
it's terrible if you burn it and breathe
18:57
in some of the smoke it's terrible
18:59
and it has this chemical called four
19:01
bowl
19:02
and it's very water-soluble so if water
19:04
goes onto it the chemical can get into
19:06
there and it will drip on you
19:07
and it can cause terrible um rashes on
19:10
your skin and it's so strong apparently
19:12
it can
19:13
rip the paint from your car it's
19:15
extraordinary
19:16
yeah it's so cool although lots of them
19:19
in florida are painted with a big
19:20
x which to me looks like the treasure
19:24
[Laughter]
19:26
so i would be tempted to go there and
19:28
spend ages digging around
19:30
eating the roots probably the obvious
19:33
thing would be get rid of them right
19:34
that sounds like why don't you just chop
19:36
them down but apparently they
19:38
choose not to purely out of um they help
19:40
with erosion from the coast as it's
19:42
coming in it's
19:43
very good for protecting other trees um
19:45
also i don't think we
19:46
just destroy every bit of nature that's
19:48
dangerous to us yes we do
19:51
so i mostly got interested in this
19:53
because i saw this
19:54
article in the bmj from a few years ago
19:56
called eating a manchineal beach apple
19:59
by nicola h strickland who is a
20:01
consultant radiologist
20:03
and she and a friend were holidaying in
20:06
the caribbean
20:07
and they saw a piece of fruit on the
20:09
floor and thought oh that looks nice
20:11
and then decided to eat it she sounds
20:13
like a woman after my own heart
20:14
[Laughter]
20:17
and so they at this stuff and got
20:19
extremely
20:20
extremely sick but luckily she's a
20:22
scientist so she could write it up
20:24
about what happened she said it was
20:26
incredibly painful she could hardly
20:28
swallow
20:29
the pain was exacerbated by most
20:30
alcoholic beverages
20:34
i love the way that she's tried all the
20:35
different garlic beverages
20:37
um although it was mildly appeased by
20:39
pina coladas
20:41
and so if you ever do have one of these
20:43
then have some pina coladas and that'll
20:44
make you feel a bit better
20:46
if you like that's the song isn't it if
20:47
you like pina coladas and getting caught
20:49
in the rain
20:50
don't park under the manchester tree
20:53
it's it's also it's a uh it could it was
20:56
used as a useful thing for indigenous
20:58
people who were living
20:58
say in florida at the time where the
21:00
tree is um there's a story it's a bit of
21:02
a myth of a story
21:03
um but it's one of those ones that sits
21:06
50 50 on
21:07
the side of we're not quite sure if it's
21:08
true or not uh there was a guy called
21:10
juan ponce de leon
21:12
who was an explorer and he tried to
21:13
colonize a specific bit of florida he
21:15
was initially it was said legendary
21:17
looking for the fountain of youth which
21:18
was said to be in florida
21:20
um so he returned there after a few
21:22
trips and he brought 200 people he had
21:24
priests and farmers and artisans and 50
21:26
horses and so on
21:27
and he wanted to properly colonize this
21:29
place and they were attacked by the
21:32
local
21:32
um people who wanted them to go away and
21:35
what they would do is they would dip the
21:36
tips of the arrows
21:37
in the machanil sap and fire at them so
21:40
even if it sort of pierced them just a
21:41
bit it would go inside and
21:43
and give them a poisoning and and
21:44
supposedly that is how this leader
21:46
um ponce de leon died um he took an
21:49
arrow to the thigh
21:51
and they retreated so they actually it
21:53
worked we need some pina coladas over
21:55
here now
21:56
i read that that was just a a slight
21:59
attempt later to slander him saying he
22:00
was looking for the fountain of youth
22:02
because basically saying this guy is an
22:03
idiot
22:03
right yeah some lots of sources say
22:08
it i mean what he was definitely
22:09
searching for was an island called
22:10
bimini and the king of spain had granted
22:13
it to him but he hadn't said where it
22:14
was
22:15
i don't know i don't know how this came
22:17
about basically
22:19
king of spain said you can have it if
22:20
you can find it
22:22
so he was he was definitely colonizing
22:25
florida at this point yeah
22:26
what an easy trip for a king or queen oh
22:30
you can have bibbily bobby
22:33
that's my debt paid off i'd say it's
22:35
going excellent mount weasel sir
22:40
yeah apparently as well it would aid
22:41
people who sort of uh were
22:43
shipwrecked sailors for example if they
22:45
didn't want to die a gruesome death they
22:46
would know just eat that and
22:48
end your life early it was sort of used
22:50
as a suicide assistance
22:51
as well again these are reports from
22:53
from the annals of history can't be sure
22:55
if they're true
22:56
you could rub yourself all over with
22:58
lime juice apparently to stop the toxin
23:00
corroding your skin
23:01
this is based on an account i read in
23:02
1821 and so
23:04
i maybe check the updated medical advice
23:06
but that's what the local carib people
23:08
used to do so they'd um
23:10
sort of cut their trees down and they
23:11
wouldn't really be wearing clothes but
23:12
they would cover themselves head-to-toe
23:14
lime juice which i think there's a lot
23:15
of limes
23:16
that is a lot of flavor to cover it a
23:18
whole human body yeah
23:19
they're small aren't they limes are
23:21
small yes yeah compared to human bodies
23:23
yeah they're much much smaller are they
23:26
using fishing
23:27
because you can drop the poison into a
23:30
sort of pond
23:31
or a lake and all the fish just sort of
23:32
go belly up floats
23:34
yeah but i'm not so again this was in
23:37
this account but it seems very risky to
23:39
then consume the fish that have
23:40
consumed this highly yeah because it
23:43
might be concentrated in a bit of them
23:45
you would have thought yeah although
23:47
fish is often served with a little bit
23:48
of lemon so if you coat all your fish in
23:50
the lemon maybe it's a very savory
23:52
maybe that's why it's made into
23:54
furniture as well isn't it
23:56
or what you're kidding yeah so so they
23:59
use the tree but so they they have a
24:00
special
24:01
way of um removing any poison elements
24:04
okay but yeah so
24:05
but yeah if you dry it out so there you
24:07
go light fire all around it before
24:09
cutting it down before harvesting it
24:11
yeah it just dries it all out and then
24:12
you can cut it down
24:13
relatively safely you have to wear a big
24:15
mask interesting way of potentially
24:16
killing someone
24:18
because it would just look like a normal
24:19
bit of furniture you know have a seat
24:22
they have a seat yeah they'd have to sit
24:23
down with a bare bottom though wouldn't
24:25
they
24:26
that's how i could not tell my music
24:28
thank you for coming in trousers off
24:29
thank you
24:30
have a seat have you heard of the
24:32
man-eating trees of madagascar
24:34
so these were written about first in
24:36
1874 in the
24:38
newspaper the new york world which was
24:40
quite an unreliable
24:42
newspaper partly because it published
24:43
this account about the man eating trees
24:45
in madagascar
24:46
and it describes this uh human sacrifice
24:49
done by a tribe called the
24:50
kodo tribe who took a woman to this tree
24:53
and they
24:54
they leave her by it for a bit they put
24:56
her on it and then it its branches all
24:57
coil round and devour her
25:00
and this is complete yellow journalism
25:02
hoax stuff it's not real at all
25:03
obviously
25:04
but a book was written a couple of years
25:06
later called madagascar
25:07
land of the man eating tree and in it i
25:10
just really like this
25:12
author kind of using the story but then
25:14
disassociating himself from it he said
25:16
i do not know whether this tigerish tree
25:19
really exists
25:20
or whether the blood-curdling stories
25:21
about it are pure myth it is enough for
25:23
my purpose if its story focuses your
25:25
interest on one of the least known spots
25:26
of the world
25:27
it's such baloney wow he's just saying
25:30
it's not true despite the fact it's the
25:31
title of his book
25:33
yeah yeah this is so meta that you're
25:35
now then repeating
25:37
yeah fake thing with the same
25:38
fascination i get people interested in
25:40
madagascar that's all i'm interested in
25:43
wait what's the title of his book it's
25:44
not the man eating tree of madagascar
25:46
yes is madagascar land of the man eating
25:48
tree
25:49
i actually i'm on his side i reckon a
25:52
few more people visited boosted the
25:53
tourist industry back in when was it he
25:55
was writing
25:56
the 1870s boosted madagascar's tourism
25:58
between the 1870s
26:00
yeah because there's so much there's
26:01
like a butling zone now
26:04
actually can i just can i just mention
26:06
one more dangerous tree yes please
26:08
so there's one more dangerous tree uh
26:10
that's probably the most well-known tree
26:12
for being dangerous
26:13
and that is dangerous because it
26:17
knocks you on the head coconut coconut
26:19
the coconut tree
26:21
do you know why the coconut tree has
26:22
quite a bad reputation
26:24
so people say like in in gales people
26:26
sort of flock inside because they're
26:27
going to get knocked unconscious by it
26:28
and
26:29
loads you know there's that fact about
26:31
yeah i thought there was like
26:32
in papua new guinea like 10 of the
26:35
people who were in a
26:36
had been hit by so
26:39
this is all the fault of sharks
26:42
because uh so um who i think um
26:45
straight dope and um snopes looked into
26:48
this
26:49
but there was the myth that increased
26:51
like rocketed after 2002
26:52
and it was propagated by this shark
26:54
expert who did that famous comparison
26:56
that said falling coconuts killed 10
26:58
times more people
26:59
or 15 times more people than sharks do
27:02
trying to say look sharks aren't that
27:03
dangerous
27:04
fair enough but he was basing that on a
27:06
nonsense made up study by an insurance
27:08
company
27:09
holiday insurance company that was
27:11
saying 150 people a year are killed by
27:13
coconuts
27:14
and it was actually based on two
27:15
anecdotal potential deaths by one
27:18
traveler and then coconuts have this
27:19
terrible reputation
27:21
do they are you telling me that all that
27:23
coconut insurance i bought it's
27:25
completely pointless
27:26
i'm so sorry i'm going to take my
27:27
coconut helmet back to the shop tomorrow
27:31
just saving you all a bit of hassle yeah
27:34
well there's something so queensland you
27:35
remember in australia queensland removed
27:37
all its coconut trees from beaches in
27:39
2002.
27:40
because of the danger posed see i told
27:42
you
27:43
people do that for dangerous trees they
27:45
do you're right
27:47
it's not just me but i am australian so
27:48
maybe it's australians i would genuinely
27:50
just give people helmets which have a
27:52
massive
27:53
uh blade like an axe blade on top that
27:56
way
27:57
you just get two coconut halves and
27:58
you're fine does it not
28:00
maybe make the whole of the earth a
28:02
little bit more dangerous if everyone's
28:04
walking around with blades on their
28:05
heads
28:07
maybe what you take with one hand you
28:10
give away with the other
28:13
yeah coconut deaths would drop but i
28:14
think axe helmet
28:17
would rise a bit yes
28:22
okay it is time for fact number three
28:24
and that is
28:25
anna my fact this week is that cryonic
28:28
freezing chambers
28:29
are built to store up to four bodies and
28:32
five heads wait a minute
28:37
so that means there's something not
28:39
quite added up here this is like a
28:41
future game show right
28:42
where they battle out five heads for the
28:44
four bodies who's going to be placed on
28:45
that that's it yeah
28:46
what do you mean like musical chairs
28:48
yeah the last remaining head is out of
28:50
the game
28:51
it's much like that how does that work
28:53
well it's this i will say
28:55
at the top is a very morbid fact um but
28:58
basically you can get chronically frozen
29:00
a few hundred people have done it so far
29:03
and you've got two options you can go
29:04
whole body head to toe
29:06
or you can do just head and it's
29:08
actually a bit cheaper to do just the
29:09
head so
29:10
yeah it's that much cheaper though it's
29:12
not enough cheaper is it you're right
29:14
i would i mean so full body or one
29:17
i got full body cost two hundred and
29:19
fifteen thousand dollars from
29:20
the source i was on i've actually got a
29:22
better deal oh okay
29:24
two hundred thousand but okay okay and
29:25
then the one and then head is ninety
29:27
five thousand dollars but that's
29:28
half as much now the head is the bit i
29:30
would want to keep but
29:32
i think you should pay a quarter as much
29:34
you're storing so much less you're
29:35
getting
29:35
something way more important though it's
29:37
about demand isn't it andy it's not
29:39
about space
29:40
yeah come on mate well you're using less
29:41
dry ice i just think there should be
29:42
better deals
29:44
well i agree i think maybe when demand
29:45
does go up maybe the price will come
29:47
down
29:48
but yeah at the moment you can do either
29:50
and also another weird thing about the
29:51
storage is uh everyone's upside down
29:54
which is truly bizarre so you've got all
29:56
these bodies in a tank
29:58
and they're still with their heads at
29:59
the bottom and apparently that's because
30:01
if there's some sort of an error
30:02
there's some sort of a leakage and the
30:04
body starts to thaw
30:05
it'll come from the top and then the
30:07
feet will thaw first because you don't
30:08
want your head
30:10
thawing first because as andy said
30:11
that's for some of us is the bit that we
30:13
like the most
30:15
this is only in the russian one isn't it
30:16
no they're all those they're all
30:18
upside down yeah yeah and the russian
30:20
one is the cheaper one by the way okay
30:22
maybe the one that you have a good deal
30:23
at anna is that right um what was your
30:25
prices
30:26
my price was 200 grand that was alcor in
30:28
america but the russian one does do a
30:29
bit more budget
30:30
the russian one is thirty six thousand
30:33
dollars
30:34
for full body and 18 000 for just the
30:36
head
30:37
so it's a lot cheaper oh my god um but
30:40
the bad thing about it
30:41
is you don't have your own fridge you
30:43
have to share fridges with
30:44
other people and sometimes with um like
30:47
pets
30:48
and things yeah i think i read that it's
30:50
unbelievable
30:52
so you're not you're you're not in a
30:53
separate this is creo russ is the name
30:55
of the firm isn't it yeah like toys r us
30:57
yeah yeah yeah well and actually because
31:00
it's russian the r will be backwards
31:05
um but you're not even so you're not
31:07
only not in a separate chamber you're
31:08
just in this place in a sleeping bag
31:10
apparently
31:10
yeah you're just upside down in a
31:12
sleeping bag with some dog next to your
31:13
head
31:14
it's the same in the american ones
31:16
completely except there are just more
31:18
people in the russian ones so you do
31:19
have to share with a few people okay
31:21
yeah it's more like
31:22
you know yeah like i think you've got
31:23
your own tube basically
31:25
in the american ones oh i thought the
31:27
american one was in i think it's in the
31:28
tube that you have the full bodies
31:31
and they do even for the heads they put
31:33
that in its own special sleeping bag
31:34
i just quite like that it's a sleeping
31:36
bag it's going in
31:38
so nice um yeah and it's because they
31:40
they sort of say that to reanimate the
31:42
body is
31:43
going to be a lot harder like with the
31:44
theories of you know why just
31:46
use your head as opposed to the full
31:48
body that's one of the things they say
31:50
you know we'll probably grow you a new
31:51
body is what they say or we'll 3d print
31:53
you a new body you know who knows what
31:54
the technology will be
31:55
that's not the worrying bit you could be
31:57
a robot
31:58
you can say any bollocks to people
32:00
who've just given you 200 grand and are
32:01
going in your freezer i mean
32:03
yeah i think because we are saying this
32:06
is pseudoscience right is that what
32:07
we're saying
32:08
i don't well so i kind of agree with
32:11
there's one scientist so i was reading
32:14
an article by one scientist online
32:15
who i agree with who was saying
32:17
essentially it's not
32:18
pseudoscience it's like science is on
32:20
very unproven at the moment and there is
32:22
evidence that you can reanimate certain
32:24
animals but
32:24
it's extremely unlikely we'll be able to
32:26
reanimate ourselves but on the other
32:28
hand
32:28
even if there's only a one percent
32:30
chance you know
32:32
why not take it well one reason you
32:34
might come back to life
32:36
forever yeah i mean it seems like it's
32:38
worth doing
32:39
well not forever just a bit further down
32:40
the line for a bit more time
32:43
that's assuming immortality has been
32:44
cracked i think that's two things that
32:46
have been shoved together that are
32:47
quite quite right that's the 0.5 chance
32:50
we've got the elixir of life
32:51
and we're able to reanimate if they can
32:53
do it they can just do it again can't
32:54
they
32:54
you know if they can reanimate the dead
32:57
i'm with ponce de leon over there
33:01
um the big problem uh which neurologists
33:05
say
33:05
is basically your brain can't survive
33:07
this kind of thing
33:08
yeah and even if you could somehow bring
33:10
your body back to life
33:12
you would be very likely to be severely
33:14
brain damaged
33:15
yeah the the the brain is designed to
33:18
keep out
33:19
uh other liquids and stuff there's a
33:21
blood-brain barrier which
33:22
is meant to keep your brain separate and
33:24
so you would have to pump the
33:26
antifreeze basically so vigorously into
33:28
the brain
33:29
that uh it might be it might really
33:31
damage the yeah
33:32
yes yeah um there is a british outfit
33:35
devoted to
33:36
cryonics so there are only a few kronos
33:38
chambers in the world there are a couple
33:39
in america one in russia
33:40
but there there is in the uk a cryonics
33:43
ambulance
33:45
and the financial times interviewed a
33:47
guy called tim gibson
33:48
who is a member of the british cryonics
33:51
society basically
33:52
and they do all the medical procedures
33:54
to cool you down
33:56
and stabilize you and then they'll send
33:58
you to the usa
34:00
and um there are 40 people on the list
34:03
who might ring up at any time and say
34:05
i'm dying can you come and get me um
34:08
and they give you you know they give you
34:09
all the drugs and then they replace the
34:10
blood with antifreeze
34:12
we should probably say why they replace
34:13
it with antifreeze because when you
34:15
because when you
34:15
you're cryonically frozen you're not you
34:17
don't actually have any ice
34:19
in your body because that'd be really
34:21
bad your body is huge proportion of it
34:22
is water
34:23
and if you actually frozen it turned to
34:24
ice then it would expand and all your
34:26
cells would explode
34:27
so you have to replace all the blood you
34:29
have to pump the body full of antifreeze
34:31
to stop
34:31
the water actually turning to ice so i
34:33
think people think that you're becoming
34:34
kind of ice
34:35
but yes they've become the opposite we
34:37
have we have austin powers
34:39
um images in our head i think for
34:40
cryogenics right yeah
34:42
it's it's yeah demolition man so um this
34:45
thing about having this ambulance come
34:47
they they try to get there quite quick
34:48
because obviously once you pass away
34:51
well no no
34:51
it's all to do with preserving the
34:52
bodies straight away right so um part of
34:54
this russian company the um
34:56
cryo rs uh company um
35:00
they offer vip package deals
35:03
do they yeah and so at the base level
35:05
what they do is they give you a fitbit
35:06
style wristband
35:08
um and that will learn an alert that
35:10
will alert a nearby team so when they
35:11
see it sort of flatline
35:12
they'll go quick let's get to them asap
35:15
well if your batteries just run out yeah
35:17
i have an apple watch right and the
35:19
battery runs out all the time
35:20
that's true and if every time that
35:22
happens suddenly a crack squad of
35:25
ambulance then turn up control and try
35:27
to cut your head off
35:30
it is it's the only ambulance which
35:32
turns up hoping that you'll be dead
35:35
yes if you're fine then they have to go
35:37
away again yeah that's really
35:39
they would have to wait outside with the
35:40
other ambulance crew who are trying to
35:41
keep you alive
35:42
and then have an argument
35:46
um so the father of chronics is a guy
35:48
called robert ettinger
35:49
and um he is preserved at the moment in
35:53
one of these places
35:54
as are his late mother and also his
35:56
first and second wives
35:58
god that's going to cause problems i
35:59
just i just read that um what a
36:01
brilliant sitcom that is in the making
36:03
right
36:05
are they do you think they're all in the
36:06
same tube because that's four people
36:08
that's a full person yeah some
36:10
stranger's
36:11
[Laughter]
36:15
no once you learn that that's the
36:16
dynamic you're like i'll pay to go in
36:18
that one
36:19
i want to see that when i wake up first
36:21
wife going oh and who's this lovely lady
36:26
um so this this all is quite far-fetched
36:29
obviously this kind of cryonic freezing
36:31
and actually dan you said cryogenic
36:33
earlier but just to
36:34
be clear cryogenics is actually the
36:37
science of getting stuff to really
36:39
really really low temperatures
36:40
is not to do with cryonics and this is
36:42
made very clear on the
36:44
official cryogenics website of the
36:46
united states which is basically the
36:48
website which serves anyone who's
36:49
interested in that scientist who are
36:50
interested in that
36:51
basically on their front page they're
36:52
like we are not about freezing bodies
36:55
and hoping to reanimate them after death
36:57
we did not believe this is a real thing
36:58
if you want to do that look up cryonics
37:00
please leave our website
37:02
so that's people always confuse those
37:03
things um but it's quite far-fetched
37:06
but what we can do is reanimate uh
37:09
people
37:09
very temporarily now and this is this is
37:12
really really exciting
37:13
just happened it's so it's basically
37:16
about if you're in a traumatic accident
37:19
and it's extremely unlikely that you're
37:21
going to be able to be saved in the time
37:22
that you've got
37:23
then they can sort of put you on hold
37:26
for a few hours and this is really early
37:27
days there hasn't been the study
37:28
published but
37:30
at the university of maryland school of
37:32
medicine in november last year
37:34
they've placed at least one patient in
37:36
suspended animation
37:37
and so what they do is they come in
37:38
they've had a trauma they've been shot
37:40
or stabbed
37:40
they have a big cardiac arrest they've
37:42
lost loads of blood they're not going to
37:44
survive if you only have you know
37:45
five minutes to operate on them so you
37:47
cool their body
37:49
to 10 to 15 degrees celsius which is
37:51
obviously
37:52
much colder than the human body is
37:54
supposed to go
37:55
by replacing all of their blood with ice
37:57
cold saline solution
37:59
and so their brain almost completely
38:00
stops they've done this for a few hours
38:02
and then you have two hours to actually
38:04
operate on them and save their lives
38:06
wow and then you replace their blood and
38:08
they come back
38:09
and they are clinically dead for that
38:10
period of time for two hours clinically
38:12
dead wow is that amazing it is amazing
38:15
it's not much of an episode of austin
38:17
powers is it when you come back after
38:18
two hours
38:20
the fashions are gonna be kind of
38:22
similar than when you left
38:23
so many dated references
38:27
but that's that so we've learned how to
38:28
press pause on life
38:30
basically it looks like it yeah again it
38:33
hasn't been published yet they're sort
38:34
of like drip dropping all these hints
38:36
that it's very exciting
38:37
but they should be known by the end of
38:38
the year that's extraordinary
38:41
um i have another freezing thing
38:44
okay yeah um so
38:47
reader's digest magazine just suggested
38:49
various methods to deal with hemorrhoids
38:52
they suggested 10 top 10 methods deal
38:53
with hemorrhoids one of them was putting
38:54
a warm tea bag
38:56
against your bottom and one of them was
38:58
grating a raw potato making a kind of
38:59
potato poultice
39:01
okay and then off the back of this there
39:03
are lots of other websites which
39:04
recommended putting a frozen wedge of
39:06
potato
39:07
into your bottom for
39:10
30 seconds and then for a minute and
39:12
then for one minute
39:13
and so on um like a chip a frozen chip
39:15
no like a potato wedge
39:17
but that's like a thick chip a wedge is
39:20
sorry i can't believe that this is the
39:22
debate we're having
39:22
[Laughter]
39:25
a wedge is different to a chip yeah it's
39:26
different a chip would be a cuboid
39:28
whereas a wedge would have a curved
39:30
end and a sharp end yeah it's shaped
39:32
like a wedge it's like shaped like a
39:34
door wedge
39:34
do you think the shape is important
39:35
probably is isn't it because you know
39:36
you have a sharp end in first
39:38
i think if you're going to put anything
39:39
up your bum the shape is important
39:43
you will want to put the thin end of the
39:45
wedge that's where we get the braids
39:47
from
39:49
you don't don't start with the big end
39:50
of the wedge no you want a nightmare
39:52
waiting to happen
39:53
anyway doctors recommend not to do this
39:55
because it doesn't work
39:57
you should end up ruining a perfectly
39:59
good potato
40:01
that's the second fact you've had today
40:02
where there's been a very long
40:04
explanation of an amazing fact
40:06
with the cafe at the end but this isn't
40:08
true what was the first one
40:10
the madagascar trees have you not read
40:13
andy's autobiography i shove frozen
40:15
potatoes at my bum
40:17
page one i don't actually do that okay
40:24
it's time for our final fact of the show
40:26
and that is
40:27
andy okay my fact is that if hamlet had
40:30
wanted to buy a lemon
40:31
it would have cost him 700 euros okay
40:34
this sounds like another one of your
40:35
facts from this round
40:39
um now the hamlet i'm referring to
40:42
is contemporary with shakespeare so it's
40:45
if hamlet
40:46
had been alive when shakespeare wrote
40:47
the play because hamlet's based on an
40:49
older story
40:50
several hundred years before that so i'm
40:51
talking about the late 16th century
40:53
yep if hamlet had been alive in the late
40:56
16th century yes
40:57
uh and real yeah and he'd he'd be at
41:00
home in elsinore castle which is real
41:02
that's good news that's that's
41:04
one part it would have cost him 700
41:07
euros well did they have euros
41:08
they would have cost him the local
41:10
equivalent of 700 euros
41:13
so you've decided when there was a very
41:15
famous real man
41:16
available for this fact shakespeare yep
41:19
you decided to go for a fake man okay if
41:21
shakespeare had wanted to buy a lemon
41:23
when he was on his research trip to
41:25
elsinore
41:26
it would have cost him the local
41:27
equivalent at the time yeah of 700 euros
41:30
except he never went to elsinore so
41:32
that's another
41:32
fact is that lemons used to be expensive
41:34
that's why you said the word
41:36
if at the start yes oh okay so in fact
41:38
all of these things are completely
41:40
sorted by that one word
41:43
let's do that with more of our facts and
41:45
it's a lot easier
41:48
um yeah so the fact is lemons are cheap
41:51
now is basically the fact but they
41:53
were expensive then they were expensive
41:54
then and they both are true um the price
41:56
of lemons has changed i think it's the
41:57
one thing we can all agree on
42:00
sorry i should have made that my back
42:01
shouldn't i that's one thing that is
42:03
definitely true
42:04
what have you got any sort of further
42:06
explanation
42:07
you know why were they so expensive were
42:09
they gold-plated back then
42:11
um so obviously lemons uh are more of a
42:14
tropical
42:15
uh fruit and i the other thing i didn't
42:17
know when researching this is that
42:18
lemons
42:19
uh you didn't get to europe for a really
42:22
long time
42:23
yeah and in fact the the part of the
42:26
reason
42:26
was that they are man-made humans
42:29
invented lemons wow
42:31
they're cross-bred uh between a citron
42:34
which is a himalayan fruit which is
42:36
large
42:36
and not very juicy and then another kind
42:38
of sour orange and we're not
42:40
i think sure exactly what the other
42:42
ingredient is but we know that it is a
42:44
hybrid
42:45
is it was it definitely not a natural
42:46
hybrid it was definitely manufactured
42:48
man-made
42:49
so i thought they were they're very good
42:50
at hybridizing aren't they a citrus
42:52
plant yes they are
42:53
i don't think we've got the records of
42:54
whether it was man-made or natural
42:55
because i think some of them naturally
42:56
met each other yeah
42:58
yeah they were all the hybrids weren't
43:00
man-made okay but all citrus goes back
43:01
to these three
43:02
uh super citrus fruits isn't it so weird
43:05
yeah
43:05
yeah so anyway they started in northern
43:08
china or
43:08
india or pakistan north east india or
43:10
pakistan we're not sure where and then
43:12
by the fourth century bc they were in
43:13
rome but they were still
43:14
obviously very expensive and especially
43:16
in northern europe
43:17
i.e denmark which is where elsinore
43:20
castle
43:20
is i found out how much they cost in the
43:24
in britain around a similar time-ish so
43:27
henry viii has his privy purse so you
43:30
can see everything that he spent his
43:31
money on
43:32
and at one stage to james hobart for
43:35
bringing oranges and lemons to the king
43:37
at hartford
43:38
he paid 20 shillings now i don't know
43:41
how many oranges and or lemons there
43:44
but he went to hartford castle as almost
43:47
a bit like a holiday home kind of thing
43:49
so he wouldn't have been there for the
43:50
whole time so it would have been for a
43:52
shortish amount of time he would have
43:53
been eating these oranges and lemons
43:55
so maybe not so many of them um and
43:58
other things that were worth 20
44:00
shillings around the same time so i
44:01
could work out what 20 shillings was
44:05
to arthur the looter for a loot for the
44:08
duke of richmond
44:09
so if you wanted to buy a loot the
44:10
musical instruments
44:12
not the magazine for buying used cars um
44:15
then that was 20 shillings what a very
44:17
useful point of comparison for all of us
44:19
yeah
44:19
because my loots i know how much they
44:21
cost me so that was very helpful yeah i
44:23
wanted to buy a citron
44:25
in loot
44:27
[Music]
44:28
very good that's that's the joke i think
44:31
that charles babbage would have hated
44:32
most of all
44:34
this whole show um he paid anthony
44:37
ansley
44:38
20 shillings for playing him three days
44:40
at tennis
44:42
wow and twenty shillings would also buy
44:45
him a brace of greyhounds
44:47
and a wig for his fool
44:51
so these are all the equivalent of
44:52
getting a certain amount of oranges and
44:54
lemons is about
44:55
an undisclosed quantity yeah
44:58
sounds like they were cheaper we can
44:59
broadly say they were cheaper it feels
45:01
like they were cheaper here than they
45:02
were
45:03
yeah and that was earlier so i should
45:05
say where the fact is from which is from
45:07
the guide
45:07
to cronborg castle and cromborg is the
45:10
castle that
45:11
was fictionalized as elsinore in uh in
45:14
hamlet
45:14
so we went to copenhagen last year and i
45:17
bought the guidebook
45:18
and then i waited seven months to read
45:20
it and then i read the section
45:23
um in the middle of the 17th century 51
45:26
of dutch paintings contained a lemon
45:29
really yeah
45:30
sorry in the middle of which century
45:31
17th wow that was a big one for dutch
45:34
painting as well wasn't it it was the
45:36
biggest yeah
45:37
which is weird because lemons i would
45:38
have thought are very easy to draw and
45:40
if i were
45:40
a renaissance great i would challenge
45:42
myself with something more like a
45:43
pineapple well they weren't of lemons
45:44
they just contained lemons somewhere in
45:46
them
45:46
it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't like a
45:48
paint the fruit contest
45:50
i don't know how familiar we are with
45:51
dutch masters but they tend not to just
45:52
be of one lemon
45:55
lemon and the big apple one next to it
45:57
and the bananas the crown and
45:59
yeah but i think they're a state the big
46:01
status symbol and they were in fact they
46:03
were ornamental mostly
46:04
you wouldn't you wouldn't eat them yeah
46:05
because they were so hard to get and if
46:07
you did eat them
46:08
you initially would eat them with the
46:10
skin on apparently
46:12
and stay with oranges yeah but then
46:14
actually i was reading a little
46:16
cooking blog in the guardian by the chef
46:18
tom hunt and he actually said that if
46:20
you eat like he said good lemons are
46:22
knobbly
46:22
juice filled and should be eaten whole
46:24
like apples rind flesh
46:26
the lot so i'm gonna try that next time
46:28
cool yeah
46:29
but i mean most lemons are waxed aren't
46:31
they yeah so you wouldn't want to eat
46:32
the waxed ones
46:33
that's why you've got to go organic yeah
46:34
you don't want that one but you could
46:36
boil off the wax i suppose
46:37
yeah you could do that yeah culinary
46:40
tips from fish
46:44
have a potato wedge anybody all right
46:47
our restaurant
46:51
but citrus fruits have gone mad in the
46:53
last few hundred years then haven't they
46:56
they're really given that they did start
46:59
with these three types of citrus so
47:01
citrons pomelos and mandarins were the
47:03
official
47:04
grandfathers of all the citrus fruits we
47:06
have today
47:07
and now i think i was reading that the
47:09
uh i don't know why this is the
47:11
authority but the university of
47:12
california's
47:13
california riverside selected list of
47:16
citrus varieties
47:17
lists 1 200. and that's the edited list
47:21
and they are they're all hybrids so
47:24
grapefruit is part lemon
47:26
uh it's hybrid of lemon and a bitter
47:28
orange and yeah as you said
47:30
lime is a citron and a mandarin orange
47:32
but grapefruits are quite
47:33
relatively new i think and they were
47:35
accidentally made from this hybrid
47:37
mandarins which i would think of as
47:39
quite ubiquitous now
47:41
didn't reach us until the 19th century
47:43
didn't have any mandarin
47:45
what about um sainsbury's easy peelers
47:47
were they
47:48
they were the original
47:52
they're in the garden of eden um
47:55
in the early 20th century there was a
47:58
phrase in
47:58
america that you would be handed the
48:00
lemon
48:01
do you know what that is what it might
48:03
be is that um
48:05
if someone handed you a lemon that's not
48:06
like a bad car you know where you say a
48:08
bad car is a lemon
48:09
no i see what you mean but no not that
48:11
and that's not a that's not a
48:13
um make lemonade the first just the set
48:16
up okay okay
48:17
is it testicular no and actually i don't
48:20
think you could guess this
48:23
it was it meant that you were splitting
48:24
up with your partner
48:26
okay so you would say i'm handing you a
48:28
lemon and that means that we're
48:30
gonna go our separate ways and you used
48:32
to get like um
48:34
cards or you know where it said i'm
48:36
handing you a letter
48:37
and it would be like a dear john letter
48:39
that you would give them and it comes
48:41
from
48:41
um basically it's because they're the
48:43
opposite of sweet so like you would have
48:45
a sweet fruit and this is a sour fruit
48:47
and there was a song called a lemon in
48:49
the garden of love by the broadway
48:51
composer richard carl
48:52
which had this idea and then it became
48:54
really popular
48:55
and then in 1907 there was a letter in
48:57
the boston herald from a fruit dealer
48:59
who was complaining about this i'm
49:02
saying
49:03
i'm trying to sell my lemons and yeah it
49:05
just means that you're splitting up with
49:06
someone that's not really fair is it
49:08
just all his customers going we're not
49:09
even in a relationship
49:12
you got the authority to dump me he said
49:14
why not
49:15
an overripe cucumber or a frozen tomato
49:20
instead of just someone an overripe
49:23
cucumber could be a good way of
49:25
is that why we get the phrase i'm
49:26
standing around like a lemon because i
49:27
say that sometimes
49:29
no you do it a lot but because there is
49:32
there is the flare there's a phrase
49:33
there's not i haven't
49:34
made that right yeah i've been left
49:35
around here like a lemon for half an
49:36
hour i think it just probably comes from
49:38
the fact that lemons are the longest
49:39
lasting thing right
49:41
no you don't say i'm standing around
49:43
like 11 because lemons don't go off
49:44
quickly no but it might be the last
49:45
thing in the future
49:46
in the fruit bowl so it's sitting there
49:47
alone oh yeah that's what i would have
49:50
thought i agree
49:51
yeah i think what andy's saying is if
49:52
you've been split up with then you're
49:54
alone
49:54
right if you're standing like a lemon
49:56
then you're lonely exactly so they're
49:58
kind of similar yeah
49:59
one might have i really think that other
50:01
is right okay well look whatever
50:03
whatever guys
50:04
oh there is a related fact about lemons
50:06
and personality
50:08
which is that the amount of saliva that
50:09
you produce after tasting a lemon
50:12
i can tell you whether someone is an
50:14
introvert or an extrovert come on
50:16
really this is something called the
50:18
reticular activating system and it's a
50:20
bit of the brain that responds
50:21
um to some stimuli in food and also to
50:24
some
50:25
social stimuli and it controls the
50:27
amount of saliva you produce
50:29
we haven't judged the cause and effect
50:30
here have we because maybe they're
50:32
introverted and antisocial because every
50:33
time they meet anyone they start
50:34
dribbling
50:38
that's possible but that's why they say
50:40
you know when you're stood on your own
50:42
in the middle of the room they say it's
50:43
like you're 11.
50:44
and that's because you're dribbling all
50:46
over yourself and no one will stand near
50:47
you
50:48
because that is a phrase isn't it yeah
50:50
yeah yeah
50:51
basically this system reacts to social
50:53
contact so introverts react very
50:55
strongly to meeting people
50:56
it gives a you know it's kind of more of
50:59
a reaction
50:59
and so does lemon right okay
51:02
so if you think someone might be an
51:04
introvert just give them a bit of lemon
51:05
slip them a lemon
51:06
and then ask how much they're salivating
51:08
yeah yeah do you know that lemon juice
51:10
kills sperm
51:12
so it's actually an effective
51:13
contraceptive okay you know that um
51:15
phrase that's
51:16
where you're like standing like a lemon
51:18
in a room
51:20
do you think that comes from the fact
51:21
that you get like a load of sperm in a
51:23
bowl
51:24
yeah and you put lemonade and only one
51:27
of them survives
51:28
yeah because that is a phrase isn't it
51:29
it's definitely a phrase yeah
51:31
god there's only one flaw with that and
51:32
i think it's that um
51:34
i think all the sperm would be killed oh
51:36
so i think
51:37
maybe you've got one sperm out of the
51:38
bowl and the lemon's missed it and he's
51:40
on his own
51:40
yeah but it's definitely could be as
51:42
casanova used it apparently and the idea
51:44
is that you put it inside the female
51:46
of our woman species we call that
51:51
i always forget what they're called it
51:53
was half a lemon he supposedly used as a
51:55
dutch cap
51:56
that makes more sense because if you put
51:58
the full lemon then
51:59
the juice is not going to get out
52:02
i actually think even half a lemon is
52:04
quite quite an ask me too i couldn't
52:06
quite work out because then
52:08
if you're putting the whole thing in
52:09
isn't that just effectively a condom
52:10
rather than just using the lemon juice
52:12
it depends which way up it goes yeah no
52:14
it's a cup i guess yeah over the
52:16
belt yeah yeah i know but so that's a
52:18
comment no no no no no no no
52:20
it goes inside the vagina it's inside
52:22
it's a cup inside
52:23
the the female of the species
52:28
i see yeah so it's sort of a catching
52:30
it's a catcher's mitt
52:31
[Laughter]
52:35
yeah by the way sperm in a bowl
52:36
definitely the worst dish on our
52:38
restaurant's menu
52:39
[Laughter]
52:42
i think michelin stars are coming our
52:44
way
52:45
[Music]
52:50
okay that's it that is all of our facts
52:52

01:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:14
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:17
coming to you
01:18
not from the qi offices in covent garden
01:21
but from four
01:22
self-isolated bits of the uk that we
01:24
cannot disclose the locations of
01:26
uh my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
01:29
not with
01:29
anna chazinski or james harkin or alex
01:32
bell
01:33
but once again we have gathered together
01:35
over the internet to share our four
01:36
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:38
and in no particular order here we go
01:42
starting with you anna my fact this week
01:45
is that before we had the technology to
01:47
take
01:47
photos for mug shots policemen had to
01:50
visit prisons to memorize all the
01:52
inmates appearances
01:55
well in some prisons i think is that
01:58
like the knowledge for
01:59
taxi drivers it was exactly that yes and
02:02
then a lot of it got automated and i put
02:04
a lot of the old-school taxi drivers
02:06
slash
02:07
uh memorizes out of business wow does
02:09
that mean if you're like me and you
02:11
can't recognize people's faces you can't
02:12
be a policeman
02:14
you would not have fared well in that
02:16
phase of the interview process certainly
02:17
so i was
02:18
i'm reading the pick quick papers at the
02:19
moment and there's a scene where spoiler
02:22
alert mr pickwick goes to odetta's
02:24
prison and then there's suddenly the
02:26
scene came up which was mr pickwick sits
02:28
for his portrait
02:30
and described him being sat down and a
02:32
policeman saying okay it's time to sit
02:33
for your portrait sir and it said
02:35
a long thin man planted himself opposite
02:38
and took a good long view of him
02:40
a surly looking gentleman stationed
02:42
himself close
02:43
and rested his hands on his hips to
02:45
inspect him narrowly and then two
02:47
others came in and studied his features
02:48
with the most intent and thoughtful
02:50
faces
02:51
and then they took this likeness and at
02:53
length it was completed
02:54
and then they said okay you can go into
02:55
the prison and it seemed to be
02:57
just standard practice as you're going
02:59
into jail this sounds like a date to
03:01
memorize you
03:02
sounds like a date what very weird
03:04
awkward dates you have
03:05
do you just stare at the person across
03:07
the table well otherwise he'll never
03:09
know on the second date who it is
03:11
if he hasn't memorized what they look
03:12
like dickens must have known
03:15
the pickwick paper debtors jail really
03:18
well
03:18
uh because his dad was in there for a
03:20
long time wasn't he yes well he based
03:22
another little door at his base sort of
03:24
half in a debtor's prison and this was
03:25
like his warm-up
03:26
yeah he knew it very well and it was
03:28
fleet prison that this was
03:29
uh set in and fleet prison was next to
03:32
the river fleet which is a now
03:33
underground river that runs through
03:35
london wow
03:37
so it's amazing that you used to get
03:38
your portrait done because that's a very
03:40
lengthy process
03:42
you know it wasn't it wasn't taking his
03:44
portrait no one was drawing his portrait
03:46
it was it meant getting his portrait
03:48
done as in people staring at him and
03:50
memorizing his face it was a
03:51
metaphorical portrait
03:55
because then the first things that they
03:56
did record when they started thinking
03:58
actually we should probably just
03:59
stop trying to work everything out by
04:01
memory is they they didn't
04:03
they didn't they still didn't take
04:04
pictures or portraits or photographs or
04:06
anything or even do sketches they
04:07
started taking measurements
04:08
to a belgian prison warden called
04:11
stevens in 1860.
04:12
it's one of the first people who started
04:14
measuring criminals like heads and their
04:16
ears and their feet
04:17
and like how tall they were like
04:19
basically if you're like measuring them
04:20
up for a suit or something
04:21
which feels like incredibly like lengthy
04:24
way to
04:25
you then have to re-measure every single
04:26
suspect that comes in and like line up
04:28
all of the measurements with everyone
04:30
yeah also a lot of people have quite
04:32
similar measurements
04:33
you know when you're roughly six foot
04:34
with brown hair average weight exactly
04:36
very hard to narrow it down it's not
04:37
going to be like this person's ear
04:39
is two and a half feet long and this
04:41
person's you know
04:42
lips are five inches in width no
04:46
i should say that i did further research
04:48
into this other than just assuming that
04:49
a fictional book contained the truth
04:52
so just to be clear this was definitely
04:55
the case and it was a thing that was
04:56
done
04:57
to identify criminals and it's mostly to
04:59
spot re-offenders right so if someone
05:00
comes into the prison
05:01
it's to it so policemen can say oh yeah
05:03
he's been in three times before
05:05
and it was really pioneered by this guy
05:07
called eugene francois vidok
05:09
who was right at the start of the 19th
05:11
century uh criminal
05:13
in fact a criminal turned policeman who
05:16
pioneered this mass memorization program
05:18
so he would train up all his agents to
05:20
make regular trips to all the prisons
05:21
around the country
05:22
and memorize you know wander around the
05:24
prison yards and memorize all their
05:25
faces
05:26
and there was thousands of faces they
05:27
memorized i think something like 30 000
05:29
prisoners
05:30
they had committed to memory so it did
05:32
happen he was an extraordinary character
05:34
this guy wasn't he eugene
05:35
vidok so he was first put into jail when
05:38
he was quite young
05:39
by his own father uh he he had robbed
05:43
his dad's pawn shop
05:44
and uh can i just say when you say pawn
05:46
shop you mean people were giving
05:48
goods to get money back for them oh
05:52
no specifically that one chess piece
05:56
a lot of people losing them so yeah did
05:59
a good business out of that
06:00
yeah no it was um for pawning items into
06:03
a shop so he he stole from there
06:05
his dad put him into prison um he stayed
06:07
there for about two weeks then when he
06:09
came out he robbed the shop again
06:10
took all the money and ran away um and
06:13
was gonna go on a ship to america
06:14
but then heard that there was a circus
06:16
in town so try to join that
06:18
um but quit because he was too afraid to
06:20
bite the heads off chickens
06:22
as was one of the acts they needed him
06:23
to do also he started making out with
06:25
the puppeteer's wife
06:26
uh while they were doing the show um
06:28
yeah is that that was geeks wasn't it
06:30
one
06:31
wasn't it geeks who were the people who
06:32
bit the heads of chickens at circuses is
06:34
that right that's right yes
06:35
that's right that's why they called me a
06:36
geek at school sure it is alex
06:39
and so the duck had a really good memory
06:41
didn't he he could memorize all these
06:42
people absolutely perfectly
06:44
um but he said that he couldn't really
06:46
require the same of his agents because
06:48
he initially hired 28 detectives all of
06:51
whom were also criminals
06:52
um to join his kind of police force
06:56
and then he decided that he would set up
06:58
index cards with all of these different
07:00
aliases convictions what they would do
07:04
how they would like to break into places
07:05
and stuff like that and basically that
07:07
was the start of
07:08
intelligence yeah so it was like flash
07:10
cards but for
07:11
criminals exactly well like a massive
07:13
game of guess who yes
07:16
james is looking so blank like he has no
07:17
idea what that game is i don't know
07:18
james would be so terrible i guess
07:20
yeah it's just the same face on every
07:22
card
07:24
he wasn't very popular he wasn't super
07:26
popular because of his habit of just
07:27
employing criminals
07:28
so he wasn't very popular among
07:30
criminals because he went to prison and
07:31
then he used the fact that he
07:33
was a criminal to report on all his
07:35
other mates who were criminals and get
07:36
them in trouble
07:37
and then yeah he employed these people
07:40
in the force who kept on just
07:42
recommitting crimes and so i think the
07:44
police weren't huge fans of him and in
07:45
fact
07:46
when he became the head of what was
07:48
essentially the um sort of undercover
07:50
police force
07:51
then he was still a wanted criminal in
07:53
another place
07:54
and there was this constant back and
07:55
forth between the police force that he
07:56
was running
07:57
saying no no we need him and the
07:59
prison's saying well we want to put him
08:00
in jail
08:03
um fingerprinting another useful useful
08:05
technology
08:06
we use a lot and um so this was proven
08:08
to be superior to
08:10
the old just like taking someone's
08:11
measurements height and weight or
08:13
memorizing their faces
08:14
it was proven to be vital with the case
08:17
of
08:17
albert and ebenezer fox who i didn't
08:19
know about these guys they were
08:20
identical twins and this was the turn of
08:22
the 20th century and they were both
08:24
serial criminals they were poachers and
08:26
thieves and
08:27
because they were identical twins they
08:29
just played this really fun game where
08:30
whenever one of them got arrested they
08:32
sort of say no it's my brother mate
08:33
and what are you going to do to prove it
08:35
all you can do is memorize my face
08:37
and so there was this one policeman who
08:39
said we've got to get a better system
08:41
here
08:41
and realize that their fingerprints were
08:43
uh actually different to one another's
08:45
even when everyone else is the same
08:47
but what i like is that there's an
08:48
estate in walmart green
08:50
which is a place in hertfordshire it
08:52
would be so great if there was someone
08:53
listening who lives there and who didn't
08:54
know this
08:55
there's an estate in warmer green called
08:57
twin fox's estate
08:58
and these guys are pretty obscure now
09:01
almost lost to history
09:02
but the twin foxes estate has these two
09:05
busts at the entrance to it
09:06
of the identical twin fox brothers so
09:09
it's an estate which is just
09:11
in honor of these serial criminals
09:13
that's incredible
09:14
do you think that's pretty cool if you
09:16
were the sculptor of that would you do
09:18
two different sittings with the two
09:20
different brothers or would you just
09:21
think
09:22
you know what well you think he's he
09:23
sculpted the individual fingerprints
09:27
just back very quickly to vidoc um
09:31
so he was quite famous in his day wasn't
09:33
he he he was someone who was notorious
09:35
for these stories
09:36
of adventure and and espionage and so on
09:39
um so much so that he was actually
09:43
he inspired characters in fiction um
09:46
so les mis it said that he is the
09:49
inspiration
09:50
for jean varjon oh is he
09:54
yeah but not only that he is also the
09:56
inspiration
09:57
in the same book for the policeman
09:59
character um
10:01
what's his name um javier
10:05
i'm ready mate is he did you say james
10:06
didn't you well i read the first hundred
10:08
pages
10:10
over the course of about four years um
10:13
in
10:13
in the movie he's played by russell
10:15
crowe so i think he's called javier
10:17
and uh but i might be pronouncing that
10:19
wrong but it's the two different stages
10:21
of his life
10:22
he inspired he was so inspiring both in
10:24
his notorious criminal activity
10:26
and his police work he appears twice as
10:29
inspirational either
10:29
or victor hugo is an incredibly lazy
10:31
author who just couldn't even be
10:33
bothered to
10:33
reach the two sources for inspiration
10:36
well i was wondering if it's just like
10:38
one of those really
10:39
horror movies where it turns out that
10:41
it's two
10:42
parts of the same person's psyche that
10:44
does the murder or whatever
10:46
do you know yeah like he's a jekyll and
10:48
hyde are you describing fight club as a
10:50
really hack
10:51
movie i haven't seen fight club or even
10:54
wow you just spoiled it for him anna
10:56
i have just done that do you not know
11:00
the first rule of fight club for [ __ ]
11:02
sake
11:08
okay it's time for fact number two and
11:10
that is
11:11
james okay my fact this week is that
11:14
scientists working in the arctic ocean
11:17
have caught chlamydia and they can't
11:19
explain how
11:20
[Laughter]
11:24
okay so when i say court in this
11:27
respect i mean like catching a fish or
11:29
catching um
11:31
some species of organism and because
11:34
they've gone down to the bottom of the
11:36
arctic ocean and they've
11:38
extracted some sediments from there and
11:40
they've looked at what
11:41
life forms are down there and they found
11:43
chlamydia
11:44
and it's um strains of the chlamydia
11:47
family
11:48
so it's not the chlamydia that you get
11:49
as humans
11:51
but they're related organisms of the
11:53
same family
11:54
and they can't work out why they're
11:55
there it doesn't make any sense
11:57
chlamydia
11:57
tends to or always as far as we know
12:00
needs a host
12:01
so he needs to live inside the body of
12:02
another animal but when they found these
12:04
things there was no other animals there
12:05
so they just can't work out
12:07
why it's there and how it got there and
12:09
has the arctic denied all knowledge that
12:11
said i'm
12:12
you know me and the pacific are just
12:13
good friends i don't know what you're
12:15
suggesting
12:16
i think i think protesting that it's not
12:18
quite the chlamydia you know doesn't
12:19
really make it any better
12:20
no i think well the thing is that the
12:24
arctic is being penetrated by the
12:27
atlantic at the moment
12:29
because of the change in temperature on
12:32
earth and warm salty water coming from
12:34
the
12:34
atlantic is kind of coming into the
12:36
arctic at the moment
12:37
and causing quite a few problems for the
12:40
you know global climate
12:41
so maybe it's something to do with that
12:43
you think there'd be enough plastic in
12:45
the oceans that they could penetrate
12:46
each other safely
12:47
but apparently not indeed yeah the
12:50
number of condoms we've given them over
12:51
the years
12:54
and so there you go that's a thing
12:55
that's happened and they found it out
12:57
quite recently and it's been in
12:58
um a lot of the science c kind of uh
13:01
publications and new scientists and a
13:02
few things like that and i just find it
13:04
really interesting
13:05
so are we going to give the ocean bed
13:06
antibiotics or are we just going to let
13:08
them
13:09
suffer if that's what we need to do pour
13:11
more chemicals into the ocean
13:14
i think it's not that they're suffering
13:16
these are just organisms that live there
13:18
they're just living their life they as
13:20
far as i know they're not doing anyone
13:21
any harm they just
13:22
they're part of the of the biosphere
13:24
really okay
13:25
um so like i say we don't really know
13:28
why they're there because they've tried
13:29
to get the microbes and grow them in the
13:31
lab but they've not been able to do it
13:32
because the pressure underneath the sea
13:34
uh and basically the conditions down
13:36
there are very different than what we
13:37
can make in the lab so
13:39
it's really really hard to study and it
13:41
could be that they're using other
13:43
microbes that are living in these
13:45
sediments and they're using
13:46
their bodies as it were to to live
13:49
but we really just don't know i was
13:51
reading about other symptoms of
13:52
just for this podcast of normal
13:54
chlamydia and
13:56
did you know that if it goes untreated
13:58
you can get a symptom
14:00
called saxophone penis which is
14:03
when the penis bends into the shape of a
14:05
saxophone
14:06
okay hang on with a big open end bit no
14:09
you can't play it it's not
14:10
it doesn't turn into a saxophone no but
14:12
you said the shape so does that mean
14:14
it's kind of
14:15
thin at the top and then bends around
14:16
then it's got a big bell at the end
14:18
um it it's basically a big bend where it
14:20
shouldn't be and it looks
14:21
like a saxophone because sexy smell like
14:26
wow that's yeah
14:29
good luck getting that one convincing
14:31
pickup line
14:32
are you sure that that does look like
14:34
extreme chlamydia to me
14:36
speaking of the arctic and penises
14:39
there is a thing called polar penis that
14:41
you can get i don't know
14:43
um this was um an antarctic adventurer
14:46
called alex brazier
14:47
um who reported this um only last year i
14:50
think it was
14:50
so he was walking through the antarctic
14:53
and obviously his
14:54
trousers were not thick enough and he
14:56
said he suffered from an extremely
14:58
cold painful and swollen member uh
15:02
and the only way he knew how to treat it
15:03
was to put a hat on it
15:05
right is that i can think of another
15:08
treatment ever
15:09
in this case he had a woolly hat his
15:12
penis was too cold and it was getting
15:13
sore so he put a hat on it
15:15
and it was fine and i like to think you
15:17
know those innocent
15:19
smoothie bottles that have the little
15:20
woolly hats on
15:22
yes yeah i like to think it'd be like
15:23
one of those little hats that you carry
15:25
around with you or something
15:27
wow you've just made them a lot less
15:29
cute for a lot of people
15:31
i don't think that one a cold dick
15:33
doesn't warrant a medical name
15:35
you didn't mean that well i believe it
15:37
was a lot more you know
15:38
it wasn't just like it suddenly started
15:40
to look like a piccolo
15:42
it was like really kind of quite painful
15:46
a lot of instruments we could get out of
15:48
penis conditions
15:49
i've got a tromboner oh god
15:53
wow um do you know who has chlamydia
15:58
is it you okay
16:01
[Music]
16:02
um of course it's koalas famous koalas
16:07
but it's actually not the same strain of
16:09
chlamydia that infects humans
16:11
but it does seem that they get it
16:13
through sex and it's probably
16:14
around 100 of wild koalas who have this
16:18
there's one or two populations that
16:19
don't have it famously i think there's
16:21
one on kangaroo island that don't have
16:23
it but
16:23
pretty much all koalas in the wild have
16:27
this disease and the problem with it the
16:29
main problem is of course antibiotics
16:31
are quite good against chlamydia
16:33
but if you're a koala you can't have
16:34
antibiotics do you know why
16:36
um you can't open the bottle because
16:38
it's like having kids
16:40
uh no are they just too embarrassed to
16:42
get it checked up
16:43
they just never get it diagnosed these
16:45
are all great answers but the answer is
16:47
that they have a very very specific gut
16:49
microbiome
16:51
because they eat eucalyptus leaves only
16:53
don't they
16:54
and they have a very very specific
16:55
bacterias that live in their stomachs
16:57
that let them eat that
16:58
and nothing else and if they take
17:00
antibiotics then it can upset that and
17:02
they can
17:02
even die because they're not getting all
17:04
the nutrients they need someone needs to
17:06
introduce the koala community to yakult
17:08
surely get some good bacteria in them
17:10
because i think they aren't they're
17:11
talking about giving they're talking
17:12
about giving them fecal transplants
17:14
aren't they
17:15
which obviously you do for humans to
17:16
regenerate their gut bacteria but so
17:18
they could have that
17:18
which seems sort of fitting because i
17:20
think they get chlamydia from
17:22
fecal matter so there are two ways you
17:24
can get it you can get it sexually as a
17:26
koala
17:27
or you can get it from your mother's pap
17:29
which is this
17:31
disgusting substance that they consume
17:33
between drinking their mother's milk
17:35
and eating eucalyptus and it's thought
17:37
that they they
17:38
eat their mother's pet which is
17:39
essentially fecal matter that their mum
17:41
feeds them their own poo
17:42
and then it's thought that that's what
17:44
builds up their gut bacteria to help
17:45
them digest eucalyptus can you imagine
17:47
ever going to a dinner party if you have
17:49
that job when someone asks you and so
17:50
what do you do you know i give fecal
17:52
transplants to koala bears
17:56
that is the kind of person i want to be
17:57
sat next to a dinner party
18:03
[Laughter]
18:04
dream dinner party do you know who else
18:07
has chlamydia
18:09
parrots so parrots can get something
18:12
called um
18:15
cyticosis but with a silent p at the
18:17
start
18:18
and it's known as parrot fever
18:21
very good sorry um but yeah this is um
18:25
a illness that they can get and it's
18:26
caused by a chlamydia bacterium
18:28
and it can sometimes go to humans and
18:31
that is one
18:32
theory and actually it's definitely
18:34
where the popularization of the phrase
18:36
sick as a parrot comes from
18:38
okay no way yeah so there are bits
18:41
in i think that might be in shakespeare
18:43
somewhere where someone says
18:45
you're sick like a parrot um but the
18:48
specific
18:48
sick as a parrot came from the 1970s and
18:51
it was
18:51
just at a time when there was a bit of a
18:53
worry about um
18:54
parrot fever oh which is the type of
18:57
chlamydia you get from parrots
18:59
wait and when you say it can go to
19:01
humans is that sexually transmitted
19:03
it is not it's because okay you are
19:06
nautically
19:06
transmitted okay fine it's not because
19:09
they can't sweet talk you
19:10
paris but with your own words
19:16
they're the sexiest words around people
19:18
you're like oh you're looking nice today
19:20
you're looking nice today
19:24
is it more embarrassing to say to your
19:25
spouse that the reason you've got
19:27
chlamydia is that you've been having an
19:28
affair
19:28
or that it's from the pet parent they're
19:31
both quite embarrassing i've got
19:33
chlamydia i've got chlamydia
19:37
imagine trying to hang up on a nice late
19:39
night phone call with your parrot
19:42
no you hang up first no you had that
19:43
fast first
19:45
[Laughter]
19:47
i found a story from 2004 from sweden
19:51
um when uh the number of uh chlamydia
19:53
cases were
19:54
like really spiking and the government
19:55
had to do something about it so they
19:57
started offering
19:58
like a service um three days a week i
20:00
think it was something like fridays and
20:01
saturdays and sundays
20:03
um where you could ring you could ring
20:05
like a condom ambulance
20:07
um and it was called the the chusan
20:09
express because uh the chostan is a
20:12
well known make of condoms and for about
20:14
four quids worth
20:15
um you they would deliver ten condoms to
20:18
any address
20:18
uh within the city of gothenburg or
20:21
stockholm or malmo
20:23
okay it's pretty good value did they get
20:26
the
20:26
sort of ambulance level siren
20:30
it's the kind of urgency you want when
20:31
you can't find a car yeah especially the
20:33
people who feel embarrassed by england
20:36
just get this big sound i want the st
20:38
john's air ambulance outside my window
20:42
i was once in a shop in bolton and there
20:45
was like a
20:46
middle-aged man wanting to buy condoms
20:48
and he was really embarrassed because it
20:50
was a lady behind the counter
20:51
and he just went excuse me love you got
20:54
any rubber gloves
20:56
[Laughter]
20:59
he went you got any rubber gloves and
21:02
she took him to the other part of the
21:04
star and gave him some actual rubber
21:05
gloves
21:07
and then he had to go no i don't mean
21:09
those
21:10
[Laughter]
21:13
oh guy i just felt so embarrassed by him
21:15
i mean
21:16
it's just a story if only if only he'd
21:18
had five small penises
21:22
he had a penis like a set of bagpipes
21:28
[Applause]
21:29
okay it is time for fact number three
21:31
and that is
21:32
alex my fact this week is that jessica
21:35
alba has ridden the london eye
21:37
31 times
21:40
she holds the record for the
21:41
international overseas celebrity to have
21:44
ridden it the most times
21:45
it's such a good fact so you know is it
21:47
because she really loves the london eye
21:49
i wish it was because that because i
21:51
cause like i just i love the idea of
21:52
having a massive fan of it but no it's
21:54
actually because she
21:55
uh was doing press for uh the movie
21:58
fantastic four rise of the silver surfer
22:00
which came out a few years ago
22:01
and she did the press interviews on the
22:03
london eye because uh
22:04
part of it takes place in london uh hang
22:06
on did she did she go off it and go back
22:08
on it
22:09
no i don't think she went unqueued every
22:11
time she had a new interview
22:13
so she's done 31 rotations one single
22:16
rotation um visit yes that i see
22:20
what happened was it was um it was like
22:22
a press junket
22:23
and it was jessica alba um michael
22:26
chiklis and chris evans
22:28
and they were all doing this thing and
22:29
they went around 30 times and then she
22:31
must have gone on one more time
22:33
she just enjoyed it like as a punter
22:35
right but what that says to me is that
22:37
the other people
22:37
don't really like it very much and they
22:39
decided now we've done our 30 times now
22:41
we're not going to go back again
22:42
yeah i think that's fair well
22:46
i think it's a bit weird that she went
22:47
can i have just one more just
22:49
just for me is that the longest press
22:52
junket of all time that is a 15 hour
22:55
press junket
22:56
it's a long time isn't it is that right
22:59
it takes about half an hour to go around
23:00
yeah
23:01
holy moly wow i wonder if she did it all
23:04
in one day though or maybe they did it
23:05
over two days
23:06
we'll never know if only she had some
23:08
kind of media outlet
23:09
that i messed up i messaged her
23:11
instagram feed to see if she'd tell me
23:12
anything about it she never replied
23:14
[Laughter]
23:15
in the article i read about this um it
23:17
had a few other celebrities
23:19
that have been on it quite a few times
23:21
um
23:22
matt damon i think i've tied with i
23:24
think we've been on
23:26
about the same number of times well he's
23:28
been at least
23:29
five times um and i've i've done at
23:32
least six
23:33
really why have you been on it six times
23:35
see i i mean 31 sounds ridiculous but
23:37
then i don't know six is
23:38
actually is outrageous as well for a
23:39
normal i used to live outside of london
23:41
so
23:41
if i came and visited um family and
23:43
friends in london they always it was a
23:45
touristy thing that they would take you
23:46
to do and then i became that person who
23:48
they would say could we go and do it so
23:50
i've been on quite a few times
23:51
um yeah six but do you have been on the
23:53
same number as charlie chaplin
23:56
have you yeah amazing dan is such a
23:59
fantastic
24:00
and he's so happy that james shares that
24:02
very very ubiquitous thing
24:04
no i that my pause was i was suddenly
24:07
very annoyed that james knows something
24:09
about charlie chaplin
24:10
that i didn't so much so that i didn't
24:12
notice the joke and what he was saying
24:14
all i know is that he died before the
24:17
london i was built
24:18
that's all i know and i i saw that
24:20
entire thought process in dan's face
24:23
on my laptop gradually happening
24:28
so the london eye really it rejuvenated
24:30
the ferris wheel
24:31
industry and it really did before it
24:34
came along
24:35
it came around again the ferris wheel
24:36
industry after that didn't it very good
24:38
it did
24:38
um so it was a big deal around the turn
24:40
of the 20th century and the
24:42
tallest ferris wheel in the world was
24:44
the grongaru de paris which was built in
24:46
1900 for the world's fair
24:48
and demolished in 1920 but it was 100
24:51
meters high
24:52
and that wasn't beaten for almost 90
24:55
years
24:55
it's amazing isn't it how how lit how
24:57
the tallest wheel is not that much
24:59
taller than the first ferris wheel you
25:00
think that the first one would have been
25:01
like i know four meters or something
25:02
hilarious and yeah it's actually pretty
25:04
it was a pretty good
25:05
like for a first attempt i was pretty
25:06
impressed it's decent also do you know
25:08
what one of the limiting factors which
25:10
is why they can't really go any taller
25:12
this is according to mitsubishi heavy
25:13
industries who are one of the world's
25:15
biggest manufacturers of giant ferris
25:17
wheels
25:17
i don't know how many there are
25:20
but take take a guess a problem that i
25:22
don't know how jessica albert dealt with
25:24
for instance
25:25
oh okay okay is it because
25:29
uh they can't go that fast so if they're
25:31
really really big
25:32
it's going to take you ages to get all
25:34
the way back round to the start again
25:36
and people just get bored and is it is
25:39
it going to be something
25:39
is it counterweighting it's close no
25:42
james is a lot closer
25:43
it's bored and also bearing in mind
25:45
maybe it's quite a lot of older people
25:47
or very small children um it's about
25:51
bugs
25:52
toilets no toilets yeah
25:55
and there's sort of like a maximum
25:56
amount of time that you can have people
25:59
trapped in a room without lose before
26:01
there starts being sort of disastrous
26:02
situations and more cleaners need to be
26:04
brought on board and it's just not worth
26:05
it
26:06
i do have a fact about jessica albrum
26:08
poo actually if you want to hear it
26:09
yeah please why not that um she was in
26:12
the
26:13
uh she starred in fact in the 2011 uh
26:15
movie
26:16
spy kids 4d and the director robert
26:19
rodriguez was inspired to
26:21
write that movie after he watched
26:22
jessica i was baby do a poo
26:25
interesting sorry what was the movie
26:26
again uh spy kids 4d
26:28
what's that okay so you thought i'll
26:31
just
26:32
maybe write a [ __ ] movie no yeah pretty
26:34
much yeah
26:35
no he um so she watched he was working
26:37
with her and she was doing another press
26:39
thing and she
26:39
her baby did a big poo in the nappy just
26:42
as she was about to go on camera so she
26:44
he watched her change a nappy like
26:46
really quickly while kind of like
26:47
getting ready and doing all of her like
26:49
makeup and stuff
26:49
and he had he like was amazed at her
26:51
watching her kind of be a mother and
26:52
also do this very professional job at
26:54
like literally the same time
26:55
and so he thought wouldn't it be fun to
26:56
have uh a spy who's also a mum
26:59
and then he wrote the movie with uh by
27:01
his mom in it
27:02
really is that what it's about yeah oh
27:05
did the first three also about that so i
27:06
don't know why he required
27:07
new inspiration but this is what it says
27:11
in uh
27:12
yeah that's amazing um you know you were
27:14
saying about how they can't get much
27:16
bigger
27:17
have you seen the new biggest ferris
27:19
wheel which is about to be opened this
27:21
year
27:21
is that the one in dubai or something
27:23
yeah the one in dubai is called
27:25
in dubai a i n dubai it's going to be
27:28
210 meters tall and the current highest
27:32
which is in las vegas
27:33
is 167 meters tall so it's way way way
27:37
way bigger than that one
27:38
london is about 130 something like that
27:41
and it means that each of the spokes
27:43
of the wheel is about the same length as
27:46
a football pitch
27:48
wow that's how big it is on the um
27:51
on the flip side i tried to find the
27:53
smallest ferris wheel
27:55
that we had and there's a list on
27:57
wikipedia of ferris wheels
27:59
and um unfortunately the smallest pharah
28:01
will didn't have a hyperlink to it um
28:03
but the second smallest did so i can
28:05
tell you about the second smallest
28:06
ferris wheel
28:07
um it's called the uni royal giant tire
28:10
and it was built by the same team or
28:13
company that built the empire state
28:15
building right
28:17
wow how cool is that
28:20
um it is uh that's extraordinary
28:24
someone has deleted that information
28:27
from my next day
28:29
amazing unbelievable that my son is
28:32
in so much trouble right now um can you
28:35
give us a rough
28:37
size yes okay imagine the largest
28:39
non-production tire so it looks like
28:41
it's
28:42
okay largest non-production tyre let me
28:45
just
28:46
bring up the very clear image and scale
28:47
in my mind because i'm so familiar with
28:49
that is it like a monster truck tire
28:51
yeah but like about ten times the size
28:53
it's massive okay yeah yeah i mean this
28:55
is this is
28:55
guys it's really big i've seen smaller
28:57
ferris wheels than that you see like
28:59
kid's ones don't you in the
29:01
background what about like a legoland
29:02
they have a tiny model one or like those
29:04
will connect ones you get in the windows
29:05
of harrods
29:06
probably someone's made one that i have
29:07
a needle out of chromium
29:09
yeah yeah i suspect that wikipedia
29:12
decided not to list every single ferris
29:14
wheel in the world right down to the
29:16
very smallest
29:17
guys i did say it was the second
29:19
smallest
29:21
that's a good point hey do you remember
29:24
um in 2013 before we started this
29:28
podcast we did a whole lot of practices
29:30
and one of the first ones we ever did
29:32
was someone asked us a question what is
29:34
the name for a phobia of ferris wheels
29:37
yes i do do you know weirdly i got
29:39
really emotional
29:40
um researching this fact because that
29:42
was that was the conversation that we
29:44
had that has led to this whole podcast
29:46
yeah
29:46
that singular one yeah uh i went through
29:48
and found all my old emails and went
29:50
through all my old research for it which
29:52
is crazy
29:53
it's actually quite common for people to
29:55
have a phobia of ferris wheels
29:56
as i see if i google it or go on twitter
29:59
and type in phobia or ferris wheels it
30:01
seems to be quite common
30:02
and i went on to big roundwheel.com
30:05
which is like a ferris wheel
30:07
fan site and there's an faqs there and
30:10
they say you know
30:11
what am i gonna do if i'm scared of
30:13
ferris wheels and they say
30:15
consider sitting on a park bench which
30:17
could probably support about a thousand
30:18
pounds
30:19
while sitting on this bench are you
30:21
afraid the bench will suddenly break and
30:23
you will fall
30:24
most likely not because the consequences
30:26
of falling 18 inches are not very
30:28
dangerous
30:30
now consider the ferris wheel seat yes
30:32
it is much higher
30:34
but it is also designed to carry about
30:36
three times the weight of that part
30:37
bench it is designed for
30:39
so basically if you are worried and it
30:41
goes on and it goes on but
30:43
there's no i didn't you know giving
30:44
people like fear therapy you don't have
30:46
to use that mocking tone james
30:53
it didn't have the tone on the website
30:55
because i was just reading it but that's
30:56
how i imagine they wrote it
30:58
so when we had that initial fish chat
31:01
before
31:02
fish started one of the topics we also
31:04
spoke about was the person who created
31:06
the ferris wheel the first
31:07
the first one being george washington
31:09
gail ferris jr
31:11
which is where ferris gets its name from
31:14
and i read about its inaugural run
31:15
its very first time it showed members of
31:17
the public and press
31:18
the first time it was spinning in all
31:20
its glory um
31:22
and the first time it did that it did it
31:23
with no carriages
31:25
hanging on to the end of this phone so
31:26
what did people just hang on with their
31:29
hands they had the people the
31:31
construction
31:32
site workers climb to the end of the
31:34
spokes and sit there oh
31:36
nice angle as it was going now that's a
31:39
legit fear i think like if you're scared
31:40
of ferris wheels and they make you ride
31:42
it like that
31:43
because have you imagined just sitting
31:45
on like a lock for instance
31:47
you don't worry about falling off a look
31:48
do you so why should you worry about
31:50
sure it's a lot famously very easy to
31:52
fall off a log james
31:53
[Laughter]
31:57
but this was in 1893 so this was um
31:59
first showed at the chicago world
32:01
colombian exposition
32:02
and it was just a ridiculous thing to do
32:05
it was so ginormous it was bigger than
32:07
the tallest buildings really at the time
32:09
um or at least on par with them
32:11
um a pretty extraordinary feat well the
32:14
reason they did it is because
32:15
um they wanted something that was better
32:17
than the eiffel tower
32:19
because the eiffel tower had been built
32:21
in paris of course
32:22
and everyone that was thought this was
32:24
amazing but they had this new world fair
32:26
and they thought well we can't be
32:27
outdone by paris we need something which
32:29
is as good as that
32:30
and so they had almost a competition to
32:32
see what might come
32:34
in the place of you know as their kind
32:36
of version of the eiffel tower
32:38
uh one idea was they were going to have
32:40
a 4 000 foot tower with a car that
32:42
seated
32:43
200 people that was on a bit of bungee
32:45
rope
32:46
and then people would push this car off
32:48
the top of the tower
32:49
and then all 200 people inside this pod
32:52
would do like a
32:53
joint bungee jump so a bungee jump but
32:56
inside a bus
32:57
exactly like that yeah what a bloodbath
33:00
that was well
33:01
that can only be the reason they didn't
33:02
do it another idea was they would have a
33:05
5000 foot tower made of logs and at the
33:07
very top of this
33:08
log tower there would be a log cabin
33:11
i don't know i don't know how you would
33:13
get there there was another one which
33:15
was a 9 000 foot tower
33:17
and at the very top they would have a
33:18
toboggan slide and you would kind of go
33:20
on like a crest to run all the way down
33:22
to the bottom is amazing
33:24
were these increasingly desperate
33:26
pictures from the same person they kept
33:27
saying no and they were just like he was
33:28
like going down down the road
33:30
what about a twenty thousand football
33:32
tower
33:33
monkey tennis
33:36
uh and then what happened was they were
33:38
looked at all these things i thought
33:39
this is ridiculous
33:40
and they got a letter from gustav ifel
33:43
himself
33:43
who said you know what i'll just make
33:45
you another eiffel tower
33:47
i'll make it a little bit bigger than
33:49
the other one so it's better than the
33:50
one in paris
33:51
and that's what they were going to go
33:52
for but then it got into the newspapers
33:55
and everyone was like no you can't have
33:56
a french person
33:57
building something in america it needs
33:59
to be an american and then that's when
34:01
this guy
34:02
george washington gail ferris jr came
34:04
along and said i've got this idea for a
34:06
a big wheel didn't a french person build
34:09
the statue of liberty
34:11
sure because they did yeah yeah
34:15
and it was like built in the head there
34:17
there's an amazing picture i nearly put
34:18
it in the title qi titles actually but
34:20
like it's a
34:21
it's just the head of the statue of
34:23
liberty sitting in a park in paris where
34:25
they sort of put it on display before
34:26
they shipped it
34:27
it's really cool yeah that is cool do
34:30
you know why
34:30
george washington gail ferris jr was
34:32
called george washington gail ferris jr
34:35
by the way
34:36
was it because his dad was called george
34:37
washington gail ferris no it wasn't
34:39
weirdly actually that's quite weird
34:42
isn't it you think so but no he wasn't
34:44
it's just such a stupid name i thought
34:45
i'd look it up and the reason was that
34:47
he was from a town called galesburg
34:50
that was named after a guy called george
34:52
washington gale
34:54
and his parents were so proud of the
34:56
town they decided to give him the
34:58
entire name of the founder and they just
35:00
put the family name ferris at the end
35:02
no way so it's like me calling my
35:04
children andrew hunter murray harkin
35:07
it's like putting the entire name before
35:09
your surname
35:10
although it does sound like the mum did
35:12
have an affair with george washington
35:14
gail
35:15
and had to pull the wool over the eyes
35:17
of the husband when gail insisted he'd
35:19
have his son named after him
35:22
that is a convoluted situation you've
35:24
set up there dan so the mom's had an
35:26
affair with a guy
35:27
who's insisted that even though she's
35:29
married to someone else she named her
35:31
son
35:31
after him he's the founder of the city
35:34
he's
35:34
got ego running through his veins fair
35:38
point
35:38
and she's just got to cover that up that
35:40
is a difficult position you're putting
35:41
that woman in i don't know why she
35:43
shagged him in the first place he sounds
35:44
like a [ __ ]
35:47
did you know that one of the two feet of
35:49
the london eye
35:50
so the london eye have to pay rent on
35:52
one of the feet
35:53
of the london eye but not the other one
35:55
oh yeah because
35:57
why well because the uh let me see the
36:00
the foot that is closer to the south
36:02
bank center is owned by the south the
36:03
land is owned by the south bank center
36:05
and when it was built as the millennium
36:07
wheel it was supposed to be a temporary
36:08
structure and there was an agreement for
36:09
five years
36:10
um and then when they everybody wanted
36:12
to keep it and
36:13
and and make it a permanent um
36:15
installation this albuquerque center
36:17
um asked for well they pay half a
36:19
million pounds a year as a lease it's a
36:21
lot of money
36:22
but did you read about the dispute it's
36:24
crazy i know and because the
36:25
the south back center were basically
36:27
able to hold them to ransom the south
36:28
bank center
36:29
served the london eye with an eviction
36:31
notice
36:32
it's crazy they wrote to them and at the
36:35
time the london eye was paying rent of
36:36
65 grand for this one foot that was on
36:39
their lap it was just on a bit of
36:40
concrete it wasn't like it was in the
36:41
middle of the south bank centre itself
36:43
and the southbank xender said we're
36:45
going to up that from 65 grand to 2.5
36:47
million pounds
36:48
or you have to and they said this in may
36:50
i think and they said oh you have to
36:52
clear off our property by the first of
36:53
july
36:56
wow by july 5 july that's a month that's
36:59
too big
37:00
see that's the benefit when you're a
37:02
smaller ferris wheel that you can
37:04
relocate to different places much like
37:06
the second smallest ferris wheel in the
37:07
world
37:08
which did relocate easy to do when
37:10
you're only 86 feet tall
37:12
[Laughter]
37:17
okay it's time for our final fact of the
37:19
show and that is my fact
37:21
my fact this week is that in 2003 the
37:24
county of ottawa michigan
37:25
released a brochure for would-be
37:27
residents to prepare them for living in
37:29
the countryside
37:30
it included a scratch and sniff that
37:32
admitted the smell of manure
37:37
yeah you can see this brochure online uh
37:39
it's really good
37:40
um and the whole premise behind it was
37:43
that they kept having people move to
37:45
these rural bits of ottawa
37:47
and complaining all the time about the
37:49
realities of it one of the main things
37:50
being
37:51
a lot of places you live in will be
37:53
coated in the odor of manure
37:56
so at the scratch and sniff they say if
37:57
you're not ready for this maybe you're
37:59
not ready to live here
38:00
i think it would have been more
38:01
effective to just send them a small
38:02
sample pack like a welcome box
38:04
of [ __ ] yeah it's very confusing that
38:08
there's a place in michigan called
38:09
ottawa
38:10
yes when that is relatively quite close
38:12
to oscar it's closer to ottawa than i'm
38:13
comfortable with it being without
38:15
getting confused
38:17
so scratch and sniff is quite an
38:19
interesting technology actually yeah
38:21
um so it i didn't realize how long they
38:23
can last scratch and sniff patches they
38:24
work in this
38:25
really clever way which is that you
38:27
basically have these scent chemicals so
38:29
whatever you sent you're trying to
38:31
broadcast whether it's the smell of [ __ ]
38:33
that you want to send to an urban
38:34
dweller
38:35
or whether it's a smell of perfume in a
38:36
magazine that you want a lady to buy
38:39
or a man then it's tiny little scent
38:42
molecules
38:43
encased in tiny bits of plastic or
38:45
gelatin
38:46
and when you scratch it you break a few
38:48
of those bits of gelatin or plastic
38:50
and it releases the smell so it's kind
38:51
of like there are hundreds and thousands
38:54
of tiny little bottles and every time
38:55
you scratch it you smash some of those
38:57
bottles
38:58
and the scent goes up into your nose and
39:00
what this means is that it does last for
39:01
years so it can last for you know more
39:03
than a decade because
39:04
the bottles that you haven't broken by
39:06
scratching the scent's still in there
39:08
waiting for you to experience it it's
39:10
insane
39:11
yeah i just feel like we should be we
39:12
should be there should be a smell
39:14
archive and a small library where we can
39:16
preserve smells and put them in a
39:18
pyramid maybe
39:19
and then in thousands of years times i
39:21
feel like that must be one of those
39:23
things mustn't mean they put in a
39:24
pyramid though i want it to be quite
39:26
epic the pyramid is the main thing yeah
39:29
yeah i want someone to uncover it yeah i
39:31
went to a small museum once
39:34
uh it was in sunderland i think for some
39:36
reason
39:37
and um you went there and they showed
39:39
you lots of things from history
39:41
and you could go next to them and they
39:43
would fire smells out and tell you what
39:44
it was like so they had like
39:46
uh a pharaoh's tomb because they were
39:48
buried with lots of
39:50
specific um plants and um
39:53
perfumes and things like that you could
39:54
smell that and then another that was my
39:56
idea
39:57
well it this happened a long time ago
40:00
this is like 10 years ago i went to this
40:01
still i had the idea originally so
40:04
yeah it's a proof of concept and they
40:06
also had um
40:07
a smell of the sun so you went in this
40:09
room and they had a big picture of the
40:11
sun and you can go over and they sent
40:12
out the scent
40:13
of the sun and it just smelled really
40:16
metallic and
40:17
they've got you at the back of your
40:18
throat yeah really yeah and then i
40:20
bought the book that went with the
40:22
um with the exhibition and had that buck
40:25
in my house
40:26
and i had to throw it away after less
40:28
than a week because it just stunk out my
40:29
entire house
40:31
my whole house smelled like the sun
40:34
was it was it a scratch and sniff book
40:36
or was it just smells
40:38
uh i think it was supposed to be scratch
40:40
and sniff but
40:41
someone might have scratched it before i
40:43
brought it home because it just smelled
40:45
really bad
40:45
yeah they're not that reliable so i
40:47
found a story from
40:49
1987 where the bolt with the baltimore
40:51
gas and electric company
40:53
sent out um letters um to educate the
40:55
public on the smell of gas leaks and how
40:57
to
40:57
uh detect gas leaks and they included a
40:59
scratch and sniff sticker
41:01
um that you could scratch and get a
41:02
sample of what the gas smells like
41:04
the result was that um the gas was too
41:08
strong and
41:08
leaked out of the uh envelopes and the
41:10
stickers before anyone had opened them
41:12
and resulted in hundreds of people
41:13
um ringing up uh thinking that there had
41:15
been a gaslick in their house and it was
41:17
a false alarm
41:18
wow and where was it where was it that
41:19
you bought that book james did you say
41:21
it was in sunderland i think
41:22
sunderland called it that's right
41:24
sunderland
41:26
is is that why the sun yeah
41:29
wow well i mean it makes sense that it
41:32
would smell
41:33
metallic as well because as we
41:34
established on this podcast a while ago
41:36
the sun is not in fact
41:37
on fire it is um it is electromagnetic
41:41
um things so oh god tell us
41:46
so the second smallest um
41:49
if it was attached to a car that could
41:51
fit it would be
41:52
200 feet high that car um anyway so back
41:55
to sunderland
41:56
um the thing about um sunderland is
41:59
they've got that book and i found
42:01
another book which is actually a scratch
42:03
and sniff book and it's in york
42:05
um and it's the smells of the of the
42:08
city of york basically okay
42:09
it's just a beautiful collection so you
42:11
get horse stables
42:12
um you get the york moors you can smell
42:16
the moors
42:16
um but i particularly want to get this
42:18
book because one of the smells is the
42:20
smell
42:20
of a ghost right
42:24
how cool is that okay and what does that
42:26
smell like do you know
42:27
uh apparently it's not very good it's a
42:29
bit musky
42:30
according to people who've bought the
42:31
book um i
42:33
weirdly the people who complain about
42:35
the smell of the go say it doesn't smell
42:36
like a ghost
42:38
which begs the question how do they know
42:40
what one smells like
42:42
wow what what two combinations of
42:44
madness do you have to have to
42:46
thought that you've seen lots of ghosts
42:48
and then to decide to create a smell
42:50
that people can experience the ghost
42:53
with
42:54
there's a scratch and sniff movie uh
42:55
that was released in the cinemas once
42:58
um called polyesters by this guy called
42:59
john waters he makes um
43:02
quite cult cultish movies um and this
43:05
was a real gimmicky thing where
43:06
he called it uh you know on the poster
43:08
it said it was being released
43:10
um in odor vision and it was a
43:13
sensational movie
43:14
that kind of terrible punting you'd love
43:17
that
43:19
the kind of thing that gets bombs on
43:20
seats yeah um
43:22
and um yeah so the idea was that you got
43:24
10 scratch and sniff cards and you sat
43:26
there and as the movie was going on it
43:27
would come up with a number
43:29
and everyone in the audience would
43:30
scratch it as they were going along
43:32
smell what it was and he tried to toy
43:34
with the audience so you would think it
43:36
was definitely going to be
43:37
the object that was on the screen and as
43:38
you were scratching it they would
43:39
suddenly
43:40
chuck in some old shoes so it was
43:42
suddenly the smell of a boot
43:44
do you know what do you know what there
43:45
were ten smells and do you know what
43:46
some of them were i have some of them
43:47
oh yeah go for it so there was um
43:50
flatulence
43:51
obviously because that's the first smell
43:53
you're going to put into anything okay
43:54
but then do you have to write
43:56
your script to include these things
43:58
because it sounds to me like you're
43:59
saying well you have to have
44:00
flatulencing because that's an obvious
44:02
thing but then
44:02
if you have a really kind of tender love
44:05
story
44:07
someone farting half the way through
44:08
just so you get that smell
44:10
exactly i think they probably i bet i
44:12
bet there was a bit of a kind of putting
44:14
the cart before the horse sort of like
44:16
we've got these smells available to us
44:17
and you're gonna have to include them if
44:18
you want
44:19
but those flatulence there was skunk so
44:21
not really not a great
44:22
great do you mean um the drug i no i
44:25
think the animal
44:27
like um natural gas which again like you
44:30
know it's the same as farting
44:31
it's a bit yeah it's true i don't know i
44:33
feel like you're going to empty the
44:34
cinnamon if they can all smell gas
44:36
and air freshener which i presume got
44:38
rid of all the other smells
44:39
oh yeah that just sounds like a
44:41
necessary one
44:43
for all the rest of it so done with this
44:45
what's the idea of um
44:47
having the smell not relate to the image
44:50
it's that's
44:51
that's like showing a film and have it
44:52
be a funny gimmick that the visuals
44:54
you're saying don't match up with the
44:55
sound
44:55
that just sounds quite annoying no it
44:56
always matched up what it would do is
44:58
you thought you were gonna scratch and
45:00
it would be the smell of
45:02
say roses because there was a big vars
45:05
full of roses on the screen
45:06
and as you scratch suddenly in shot
45:08
comes smelly shoes
45:10
so it flips your yeah that's clever do
45:13
you know what other film employed the
45:14
use of scratch and sniff technology
45:16
spike kid's 4d you're kidding no true
45:19
that's what the 4d was it was jessica
45:21
fourth dimension was smell yeah did they
45:24
send in the smell of jessica alba's
45:27
child's poo
45:29
how that worked right at the beginning
45:32
of the movie you show the inspiration
45:33
yeah
45:33
um at the same time did you say it was a
45:36
romarama
45:37
um dan or smell-o-vision i think it's
45:40
odorama odorama
45:41
okay so there were a few of them around
45:43
at the same time that were trying
45:44
different methods to get smells in
45:46
and the reason was uh tv had taken off
45:49
and the cinemas were really worried that
45:50
they go out business because everyone
45:52
was watching tv at home
45:54
and another one that they had was
45:55
smell-o-vision and
45:57
the way that smell-o-vision worked is
45:59
all the bits of the cinema had little
46:02
kind of um vents which would send out
46:04
smells
46:06
uh rather than scratch and sniff but
46:08
unfortunately it didn't really work that
46:10
well
46:10
because people who were in the balcony
46:12
would get the smell a little bit too
46:14
late
46:15
so you would be like you were supposed
46:17
to smell one thing
46:18
and then the scenes moved on and then
46:20
suddenly you get the smell
46:22
and then in other parts of the theater
46:24
the odors were too faint
46:25
and so you just have lots of people
46:27
going
46:29
and then just sniffing the air and then
46:31
everyone else just got really annoyed
46:33
because they couldn't hear the movie
46:34
because everyone was just sniffing the
46:35
air
46:36
on the plus side you could get away with
46:38
with farting whenever you liked you
46:39
could be like
46:40
oh i guess there's a farting scene
46:41
coming up
46:46
and if they heard you can be like wow
46:47
this surround sound is really getting
46:49
amazing
46:51
the bass in our seats the seats are
46:54
moving it's 40
46:57

and that i wanted to say
00:19
um which we mentioned last week but that
00:21
is that we have re-released
00:23
the second year of no such thing as a
00:25
fish for free
00:26
on the internet so if you go to the
00:28
place where you normally get your
00:29
podcasts you will see
00:30

there in the past
00:35
so there's hours and hours of fun on
00:37
there hope you enjoy them

00:42
extra then you can go to no such thing
00:44
as a fish.com
00:45

[Music]

[Applause]
01:36
[Music]
01:39
hello and welcome to another work from
01:42
home episode of no such thing as a
01:44
fish a weekly podcast my name is dan
01:47
schreiber i am sitting here with anna
01:49
chazinski
01:50
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
01:52
and once again we have gathered around
01:54
our microphones with our four favorite
01:55
facts from the last seven days
01:57
and in no particular order here we go
02:00
starting with fact number one that's my
02:03
fact
02:04
my fact is nasa fixed its mars probe
02:07
by getting it to whack itself with a
02:09
shovel
02:10
did nasa send a shovel
02:13
with the probe just in case it needed
02:15
something to whack itself with
02:17
like in a cartoon and did did nasa once
02:20
they had it hitting itself with a shovel
02:21
did it go
02:22
stop hitting yourself mate stop hitting
02:23
yourself
02:27
so whack is uh as james pointed out to
02:29
me in an email
02:30
not the correct term technically it was
02:33
a little
02:34
push it was a little shove but it's been
02:36
reported as a whack
02:37
by most of the media i wouldn't call it
02:39
a shove it was a gentle caress
02:41
yes uh nasa fixed its mars probe by
02:44
gently caressing it
02:45
with a shovel stop caressing yourself
02:49
no really stop it we can see the video
02:52
oh
02:52
okay sorry i'll
02:55
put that away um so yeah so
02:59
uh this is um this is the uh mars probe
03:02
that landed
03:03
late 2018 it was in november and it's
03:06
the mars
03:06
insight mission and the idea is that
03:09
it's going deep into the interior of
03:10
mars which has never been done before
03:12
all previous missions have just looked
03:13
at the landscape
03:14
taken bits of soil this one's drilling
03:16
down to tell us about the planet
03:18
as nasa actually puts it on its own
03:20
website it's the first mission to give
03:21
mars a thorough checkup since the planet
03:23
formed 4.5 billion years ago
03:26
so it's it's a beautiful little thing
03:28
that they're trying to test out here and
03:29
as they were using
03:31
the machine that was drilling down the
03:32
drill itself which is called the mole
03:34
suddenly got stuck and they couldn't
03:36
work out why and this happened in march
03:38
of last year
03:39
and so for a whole year they've
03:41
desperately been trying to work out
03:43
how we can get this shovel to work again
03:45
because it's only gone something like 35
03:47
centimeters into the ground
03:49
when it's meant to go a full three to
03:51
five meters roughly
03:53
so they have no idea what to do and um
03:55
they've been thinking
03:56
a whole year they've had labs set up
03:58
where they've tested every scenario of
03:59
what they could do
04:00
and the answer finally that came to them
04:02
is just give it a little
04:04
caress and uh and it might work and it
04:07
has
04:07
so it's working again yeah initially
04:09
they tried to caress it on the side
04:11
didn't they uh yes they tried to move it
04:13
to the side of the hole which it was
04:15
drilling
04:16
uh and that might give it a bit more
04:17
purchase um but then they decided
04:19
they're gonna have to push down on it
04:21
and the problem is that there is a
04:22
massive
04:23
tether so the mole is attached to the
04:25
main probe with like a piece of wire
04:28
and what they didn't want to do was push
04:30
that and then damage the tether and then
04:32
not be able to do anything with it
04:33
because if you damage that then there's
04:34
no molding there's no
04:36
no nothing and it's also it's not a
04:38
drill it's
04:39
um kind of a drill would spin round
04:42
right wait james did you just say this
04:44
is not a drill
04:46
this is not a drill um so a drill would
04:50
spin round
04:51
um but there's nothing for it to grab
04:53
onto so you can't
04:54
kind of spin around like a drill it's
04:56
kind of an up and down thing
04:57
so it kind of pulls itself up and then
04:59
slams itself down and hopefully makes it
05:01
a little bit in
05:02
and then it keeps doing that again and
05:04
again and again and again and hopefully
05:05
gets about three or four meters in there
05:07
do you guys know why it's called insight
05:09
uh because they are citing the inside of
05:12
mars i think well it's a clever double
05:14
play on words so
05:16
nasa's just full of um these stupid
05:18
acronyms where obviously gives stuff a
05:20
name and then thinks well we better
05:22
attribute
05:22
you know something to each of those
05:24
initials so it's called insight it
05:26
stands for
05:26
interior exploration using seismic
05:28
investigations geodesy and heat
05:30
transport
05:31
and it actually had to have a name
05:33
change so it used to be slightly more
05:36
catchy than that
05:37
it was originally called the geophysical
05:39
monitoring station
05:40
which was gems but uh nasa suddenly went
05:43
oh god we've already got one of those
05:45
that's in in the workings so they had to
05:47
change its whole name so that it didn't
05:49
coincide with another one do you know
05:50
that insight has won an emmy
05:52
hasn't it no yeah before it won an emmy
05:56
for
05:56
um outstanding original interactive
05:58
program
06:00
um so nasa did some coverage of this
06:02
landing and of its
06:04
drilling and shoveling and all that kind
06:06
of stuff and you could go online and you
06:07
could interact with the
06:09
with the show and um it won an emmy for
06:11
it it was a bad year for tv that year
06:13
wasn't it
06:16
yeah and one other thing about insight
06:19
um do you know that they have
06:20
named a rock on mars oh okay
06:23
so um when it landed when the in sight
06:26
lander landed
06:27
it kind of knocked a little rock it's
06:30
only about the size of a golf ball
06:31
and it rolled about three feet away and
06:34
do you know what they named this rock
06:36
okay they named it after a famous
06:39
thing a famous thing did they name it
06:42
after a rock star
06:44
after some some famous people oh
06:47
the rolling stones correct because hey
06:50
it was a rolling stone wow
06:54
they've named this one tiny rock on mars
06:56
which is about the size of a golf ball
06:58
they've named it after the rolling
06:59
stones
06:59
it's almost more of an insult naming
07:01
that after the rolling stones it really
07:03
is it's not like naming a star
07:05
or a you know a moon or something is it
07:07
and isn't it it's named after all the
07:08
rolling stones they haven't picked one
07:10
that one rock is now just the full band
07:13
it's called the rolling stones rock
07:16
right although they could have called it
07:17
the rolling rock or the rolling stone
07:19
because that's effectively what it is
07:21
yeah but they've just decided rolling
07:22
stones rock did they observe whether the
07:25
rolling stone has gathered any moss
07:27
well we might come to moss later in this
07:29
show
07:32
spoiler spoiler just this was a very
07:35
very low tech solution that they used
07:37
the um
07:37
the whacker spade shovel mole thing yeah
07:40
it's whack-a-moles let's just call it
07:42
whack-a-mole
07:42
we've already got a caressa mole anna
07:46
sorry that's a very different game
07:51
um anyway this was a very low-tech
07:53
solution so uh there was another one i
07:55
found during the apollo 11 mission
07:57
and this is when they'd all got back on
07:59
the lunar module
08:01
and they hadn't yet pressed the button
08:03
to say take us back to earth
08:05
and armstrong was wearing his backpack
08:07
on the module
08:08
and it smashed into the switch there was
08:11
one switch they needed to turn on the
08:12
engine and begin the flight back to
08:14
earth
08:14
and he was wearing his big clunky space
08:16
backpack and it just broke the whole
08:18
switch off
08:20
like it was fine because they just
08:22
shoved a felt-tip pen
08:24
that buzz aldrin had been using don't
08:25
know why he had a felt tip pen on apollo
08:27
11.
08:28
but um you do if you watch the moon
08:32
footage when neil armstrong turns round
08:33
it says on his back
08:37
that's what that was for he still keeps
08:39
that pen on him to this day
08:41
buzz aldrin he stops yeah he takes it
08:43
everywhere he goes yeah it's
08:44
still working yeah it's still got ink
08:46
it's still
08:48
in many ways it's more impressive than
08:50
the moon landings
08:50
[Laughter]
08:52
i don't suppose he still uses it no he
08:54
carries it as his lucky charm
08:56
it was the thing that got them off the
08:57
moon so yeah because when we met him dan
09:00
you did have the word on your
09:01
back but that wasn't him who wrote it
09:03
no i'm still i'm still trying to find
09:05
who did that um
09:07
it's got similar handwriting to you
09:08
james but i don't want to make any
09:10
accusations
09:11
um that's interesting there's a i found
09:12
a fun term for the idea of whacking
09:15
something to make it work again which is
09:16
um percussive maintenance and it's
09:20
it's a thing that actually is
09:22
recommended by so many different people
09:24
people who work in the electronics
09:25
industry um there was a whole thing
09:27
about the fact that
09:28
um if a soldered connection needed to
09:31
reconnect sometimes it would lose its
09:33
connection and just by whacking it you
09:34
could make it
09:35
sort of reconnect so there's been so
09:37
many examples of percussive maintenance
09:39
uh throughout the years in nasa
09:41
territory skylab
09:43
uh when that went up there was a bit of
09:45
a problem on the outside of it and the
09:46
way that the astronauts fixed that was
09:48
during a spacewalk was to hit it uh and
09:50
that made it work again
09:51
um so that was very useful but then
09:53
there was also uh this great airplane
09:55
called the blackbird
09:56
the sr-71 blackbird have you guys heard
09:58
of this
10:00
this is a bird sorry this is a plane
10:03
no it's superman
10:04
[Laughter]
10:07
so this is a plane that um flew so high
10:09
and fast that when it was up there
10:11
the body of the plane would stretch
10:13
because of
10:14
you know the materials would stretch and
10:16
uh yeah yeah
10:18
yeah absolutely um oh god can i just
10:21
can i just repeat what you just said you
10:23
said so it went so fast
10:24
that the body would stretch you know
10:27
because like the body would stretch
10:30
i didn't expect for this to get picked
10:31
up i don't know where to go from here
10:33
that was not an acceptable explanation
10:36
dan is it the case that the pilots will
10:37
be sitting at the controls and then
10:39
suddenly they go whoa
10:41
and then they'll be sitting in the third
10:42
row yeah is it the people who are on the
10:44
plane are going i've got a lot more
10:45
legroom than i used to have
10:50
well i thought that was a thing with
10:51
planes that when you go to a certain
10:53
altitude
10:54
materials can stretch and shrink i
10:55
thought that was a classic thing
10:58
you've got to collect more information
10:59
on it in order to elucidate it for the
11:01
rest of us who don't know about it
11:03
well let's imagine that let's let's just
11:06
accept that this group had shrunk no
11:08
we're not accepting it okay
11:09
well i'm ready to accept it come on
11:12
let's accept that this thing is
11:13
stretched like stretch armstrong
11:15
the idea was that they built a plane
11:17
whereby the
11:18
panels didn't necessarily meet on the
11:20
ground there was a gap between them so
11:22
that when it got to that height and it
11:23
stretched they would lock into each
11:24
other
11:25
and then it could continue flying in
11:27
perfect harmony
11:28
at that height when it landed back on
11:30
the ground they would then
11:32
bash it back into shape of making those
11:34
gaps again for the next flight
11:36
hang on i'm a bit confused now about how
11:38
if the panels didn't meet on the ground
11:40
yeah and then it's stretched apart it's
11:43
a good i know what you're going to say
11:44
and it's a good question
11:46
are you sure it didn't squash it feels
11:48
like because it would be so
11:50
cold up there because it's a lot colder
11:52
in the sky it feels like the materials
11:54
would shrink
11:55
yeah it's another good point um
11:59
well it sounds like an amazing plane it
12:01
sounds like a hell of a plane i'm sorry
12:03
i didn't get to fly
12:06
it could you know how things if they go
12:07
faster than the speed of light they they
12:09
shrink maybe it's that thing maybe it's
12:10
the
12:11
um einstein thing i can only thank you
12:14
all for trying to help me out with it
12:15
um i don't think we're gonna get
12:17
anywhere constructive
12:19
did you know there's a there's a gorilla
12:21
suit on the iss
12:23
is that okay yeah what for for fun
12:26
they just said no yeah and they just
12:28
wear it sometimes on the iss
12:30
isn't that the least practical thing
12:32
you've ever heard of being sent up there
12:34
and it's not a sort of backup space suit
12:37
they'd run out of spaces
12:40
imagine the pictures coming from the
12:42
next time that
12:43
people go on the moon and you've got
12:45
three of them in spacesuits and one
12:47
guy's like oh sake i'm gonna do
12:49
the gorillas
12:55
in 2013 there was a hole in the iss
12:59
and it was probably caused by a tiny
13:01
micro meteorite
13:03
the hole was just a few millimeters to a
13:05
few centimeters wide
13:07
and they plugged it using an astronaut's
13:10
thumb
13:11
oh so did the astronaut have to stay
13:13
next to the wall
13:14
for the rest of the mission he's still
13:16
there he's still there yeah
13:18
no they cut his thumb off and
13:21
uh no they uh eventually used some
13:24
sealant but just
13:24
until they managed to get their correct
13:27
tools there uh he had to stand there
13:28
with his thumb in the back
13:29
that's great very cool what's the story
13:32
about the netherlands dyke and the
13:33
person who shoved their thumb in it to
13:35
stop the whole country flooding that
13:36
that's what you just said is the whole
13:38
story that's it that's the story it was
13:40
well told i thought
13:43
can i just talk about one more lo-fi
13:45
nasa fix it's one of the best it's
13:47
in 2012 when the iss was repaired with a
13:49
toothbrush
13:51
uh so yeah this was that they they have
13:53
four units on the outside that power
13:55
the iss and they're covered in solar
13:57
panels and one of them broke
13:59
and so the space space people the what
14:02
do you call them astronauts
14:03
uh the astronauts had to climb outside
14:06
to fix it
14:06
but the bolt was stuck because they
14:08
gathered so much space dust
14:10
that they couldn't quite get a handle on
14:11
the boat properly and they didn't know
14:13
how to get rid of the space dust they
14:14
were like well we need some sort of
14:15
little
14:16
kind of brush sort of hard stiff and
14:18
they use a toothbrush and i don't know
14:20
how they decided which astronaut
14:21
sacrificed their toothbrush yeah for the
14:23
sake of this bolt
14:24
but they brushed all the dust off and
14:26
then after that you're sort of brushing
14:27
your teeth with space dust which is
14:29
probably is probably
14:30
worth the sacrifice feels like it would
14:32
be more abrasive than a normal
14:33
toothbrush
14:34
yeah might help you brushing your teeth
14:36
with space dust
14:38
it could be the new thing colgate might
14:40
be about to release the next
14:42
toothpaste uh here's another tip if you
14:44
have a gap in your teeth just go up to
14:46
very high altitude
14:51
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:53
that is
14:54
james okay my fact this week is that we
14:57
don't
14:58
know what the greek philosopher plato's
15:00
real name was
15:01
plato was his wrestling nickname so
15:05
this is um from historian diogenes
15:09
laertes who wrote a lot about plato
15:12
and he said that his name came from
15:14
broad shouldered
15:15
which is what plato means uh and that it
15:17
was due to his physique because he had
15:19
big muscles he was known as being a
15:21
wrestler
15:22
he apparently competed at the ism games
15:25
and we don't really know what his actual
15:28
first name is according to diogenes
15:29
laertes it might have been aristocles
15:32
which means best reputation but we don't
15:34
really have much historical evidence for
15:36
that
15:37
so most people think that probably isn't
15:39
true but we do think that probably he
15:41
got his name plato because he was broad
15:43
shouldered well so i read
15:45
there's um three possibilities for why
15:48
he got called plato
15:49
in that same category one was broad
15:51
shoulders one was possibly breadth of
15:53
eloquence
15:54
um but my favorite one is that he had a
15:56
massive
15:57
forehead that's the third one did he
16:00
that supposedly had a very wide forehead
16:02
and that might have been
16:03
why he got caught there there was a the
16:05
the thing he took part in sounds really
16:07
intense this thing called the pancration
16:10
which is it's um it's a kind of fighting
16:13
where you can do
16:14
everything pretty much except biting
16:16
people and gouging out their eyes
16:18
um it's a bit like mixed martial arts
16:21
and it's so violent that when the
16:22
olympics came back
16:23
it was the only ancient olympic event
16:26
that was not brought back
16:27
and the archbishop of leon said we allow
16:30
all events to be reinstated
16:32
except pancration and that's what plato
16:35
was doing he was doing the ultraviolent
16:36
thing
16:37
although he was doing the least violent
16:39
of this admittedly extremely violent
16:41
practice wasn't he
16:42
i think he was up there but not quite
16:46
peak boxing was maybe the worst and then
16:48
the wrestling was seen as
16:50
you know the wimps element of of
16:51
pancratting i think
16:53
but you still had people like the other
16:55
um wrestling nickname i found was mr
16:57
fingertips
16:58
who was a fourth century bc wrestler in
17:01
the pancrastian and he was called mr
17:03
fingertips because his strategy was
17:04
every time a game started
17:06
he'd bend the opponent's fingers back
17:08
until they snapped and then that usually
17:10
would mean that they caved immediately
17:12
wow that is a pretty basic move in
17:15
wrestling isn't it it's hardly one ahead
17:18
of pulling someone's hair
17:20
or like kneeling down behind them and
17:22
then getting someone to push them over
17:24
i don't know it's pretty good it's like
17:25
if you're if you're doing a thumb war
17:27
and you immediately break your
17:28
opponent's thumb
17:29
then the thumb war is one at that point
17:31
i don't know i always think bending
17:33
people's fingers back is like a chinese
17:35
bun
17:35
it's a bit cheap you mean it's not fair
17:37
play it's a bit playgroundy
17:39
yeah it's it's a seminal move in modern
17:42
day wwf and wwe wrestling
17:45
it's what breaking someone's fingers
17:47
holding their hands and gripping them
17:48
and bending them it can lead to 10
17:50
minutes
17:51
honestly it's it's it's a biggie in the
17:53
world of wrestling
17:54
is that is that serious dan yeah yeah
17:57
yeah you they
17:58
hold each yeah yeah it's a it's a move
18:01
that you see a lot it's
18:02
it's almost a way of the wrestlers
18:04
during a big match getting their
18:05
breath back together you know it's it's
18:07
their it's their break moment
18:09
but they really bring the theatrics it
18:11
just makes it look like you're doing one
18:12
of those country dances where someone
18:14
skips underneath the arch that you're
18:16
performing
18:19
i wonder if like you know modern day
18:20
boxing and so on half of the
18:23
whole thing is the smack talk that
18:24
happens you know the taunting and so on
18:27
i'm just wondering what plato's smack
18:28
talk would be like because he would
18:30
dish out new philosophical ideas that
18:32
would crush your whole understanding
18:34
of the earth how could you fight once
18:36
you've been told about existence in your
18:38
place in the universe
18:40
i don't know i think it's particularly
18:42
easy to punch that guy in the face to be
18:43
honest
18:47
he might have shouted that you were a
18:48
featherless biped that was one of his
18:50
human slams that was how how he defined
18:54
man
18:55
and i think it was uh sort of saying
18:57
we're really no different from
18:58
creatures in a lot of ways but then he
19:00
came up against diogenes the cynic
19:02
who said that's a ridiculous way to
19:04
define man and he brought to plato a
19:07
live chicken
19:08
and plucked it in front of his very eyes
19:10
wait
19:11
sorry he plucked the chicken live
19:13
because if so diogenes has a lot of
19:15
questions to answer
19:16
i think it's better than killing a
19:17
chicken just in order to pluck it to
19:19
make a philosophical point
19:20
i think it's tough to pluck a live
19:22
chicken yeah
19:24
i think that's a real skill if you can
19:26
pl i've never tried
19:27
but frankly he should have been called
19:29
diagnose the optimist if he thought he
19:31
was gonna get away with it
19:35
maybe he was a wrestler too and got it
19:36
in a headlock or something
19:39
helped out but plato was forced to amend
19:41
his definition of man
19:42
to a featherless biped with broad flat
19:46
nails okay then that distinguishes us
19:49
from the chicken does that mean like
19:51
fingernails and toenails and stuff
19:53
it just means basically i think you look
19:55
for the first thing that we have the
19:56
chicken doesn't
19:57
it's quite a lot to pick from he went
19:58
for the nails chickens have got nails
20:01
but they don't know but they've got
20:02
they've got bendy like oh yeah that's
20:04
true yeah they're not flying well
20:06
it feels like a bit of a reach from
20:07
plato at that point yeah but here's what
20:09
i'm thinking
20:10
right he said broad flat nails plato
20:13
means broad we don't know where the
20:14
broad bit comes from but maybe he had
20:16
extremely broad nails
20:20
he just had really flat fingers yeah
20:22
maybe that's where he got his name
20:23
just the first thing you noticed about
20:25
him diochennes
20:27
like if diogenes was taking the piss out
20:29
of you i think that's pretty bad because
20:30
he lived in a barrel
20:31
yeah didn't he did he
20:34
if someone's coming up to you taking the
20:36
piss and it's like mate you live in a
20:37
barrel he looks like a barrel and he's a
20:38
cynic was he oscar the grouch
20:40
who is this he basically oh my god he
20:43
basically was
20:44
yeah i think oscar the grouch is based
20:46
on him i think he was just trying to
20:48
show the vanity of
20:49
human vanity you know yeah he lived in a
20:52
jar to tell humans that they were all
20:53
wait a jar
20:55
or a barrel because i think a jar is
20:56
worse the jar is smaller normally
20:58
yeah it's called a jar usually but i
21:00
think it was quite a large one i don't
21:01
think he squeezed himself into like a
21:03
jam jar
21:04
yeah but he also um he masturbated in
21:08
his barrel
21:09
oh no well i hope it wasn't a jar then
21:11
because that would be a hell of a view
21:13
to everyone passing by
21:14
people didn't find that amazing and he
21:16
used to defecate in theaters and stuff
21:17
didn't he diet
21:19
oh wait he was trying to escu society i
21:22
think
21:23
is the point i might be wrong about this
21:24
because i don't know much about diet
21:25
chinese but
21:26
i think that's what he's trying to do
21:27
and he's trying to go against societal
21:29
norms
21:30
and he lived in a barrel but then he
21:32
still needed to masturbate because he
21:34
was you know he had urges
21:35
uh and he couldn't leave his barrel so
21:37
he had to do it in a barrel but people
21:38
didn't like it very much
21:39
damn why did you say just that it was so
21:42
it was so particularly bad to masturbate
21:44
in the
21:45
jar with your barrel no one's going to
21:46
see inside you can do that in private in
21:49
your background
21:50
you're dying you're david blaining it
21:52
people are going to come and
21:53
visit to see you see what you're up to
21:56
did david blaine do that if i'd
21:57
known that i would have watched his
21:59
whole
21:59
you know stuck in a box gig i'm not sure
22:01
if he did did he leave the jar
22:03
to go into the theater to have a poo or
22:06
did he
22:06
have the jar taken into the theater
22:11
well like roll it along like a hamster
22:12
wheel yeah and then and then
22:14
sort of pull out of the end of it i
22:16
think this might have been at two
22:18
different stages of his life
22:21
i think he might have been past his
22:23
barrel years into
22:28
you've got to keep it fresh for people
22:29
haven't you got to keep ripping it up
22:31
he famously the thing about masturbating
22:33
was he always said
22:35
it because i think he begged for food
22:38
baby
22:38
and yeah he said it'd be better if i
22:41
could satisfy my hunger by rubbing my
22:43
belly
22:43
in the same way that i satisfy my sexual
22:46
needs by rubbing my genitals
22:48
that was his that was his saying wow
22:50
that's his catchphrase
22:53
pretty bold decision by the sesame
22:55
street writers to face oscar the grounds
22:56
on this guy
23:01
there are a lot of unedited scenes in
23:03
there
23:06
um he actually it's quite interesting he
23:08
gave an explanation for the origin of
23:09
the word cynic diogenes
23:11
so someone said why do they call you
23:13
diagonally the cynic and it meant
23:14
diogenes the dog-like as
23:16
it's from the same rover's like canine
23:18
and i think he says
23:24
i just everywhere no he said it's
23:27
because i fawn upon those who give me
23:29
anything and bark at those who give me
23:31
nothing
23:32
that's cynicism that's where that's
23:33
coming from according to him that's
23:35
interesting
23:38
okay it is time for fact number three
23:41
and that is
23:42
andy my fact is that the first ever
23:44
internal combustion engine
23:46
was partially powered by explosive moss
23:51
wow oh god
23:54
now people who listen to this podcast
23:56
might not know about addie's obsession
23:58
with moss
23:59
um because we've never let him do a moss
24:01
fight before
24:03
but for one of our books was it the last
24:04
book we did or the one before
24:06
uh one before yeah book of the year 2018
24:09
maybe
24:10
um we had an article on club moss and it
24:12
was andy's absolute fave
24:14
it was the longest article in the book
24:16
at the time of submission and
24:18
weirdly it was the shortest by the time
24:19
it actually made it to print
24:21
so revenge time um so this is an
24:25
internal combustion engine you know
24:27
powered by small internal explosions
24:29
and the thing which provided the
24:31
explosions was this moss
24:33
uh the machine was called the pyriona
24:35
four
24:36
and it was patented in 1807 which i find
24:40
unbelievably early um as in the patent
24:43
was signed by napoleon for this machine
24:47
and it was patented by a french inventor
24:49
called nisefo
24:51
niepsa and this machine
24:55
ran a boat the engine was attached to a
24:57
boat
24:58
and it was full of lycopodium dust which
25:00
is from a particular species of club
25:02
moss
25:03
uh and it it's very explosive this stuff
25:06
uh because it has lots of surface area
25:08
and it's 50
25:09
fat so it goes bang quite readily when
25:13
it's supposed to flame
25:14
and it there was a boat going around up
25:16
and down rivers
25:17
that's incredible i hadn't i didn't i
25:19
cuz i didn't look into this specific
25:21
one and it actually powered a boat yeah
25:23
but i think it was quite a small boat
25:25
wasn't it
25:26
it wasn't a huge boat yeah was it was it
25:29
on a model boating pond
25:30
it wasn't a model boat it was not
25:32
because i did read one place that said
25:34
it was a toy boat but i couldn't tell
25:35
whether it was or not
25:36
i mean all boats are toy boats if you
25:39
know if you're a giant
25:43
okay it wasn't it wasn't a massive boat
25:45
i think let's go that far
25:47
okay but it wasn't only a centimeter
25:49
long it was somewhere in between the two
25:52
it was somewhere in between a centimeter
25:54
and the titanic
25:55
yeah exactly yeah that's absolutely
25:58
clarified that for me thank you okay
25:59
it was pretty clever how it worked
26:00
though wasn't it because it would it
26:02
would use the energy from this
26:03
combustion engine and it would suck
26:05
water in from the front and push it out
26:07
the back and then it would use that
26:08
movement to power it forward yeah it was
26:10
always clever
26:12
um and um just on a little tangent
26:15
nyepsa the inventor it was him and his
26:17
brother who did it
26:18
um niebza is also the man who produced
26:21
one of the first ever photographic
26:23
images
26:24
20 years later imagine being at the
26:26
beginning of those two technologies
26:28
did he did he use the uh because
26:30
photographic flash was
26:31
in its sort of early days then wasn't it
26:34
and they used all sorts of explosives
26:35
and i think they used this in
26:36
photography and flash photography
26:38
and i wonder if he used that was he a
26:39
one-trick pony and he only ever used his
26:41
club
26:42
i don't know i think his photography
26:45
being as it was the very very first one
26:47
that ever
26:48
existed was before flashes yeah the
26:51
first one that he did it was
26:52
it was called the view from the window
26:54
at legra
26:56
uh and it was in 1826 and the exposure
26:59
time was eight
27:00
hours so i think a flash wouldn't have
27:02
helped much in that case
27:04
don't blink don't blink
27:08
and the um the light was a problem
27:10
because they didn't have flashes but
27:12
they used the light of the sun
27:13
but obviously the sun is not in the same
27:15
place for eight hours
27:17
and so if you look at this picture it
27:18
looks a bit like a charcoal etching to
27:19
be honest it's not a
27:20
you know it's not 4k but um you can see
27:24
the sunlight on the left hand side and
27:26
the right hand side because of the
27:27
really
27:28
time itself so cool to expose can i just
27:30
say about
27:31
club mosque quickly oh yes i just want
27:34
to i just want to
27:35
formally apologize andy it's amazing
27:37
thanks
27:38
is incredible i watched an amazing video
27:41
by a buddy of ours mutual buddy of the
27:43
podcast steve mold
27:44
uh from the festival spoken nerd where
27:46
he has powder uh powdered version of it
27:49
and
27:49
showing just how hydrophobic it is so
27:52
the idea
27:53
is that you could dip your hand into a
27:55
big body of water
27:57
if you have the powder just laying on
27:58
top of the surface area and come back
28:00
out
28:01
your hand will be sort of latexed a bit
28:03
looks like you've gone marigold glove
28:05
but you'll have a completely dry hand
28:07
that you can powder off i mean it's
28:08
extraordinary substance
28:10
i've never heard of that before that's
28:11
fine and you can set fire to water
28:13
using it can't you because it's so
28:15
extremely flammable and it coats the
28:17
water without you know being absorbed by
28:19
it
28:19
uh so you can sort of pour water covered
28:21
in club moss
28:22
spores out of a jar and then set fire to
28:25
it and it looks pretty cool
28:27
there are lots of uses um so it was as
28:30
anna said it was used for
28:31
uh flash powder for uh photographers
28:33
before they invented flash bulbs
28:35
it was also used to coat suppositories
28:38
i'm not exactly sure
28:39
why okay is it the same reason as your
28:42
hydrophobic fingers and
28:44
basically you don't want anything to
28:45
stick to it basically yeah
28:47
yes in fact it would be that because it
28:49
was also used as a coating for condoms
28:51
then because it was used
28:52
specifically to stop the latex and
28:55
condoms from sticking to the rest of the
28:57
condom before we had modern condoms
29:00
got it you said that was a lot of time
29:01
in that sense they felt very
29:03
felt very racy saying that all those
29:05
times i suppose the problem is
29:08
basically you're using spores and it's
29:10
not a good idea to put spores
29:12
in your vagina or anus
29:15
is that in case you give birth to sort
29:17
of a moss human hybrid
29:19
no it's in case it goes off like a flash
29:23
bulb yeah
29:26
and that actually is where the term
29:29
flashing used to come from
29:30
um because women used to go around parks
29:33
and then open their big raincoats and it
29:35
would be like a camera flash
29:37
yep that's incredible amazing etymology
29:40
i never knew that
29:40
i'm not i'm not buying it i knew you
29:42
were trying to make me believe that and
29:44
i'm not buying it
29:45
dan it's true it's true diogenes the
29:47
cynic used to stick his bum out of the
29:48
barrel
29:49
and he'd go hey look at this bang um
29:53
no but yeah james you're absolutely
29:54
right sticking spores in yourself is a
29:56
bad idea but
29:57
this moss was even used to coat surgical
29:59
gloves
30:00
so you would literally decide to go in
30:02
the
30:03
internal organs of people but you
30:05
wouldn't need the glove right
30:06
if you were like if you were a doctor
30:07
doing a finger up the bum check
30:09
you would just need to coat one finger
30:11
in in this club mask
30:13
and you would say well you're saving
30:16
four unused fingers of a glove
30:17
so you know that's that's handy from
30:20
what you're saying it sounds like if
30:22
you're a doctor
30:23
then you can use a glove five times in
30:25
five different bottoms
30:26
because you've got five fingers is that
30:29
is that what you're saying that's
30:30
literally what i'm saying yeah
30:32
oh would you say no offense mate
30:34
honestly it's just i only had the middle
30:35
finger left
30:38
i only had the thumb left i know i've
30:40
got broad nails
30:41
[Laughter]
30:42
they call me play-doh
30:46
um do you know some people who like moss
30:49
are the japanese
30:51
yes my japanese friend is obsessed with
30:53
it is that true data point yeah yeah she
30:56
goes around collecting it
30:57
that's so interesting because i read
30:59
this on the internet and i thought if i
31:00
say this probably lots of japanese
31:02
people write
31:02
and say we're not obsessed with musk so
31:04
i'm so glad that we have at least one
31:06
datum
31:06
um but there was a book written in 2011
31:09
called moss's my dear friends and it
31:12
sold 40
31:13
000 copies in japan and these days you
31:16
can get moss themed drinks
31:18
and you can get um like a ring which has
31:20
moss in it so instead of like a diamond
31:22
it sprouts out a little bit of
31:23
moss and actually the japanese national
31:27
anthem contains the word moss
31:28
does it no it genuinely does um it goes
31:32
may your world go on for thousands of
31:34
years
31:34
until pebbles merge into one giant rock
31:37
that's covered with moss
31:39
that's great beautiful it probably
31:41
sounds better in the original language
31:43
i do think so yeah so moss
31:46
actual moss which is a club moss is an
31:48
actual moss but actual moss
31:50
is a real life saver so it was used a
31:53
lot in the first world war on wounds
31:55
because they ran out of bandages so many
31:57
people were getting injured a lot of
31:58
exposed flesh a lot of stuff was rotting
32:00
and they suddenly realized they could
32:02
stuff a wound with moss
32:04
and first of all it's incredibly good at
32:06
absorbing liquid so
32:08
if you're bleeding it's very good at
32:09
absorbing that it can absorb 22 times
32:12
its own weight in liquid
32:13
it's twice as absorptive as cotton and
32:16
it's because 90
32:17
of the cells in moss are dead so they're
32:19
just like water bottles waiting there to
32:21
be filled
32:22
and also it makes the environment around
32:24
it really acidic which makes it
32:25
sterilizing so it also sterilizes wounds
32:28
so if you get a little suck just shove
32:29
some moss in it i think is it a very
32:31
specific kind of moss that they use
32:33
i can use any old you can't use any old
32:35
mask it's sphagnum moss isn't it yes
32:38
batman's awesome they used to use it for
32:40
diapers as well
32:41
ancient cultures would put it sort of in
32:44
a bag like
32:45
uh casing and put it around the children
32:47
so when they went to the toilet it acted
32:49
the same
32:49
it's another reason why diogenes kept it
32:51
in his barrel
32:52
[Laughter]
32:54
sphagnum is really good so there are
32:55
about 380 species it's a whole um
32:58
genus is sphagnum moss um but in the
33:01
first world war they had to harvest it
33:02
from peat bogs because peat bogs are
33:04
largely
33:05
sphagnum moss basically and by the end
33:08
of 1916 they were making a million
33:11
moths dressings every single month wow
33:14
so it was a huge
33:15
endeavor to create all that stuff yeah
33:17
yeah
33:18
sphagnum is great sphagnum is the main
33:20
ingredient of pete and
33:21
that is what's your favorite andy is it
33:23
sphagnum moss um
33:25
or club moss or just general mosses in
33:27
general i think or kate moss
33:29
that's fine it's not kate moss um
33:32
i think it's imagine kate moss
33:34
kate moss is your third favorite moss
33:39
crowd i think kate is my fourth favorite
33:40
moss okay it doesn't even list
33:45
okay it's time for our final fact of the
33:48
show and that
33:49
is chozinski my fight this week is that
33:51
we have arches in our feet for the same
33:54
reason
33:54
that we fold slices of pizza if we do
33:58
that
33:59
is it because feet are so delicious yeah
34:02
they're cheesy they're cheesy
34:04
we don't want to spill any of the cheese
34:06
it's to stop the cheese falling off
34:08
yeah this is a thing that
34:12
americans do a bit more than us i think
34:14
the pizza folding i think maybe because
34:15
they have bigger slices
34:16
so you fold a slice of pizza and it
34:18
makes it stronger and a new study has
34:21
just been done
34:21
in two foot arches and it's been
34:24
discovered that this is the reason for
34:26
one of the arches in our feet
34:27
and it's actually the lesser appreciated
34:30
arch
34:30
so this study is about you've got the
34:34
big attention seeking arch right which
34:35
is the longitudinal arch which runs from
34:37
front to back
34:38
and then you've got the transverse arch
34:41
which runs the width of your foot
34:43
and you can really see the transverse
34:44
arch when you look at the top of your
34:46
foot
34:46
it's the lump on the top of your foot
34:48
and essentially they've looked at that
34:51
and they applied lots of pressure to it
34:52
these scientists they got uh
34:54
really they got cadavers and they put
34:56
weights on them and then they cut the
34:58
transverse arch to see what kind of
34:59
weight they could hold comparatively
35:01
and they found that the stiffness of a
35:03
foot is reduced by 40 percent
35:06
when you cut that transverse arch so
35:08
it's there for stiffness
35:11
what is an arch made of it's bone
35:14
ligament tendony that all that the
35:17
usual that the body's made of
35:19
okay that's really helpful thanks dr
35:22
anna
35:25
well you know it's a bone and ligament
35:27
the foot does have
35:28
a quarter of the bones in your body both
35:30
your feet combined have a quarter of the
35:32
body's bones
35:33
so it's really really important that our
35:34
feet at this stiff it's one of the
35:36
things that really distinguishes us from
35:37
other
35:38
great apes is that we have the arches in
35:40
our foot generally
35:42
which allow us to be bipedal and to walk
35:45
and run
35:45
particularly over really long distances
35:48
so if you look at the feet of
35:49
chimps then they're completely flat and
35:51
that means that they can grab onto trees
35:54
and stuff like that
35:54
but they cannot run a marathon so in
35:57
your face chimps
35:58
well i know what you're saying about in
35:59
your face chimps but what i was thinking
36:02
is what would you rather have feet that
36:03
let you climb a tree or feet that let
36:05
you run a marathon
36:07
it depends on what you're trying to
36:08
escape from yeah
36:10
if you're trying to escape from polaroid
36:12
cliff
36:14
i'd probably climb up a tree i have a
36:15
tree if you're trying to escape from
36:17
tarzan
36:18
exactly he'd probably beat you at
36:20
marietta as well yeah
36:21
yeah he definitely would but actually i
36:23
think it um it doesn't
36:25
matter whether you've got this uh thing
36:28
or not
36:29
so there was a study of people who
36:31
visited the boston museum of science and
36:33
they studied all of their
36:34
feet uh and they found that some i know
36:37
what a weird
36:39
gig for scientists just to hang around
36:40
the museum saying hey can i look at your
36:42
feet
36:43
um but they found that some people had a
36:45
mid
36:46
tarsal break okay and what that means is
36:49
that the middle of the foot bends quite
36:51
easily
36:52
as you push yourself off the ground so
36:54
one in 13 people has a weird folding
36:56
ape-like feet
36:58
and if you have this and you walk on a
37:00
beach
37:01
you might see there's more of a ridge in
37:03
the middle portion of your footprint
37:05
which shows that that's where your foot
37:06
basically folds as you step
37:08
and most people don't know they've got
37:10
this which is very exciting i think it
37:12
would matter if you were doing
37:13
a marathon every day yeah that's true if
37:16
you're kind of doing a lot of long
37:17
distance running it would probably start
37:19
to hurt quite a lot
37:20
yeah yeah although it hurts all the time
37:22
anyway if you do lots of long distance
37:24
running so you probably wouldn't notice
37:25
that's fair enough um like hannah says
37:27
though the arches are for stiffness
37:29
so if you didn't have an arch going
37:31
transversely
37:32
so going from left to right and you had
37:35
flat feet
37:36
then you wouldn't have any stiffness in
37:37
your feet at all and they'd just be like
37:39
floppy bits of cardboard
37:40
yeah that would be a problem yeah that's
37:42
true flopping around so anna
37:44
also if this applies to american pizzas
37:46
which are much longer
37:48
than say a british pizza if you have
37:50
smaller feet
37:51
do you need the arch as much i guess you
37:53
need them less because you're bearing
37:55
less
37:55
weight i mean it would it would be
37:57
proportional uh and it's it's actually a
37:59
thing called
38:00
gaussian curvature which is something
38:01
that we briefly discussed years ago on
38:03
the show when we were talking about
38:04
corrugated iron
38:05
and it's the amazing effect that you'll
38:08
all remember that classic episode
38:12
i think it was in the 60s so we've just
38:14
put a load of
38:15
episodes back up for free and i think
38:17
it's one of those it is
38:19
so i will be good news guys it was an
38:21
absolute classic of the genre
38:23
i highly recommend the corrugated iron
38:25
session and we talk partly about how the
38:28
shape of that makes it stronger
38:29
and it's the same reason that for
38:31
instance you can't crack an egg
38:33
if you squeeze it really really really
38:34
hard and it's this thing that
38:36
this guy called i mean i think
38:40
i can i can you can't i can you can't
38:43
right
38:44
look i i haven't had seen an egg for
38:47
weeks
38:47
so frankly i can't at the moment i have
38:50
an egg downstairs can i run down and get
38:52
it yeah don't taunt me
38:54
on camera by breaking one of your few
38:56
available stalks of eggs
38:57
you won't be able to break it you could
38:59
break it if you shove your thumb into it
39:01
but if you just squeeze it
39:02
if i just squeeze it you won't break it
39:04
should i genuinely do it or should we
39:05
forget it and just move on i mean it's
39:07
an enormous waste of time because you
39:08
won't be able to do it
39:09
or you'll cheat and shove your thumb in
39:11
or bang it again i'm not gonna choose
39:18
you should put your face beneath it so
39:20
that if you end up with egg on your face
39:21
you actually won't end up with egg on
39:23
your face
39:27
if you do manage to do this at home you
39:29
know try it if you want as long as you
39:30
don't don't waste food but if you've got
39:32
an egg that's gone off do it
39:33
um sometimes you'll get an egg which has
39:35
got some kind of
39:36
imperfections in it and it is possible
39:39
if your egg is not
39:40
you know if there's a problem with your
39:41
egg here's the caveat
39:44
but most of the time it is impossible to
39:46
break an egg just by squeezing it
39:48
it is cool although weirdly i read that
39:50
a way of really emphasizing the gaussian
39:53
curvature the strength of it is to have
39:54
a hyperbolic paraboloid
39:56
which is basically having something
39:57
that's curved in two directions a bit
39:59
like our foot
40:00
and something that uses that is power
40:01
stations so you know if you look at
40:03
power station
40:04
it's curved uh or the cooling tower a
40:06
cooling tower yeah
40:08
um it's sort of doubly curved um because
40:11
it's
40:11
uh rounded but it's also got that curve
40:13
going in it's the opposite of what we
40:15
have on our feet
40:16
so in your feet your curves are both
40:19
going in the same direction
40:20
good point so if you turn your toes in
40:22
then it's bending in the same
40:24
way that the um left to right of your
40:26
foot goes
40:27
i'm not explaining this very well but
40:29
it's more like a pringle if you think of
40:31
a pringle it kind of
40:32
from top to bottom it curves one way and
40:35
then from left to right it curves the
40:36
other way
40:37
that's why it's impossible to break a
40:39
pringle if you hold it in your hand and
40:41
squeeze
40:42
i've tried it i can't do it this is my
40:45
problem
40:46
this is my problem with hyperbolic
40:47
paraboloids it's always used as the
40:49
example they go
40:50
and pringles use this technology as well
40:53
and it's like what are you talking about
40:55
the entire selling point of pringles is
40:57
that you can crunch them
40:58
they wouldn't be nearly as crunchy if
41:00
they were flat oh yeah that'd be
41:01
disgusting
41:03
i would hate to eat a flat pringle
41:05
genuinely
41:06
really yeah that sounds like an awful it
41:09
just
41:09
sounds creepy doesn't it you know what's
41:11
even stronger
41:13
if you have a corrugated iron style
41:16
crisp like yeah
41:17
koi's kind of thing a corrugated crisp
41:19
now that's a strong crisp
41:20
i can jump up and down on one of those
41:22
things for days and get nowhere
41:25
have you guys heard of um douglas mawson
41:28
no i was just studying things about the
41:31
souls of the feet so he was an antarctic
41:33
explorer
41:34
well he wasn't antarctic he was
41:35
australian actually but he was exploring
41:37
the antarctic uh in 1912 and
41:41
he wasn't bothering with the pole he was
41:42
doing the most
41:44
ambitious exploration of antarctica ever
41:46
you know thousands or hundreds of miles
41:48
at least of antarctica's very desolate
41:50
interior he was trying to you know
41:52
explore to map it
41:53
anyway on his way back with a hundred
41:56
miles to go
41:57
his partner had died he discovered
42:00
that the soles of his feet had
42:02
completely detached
42:04
the throat above genuinely i don't think
42:08
is that possible it's there was blood
42:10
and pus
42:11
spurting out and just all the skin of
42:13
his soles of his feet to come off so
42:15
somewhere there's an
42:16
actual footprint laying in the snow
42:19
well what he had to do was he had to
42:21
tape the dead souls back onto his feet
42:24
and put six pairs of socks on and then
42:26
keep walking
42:28
wow well anyway he survived he survived
42:30
and he became a national hero and he
42:31
lived another 46 years so the story has
42:33
a happy ending in some senses
42:35
um yeah he was lost for ages wasn't he
42:38
wasn't he away for years
42:39
and his wife married someone else and
42:40
then he returned to 12 years later and
42:43
that's odysseus that's sorry
42:46
surely when he came back he would be
42:48
like an inch shorter than when he left
42:51
i would know my husband anywhere and he
42:53
was five foot ten
42:55
you're five foot nine and a half
42:59
and some more stuff on feet yes please
43:01
yeah
43:02
our feet are just really good i think we
43:04
should be more proud of our feet
43:06
and i think we should just ban trainers
43:09
this is i've sort of been brainwashed
43:10
because there was that study that was
43:12
quite famous in 2004 by that harvard
43:14
professor and then a book based on it
43:15
called born to run
43:17
which is a really good book but sort of
43:18
about how we are we're born to run
43:21
and our feet are made for it and if you
43:23
look at we did in this series of qi the
43:25
raramuri people in mexico
43:28
and they can run for hundreds and
43:29
hundreds of miles and they just do it in
43:31
as thin a sandal as possible
43:33
because the ideal way to run is just to
43:35
have a very thin surface to protect you
43:37
from stones
43:38
or needles and uh then just use your
43:40
foot's natural strength
43:42
you can tell how fast a runner you will
43:44
be by how long your toes are
43:46
can you now yeah sprint sprinters have
43:49
longer toes than non-sprinters
43:51
and that's partly because if you have
43:53
longer toes your feet
43:54
stay in contact with the ground very
43:56
slightly longer okay is it also because
43:59
like
43:59
whoever gets to the end first it can be
44:01
any body part carnot that crosses the
44:03
line
44:04
that determines the winner so if you
44:06
have massive clown feet
44:09
that's why so many of the best friends
44:11
of the clowns
44:15
oh it's usain bolt in the lead but no
44:17
wait here's bobo the clown behind him
44:19
he's going up fast
44:22
hey do you know um you know einstein
44:25
famously
44:25
didn't wear socks yeah famously that's
44:28
what i think if you asked anyone for one
44:30
fact about einstein that's what they'd
44:31
say that's why he won his nobel prize
44:33
well wasn't it
44:34
yeah yeah that's pretty famous isn't it
44:37
he was a non-sock-wearing guy
44:39
i i had never heard that before i think
44:41
it's famous in the context of this
44:42
podcast
44:43
i think but yeah no i've i genuinely
44:45
never heard that dan that's
44:46
very interesting why did he not wear
44:48
socks like well we don't know we
44:50
he never said the real reason but there
44:51
is a thought that it's because he
44:53
suffered from
44:54
excessive foot sweatiness he was
44:58
he was fa he was he was famous in the
45:01
military circles
45:02
for having sweaty feet to the point
45:04
where he was not allowed
45:06
uh to uh sign up for the swiss military
45:08
because they said that his feet were too
45:10
sweaty they don't bad you from the
45:12
military because you've got sweaty feet
45:14
he had flat he had flat feet varicose
45:16
veins and excessive foot perspiration
45:18
was what's on the official report maybe
45:21
he would give away
45:22
if they were trying to attack somewhere
45:23
by night like a surprise attack
45:30
charlie dan if you have sweaty feet you
45:33
would wear socks because that's gonna
45:35
soak up the sweat
45:37
i would wear socks lined with sphagnum
45:39
moths which can absorb
45:40
30 times water yeah no as i say
45:44
he never he never said it was for that
45:46
reason it just it's an interesting
45:47
thing to notice i think you wouldn't
45:48
want to go around with wet socks but
45:50
then you've just got wet shoes instead
45:52
right yeah but the sole that inner
45:55
padding is a bit more
45:56
of a i think you could suck more water
45:58
into that and not be wet no i mean
46:00
because
46:00
the worst thing about wearing no socks
46:02
and trainers is the fact that it's too
46:03
sweaty
46:04
although it does make sense that the
46:06
military wouldn't allow him in because
46:07
that's why
46:08
prince andrew was so desirable to the
46:09
military wasn't it
46:12
an inability to sweat is really
46:13
something that they do look for
46:15
and interestingly he's very good at
46:17
holding pizzas when he's in pizza
46:18
express because he's learned
46:20
the galaxy curvature
46:30
okay that's it that is all of our facts
46:32
thank you so much for listening
46:34
if you want to get in contact with any
46:35
of us about the things that we've said

in a cupboard um so if you'd like to
00:48

01:26
episode over the show
01:42
hello and welcome to another working
01:44
from home episode of no such thing as a
01:46
fish
01:47
a weekly podcast my name is dan
01:49
schreiber i am sitting here with anna
01:51
chazinski andrew hunter murray and james
01:53
harkin
01:54
and once again we have gathered around
01:55
our microphones with our four favorite
01:57
facts from the last seven days
01:59
and in no particular order here we go
02:02
starting with you andy my fact is that
02:05
the inventor of condensed milk
02:06
gail borden had previously tried
02:09
inventing a biscuit
02:10
made of meat
02:14
sounds delicious yeah i don't like
02:16
condensed milk but i've read about this
02:19
meat biscuit and it sounds amazing it
02:22
sounds
02:22
i guess it kind of sounds a bit like dog
02:24
food i think but for people
02:26
okay that doesn't sound amazing but i
02:29
guess we have different tastes
02:30
well so he was alive in the mid 19th
02:32
century and
02:34
you know there are all these problems
02:35
about preserving food at the time
02:37
and feeding you know large numbers of
02:39
people at a distance or at a distance of
02:41
time
02:41
so especially feeding your armies things
02:44
like this
02:45
um this was a couple of decades before
02:47
the civil war
02:48
so he would have known there was a civil
02:50
war coming needed to feed people for
02:51
that
02:52
he had amazing powers of foresight
02:54
didn't he this inventor yeah i know
02:56
yeah i mean incredible actually um sort
02:59
of weird he didn't make his money out of
03:00
that
03:00
but he invented so much stuff um and one
03:04
of the things he invented was a beef
03:06
broth
03:06
which he then evaporated into this kind
03:08
of syrup and you could either fry or
03:10
bake
03:11
that syrup into a biscuit and um it was
03:14
a universally derided
03:16
not actually not universally the
03:17
scientific americans said it was one of
03:19
the best discoveries of modern times
03:22
okay that was a good review it also won
03:24
a gold medal
03:25
at the great exhibition in 1851 yeah but
03:28
the army tried it and they declared it
03:31
was not only unpalatable but
03:33
failed to appease the craving of hunger
03:35
producing headache nausea and great
03:37
muscular depression picky picky
03:41
but can we talk about some of the other
03:43
stuff that boredom invented
03:45
because he was incredible so lots of his
03:48
relatives very sadly died of yellow
03:51
fever his mother his wife and his son
03:52
had all passed away because of yellow
03:53
fever
03:54
so it was a summer disease predominantly
03:57
and one thing he decided to invent was a
03:58
giant refrigerator
04:00
to keep people in until they got better
04:02
that didn't work
04:04
yeah he tried him did you read about the
04:06
um
04:07
what's it when something amphibious the
04:09
amphibious machine he invented
04:11
the terrace yeah it was basically one of
04:13
those things that you get on the thames
04:14
in london wasn't it
04:16
uh which was like a duck river it was a
04:19
documentary
04:20
yeah it was built for prairies it was
04:22
like a wagon that could ride you along
04:24
the prairies
04:25
but then it transformed into a boat at
04:27
the click of a button
04:28
or the erection of a sail i guess once
04:30
it hit the water
04:31
it was horse-drawn wasn't it as well yes
04:34
so i guess the horse stayed on shore no
04:36
then attached seahorses to it once it
04:38
got in the water
04:41
yeah the poor horse didn't get to ride
04:42
the boat but it was pretty unsuccessful
04:44
i think on its first outing all its
04:46
occupants ended up in the water right
04:48
yeah it did so he went out a couple
04:50
times to the ocean
04:51
one time as you say it tipped over the
04:52
people into the ocean other times they
04:54
were just too afraid to let him take the
04:56
boat in
04:57
and i was reading an account of that
04:58
which gives you an idea of other food
05:00
inventions
05:01
that he had because he hosted a dinner
05:02
before he took everyone out on this boat
05:05
and uh there's a quote which is from
05:07
which he talked about the food that he'd
05:08
concocted that evening
05:10
out of material from which if you knew
05:12
what they were you would turn to
05:13
loathing and horror
05:14
i have transmuted even the dirt itself
05:17
into delicacies
05:18
that was dinner before the horror show
05:21
boat
05:22
experience that's brilliant
05:24
interestingly you know when
05:25
he um invented this biscuit i just want
05:28
to go back to the biscuit which i do
05:30
think is pretty cool
05:31
yeah so yeah he invented this biscuit
05:32
and then he went to the great exhibition
05:34
in 1851
05:35
and everyone said it was amazing like i
05:37
said the scientific americans said it
05:39
was amazing everyone thought this was
05:40
going to be the next big thing
05:41
and so he opened up a big office in new
05:44
york
05:45
okay where he could sell these biscuits
05:47
from and it was opened on maiden lane
05:51
in new york and it was and i can't quite
05:54
tell
05:55
from uh google maps it was either the
05:57
same building or it's next door to the
05:58
building
05:59
where the hamilton song or the room
06:01
where it happens
06:03
that room was on the same street and
06:06
it's either the same one or it's next
06:08
door to it
06:09
so are you implying that the song the
06:11
room where it happened is about
06:13
the room where the meat biscuit almost
06:15
took off
06:16
the original probably was right it
06:18
probably was about the meat biscuit and
06:19
then they thought oh you know what it's
06:21
not doing as well as we thought let's
06:22
change this musical from what used to be
06:24
about the meat biscuit business
06:26
now let's turn into something about
06:27
hamilton oh if only
06:30
i didn't know what the room where it
06:31
happens is i assumed it was a metaphor
06:34
of some kind but you're saying there's
06:35
an actual thing and anna knows the story
06:37
better than me but i think
06:38
is it not where they all got together
06:40
and decided
06:41
that the country would be a federal yes
06:44
system or something like that it was the
06:46
bargaining moment i think between
06:47
hamilton
06:48
and um and jefferson and his second in
06:52
command who was
06:53
madison and burr was not allowed into
06:55
the meeting and that's the meeting you
06:57
want to be in because that said that's
06:58
where power was
06:59
and meet biscuits madison actually came
07:03
out of that with his own set of demands
07:04
which is that he wanted to have some
07:06
square gardens
07:07
uh named after him in new york so
07:10
everyone got what they wanted a little
07:11
bit
07:11
[Laughter]
07:13
back to gail borden for a second uh did
07:16
you find
07:17
quite a few of the biogs of him say he
07:19
was a bit of an eccentric
07:20
and he used to ride around galveston on
07:22
a pet bull
07:23
apparently and he was quite an important
07:25
guy so he lived in this
07:27
place called galveston in texas but he
07:29
actually also helped design it
07:31
apparently so it was in 1829 he moved
07:33
there
07:34
and then he helped set up all the
07:35
streets of this place and the way they
07:37
measured streets was it was by the
07:39
number of
07:40
longhorn cattle that could move abreast
07:42
down the street which i suppose your
07:43
shows in texas at the time what was most
07:45
important the most important thing to
07:46
transport
07:47
so a hundred foot wide street could fit
07:49
14 head of longhorn cattle
07:51
wow and then uh borden basically then
07:54
went on to make his condensed milk
07:56
didn't he andy yes and that's what we
07:58
know him
07:58
best for today that's what we know and
07:59
love him for today but then gordon's
08:02
milk is like
08:02
i think in america still perhaps one of
08:05
the big brands is it
08:06
yeah it is but it wasn't called borden's
08:08
until after he died i believe
08:10
he was actually inspired to make the
08:11
condensed milk on the way back from
08:12
collecting his prize for the meat
08:14
biscuit right
08:15
he was obviously on a roll yeah yeah it
08:16
was it was on the boat on the way back
08:18
from london and there was cow
08:19
there were cows on board to help feed
08:21
the young kids on board
08:23
and they were too distressed to produce
08:25
their milk selfishly because of all the
08:27
waves
08:28
and so a lot of the kids on board died
08:30
and he thought we've got to have a way
08:31
of getting milk that doesn't require
08:32
sucking out the
08:33
others of a cow directly well the reason
08:36
that he became so popular is that his
08:38
milk was way better than everyone
08:40
else's because he had what was called
08:41
the dairy man's ten commandments
08:44
and if anyone was gonna sell him milk to
08:46
condense it had to
08:48
fit in with certain things that he said
08:50
had to happen
08:51
so for instance they had to wash the
08:52
cows orders before milking
08:55
and they had to sweep their barns clean
08:57
and they had to
08:58
dry their strainers every morning and
09:00
night and stuff like that but he came up
09:02
with these
09:02
specific rules that you had to adhere to
09:04
if you wanted to give him milk
09:06
well he was um working on his milk
09:08
around about the time where milk was
09:09
incredibly controversial wasn't he
09:11
because this is the 1850s and i didn't
09:13
know about this thing the great milk
09:15
swill
09:15
crisis uh but i'm sure everyone else
09:18
knows about it
09:19
uh which is basically uh this thing
09:22
happened where until
09:23
until industrialization people really
09:24
did have a farmer bring a cow around to
09:26
their door and they'd order milk from it
09:27
so you met the cow
09:29
and you got to okay it but with like
09:31
urbanization stuff
09:32
then you just had to buy milk without
09:34
having met the cow first hand
09:36
and so people used to start tampering
09:38
with it and a major problem was
09:39
distilleries
09:40
uh always bit roguish used to basically
09:43
set up
09:43
side alleys in dairy farming and they
09:45
just fill
09:47
and then they just feed cows all the
09:48
leftover kind of corn rye
09:50
swilly mash and it was really badly
09:52
infected and they'd sort of the milk
09:54
would come out and it would be a gross
09:56
watery blue color and then they'd fill
09:58
it up with things like chalk and plaster
10:00
to make it look
10:01
white and like real milk and people were
10:03
just dying by the bucket load
10:04
uh because these incompetent whiskey
10:06
makers were trying to give them milk
10:07
and so there was this huge huge crisis
10:10
and huge controversy and once they
10:11
closed that up i think
10:12
death rates went down about five times
10:15
in new york wow
10:16
that's so interesting about sorry to
10:18
pick up on a very minor thing you said
10:20
in that really
10:20
it's quite intense uh thing about
10:22
lifestyling um
10:23
but meeting the cow that gave you milk
10:26
and
10:27
um sort of knowing its name that's why i
10:30
guess they must have um the spokes cow
10:32
that they have for gordon which is elsa
10:35
yes because you would feel like okay
10:36
elsie's in charge here she's
10:38
she's looking after so they've had over
10:39
50 elsies over the year
10:41
um do you think everyone in america
10:43
thinks that they're all getting the milk
10:45
from this
10:46
one exhausted she puts on such a brave
10:49
front but my god she's knackered
10:51
yeah we've mentioned elsie before have
10:54
we
10:55
like incredibly briefly we mentioned her
10:57
when we were talking about
10:58
i think she was censored because she had
11:01
others
11:02
and elsie has undergone a bit of a
11:04
transformation from the first time she
11:05
appeared she used to be a complete cow
11:08
as since she used to be actually a cow
11:11
and then she's kind of started she was
11:13
put on her hind legs and she was dressed
11:15
in pineapples and things
11:17
and so she was in the kind of uncanny
11:18
valley between human and cow
11:20
and i think hollywood censored her
11:21
because she was a bit too sexy
11:24
that for a cat that sexier than a cow
11:26
should be basically you don't want to be
11:27
turned
11:28
on while you're trying to eat your
11:29
breakfast cereal no way
11:32
okay i do actually just if we're on milk
11:35
i have one more thing about condensed
11:36
milk
11:37
because i think i might have found an
11:39
earlier example of condensed milk
11:41
which is saint cuthbert saint cuthbert
11:44
was alive in the 7th century a.d
11:46
and he according to legend he chopped
11:50
his own leg off
11:51
after speaking angrily to his parents
11:54
and it was then replaced with a cast
11:56
that was made
11:57
of milk and so i think that is a
11:59
possible example of earlier
12:01
milk condensation what are you talking
12:04
about
12:05
so you know miracles happen and you if
12:08
you cut your own leg off because you're
12:10
you've been speaking angrily to your
12:11
parents and you're remorseful sometimes
12:13
god will grant you a new leg and his new
12:14
one happened to be made of milk
12:17
anyway there's one weird connection
12:18
which is that there is a cuthbert's
12:20
cooperative society
12:22
uh which was a shop it's now called
12:24
scott mid so it's one of the big
12:25
scottish
12:26
uh grocery shops and they hired
12:29
in 1944 sean connery as a milkman
12:33
today no way yeah okay
12:36
so so the sorry what's the link again
12:40
well so cuff the the supermarket it's
12:43
called
12:44
casper it's cooperative and sean cut it
12:48
what's sean connery got to do with it
12:51
has he got a leg made of milk
12:54
yeah it's the man with the milky leg the
12:56
sequel to the man with the golden gun
12:59
it was one of q's less popular
13:06
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:08
that is my fact
13:10
my fact this week is that in 2014 four
13:13
non-related economists with the surname
13:16
goodman
13:16
published a paper about the economics of
13:18
surname sharing
13:20
the paper was titled a few good men
13:23
very clever you've got to wonder what
13:25
came first that title
13:26
or any of the rest of it there actually
13:29
none of them was called goodman when
13:30
they first started the paper they all
13:32
had
13:32
name well they were very strict about
13:34
that actually because
13:35
um they claimed that this is the first
13:37
paper co-authored by four non-related
13:40
surname-sharing economists
13:41
and there was a thought that this could
13:43
be challenged because there was a paper
13:45
published by
13:46
scarbeck scarbeck scarbeck and scarbec
13:49
back in 2012
13:50
um but they disqualified it from beating
13:53
them to it because they said it was
13:54
written by two brothers
13:55
and their two wives so they argued that
13:57
first
13:58
the fact that um the two wives had their
14:01
maiden names before they started the
14:03
paper
14:04
and then took on the name scarback uh
14:07
disqualifies them so they did it during
14:08
the research and also
14:10
one of the brothers and his wife are not
14:12
economists they're
14:13
attorneys and so that also knocked them
14:15
out they were very thorough so in this
14:17
paper
14:17
um they looked at how likely it is for
14:21
other groups of economists with the same
14:23
name to um
14:24
share papers didn't they they had a data
14:27
set with loads of names of economists
14:28
and they found that 45
14:30
of them share a surname with at least
14:32
one other economist
14:33
so i think that it might be helpful but
14:35
the main reason
14:36
that they think this whole thing might
14:38
help is that
14:40
if you have loads of people with the
14:41
same name then you don't have that
14:43
problem where
14:44
the paper is by dan schreiber at al and
14:47
we don't see who the other people who
14:49
wrote the paper are
14:50
why do they do they just pluralize the
14:52
surname basically by four goodmans
14:54
they just say by goodman at al but they
14:57
don't refer to exactly which goodman
14:59
is the first goodman so actually
15:02
everyone is getting
15:03
equal um billing it's like if we all
15:06
changed our name to tashinsky
15:08
and then we went to do a gig and then in
15:10
big lights on the theater
15:12
it said to shinsuke to shinsuke to
15:13
shinsuke and toshinsky we wouldn't know
15:15
who was the top of the bill of course it
15:16
would be me but we wouldn't know who it
15:18
was
15:18
yeah exactly i'm not falling for that
15:20
i'm not rocking up to a fish gig with
15:22
harkin and at
15:23
all nice try buddy
15:27
i've read a thing about surnames and
15:28
actually this is a beatles fact so dan
15:30
i'm probably going to defer to you on
15:31
this one but
15:32
is that the case that um paul mccartney
15:35
wrote yesterday
15:37
yes this quiz is easy all right next
15:41
okay no but i read that um john lennon
15:44
became furious when he was in hotels
15:46
because
15:46
quite a lot of the time the person
15:48
playing the piano in the hotel
15:50
would play yesterday as a tribute to him
15:53
and
15:53
he hadn't written any of that song at
15:55
all it wasn't a leonard mccartney song
15:57
it was just a
15:57
mccartney song and so that that made him
16:00
furious yeah that's true
16:01
yeah two people have that confirmed
16:05
so if you're if you ever see andy in a
16:07
hotel and you want to pay tribute to him
16:10
don't play him the episode if no such
16:12
thing as a fish where alex bell was here
16:14
instead of him because that'll just
16:15
annoy him
16:16
exactly i'll be so angry i'll be amazed
16:18
at your piano skills if you can play
16:20
that episode
16:22
girl batch of those that poor penis
16:24
getting requests for
16:25
do you know episode 313 no such thing as
16:28
a
16:29
banana with wi-fi it's the same dude
16:33
everyone's the same um
16:36
on surnames in academia and problems at
16:39
this poses
16:40
so the same surname problem is a serious
16:42
issue and it's especially an issue in
16:44
china because in china there are 200
16:48
000 people per unique surname right so
16:50
they've got far fewer surnames in china
16:53
and uh i read a piece written by a wang
16:55
a j wang who was saying there are more
16:57
than twelve hundred
16:58
j wangs j wangs in nanoscience alone
17:02
so this is i mean this is hell so if you
17:05
want to find an individual academic you
17:06
can't find them because you have you
17:08
know
17:08
200 000 wangs to deal with so now in
17:11
academia you get something called your
17:12
orchid which is standardized now across
17:14
most
17:15
journals so rather than being one of a
17:17
billion you know smith's
17:19
wangs you have to have a 16 digit number
17:21
but there is an issue because dead
17:23
scientists probably won't sign up to
17:24
this awkward system
17:25
because they can't and so this the worry
17:29
is that now if you're a deceased
17:30
scientist your academic work
17:32
is going to become harder and harder to
17:33
source so have you guys heard of dick
17:35
aspman
17:36
uh no i've never heard of it he was a
17:39
gas station employee from canada
17:42
and his name if you look him up on
17:43
wikipedia it says his name propelled him
17:46
to celebrity status across north america
17:48
for four months in 1995
17:51
wow that is like the um who was it the
17:54
andy warhol
17:55
isn't it it's there everyone has their
17:57
four months of fame
17:58
yeah exactly i think it's because david
18:01
letterman
18:02
found out that there was someone called
18:03
dick ass manner he found this so funny
18:05
that he um
18:06
you know kept on referring to him this
18:08
became known as asmania
18:09
and um eventually
18:12
eventually his dad by the way was called
18:14
adolf ass man which is amazing
18:16
i mean what an amazing yeah wow if
18:19
you're only allowed to change one of
18:20
those names
18:22
it's so hard to know what to choose
18:28
um yeah and so he became super famous
18:31
and then he faded into obscurity
18:32
and then but there was another aspen
18:34
recently who got in trouble over a
18:36
vanity license plate
18:37
another canadian i believe who had asked
18:39
man on his license plate and the
18:41
authority said no you can't have that
18:42
anyway that's that name i have a very
18:44
random surname fact while we're just
18:46
lobbing in some
18:46
good old surnames um i just read this uh
18:50
late last night
18:51
cilla black the singer and um tv show
18:55
host i found out what her real surname
18:56
is do you guys know where her real turn
18:58
is no cilla white and uh
19:01
she only got the name change as a result
19:04
of a mis
19:04
print in a mersey beat newspaper when
19:06
she was starting out they called her
19:08
cilla black
19:08
and she just went oh that's a bit of a
19:10
misprint isn't it yeah
19:12
it's a massive it's a massive type yeah
19:14
it's not a typo at all
19:16
so it's like literally the difference
19:18
between black and white
19:23
yeah good call but i can't believe she
19:25
styled it out and just went oh yeah yeah
19:26
that's me
19:27
like like when a boss and the boss says
19:29
your name wrong in a meeting
19:31
okay i guess i'm mike for this meeting
19:33
yeah
19:34
she did it for her whole career
19:38
okay it's time for fact number three and
19:41
that is
19:42
anna my fact this week is that if you
19:44
wanted to have a bath in paris
19:46
in the 1820s you could have one
19:48
delivered to your door
19:50
this is the bath delivery service did
19:53
you have to
19:54
take the bath outside of the door or
19:56
could you bring it into your house
19:59
or what it was it was brought into your
20:01
house sorry so it was delivered to your
20:02
door and then up your stairs and
20:04
into whatever room you chose to bathe in
20:06
so this was called the ba
20:08
domicile and it was so popular in paris
20:10
in the 1820s
20:12
and yeah someone would come along a guy
20:14
called a thermaphore
20:16
would deliver a bath to your doorway and
20:18
then they'd also bring these metal rails
20:20
so they could wheel it up the stairs on
20:22
these rails
20:23
plunk it down they also came with a
20:25
dressing gown and a towel
20:27
and you could you'd order your flavor of
20:30
bath so if you wanted a hot bath you
20:32
would say
20:33
if you wanted a refreshing cold bath
20:35
that like may have been less money i
20:37
don't know but that was also an option i
20:38
know when you say flavors
20:40
i don't usually associate hot and cold
20:42
as flavors
20:43
so was there any other anything else
20:46
that you could choose like pistachio
20:48
i think there was one other choice
20:50
mineral
20:51
yeah it's not again not a flavor mineral
20:54
is not a flavor
20:55
um well i think it spices up birth time
20:58
a bit if you do refer to them as flavors
21:00
turn on the hot flavor cold flavor sure
21:03
try it next time i love the fact that
21:06
they brought along a towel that feels
21:07
like the
21:08
least important bit of the entire
21:10
enterprise
21:11
what so was this a porcelain bath they
21:13
were bringing or was it made of
21:14
something like
21:16
what do you do do you just drip dry
21:17
whenever you get out the bath
21:19
of course i do of course i do just stand
21:22
in the street
21:22
letting nature do its work
21:27
it's very important to bath time to have
21:29
a towel
21:30
obviously do you jump do you jump out
21:32
like a dog and shake all of the water
21:34
off you
21:34
i just i just shake it off once and then
21:37
i'm normal again
21:38
[Laughter]
21:40
sorry you were saying was it a porcelain
21:42
anna was it porcelain
21:44
they were made of various different
21:46
materials apparently some are made of
21:47
leather
21:48
um and some were foldable pliable
21:51
apparently they said in one article so
21:54
i guess i thought if it was leather and
21:56
you had like a hot flavored bath then it
21:58
might warp
21:59
i don't maybe they had better technology
22:01
that we've now forgotten
22:03
like secret leather yeah yeah
22:06
i love the bath some you're playing some
22:08
weird sex games
22:13
that must have been a no questions asked
22:15
service
22:18
anyway what a great service it is but it
22:20
seemed to sort of
22:21
disappear as i guess trends do so they
22:23
think i think there are a thousand of
22:25
these bars for rent in paris by the
22:27
mid-1820s and then they receded again
22:30
bathing was a bit controversial i think
22:31
some people thought it was a bit
22:33
lascivious there was a famous prostitute
22:35
caught as a french courtesan who had two
22:38
baths and that was a bit
22:39
frowned upon like oh that's the kind of
22:40
thing called stands do and she actually
22:42
had in one of her baths that was made of
22:44
that was
22:45
that was made of silver she had three
22:47
taps one of which delivered water and
22:49
another delivered milk and the other
22:51
champagne
22:52
just on the flavor thing though uh
22:53
because james was saying stuff about
22:55
what did you say like
22:56
almonds and stuff like that that i
22:58
stabbed pistachio but it was just the
22:59
first flavor that came into my hand yeah
23:01
but
23:01
that was a thing like there was the sort
23:03
of prototype back then of the bath bomb
23:06
that gives the color and and aroma that
23:08
you get with them
23:09
in the form of things like clouded
23:12
powdered
23:12
almond paste and then milk was another
23:15
big one
23:16
and largely i think that was a modesty
23:18
thing for women
23:19
the idea was that you would have the
23:21
bath not necessarily in a bathroom but
23:22
possibly in an open room and so it just
23:24
created
23:25
a layer of camouflage to stop your bits
23:28
from being seen
23:29
um you see that but i think let's say
23:32
you have some nice redox in your bath or
23:34
something and it smells of lavender
23:36
then you come out of your bath and you
23:37
smell like lavender
23:39
i probably don't want to smell like milk
23:42
after you get out of the bath don't you
23:43
know what i mean
23:44
i i like milk i wouldn't mind smelling
23:46
like fresh is the milk fresh
23:48
that's the to begin with it will be
23:51
that's a really good show using if
23:53
you're using the patent murray drip dry
23:55
method then over time that milk will
23:57
curdle
24:00
also i don't know how clean you can
24:01
claim you are if you're stepping out of
24:02
the bath and you're sort of covered in
24:04
bits of pine nut and almond
24:06
seed and whatever else it was that they
24:08
had well there was another thing where
24:09
you used to have and this was more for
24:11
the
24:11
aristocracy you would have two baths so
24:13
you would have the bath that had the
24:14
bath bomb in it like the milk and the
24:15
almond you'd go in and wash down then
24:17
you'd get out and go into your next bath
24:19
and that would be just the clear water
24:21
and you could just wash
24:22
in the purity of that and then get out
24:24
according to the smithsonian
24:26
i read this on the website sometimes you
24:27
wouldn't actually get into your actual
24:30
bath you would wrap yourself in blankets
24:32
and then you would lie
24:33
or sit on sticks of wood which were
24:35
balanced across
24:37
the tub of water i can't believe this is
24:39
true
24:40
like you're being steamed yeah basically
24:42
yeah i mean i really can't believe this
24:44
is true
24:44
and is that is that to make you more
24:46
healthy to consume and to give you a
24:47
more satisfying crunch
24:49
i mean that's why you do it to broccoli
24:50
isn't it
24:53
yeah um it's weird that we're talking
24:55
about baths in this one and
24:57
someone we talked about earlier in this
24:58
podcast has quite a strong connection to
25:00
bathing adolf fast man
25:06
no adult fast man i tried to think of
25:07
the bath that he'd come up with
25:10
gail borden of meat biscuit fame also
25:13
invented a wagon which
25:15
women could wheel down down the beach
25:17
and to the shore
25:18
and then they could descend from there
25:19
into the water without anyone seeing
25:21
them which we had in the victorian era
25:22
but he invented that
25:23
in america for ladies to use so a
25:26
bathing entrepreneur as well
25:28
do you guys know who invented the
25:30
heart-shaped bathtub
25:33
uh no i can't believe they're not famous
25:35
for it though
25:36
have you guys heard of the heart-shaped
25:38
bar no no
25:39
okay so this is a thing in america i
25:42
think
25:42
uh which is where you have a bathtub
25:44
which is shaped in the classic heart you
25:46
know so i guess the two of you
25:48
sit it it's for it's for couples the
25:51
inventor of this thing was a guy called
25:52
morris benjamin wilkins
25:54
and i just i like him so much this guy
25:57
because he he served in the u.s navy he
25:59
was in submarines
26:00
um and then he came out of the navy came
26:03
out of the submarine and decided to
26:05
invent a new kind of bathtub i guess to
26:07
preserve a bit of the submarine
26:08
experience um
26:10
and again if that's the opposite that's
26:12
the opposite experience
26:15
in a submarine you're out of the water
26:19
you're right if you wanted to do that he
26:21
would just be in the sheath
26:23
inside the bath yeah he would be in like
26:25
a metal sheath
26:26
yeah okay or laying on the twigs above
26:29
the bath like your other invention
26:31
did he get fired from being a submariner
26:33
because he kept trying to fill up the
26:36
submarine
26:38
okay i badly misspoke he hated
26:40
submarines so much that he failed to
26:42
create the opposite of a submarine
26:46
but he he um if you look him up again on
26:48
wikipedia if
26:49
it says that he is credited with making
26:51
the pocono mountains in northeast
26:53
pennsylvania
26:54
the honeymoon capital of the world now i
26:57
have never heard of these mountains
26:58
before now
27:00
so i don't know if they really are but
27:01
he invented this bathtub and then he was
27:03
so emboldened by it
27:04
wilkins that he went on to create the
27:06
champagne glass bathtub
27:08
this is unbelievable it's seven it's a
27:11
it's an actual champagne glass
27:12
and you know one of the shallow ones not
27:15
a very high flute
27:16
yeah is that be a disaster the one
27:17
that's based on barry antoinette's press
27:19
exactly
27:20
yes and it's it's it's that shallow
27:22
shape a coop
27:23
uh and uh you can both sit in there but
27:25
you are seven feet off the ground
27:27
and supported by this incredibly narrow
27:29
looking wow
27:30
yeah it's really really cool there
27:33
uh i think you need a ladder to get in
27:35
there no you're in um
27:36
you're in a much higher champagne flu
27:38
and you kind of flow over the edge
27:40
[Laughter]
27:43
[Applause]
27:44
okay it's time for our final fact of the
27:46
show and that is james
27:48
okay my fact this week is that dogs can
27:50
suffer from a sprained
27:52
tail if they get too happy
27:55
sweet so nice yeah it's sweet isn't it
27:59
so this um i read about this in a news
28:02
article about
28:03
rolo who was a seven-year-old dachshund
28:06
who managed to strain his tail by
28:08
wagging it so hard
28:10
his family are at home a lot more at the
28:12
moment and so he's always happy because
28:14
his humans are around and so he kept
28:17
wagging his tail
28:18
and he strained the ligaments and it
28:21
turns out that
28:22
strained tails is a thing with dogs that
28:24
you need to worry about i've never had a
28:26
dog so i didn't know about this but
28:27
apparently it's a problem
28:29
how problematic is it because their
28:30
tails aren't offering that much are they
28:32
a bit of balance but if you sprain it
28:34
it's not like an ankle i guess it's just
28:36
more painful than um awkward for their
28:39
lives
28:40
um it's a thing called limber tail it's
28:42
also called dead tail
28:44
swimmer's tail cold tail frozen tail
28:46
spraying tail limp tail sprung tail and
28:48
broken tail
28:49
um lots of synonyms for it did you say
28:53
swimmer's tail
28:54
swimmer's tail because that's one of the
28:55
main times you get a sore tail if you're
28:58
a dog
28:58
if you've been swimming in water that's
29:01
too cold
29:02
or too hot so either of the flavors then
29:05
it narrows the space where your spinal
29:08
cord goes through
29:10
and that can cause basically your uh the
29:13
bones to kind of rub against the
29:15
ligaments and stuff and that can cause
29:17
problems and cause you to
29:18
to have injured ligaments ouch so always
29:20
request the mineral option
29:22
for your dog bath yes exactly yeah is
29:25
this
29:25
is this quite common james this is
29:27
something that a lot of people
29:28
who have dogs are often at the vet for i
29:31
don't think it's the most common thing
29:32
in the world but it is definitely a
29:34
thing that happens if you look on the
29:35
internet and google
29:36
engine tail like i say i don't have a
29:39
dog
29:40
and i do have a cat and she seems fine
29:43
yeah it's not as
29:44
it's not as common as worms is it no
29:46
it's less common than worms but more
29:48
common
29:49
than being hit by a meteorite yeah
29:52
i've grown up with dogs and we never had
29:54
to take them to the vet for a springtail
29:56
but then we made sure they were never
29:57
happy
29:58
because just didn't want the hassle
30:01
it's not just happy that they wag their
30:03
tails when they are right
30:05
it's right they they do it when they're
30:07
angry they do it when they're about to
30:08
attack there's different kinds of
30:10
wags um and i was reading there was a
30:13
guy called dr
30:14
roger mugford who invented a wago meter
30:17
and the wago meter so uh dr
30:20
mugger dr mugford uh probably best known
30:23
for retraining prince and bull terrier
30:25
dottie after it bit two boys that's how
30:27
i know him
30:28
best known unbelievable
30:32
so he created the wago beater which can
30:35
indicate whether or not the dog is happy
30:36
or angry or
30:37
about to attack and it's a sensor that's
30:39
attached to its tail
30:40
what it's used for though is when they
30:42
do dog shows um they want to sometimes
30:44
tell who's the happiest dog
30:46
so the wago meter is put on the dogs and
30:49
it monitors
30:50
the wag that's going on to then
30:52
officially scientifically
30:54
using mugford's wagon me to determine
30:56
who the happiest is yeah i think we're
30:58
all the mugford's here
31:01
they do definitely have different wags
31:03
though that you can kind of tell
31:05
so if it's um apparently if they do like
31:07
a really slow
31:08
quite stiff wag then that's when they're
31:10
saying go away
31:11
i might attack you i'm anxious okay but
31:14
left and right is the difference too
31:15
so if they i had no idea about this
31:17
before looking this up that
31:19
a tail wagging to the left is negative
31:21
emotions
31:22
and wagging to the right is happy and i
31:24
thought the dogs just wagged their tails
31:25
left and right
31:26
yeah the wag was a wag i would have
31:28
thought a black would be left then right
31:30
that left then
31:31
exactly yeah oh no they they lean they
31:33
um they tend to one side
31:35
unless our dog's a bit lopsided but is
31:38
there a stage left or
31:40
is it the dog's left or is it my left
31:42
it's the dogs left yeah
31:43
that's important to know it's from the
31:45
perspective of the dog because it's
31:46
about brain hemispheres right the same
31:47
as in humans so
31:48
amazingly they've got similar brain
31:50
hemisphere uh responsibilities as we do
31:53
and so when they're wagging to the right
31:54
and they're happy that's because the
31:56
left side of their brain
31:57
is kind of active when they're feeling
31:59
relaxed and chill
32:01
and then the right side of their brain
32:02
is active when it's an emergency and so
32:04
that's why they then work to the left
32:06
that's weird because whenever i do the
32:07
hokey cokey whenever i put the right leg
32:09
in there i always feel really relaxed
32:11
but then as soon as i put the left leg
32:12
in i feel really anxious
32:16
you're misaligned um there are
32:19
researchers
32:20
at caillou university they have invented
32:24
a tail for humans
32:25
that's great so um a full-size
32:28
tail for humans and the idea is that it
32:32
will help you to walk around
32:33
bend over and anything that you might
32:36
find a little bit tough to do because
32:38
your body has
32:39
you know things that it can't do the
32:41
tail will just help balance you
32:43
really when you say your full size tail
32:45
do you mean are we talking kangaroo
32:46
length are we talking dog length
32:48
uh more kangaroo than dog because it has
32:51
to balance your entire upper body
32:53
so let's say you're running a bath and
32:55
you have to bend over
32:56
i've got a shower kind of um screen
33:00
next to my bath so it's kind of hard to
33:01
bend around and turn my bath on without
33:03
getting in the bath
33:04
but if i had a tail i could do it easily
33:06
because that would just balance me out
33:07
and i could
33:08
kind of bend my body in any direction
33:10
and it might be useful especially for
33:12
elderly people
33:13
who have um like limited mobility
33:16
it might help them to bend over and
33:18
reach things that they can't normally
33:19
reach so it might be that when you get
33:21
to a certain age
33:22
you get a tail attached wouldn't that be
33:25
cool
33:26
amazing something to look forward to
33:28
it's not surgically attached is it they
33:29
just sort of strap it on you
33:31
at the moment it's strap on okay
33:35
well that'll that'll bring a bit of
33:37
spice to the 70th birthday party
33:41
granddad we bought you a strap-on it's a
33:44
hell of an intimidating strap-on to walk
33:46
in a room on
33:47
kangaroo length whoa you've got it on
33:50
the wrong side granddad
33:52
it's supposed to be sticking out the
33:53
back
33:56
oh jesus oh dear
33:59
some sheep when they're nursing they're
34:01
young they get so carried away grooming
34:03
newborn lambs that they lick off their
34:05
entire
34:06
tails they sort of chew them they're
34:10
sort of chewing they're allowed to chew
34:11
out some of the debris in their fur but
34:12
they really love them you know sometimes
34:14
apparently if you really love your baby
34:16
you've got a baby down you kind of want
34:18
to sort of fight it um yeah
34:20
they're in they'd like that and they
34:21
accidentally show off their tails
34:22
child's leg is made of condensed milk so
34:24
it's a bit
34:25
easier for him that is remarkable though
34:29
like wow you'd resent your parents do
34:31
you know why
34:32
rabbits have white tails no it seems to
34:35
be
34:35
thought doesn't it yeah it does seem
34:36
stupid because whenever you see a rabbit
34:38
running around in the countryside
34:40
they're really easy to spot because they
34:42
have this white fluffy tail that jumps
34:44
around
34:44
yeah and you can see them from anywhere
34:46
so you would think that a fox would have
34:47
the same
34:48
yeah skill right well it turns out that
34:50
while you do notice them immediately
34:52
they're really good for kind of tricking
34:54
you as to which direction rabbits go
34:57
because if you do see a rabbit running
34:58
away they kind of dart from left to
35:00
right from left to right
35:01
and so when they're directly in front of
35:03
you you see the tail
35:04
but as soon as they dodge to the left or
35:06
the right
35:07
you can't see the tail anymore you can
35:09
only see the dark bit you can't see the
35:10
light bit
35:11
so for a second you can't tell whether
35:12
they've gone left or right so
35:14
basically confuses any predators
35:16
[Music]
35:18
really good tail decoys and animals are
35:21
so
35:21
fascinating like how you know how
35:23
lizards can
35:24
just drop their tail off um
35:27
i was reading about geckos and the fact
35:30
that the way that their tails are made
35:32
up
35:32
they're kind of like toilet paper
35:34
they're kind of serrated
35:35
already they're pre-serrated so that
35:38
they help the process of the tail
35:40
to be bitten off by clenching muscles
35:43
they're actually actively part of it um
35:45
which is why if a gecko is already dead
35:46
it's much harder to bite off its tail
35:48
because it's not helping
35:49
the animal eating it uh to do it yeah
35:53
and there was this really cool thing
35:54
which is it's very fatty their tails
35:56
and so if the predator then pursues the
35:58
gecko and the gecko still gets away the
36:00
gecko will then go back
36:01
and eat the tail because it's so fatty
36:03
it's got so much
36:04
nutrients in it wow yeah so it's
36:06
effectively also an emergency meal for
36:08
them
36:09
do we know if they sort of cry as
36:10
they're doing it because i think if you
36:12
had to
36:13
eat your own limb to survive you would
36:15
yeah crocodile tears but even so
36:17
um actually the longest tail in nature
36:19
is a lizard isn't it which can
36:21
be deposited at will it's the asian
36:23
grass lizard which looks so
36:25
funny it looks like a child got carried
36:27
away when drawing the tail
36:28
so it's still its tail is 25 centimeters
36:32
which is over three times the length of
36:33
its body
36:34
it's so sweet and i also quite like um
36:37
the term the terminology when they're
36:39
talking about the length of lizards
36:41
compared to their tails they talk about
36:42
snout to vent
36:44
snout to ventilation is 66 centimeters
36:48
is the vent the bottom the vent is the
36:50
bottom yes
36:51
from which you vent air and other things
36:55
i just like that phrase how tall is he
36:56
snout to vent
36:59
yeah that's true actually because people
37:01
who have long legs
37:02
it's like having a long tail it's not as
37:04
important is it yeah the most important
37:06
bit is from your nose to your anus
37:08
yep and really what happens below that
37:10
is just incidental
37:12
i agree all these basketballers bragging
37:14
it's not to vent
37:15
they're barely different to us
37:24
okay that's it that's all of our facts
37:26
thank you so much for listening if you'd
37:28

00:14
hello and welcome to another working
00:16
from home
00:16
episode of no such thing as a fish a
00:19
weekly podcast
00:20
not coming to you from the qi offices in
00:22
covent garden
00:24
my name is dan shriver i am sitting here
00:26
with anna chazinski
00:27
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:30
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four
00:33
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:35
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with you
00:40
anna my fact this week is that when
00:42
people accidentally swallow
00:44
coins their stomachs sometimes punch
00:46
holes in them
00:47
i think this is so cool and it's quite a
00:50
new thing
00:51
i'm not suggesting you should swallow a
00:52
coin to test it out but anna when you
00:54
say it's quite a new thing do you mean
00:55
in the past when people swallowed coins
00:57
it's not done that
00:58
yes wow so you didn't mean that you
01:01
didn't mean that coins are a relatively
01:02
recent human invention and we didn't
01:04
have the capacity to swallow them until
01:06
8 000 years ago i didn't mean that no
01:08
people have been swallowing coins since
01:10
time immemorial it's just that our
01:11
stomachs have evolved is what you're
01:13
saying
01:13
exactly in the last 20 years our
01:15
stomachs have completely changed
01:16
no that's that's not what's happened
01:18
either coins have changed though
01:20
so this was a problem that was
01:22
discovered in america in the 90s
01:24
and it turned out that copper coins have
01:27
been swapped for copper-covered zinc
01:29
coins and if you swallow copper then
01:31
your stomach acid doesn't really affect
01:33
it it can just go through come out the
01:34
other end
01:35
but if you've got zinc in there the
01:36
stomach acid finds it much easier
01:38
to chip away at it and so doctors were
01:41
finding in the 90s they were x-raying
01:42
kids they said they had stomach problems
01:44
for instance and they saw these kind of
01:46
discs with lots of holes in them
01:47
like really neat holes punched in them
01:49
and they didn't really know what they
01:50
were
01:50
and turned out they were coins but made
01:53
of zinc and they had the holes punched
01:54
wow
01:55
and so it's how cool is that yeah it's
01:57
amazing how come it doesn't dissolve the
01:59
entire coin why is it so neatly just
02:01
punching holes in it
02:02
well i would guess that the copper that
02:05
the zinc coins are sometimes covered
02:06
with
02:06
can erode a bit with use so i think
02:08
sometimes bits of copper will have come
02:10
off on parts of the surface and not on
02:11
others
02:12
and if the acid can get through the
02:13
copper it can suddenly penetrate through
02:15
the zinc
02:15
so it'll be on the bits of the coin
02:17
where the copper hasn't
02:19
been eroded i think it's super clever
02:21
very clever
02:22
isn't there a country where coins have
02:25
holes in them already
02:26
i'm sure yeah loads of countries yeah
02:28
yeah there's a square hole i'm sure
02:30
there's a country which has either a
02:32
square or a round hole
02:33
it's probably one of the two in the
02:34
middle of it yeah i can't remember which
02:36
country that it's really annoying well
02:37
the way but the way they manufacture
02:38
those is
02:39
they get someone at the royal mint to
02:40
swallow every single coin
02:43
very hard it's very hard to retrieve
02:45
them at the end though
02:46
isn't it like the worst uh fruit machine
02:50
ever
02:50
the money comes out of the end but
02:52
you're not really excited by it yeah
02:54
you are getting though a square hole out
02:56
of a round hole
02:57
at the end of it yeah yeah oh that's
03:00
cool yeah
03:01
yeah oh oh sorry have you seen that i
03:05
think wikipedia's twitter feed
03:06
tweeted it this weekend um have you seen
03:09
it it's like a toilet in japan
03:11
is it in japan where it um where it can
03:14
recognize you by your anus
03:16
yeah oh yeah isn't it amazing
03:19
what an amazing bit of technology james
03:22
you sit down
03:25
welcome back and it just all the cameras
03:28
can look
03:29
at uranus and just say oh that's you
03:31
james
03:32
what possible need is that if you're
03:34
here next door in a uh in a public
03:36
toilet if you hear a toilet going oh no
03:38
no no not you again that's the next
03:42
thing when they become sentient isn't it
03:44
is it useful for what is it useful for
03:47
is it so that if you've got lots of
03:48
people in the house and you're trying to
03:49
monitor your health
03:51
but you don't want to get confused
03:53
between it it's like that
03:54
it's like you know having a fitbit yeah
03:57
on your wrist
03:58
and it can tell like what's wrong with
03:59
you but the thing is with the toilet you
04:01
can't really carry it around with you
04:03
so uh it needs to and lots of people use
04:06
it so it kind of needs to know who's
04:08
using it at any one time so it can
04:10
look at your feces and decides what's
04:13
wrong with you maybe
04:14
maybe for maybe for crimes they could
04:16
use it uh as
04:17
you know anal recognition you know we
04:19
might be able to bust criminals by then
04:20
well it would save a lot of very
04:21
embarrassing uh police lineups wouldn't
04:26
it
04:28
um they should call this thing a fit but
04:30
that's what they should call it
04:31
they've got to do that they've got to do
04:32
it um anyway so that's uh
04:34
that's what we've got to say about coins
04:36
i guess well i just
04:38
what i just wanted to say the fact that
04:40
zinc reacts with your stomach acid is
04:42
quite an interesting thing
04:44
so in 2015 they invented this new
04:46
technology
04:47
it's like you kind of take a pill and
04:50
the pill has like a tiny motor in it
04:52
cool and the motor is activated it's
04:55
made out of zinc
04:56
and it's activated by your stomach acid
04:58
so the zinc reacts with your stomach
05:00
acid and
05:00
generates like hydrogen bubbles and then
05:03
those bubbles
05:04
mean that it can act like a torpedo and
05:06
it fires through your stomach
05:08
so that it gets into your stomach wall
05:10
and it can kind of lodge there
05:12
and it can put stuff into your
05:13
bloodstream oh wow isn't that amazing
05:16
wow
05:16
awesome so it's a motor that's only
05:18
activated when it
05:20
reacts when the sink reacts with the
05:22
exactly that hydrogen did you say it's
05:24
zinc reacting with hydrochloric acid
05:27
creating hydrogen bubbles that's so
05:28
clever genius and that isn't that what
05:31
the alanis morissette album jagged
05:33
little pill
05:34
is about that is it's weird though
05:37
because this technology was only
05:38
invented in 2015 but that album came out
05:41
in the
05:42
90s or something she's got real
05:43
foresight though yes she accidentally
05:45
didn't patent the invention she released
05:47
it as lyrics
05:48
oh ironic
05:53
um you got any more on this anna uh just
05:56
just quickly to
05:57
share some advice advice piece of advice
05:59
number one is just don't swallow coins
06:00
just because you want to be able to
06:01
thread them on a string or whatever
06:03
um and when i say accidentally i guess
06:05
i'm talking about children it's mostly
06:06
them who swallow coins so maybe they're
06:08
doing it on purpose
06:09
but they don't know why but um the
06:11
current medical advice is to doctors if
06:14
you're looking at an x-ray and you see
06:15
some coins in the stomach
06:17
is that if it's just a coin that's sort
06:19
of intact you can just leave it
06:21
send the patient home and it'll probably
06:22
pass but if it's a coin with
06:24
scalloped edges or holes in it then you
06:27
should endoscopically remove it because
06:28
that implies it's been there for a bit
06:30
too long
06:31
and it's decided to sort of bed down oh
06:34
that's a bit of medical advice out there
06:35
from an amateur to the experts
06:39
an enthusiastic kind of right
06:41
absolutely
06:43
but stomach acid is amazing isn't it the
06:45
power of stomach acid
06:47
if you swallow razor blades again don't
06:48
do it because they'll slit your throat
06:50
on the way down but if you do
06:51
and survive it your stomach acid can
06:53
just break them right down
06:54
that's incredible it's more acidic than
06:56
battery acid that's amazing
06:59
so crocodiles they can secrete stomach
07:02
acid
07:03
10 times faster than any other animals
07:04
which is this amazing
07:06
i mean when you think about that that's
07:07
that's nuts um
07:09
and it's because they do it because they
07:11
have these massive meals every so often
07:13
and they need to break them down
07:14
and they have instead of you know we've
07:17
got an aorta
07:18
a blood vessel in our bodies they've got
07:20
two one of which supplies the heart but
07:23
one of which is a special one which goes
07:25
to the stomach and when they eat
07:27
the brain the crocodile's brain signals
07:30
the heart
07:30
and it says don't send any blood to the
07:32
lungs just pump it all to the stomach
07:34
via the special
07:35
super highway and then this carbon lots
07:38
of carbon dioxide builds up in their
07:39
blood because none of their blood is
07:41
going to the lungs
07:41
so the carbon dioxide is not getting out
07:43
of their bloodstream but what that means
07:46
is that the stomach takes that blood
07:48
which is full of carbon dioxide
07:50
and it pulls the carbon dioxide out to
07:52
create more acid
07:53
so that's how they make it and they can
07:55
digest gazelle
07:56
horns and hooves and they just eat
07:58
anything and it can just be broken down
08:00
it's because they've got this magic
08:01
method of making it that's incredible
08:02
that's so cool so is it it's like dual
08:04
purpose because the vessel is first of
08:06
all going to the stomach to help it out
08:07
but also
08:08
the increased carbon content of the
08:10
blood can then be used yeah they're very
08:12
clever
08:12
amazing that's amazing do you know
08:14
stomach acid is the reason that
08:16
when you do a number two it can sting
08:18
that's it because
08:20
yeah i thought that was really
08:21
interesting so it doesn't
08:23
just it doesn't eat away at your stomach
08:24
lining because we've got a very
08:26
protective layer of mucus in our stomach
08:27
lining
08:28
but if you've got a particularly bad uh
08:31
lump of
08:31
um turd then and it comes out and it
08:34
really brushes up because i just said
08:36
you went so polite for number two and
08:39
then you're like
08:40
okay now what's another polite synonym
08:42
for that i forgot all the words
08:43
you've got all the other words
08:47
matter then there's a little bit of
08:50
stomach acid still left on the outside
08:51
of it and your
08:52
rectum isn't protected from it is that
08:55
right
08:56
ah that's not in all cases where it
08:58
stings so is it
09:00
like if you have a curry that might be
09:01
due to the chilis or something i think
09:03
that is also due to chillies probably
09:04
yeah so that's a potent combination the
09:06
stomach acid and the chili i guess
09:09
gosh that would be a painful stool
09:13
see that's that's the word you should
09:15
have used on a stool
09:17
that's a classy classy way of saying it
09:20
penguins king penguins specifically they
09:23
are like the reverse of um crocodiles
09:27
uh it was the crocodile thing uh i said
09:30
just now
09:31
so king penguins can basically turn
09:32
themselves into a fridge
09:34
their own stomach on the inside they can
09:36
turn it into a ladder
09:38
because they sometimes have to provide
09:40
an emergency meal for their
09:42
chicks and they as a result don't want
09:45
to digest any of their food
09:47
and so they stop producing stomach acid
09:50
basically
09:51
and that means that the food just and
09:53
then they just have these fish
09:54
in their guts for through up to three
09:56
weeks on end which they can then
09:58
regurgitate
09:59
on like undigested that's how they do it
10:01
isn't that mental
10:02
wow do they keep it at
10:05
sort of refrigerator temperature do we
10:07
know because otherwise wouldn't it be
10:08
quite
10:09
quite rotten i think if you're a penguin
10:12
everything's everything
10:13
everything's a refrigerator you're right
10:16
well they do anna they do kind of have
10:18
antibacterial chemicals which they can
10:20
secrete inside themselves to preserve
10:22
the food so that's how they stop it
10:23
rotting
10:24
i mean wow yeah so if your fridge you
10:27
know
10:27
you lose power in your fridge but you've
10:29
got a penguin lying around you can store
10:30
your
10:36
my favorite stupid swallower i think is
10:38
chris foster
10:40
chris foster from bournemouth university
10:42
who in 2008
10:44
was out on a night out with his friends
10:46
who decided that he was too drunk so
10:48
tried to take him home
10:49
to his room and to stop them from doing
10:51
this he swallowed his room key
10:53
and he had no memory of this but woke up
10:56
the next morning and his friends were
10:57
all like mate you followed your room key
10:59
last night what are you gonna do about
11:00
it and apparently i like the detail that
11:02
apparently one of his friends tried the
11:03
heimlich maneuver on him
11:04
because you could really imagine the
11:05
drunken 12 people
11:07
someone heimlich just sort of
11:10
practically crushing him
11:11
so yeah he went to hospital and said i
11:13
think i followed my key last night and
11:15
indeed he had
11:16
and he was sent home and uh passed the
11:19
key
11:19
31 hours later and put it back on the
11:21
fob
11:22
wow a happy ending and actually
11:26
it would have a slightly bigger hole in
11:28
the key so it would be easy to get it on
11:30
his spot
11:30
absolutely that's why he did it it's
11:32
very clear thinking drunkenness
11:35
my favorite swallower sorry just we seem
11:37
to be playing a game of my favorite
11:38
swallower
11:39
um would probably be uh a guy from the
11:42
19th century
11:43
have you heard of the human ostrich no
11:46
no i haven't heard of
11:47
the human ostrich this was a this was a
11:50
thing
11:50
and in fact it's not not even just one
11:52
person there were loads of acts
11:54
whose standard thing was the human
11:56
ostrich where their trick was just
11:58
swallowing cutlery or glass
12:00
and they were kind of an adjunct to the
12:01
sword swallowing
12:03
fraternity um and that was just what
12:06
they did so there was a guy called
12:07
alfonso who would eat glass and cork and
12:09
cotton and wool it sounds more like sort
12:11
of sword swallowing
12:12
apprentices or interns you know you
12:15
start off with a teaspoon
12:16
up to a dessert spoon that is that is
12:19
how you learn to
12:20
swallow a sword though yeah with a
12:21
teaspoon first
12:23
well that'll be something a bit bigger
12:24
than that it's really so i've been
12:26
reading the files of the
12:28
ssai which is the sword swallowers
12:30
association international
12:31
and um they were surveyed about their
12:34
their work
12:35
and there were 46 of them who got
12:36
surveyed because there are only 100 or
12:38
200 people in the world who do this for
12:40
a living
12:41
and the 46 people between them between
12:43
them had swallowed
12:44
2 000 swords over the previous three
12:46
months
12:47
um half of them had swallowed more than
12:49
one sword five of them had swallowed ten
12:51
swords at a time and one person had
12:53
swallowed sixteen
12:54
swords simultaneously similarly
12:57
obviously
12:57
simultaneous i know i know and they were
12:59
all they all got asked about you know
13:01
their tips and tricks
13:02
and it was a study in the british
13:04
medical journal that they were surveyed
13:05
for
13:06
so it was trying to work out what
13:08
injures them and it turns out it's
13:09
stubbed toes
13:10
actually i was just thinking
13:13
right you don't see swords much these
13:15
days do you
13:16
i mean people don't use swords much for
13:19
their original
13:20
purpose so i just wondered if you're
13:23
a sword manufacturer what percentage of
13:25
them get
13:26
swallowed
13:30
are you tempted as a sword manufacturer
13:32
to just start rounding off the edges to
13:34
make it slightly easier for these guys
13:35
yeah that's exactly what i'm thinking if
13:37
you're a sword manufacturer you might as
13:39
well go for where the market is right
13:40
what make them taste nice maybe yes
13:44
like a flavoured condom but with a sword
13:53
but the person is the sheath um that's
13:55
interesting
13:56
you the aim they said is to become a
13:58
living scabbard for the sword
14:00
right yeah and because the aim really i
14:02
mean when you're swallowing a sword the
14:03
aim is not to swallow
14:05
swallowing contracts all the muscles all
14:07
the way down this is a disastrous thing
14:09
to do
14:09
it's a misnomer isn't it really it
14:10
really is yeah so we should call them
14:12
living scabbards i think
14:14
and that's actually what the wealthiest
14:16
nights in medieval times used to have
14:17
isn't it
14:19
one of their servants would be
14:22
there at their hip and the wealthier the
14:26
night you are the more
14:27
uh swords your living scabbard can
14:29
accommodate so it's like choosing a golf
14:30
club
14:33
um anna when you sensed this fact you
14:35
sent us a link to
14:37
new scientists i think which is was your
14:39
evidence
14:40
uh for it and so i went on to new
14:43
scientists and searched for
14:44
swallowing and actually i found some
14:47
stuff about sword swallowing as well
14:48
so there is a book that they talked
14:51
about which sounds
14:52
amazing i'm definitely gonna buy it it's
14:54
called memoirs of a sword swallower by
14:57
dan mannix
14:58
and it was published in 1951 and it
15:01
talks about all sorts of things but one
15:03
of them
15:03
is that people used to swallow giant
15:05
corkscrews
15:07
so wow i know right so this is amazing
15:11
the way that you do it is you put the
15:12
corkscrew down into your throat
15:14
and you're kind of twisting it round and
15:16
as you're doing it you're making your
15:18
pharynx which is like the bit of your
15:20
throat
15:20
behind your mouth you're making it kind
15:22
of jump up and down with a muscle
15:24
and then you twist it and then you make
15:26
it jump again and then you twist it and
15:27
then you make it jump again and you can
15:29
get the whole corkscrew
15:30
down your throat isn't that amazing dude
15:33
that's
15:33
really amazing isn't it and
15:36
do you know what they could also swallow
15:38
uh is a duck's penis
15:43
yes they could whatever they wanted
15:46
what in the cabaret act that would be
15:48
[Laughter]
15:50
what an excuse when your wife comes home
15:55
i'm a living scabbard
15:58
do you know what i think a lot of wives
16:00
if they came home and find their husband
16:01
doing that and they said
16:02
i'm gonna start a career as a giant
16:04
corkscrew swallower they would wish that
16:06
they'd just been fellating the duck
16:12
that'd be my position oh god
16:16
okay it is time for fact number two and
16:19
that is
16:20
andy my fact is that soldiers in the
16:22
russian army
16:23
weren't issued socks until 2007.
16:27
wow wow wow well they didn't go around
16:30
the world fighting
16:32
barefoot did they they didn't get no no
16:34
they're not they're not hippies um
16:36
they're the opposite of hippies in the
16:37
russian army they're very very tough
16:39
people
16:39
but they didn't have um the socks that
16:42
we
16:43
know and love today um so wait was it
16:46
was it a case of bring your own socks
16:48
kind of no they they were issued with
16:50
footwear for between the shoe and the
16:52
foot
16:52
but they the thing that the russian army
16:55
wore for centuries actually
16:56
um were these squares of cloth called
16:59
port yankee
17:00
uh i hope i'm pronouncing that right
17:02
they had cotton ones for the summer and
17:03
warmer flannely ones for the winter
17:05
and they came in a square and you had to
17:09
do this little elaborate dance of
17:10
wrapping them around your foot
17:12
um but the thing is they had lots of
17:14
advantages so they were cheap to make
17:16
they were very easy to wash and dry and
17:18
bend and if you've got a hole in it
17:20
didn't matter because there were several
17:22
layers to them so one whole
17:24
you know is not a problem um so there
17:27
were lots of advantages
17:28
yeah so um i asked my father-in-law who
17:31
was in the russian army actually
17:33
uh about these and he said yeah they're
17:35
pretty good actually because
17:37
um one thing is the boots they would
17:39
give you
17:40
were extremely unflexible so
17:43
let's say they probably wouldn't fit
17:45
exactly the shape of your foot in fact
17:47
they almost certainly wouldn't
17:49
but what you could do with these um
17:51
wraps is you could kind of stuff a
17:53
little bit here
17:54
stuff a little bit there kind of do it
17:55
on two layers here
17:57
and on one layer there so it would make
17:58
your foot fit exactly
18:00
in the size of your boot you can turn
18:03
your foot into whatever size and shape
18:04
you need it to be
18:06
yeah pretty much yeah exactly i watched
18:08
a video online of someone
18:10
wrapping their foot up with one of these
18:12
and the process was very intricate it
18:14
was
18:14
like swaddling a baby um you you have to
18:18
really tuck it under bits and make sure
18:20
it flips over this other bit
18:21
so they're wearing a bag over their foot
18:22
really an elaborate bag over their foot
18:24
rather than a fitted sock
18:25
yeah i mean what is a sock but a bag
18:28
but a bag that's true a sock is more of
18:31
a bag than these squares of cloth
18:33
actually
18:34
in a sense i suppose because it's
18:37
comfortably fitted to one's foot
18:38
it feels less baggy but yeah but socks
18:41
are really important if you're in the
18:42
army right
18:43
they're super important yeah so in the
18:46
world while
18:46
wha in world war one for instance they
18:48
needed socks for their troops
18:50
and so they got people to knit them
18:53
because in those days the way you made
18:55
socks was by knitting them you didn't
18:56
have the
18:57
big manufacturing processes that you
18:59
have today and the problem with people
19:01
um knitting socks is not everyone is
19:03
particularly good at knitting oh god i
19:06
would pity the soldier who had to deal
19:08
with one of my socks
19:09
it would be hell you'd go barefoot so
19:12
for instance there was one um army one
19:15
person in the army who wrote a
19:17
poem and it said thank you kind lady
19:20
your socks are some fit
19:22
i used one for a hammock and one for a
19:24
mitt
19:25
[Laughter]
19:25
[Music]
19:27
very good i thought he was going to
19:29
finish saying
19:31
one for my i thought that was going
19:33
to be there and that's why you're not
19:34
the poet laureate
19:36
i know we should never have submitted
19:38
that rhymes yeah
19:40
uh when they asked it's so hard to
19:42
define sock when you start researching
19:44
it isn't it
19:44
it's like they've sort of existed
19:46
forever or they've only existed for 100
19:48
years depending on how you do it
19:50
so in i love this sort of variety and i
19:53
found that as i was really trying to get
19:55
to grips with the history of them
19:57
they've climbed up and down the leg like
19:59
nobody's business over the last 2000
20:01
years
20:02
it's so weird so you've got like i think
20:04
the oldest sock is
20:06
from about 2000 years ago and it kind of
20:08
looks like our socks today except it has
20:11
it was for a sandal and so it's like
20:13
those socks that have a different
20:15
bit for each of the toes like it has one
20:17
bit for the big toe and then a separate
20:18
bit for the rest of the foot but then
20:20
they sort of climbed
20:21
up the leg gradually so they'd get
20:23
longer and men
20:24
were wearing breeches when it got to
20:26
about 14th 15th century
20:28
so their trousers as it were would get
20:30
shorter and shorter
20:32
and then eventually it got to a time in
20:34
the 1400s
20:36
where socks had turned into tights that
20:39
basically revealed the arse and your
20:40
tunic or your breeches had become a
20:42
jacket
20:43
and there were all these laws about who
20:45
was allowed to show their bum and who
20:47
wasn't
20:48
the sock was basically the full leg
20:50
covering by that point
20:51
and then they sort of descended again
20:53
and got lower and lower until we have
20:54
what we have today which is the short
20:56
sock and trousers
20:57
so they're just they're up and down all
20:59
the time do you know what that
21:00
that sounds like the progress of the
21:02
korean war
21:03
uh up and down the korean peninsula do
21:05
you remember because originally
21:07
the the north had made its way almost to
21:09
the complete south island and then there
21:10
was a huge troop surge and it they got
21:12
pushed back almost to china
21:13
and then it stabilized around is it the
21:15
38th parallel that's where they kind of
21:17
came out
21:17
parallel yeah so maybe our socks will
21:19
eventually stop
21:20
at that parallel on our legs yeah i
21:22
guess would be the knee yeah that's the
21:24
parrot that's the parallel i'm trying to
21:25
draw and it's a parallel i regret
21:27
drawing
21:29
increasingly people used to be killed by
21:31
their socks in the 19th century
21:33
they were a real hazard there were lots
21:34
of warnings about them this was in the
21:36
age when
21:37
dyes were quite dangerous they were dyes
21:39
were deadly
21:40
and people used to complain constantly
21:42
that certain types of socks particularly
21:44
the brightly colored ones would leave
21:45
them with these massive ulcers or
21:47
swollen feet that they couldn't get in
21:48
and out of their boots and
21:49
sort of sores and people would get
21:52
infections from them
21:53
and die and it got to the stage where in
21:56
about the 1850s
21:57
men were recommended to only wear white
21:59
socks because
22:00
if you had socks that had been dyed by
22:02
certain types of dye like a lot of them
22:03
contained arsenic
22:04
which wasn't ideal then you were risking
22:07
your very
22:08
life wow in fact the telegraph after
22:10
your socks get dyed and then
22:12
you get died again another reason why
22:16
you're not poet laureate
22:17
we're just coming up with a lot aren't
22:18
we
22:21
but they didn't actually kill anyone did
22:23
they i don't think there were any
22:24
recorded deaths where the
22:25
cause of death was put on the form as
22:27
stop i i didn't find the death
22:29
certificates but there were certainly
22:31
journalists who said that they had been
22:32
killing people
22:33
and you can imagine with infections
22:34
people weren't very good at uh staving
22:36
off
22:36
you know i guess just climbing up the
22:38
body and socks advertise themselves for
22:40
decades afterwards as
22:42
special wow new non-poisonous socks they
22:44
won't kill you
22:45
that was the thing did they yeah they're
22:48
victorian ads
22:49
um in 2015 um
22:52
someone invented a pair of socks which
22:55
were powered by urine right
22:58
first question why do you need to power
23:01
your socks
23:02
can you not get around without powering
23:04
them good great question thank you it
23:06
feels like almost the only
23:08
oh no no it's not the only question
23:10
there's another quite important question
23:12
coming up about the urine
23:15
yeah yeah so what these are kind of
23:18
designed for
23:18
is if you are let's say you're going for
23:20
a hike or
23:22
you're out uh and you get lost or you
23:24
get into distress
23:26
um and you need to send a signal to some
23:29
people but you've forgotten your phone
23:31
and your you know pager or whatever
23:34
whatever else you were going to use to
23:35
summon oh basically you're
23:37
only wearing a pair of socks yeah you've
23:39
lost everything all the other clothes
23:40
have gone
23:41
yeah you've woken up from a nightmare
23:44
you're shocked to find yourself
23:45
so what do you do you're naked you're
23:48
lost
23:49
all you have is a pair of socks you just
23:51
put
23:52
all you have to do is piss yourself and
23:54
um these
23:55
when filled with urine and activated by
23:57
your footsteps they can send a little
23:59
message
24:00
uh to any prospective rescuers because
24:03
they've got these tiny fuel cells
24:04
which are turned on by fresh urine and
24:07
the movement of your feet
24:08
why do they have to do that why do they
24:10
have to include the footstep bit surely
24:12
you could just like i don't know
24:14
spin them around or something why do you
24:17
have to
24:18
put your pissy socks back on
24:21
i don't think you need to take them off
24:23
in the first place you just need to
24:25
piss off carefully weed down your legs
24:26
just yes on your feet yeah
24:28
okay wait you're claiming i think that
24:31
would be very difficult
24:32
especially as a woman to actually manage
24:34
to weep into a sock whilst
24:36
actually for a man most of the challenge
24:38
is not pissing on your feet
24:42
and who's this who's this notifying andy
24:44
is this like
24:45
some unity the authorities
24:48
okay yeah like you know you know
24:51
prince prince william when he worked for
24:53
mountain rescue he used to talk about
24:55
getting the urine sock alarm every few
24:58
few days um yeah so it mean it means
25:01
that it just proves that you're still
25:02
alive and
25:04
that you're worth rescuing are you at
25:06
that stage
25:08
are you really worth rescuing
25:12
i think i'd probably rather not be
25:14
rescued at that point
25:17
um i was just thinking when you said
25:18
they had adverts for socks that don't
25:20
kill you you don't see many adverts for
25:22
socks these days do you
25:23
no that's true you just assume you're
25:25
just gonna buy them i guess
25:27
yeah yeah yeah it's usually when they do
25:29
stunts isn't it stunt advertising so
25:31
ted baker did an advert a few years ago
25:34
which was
25:35
they started selling socks in odd pairs
25:37
so
25:38
they would sell you instead of just two
25:40
socks prepare they would sell you three
25:42
because there was a report of how we
25:44
lose an odd sock we always have an odd
25:46
sock so why not
25:47
give you an extra sock so that you've
25:49
always got a pair on the go yeah that's
25:51
quite clever i find that
25:52
i find that very um annoying and
25:54
discomforting actually yeah me too
25:56
actually
25:56
it was very stunty yeah they had a sock
25:58
amnesty you were meant to bring in that
26:00
one-odd sock
26:01
if you were able to buy the pack of
26:03
three basically what happens is
26:05
as soon as you buy these three socks you
26:07
immediately have an odd sock yes yeah
26:09
so if you buy two um if you buy two of
26:12
them
26:13
then you don't then you have three pairs
26:14
of socks right but then you can just buy
26:16
three pairs of socks can't you
26:18
yeah yeah no but there is the thing
26:21
about
26:21
about sorting your socks which is how
26:24
amazingly
26:25
difficult it gets as soon as you have
26:27
any num any reasonable number of
26:29
interesting socks
26:30
so if you have uh so and there are two
26:33
problems with
26:34
sock matching which is if you have more
26:36
than one pair uh which i do
26:39
sorry brag hashtag brag one of them is
26:42
full of pizzler
26:43
[Laughter]
26:45
but if you have more than one pair
26:46
firstly you need to pair more socks
26:48
obviously but secondly there is a larger
26:50
pile of unmatched socks that you have to
26:51
hunt
26:52
through right so if you have five pairs
26:54
of socks
26:55
it actually takes 25 times longer to
26:57
match than one pair of socks
26:59
okay this is by an algorithm allegedly
27:02
if you have a hundred
27:03
different pairs of socks right it would
27:06
take ten thousand times
27:07
longer to sort them than one pair of
27:10
socks
27:13
no i don't believe that there's not and
27:15
that's worked out that you're obviously
27:17
sort of paring them down every time you
27:18
find a pair
27:19
yeah i mean i assume the algorithm is
27:21
done it's done its job i think so but
27:23
they haven't done too much on the end it
27:24
gets easier
27:25
yeah it does get yeah absolutely yeah
27:26
but the answer obviously is to only buy
27:28
one kind of socks and just buy a hundred
27:29
of those yeah
27:30
hey andy i've got one more question
27:32
about your piss socks
27:34
um james james raised a point there
27:36
before which is
27:37
sometimes it's difficult for guys uh to
27:40
uh to aim properly and that could land
27:42
so has there
27:43
been any cases where um the authorities
27:46
have
27:47
busted into someone's house because
27:50
they pissed on their socks
27:56
not as far as i know but what a great
27:58
question
27:59
sounds like you haven't really done the
28:00
research here andy
28:04
i'm just talking about the fact there's
28:05
no sock advertising i really like
28:08
fun socks and so i'm quite surprised
28:11
that people don't
28:11
you know companies don't make a bigger
28:13
deal out of them and i especially feel
28:14
sorry for men when they have to wear
28:16
suits or like quite bland uh
28:19
matching outfits i know you're all
28:20
wearing like cartoon themed
28:22
tops today but we're working from home
28:25
um
28:26
that's the only way that you can really
28:27
express yourself right is by wearing
28:29
stupid socks
28:31
so i was looking at some stupid socks
28:33
and i hadn't realized something that i
28:34
think
28:35
a lot of canadians are aware of which is
28:36
that trudeau
28:38
engages in sock diplomacy a lot and
28:41
so every sort of diplomatic event he
28:43
goes to he's wearing a different and
28:45
appropriate pair of socks
28:46
and it was particularly apparent when he
28:48
marched in toronto's gay pride parade
28:51
wearing a rainbow striped pair but
28:53
printed with the words eid mubarak
28:55
because it was also eid the end of
28:56
ramadan
28:59
so and they were made by a toronto based
29:01
company
29:02
unfortunately unfortunately nobody
29:04
noticed any of that because he was also
29:05
blacked up at the time
29:06
[Laughter]
29:11
i have one fact about which could have
29:13
gone into this fact or the previous one
29:15
okay okay so in 2014 there was a great
29:18
dane in oregon which was
29:20
found to be in some distress and his
29:22
owners took him to the vet
29:24
and if you combine this fact in the
29:25
previous one you know what i'm about to
29:26
say
29:27
but they found he'd been swallowing
29:28
socks and they're
29:30
they've it's all it's all really just
29:32
now about guessing the number of pairs
29:33
of socks that you swear
29:34
from our perspective how long do you
29:36
think it would have taken to match the
29:38
socks
29:40
i reckon the maximum number sucks that a
29:43
great day can eat
29:45
before you notice and take them to the
29:47
vet yeah is
29:48
16. okay okay pairs or individual
29:51
individuals because i guess they
29:53
wouldn't necessarily swallow them in
29:54
pairs
29:54
go on any any other guesses i'm going to
29:57
say one
29:58
one sock yeah wow okay great danes are
30:02
they're great uh so they can fit
30:03
probably quite a lot i think 30
30:05
30 so i've got to say then my ex had a
30:08
dog
30:08
who once sat a sock and we had to get
30:10
the sock out of it
30:12
um which was an interesting day for us
30:14
um
30:15
but i'm not sure that the international
30:18
press would have been particularly
30:20
interested in
30:22
or you missed an opportunity in
30:24
reporting your story james
30:27
yeah no that's very good tactical
30:29
thinking from james um
30:31
so that thank you dan for just getting
30:33
one sock because normally i was assuming
30:34
you would do your usual thing and guess
30:37
5 000 socks exactly i was going to say
30:40
100
30:40
000 this dog had eaten
30:44
43 and a half socks wow yeah
30:47
and they had to do a sock extra me on it
30:50
um
30:50
and in fact this this became news
30:53
because it was published in the trade
30:55
magazine
30:55
uh veterinary practice news and they had
30:57
a competition for the animal which had
30:59
eaten the most unusual thing
31:00
and this great dane won but there were
31:03
some other
31:04
runners-up in the competition which
31:06
included a frog in texas which had eaten
31:08
the rocks from its rockery
31:10
and a dog in florida which had eaten a
31:13
kebab
31:14
now that doesn't sound interesting but
31:16
it had also eaten the skewer oh
31:19
god that's gotta hurt
31:24
okay it is time for fact number three
31:26
and that is my fact
31:27
my fact this week is that in 2016 a man
31:30
won the lottery for the second time
31:32
using the exact same numbers that won it
31:35
for him the first time
31:36
that man's name is larry gambles
31:41
and he hasn't changed his name since he
31:42
did this no no this is this
31:44
was his name um we also like bouncing
31:47
around fields like a sheep
31:50
he's not larry gambols oh how's the
31:52
different guy i think here
31:55
that's larry gambles he's from madison
31:57
illinois which is a
31:58
small place south of chicago and he won
32:02
a million dollars in 2016 as part of the
32:04
lottery and
32:05
the numbers that he used were the same
32:07
numbers that he used nine years ago
32:09
when he won 50 000 in a different
32:11
lottery
32:12
um so they worked twice for him and yeah
32:15
he obviously made the news because
32:17
he uh he because of his name because of
32:19
his name
32:20
you know it's not like a great dane in
32:21
the sock
32:24
he was asked for he was asked if he had
32:26
any advice uh
32:27
on how to win the lottery which is a
32:29
great question for a journalist who asks
32:32
and he said pick your favorite numbers
32:34
and stick with them
32:36
it worked for me so there you go
32:38
guaranteed
32:39
surefire way of winning i would argue
32:41
that that's bad advice though right
32:43
because unless your favorite numbers are
32:46
numbers that no one else likes which is
32:48
pretty unlikely
32:49
statistically you're more likely to like
32:51
the number seven or the number three or
32:52
whatever yeah
32:53
you want to be choosing numbers that no
32:55
one likes you want to be choosing
32:56
horrible right
32:57
yeah because then you get more well
32:58
there was um an article i was reading
33:00
which was saying that in each national
33:02
lottery draw
33:03
10 000 people on average choose the
33:05
numbers one two three four five and six
33:07
and uh given the amount of most jackpots
33:10
which is about four million
33:11
that means even if you win you get 400
33:13
quid yeah oh wow because it has a split
33:15
between those people
33:16
mad i reckon that that serves you right
33:19
for being so unimaginative
33:21
i agree i could not agree more also
33:25
i look i know the number of combinations
33:26
is so massive that
33:28
and i know that that is as likely a
33:30
combination of numbers as any other is
33:32
that correct
33:33
but you're getting those one two three
33:34
however i think we can also
33:36
happen is it it's never gonna be one two
33:38
three four five six no just it's not
33:41
you're right of course not imagine the
33:42
statistics be damned
33:44
it would be a complete scandal it would
33:45
be outrageous actually
33:47
you know who got the first ever lottery
33:49
ticket in the uk i think it was john
33:52
major oh yeah
33:54
prime minister did they not say that he
33:56
was worried that he was gonna win or
33:57
something
33:58
yes he hoped he wouldn't win because if
34:00
he won he would have to give the money
34:01
back and he knew that his wife would be
34:03
furious
34:04
if he won and then had to give back the
34:05
money
34:07
imagine if the first ever national
34:09
lottery right it came up
34:10
and i don't know if you guys remember it
34:12
you're probably too young i remember it
34:14
because i was 16 and i could buy tickets
34:16
it was really exciting
34:17
but imagine if the first ball that came
34:19
out was one
34:20
and then it was two and it was three you
34:22
know four then five and six which is
34:25
equally likely it could have happened i
34:27
think that would have been just the end
34:28
of it no one would have trusted it ever
34:30
again it would have been a scandal no
34:31
one would ever buy a ticket again and
34:32
then john mage is in the corner
34:35
because he is absolutely the sort of guy
34:37
who would have picked those numbers
34:39
yes it's as likely as any other
34:42
combination
34:44
i find that sticking with the same
34:45
numbers thing really weird because i
34:47
found a headline in the telegraph
34:49
this just made me laugh so much it said
34:51
millionaire lottery winner
34:52
dreamt numbers 28 years ago and this was
34:56
a woman who
34:59
these numbers came to her in a dream in
35:01
1989
35:02
and then in 2017 they came up
35:07
did the dream tell her that it was 2017
35:10
or she just got around to it no she'd
35:13
been she'd been placing the bets every
35:14
single week on that on that number
35:17
no way your grandmother does that okay
35:20
my grandmother keeps the same numbers oh
35:22
i think i do see the logic
35:23
in keeping the same numbers once you've
35:26
decided on them
35:26
because then if the numbers do come out
35:29
you feel like ah
35:30
they were my numbers and i should have
35:32
put them back on this week and i didn't
35:34
do it
35:34
yes once you started doing that it see
35:36
the logic between behind not stopping
35:38
my grandmother says that she didn't buy
35:41
them one week
35:42
and that was the week her numbers came
35:43
up i just don't believe that
35:45
i just don't believe it at all but she
35:47
that's a story in our family she says it
35:49
the other logical fallacy that people
35:51
have is that they look at the numbers
35:53
and they're out by just one and you're
35:54
like oh
35:55
i had 45 and 46 came out but
35:58
apart from the fact that each ball is
36:00
not related they're just numbers
36:02
but of course there are twice as many
36:04
numbers that are one away from your
36:05
number
36:06
as your actual number so yeah you're
36:08
twice as likely to be
36:10
one away as the actual number that's a
36:12
really good point i hadn't thought about
36:13
that
36:13
andy you were saying about the person
36:15
who came up with the number through a
36:16
dream
36:17
did you hear about this guy in spain in
36:18
the 1970s no
36:20
no so the way it works in spain is
36:24
um you could go around the shops looking
36:26
for specific numbers they printed out
36:27
the numbers
36:28
and you would choose whichever one you
36:29
wanted this guy had
36:31
um this guy decided that he wanted a
36:34
lottery ticket ending in 48
36:36
four and eight so he went round all the
36:38
shops eventually he found the ticket and
36:40
he bought it and he won the lottery
36:42
and um they interviewed him afterwards
36:45
like they always do and they said oh why
36:47
you know what was your secret and he
36:49
said oh well i was looking for this 48
36:51
and they said oh why were you looking
36:52
for the 48 and he said well
36:54
i dreamt of the number seven for seven
36:56
straight nights
36:57
and seven times seven is 48.
37:04
so good and it worked a man who really
37:07
deserved to
37:08
win have you guys heard of um stefan
37:10
mandel
37:11
you may well have done researching
37:12
people who've won the lottery lots
37:14
so he was a romanian economist and he
37:16
ended up winning the lottery 14 times
37:19
um because he worked out
37:23
that he what he would do is he would
37:25
form a syndicate
37:26
and um he grew up very very poor romania
37:29
he wanted to earn some real money
37:30
and he would find a lottery and he would
37:32
wait until the jackpot for the lottery
37:35
was
37:35
bigger than all possible combinations of
37:38
tickets so if you bought
37:39
you know every single number so that
37:41
that only applies to certain lotteries
37:42
obviously because if you did it for
37:44
things like the euro millions it will be
37:46
so expensive to buy tickets for every
37:48
combination um but he so he formed this
37:51
syndicate and he he
37:52
waited and then he would just buy every
37:54
single
37:55
ticket but the main tricky thing is the
37:58
logistics of it so
37:59
he had a team of people in melbourne he
38:01
moved to australia
38:02
and he found a lottery in virginia in
38:04
the usa
38:06
which had enough money in the jackpot so
38:09
you could print your own tickets at the
38:11
time so he printed off
38:13
one ton of tickets he had to ship them
38:16
all the way to the usa from australia
38:19
he waited for the jackpot to be right
38:22
and then
38:22
at a certain on a certain week in 1992
38:25
the jackpot hit 15 million dollars and
38:27
he said
38:27
this is the week we need to go for it
38:29
but he had to form a team of people to
38:31
take
38:32
1.4 million tickets to a shop and
38:35
queue up pay for them get them processed
38:38
and they're registered as being properly
38:39
bought
38:40
and they had three days to do it 1.4
38:42
million tickets
38:44
he hired couriers who had tens of
38:46
thousands of tickets each
38:48
and almost all of them got through but
38:50
there was one batch of tickets 140 000
38:53
which weren't registered there was one
38:56
ticket which wasn't bought
38:59
it was one two three four five six
39:03
um and so when the when the time came
39:05
they were so stressed obviously
39:06
yeah the jackpot was in that one
39:08
combination of numbers they would have
39:10
missed out thankfully
39:11
they got it and they won how much was it
39:13
then that ended up being divided as in
39:15
how much did each person get
39:16
do they get enough to make it worth that
39:18
obscene and absurd
39:20
i think a lot of people did not get
39:21
enough to make it worth the hassle uh
39:23
but i think he got several million
39:24
dollars and he moved to vanuatu the
39:26
pacific islands so
39:28
yeah but everyone's got some money
39:29
everyone did win
39:31
worth it i was just thinking if you did
39:32
buy all the tickets apart from one
39:34
then basically your odds of it being a
39:38
complete disaster
39:39
is the same as my odds of winning the
39:41
lottery if i only buy one ticket
39:43
isn't it mm-hmm yeah that's just a
39:45
that's true we are at things
39:47
it's just always showing us the new
39:49
angle
39:52
it's the that's the odds of that's the
39:54
odds of losing the lottery in that case
39:56
isn't it yeah um i read about another
39:58
guy
39:59
in melbourne actually uh as you said
40:01
that guy was who
40:02
won and he sort of often appears on
40:05
articles about you know luckiest
40:07
luckiest man in the world
40:08
and that's this guy called bill morgan
40:10
who was in the 90s he had a bad accident
40:13
actually and this ends happily by the
40:15
way that's why people say he's the
40:16
luckiest man in the world
40:17
before you start getting upset uh so
40:20
he had an accident where he ended up
40:22
dead for 14 minutes
40:24
all right sorry okay he genuinely
40:28
i thought that was a very short story
40:33
he ended up dead for 14 minutes like
40:34
clinically dead but they resuscitated
40:36
him uh
40:37
he you know and twice he was in a coma
40:39
for 12 days
40:40
they were advised to turn off his life
40:42
support twice because they were like
40:43
he's going to be completely brain dead
40:45
but he woke up completely fine turned up
40:47
didn't have any brain damage at all
40:49
so he proposed to his girlfriend
40:51
straight away she said yes
40:52
and to celebrate a bit of a low-brow way
40:55
of celebrating but he bought a scratch
40:57
card
40:58
and he scratched it off and he'd won a
41:00
car
41:01
and so he was delighted about this and
41:03
he and the local news
41:05
very very local news i guess got in
41:07
touch but i mean it was quite a big
41:09
story because he'd been in this coma and
41:10
he'd suddenly come out and he'd won this
41:12
car
41:12
so the documentary did the local news
41:15
the local news also accused him of being
41:17
lowbrow for celebrating coming out of
41:18
his coma
41:22
i think what it meant was it was quite
41:24
an underwhelming way to celebrate buying
41:26
one scratch card
41:27
you know okay look fine it's a perfectly
41:31
decent way to celebrate surviving a coma
41:33
and getting engaged
41:34
buying a scratch card i know what you
41:36
mean because it's like if you get
41:37
engaged there's it's sort of saying i am
41:39
happy to be with you rather than i wish
41:41
for a dramatic change in my life
41:42
circumstances so it's a slightly
41:45
there's a bit of side eye to it if you
41:47
say so let's let's try and change
41:48
everything
41:49
it's actually a bit of an insult isn't
41:51
it right now i've doomed my life let's
41:53
try and find something that can possibly
41:54
resuscitate it
41:56
anyway this film local film crew came to
41:59
film his
42:00
delight and they asked him to reenact
42:02
the moment that he'd won the car
42:03
and so they got him to buy another
42:06
scratch card and scratch it off to
42:08
reenact oh my god i've won a car
42:10
and then he looked down at the scratch
42:11
card and he went oh my god i've won 250
42:13
000 wow and so like why you got the line
42:16
wrong mate
42:17
and uh there's other scratch card one of
42:20
250 grand
42:21
yeah and he immediately dumped his
42:23
beyonce
42:28
okay it's time for our final fact of the
42:30
show and that is
42:31
james okay my fact this week is that
42:34
zagreb has a museum of hangovers
42:36
its inventor was inspired when a friend
42:39
woke up one morning
42:40
with an unexplained bike pedal in his
42:43
pocket
42:46
so this is a guy called arino dabiakovic
42:50
who was a university student in zagreb
42:52
in croatia
42:53
and he said that he told journalists
42:56
that a friend spoke about how he woke up
42:58
with a bicycle pedal in his pocket and i
43:00
thought as i listened to him
43:02
why not set up a place a museum with a
43:04
collection of these objects as stories
43:06
that will illustrate in a funny way
43:08
these evenings of drunkenness and the
43:10
hangover the next day
43:12
and rather than just thinking it he
43:14
actually went and did it and this is the
43:15
thing that now
43:16
exists uh in croatia it's amazing that
43:20
it's a real place yeah
43:21
yeah it sounds really cool doesn't it
43:23
it's the idea of visit when you go
43:24
inside it recreates
43:26
your drunken journey home so it's room
43:28
by room you start in the bar
43:30
and then you go onto sort of graffiti
43:32
lined walls
43:33
that emulate a street and then you get
43:36
to store fronts and then a garden and
43:37
finally
43:38
your bedroom that's the end of the
43:39
museum finally you swallow your house
43:42
key
43:45
they have a chalkboard in there where it
43:47
features the beginning of a sentence
43:49
which is i woke up with
43:50
and then you can write in your answers
43:53
of you know the worst thing you've woken
43:54
up with when you've had a hangover
43:56
and um answers in the museum at the
43:58
moment or when this article was written
44:00
include two stray
44:01
dogs a lot of pumpkins and
44:04
and i saw the girl who wrote this one
44:07
eye
44:08
now this is very frustrating because i
44:10
saw there was like a video footage of
44:12
inside the museum
44:12
and you see this girl right one eye but
44:14
you only see her in profile
44:16
so i couldn't find out if she was lying
44:18
but it could be that you've
44:20
lost one of your eyes so you've woken up
44:22
with one eye
44:23
or that you've woken up with someone
44:25
else's eye in addition to your own
44:27
an extra eye it's either one or three
44:29
eyes you've got all together isn't it
44:31
yes
44:31
exactly yeah which would you prefer oh
44:34
i should think three i don't know that
44:36
implies you might have done something
44:38
awful though
44:39
does it i think that waking up with only
44:41
one eye implies that something awful has
44:42
happened
44:44
i think it depends if you'd rather harm
44:45
yourself or someone else james maybe
44:46
that's the difference between you and me
44:48
you know well one other difference
44:50
between you and me is i assumed i just
44:52
found the eye
44:53
and you think you've done something
44:54
awful to someone to get it i assume i've
44:56
gouged it out of a love right
44:59
you're happy with the three eye option
45:00
get the three sock option you seem to be
45:02
very hesitant
45:05
well what i'm thinking is if i had three
45:06
more eyes then i might have
45:08
advice but james that will take longer
45:10
to match them all up
45:12
uh yeah yeah absolutely you've got a big
45:14
pile of eyes that you have to match
45:16
with yeah not if they're all the same
45:18
color as long as you've got all blue
45:19
eyes you're fine right
45:20
yeah that's true so if you're ever going
45:22
to be gouging out people's eyes why not
45:24
go for people with the same eye color
45:26
just a little tip from an amateur to the
45:28
professional murderers out there
45:31
i think i would definitely hope for the
45:33
chance that i had done something
45:36
horrible over the guarantee of having
45:38
lost an eye
45:40
because i trust i trust my drunken self
45:42
not to
45:43
take someone's eye on not having removed
45:47
someone's eye by force
45:48
rather than the guarantee of having your
45:50
own eye but that may be an
45:51
inflated sense of my own um generosity
45:54
and pleasantness when drunk well yeah
45:57
because um you and i went on a big night
45:59
out quite recently andy
46:00
didn't we we did we were the last two
46:02
men standing yeah at the end of that
46:04
night out and james you've been missing
46:05
three fingers ever since
46:10
so hangovers yeah
46:13
they're not fun are they no and they're
46:15
very damaging
46:16
so on average 200 000 british workers
46:19
turn up to work hungover every day and i
46:21
imagine in these days of lockdown
46:23
more than that and
46:26
there's been a couple of papers that
46:28
have pointed out it's weird that not
46:29
more research has gone into it because
46:31
it has a massive impact on on the
46:33
economy and on society
46:35
like that number of people being quite
46:37
debilitatingly ill on a daily basis
46:39
is losing losing the country a lot of
46:41
money and
46:43
i was reading one editorial in the
46:44
current drug abuse journal which says
46:46
it's really surprising we haven't come
46:47
up with a cure because of these
46:49
consequences
46:50
and it speculates that there's probably
46:51
ethical reasons so people basically
46:53
think a hangover is kind of your
46:54
punishment you got drunk
46:56
you can stop getting drunk and then not
46:58
have hangovers but the journal points
47:00
out
47:00
um that people assume a hangover's
47:03
punishment that will prevent
47:04
similar drinking episodes in future
47:06
however there is no
47:07
scientific evidence that supports this
47:09
assumption whereas during the hangover
47:11
people often state they will never drink
47:13
again
47:13
this has never been found to happen it's
47:16
true
47:16
that's true the way i like to look at it
47:18
is you're kind of borrowing some fun
47:20
from the next day
47:21
right so if you go out drinking on
47:24
friday
47:26
then you're borrowing some of saturday
47:27
mornings fun and having it on friday
47:29
night
47:30
so you have more fun on friday but then
47:32
on saturday you just feel
47:33
like not fun at all right that's a
47:36
really good way of looking oh my god
47:37
that's an amazing
47:38
way of thinking about it yeah but that
47:39
explains because i i'm
47:41
very keen on deferring gratification as
47:43
far as possible
47:45
which probably explains why i'm not a
47:46
very big drinker because i think
47:48
well i'd rather have no fun at all
47:51
tonight
47:52
in the hope of having lots tomorrow
47:55
well what you could do is play the
47:57
lottery like a friend of mine does
47:59
where he buys a lottery ticket and then
48:01
he doesn't look at it
48:02
until the next week until after the next
48:05
week's draw
48:06
has been made and he's already bought
48:08
next week's lottery ticket
48:10
and what that means is that he always
48:12
potentially has
48:13
a winning lottery ticket in his wallet
48:15
yeah so he's always got a potentially
48:17
lottery winning ticket on him
48:19
yeah exactly is he a happy man or is he
48:21
a
48:25
it's you isn't it it's him oh god
48:30
i was reading about a pretty spectacular
48:32
hangover that happened
48:34
in china there's a guy called jiang wu
48:37
who was staying at a bed and breakfast
48:39
in
48:39
qingdao he had fallen asleep
48:43
in what he thought was his bed and
48:44
breakfast but actually turned out to be
48:46
a shipping container
48:47
that was being loaded the very next
48:49
morning onto a cargo that was going to
48:51
set sail for los angeles
48:53
so he woke up inside the container
48:57
he luckily had his phone on him it was
48:59
called his friends he couldn't get
49:00
through to a bunch of people called the
49:01
police
49:02
eventually they worked out where he
49:04
might be by tracking the phone
49:05
and they found him in a stack of cargo
49:08
containers
49:09
that were reaching 60 feet high and they
49:11
had to go through
49:13
i'd log about and if he did not if he'd
49:15
not woken up if it had been a few hours
49:16
later
49:17
i think they said he would have been on
49:19
his way to los angeles
49:20
oh my god it's a free holiday
49:24
the quality of airbnbs in this city you
49:27
mentioned
49:27
must be so low
49:32
maybe they have extremely luxurious
49:34
shipping containers yeah maybe yeah
49:36
[Laughter]
49:38
i actually have a favorite hangover that
49:40
i've i've
49:41
i thought it's my favorite hangover for
49:42
a long time and i'm so glad i get to
49:44
share it
49:44
it's alexander the great i think he had
49:46
the best hangover of all time
49:48
so this was in 330 bc and
49:51
one of his greatest conquests was he
49:53
conquered persepolis
49:55
uh it was the persian capital and
49:57
they've been building up to it for ages
49:58
it's this huge
49:59
historic moment and it had a magnificent
50:02
palace or series of palaces and they
50:05
were like had hundreds of years worth of
50:06
great persian
50:08
art and sculpture and writing and lots
50:10
of treasure it was the proper jewel of
50:11
the empire
50:12
so anyway alexander the great storms in
50:14
with his troops takes over this empire
50:16
it's the capital
50:17
massive moment and then so according to
50:19
one account everyone
50:20
got really pissed as you do celebrating
50:23
absolutely hammered
50:25
and apparently the drinking was far
50:27
advanced
50:28
and drunken madness took possession of
50:30
their minds
50:31
and then according to various accounts
50:33
either alexander and his assistants
50:35
decided or this woman
50:36
decided who was one of their mistresses
50:39
uh decided that what they should do is
50:41
they should just
50:41
burn the whole place down so she said
50:44
wouldn't it be really funny if you got
50:47
us a bunch of women to burn down this
50:49
amazing persian city that's taken so
50:51
long to build
50:52
and they giddy with wine decided that
50:53
would indeed be absolutely hilarious
50:56
and they burnt down the entire place and
50:58
so i just love the idea alexander the
51:00
great woke up the next morning in his
51:02
newly conquered palace in the city
51:04
and went oh my god what have i done wow
51:08
and that's it he destroyed the great and
51:10
we'll never have that we'll never have
51:11
the great jewel of that persian empire
51:13
they need to make that into a movie a
51:15
sort of historical version of the
51:17
hangover
51:18
the movie yeah just to see what his 24
51:20
hours when i post that
51:22
whoa the the um the ancient cures
51:25
are so much fun for hangovers
51:29
so there was a big thing of wearing a
51:31
wreath
51:32
of flowers in your hair if you did that
51:34
while drinking
51:35
doctors thought that had curative
51:36
properties and that you might not
51:38
get the hangover the next day did they
51:40
have to be specific flowers
51:42
i think they probably would have been
51:43
because that was a that was a big thing
51:44
wasn't it you know this will cure this
51:46
and so
51:47
um but that we know that the treatises
51:50
about this were written we just don't
51:51
know what was in them because
51:52
we just have some references to them so
51:55
we don't know exactly which flowers
51:56
work for which drinks it's not very
51:58
helpful is it i know
52:00
it's a lovely idea as well everyone just
52:02
in the pub is wearing a wreath of
52:04
flowers on their head
52:05
well they get battered yeah that's quite
52:07
nice that was being boiled in a coffin
52:09
and then buried in hay
52:11
which is less nice this is an
52:14
alpine old alpine tradition i've read
52:16
about it in this book
52:18
which i really want to get the full book
52:19
it's by a guy called shaunicy bishop
52:21
stool
52:22
and he he's written a book called
52:24
hungover the morning after and one man's
52:26
quest for the cure
52:27
and he basically went on this quest of
52:29
getting drunk every single night in
52:31
order that he could test out right now
52:33
and he tried this one where which is
52:35
traditional where you lie
52:37
in this kind of wooden coffin in a dark
52:39
room and you're shut in
52:40
and then this lady scoops boiling water
52:43
into it
52:44
till you're really hot and then you get
52:45
lifted out and chucked into a massive
52:47
pile of hay
52:48
and then covered up with hay and then
52:50
she digs you out and you're good to go
52:52
um it's worth a try isn't it it's what
52:54
does it do does he report
52:56
what it's like did it work he says it's
52:59
it's he's felt sort of euphoric
53:01
afterwards but
53:02
he didn't actually seem to say that it
53:03
definitely worked but he did come up
53:06
with
53:06
a hangover cure in this book and i trust
53:09
this more than anything because no one's
53:10
come up with a proper hang of a cure
53:12
except this guy who said uh the only
53:14
solution to the proper hangover symptoms
53:16
of uh
53:17
nausea and headache basically so we
53:19
don't really care about tiredness and
53:20
stuff that's just like snap out of it
53:22
have a coffee but nausea and headache
53:24
before you go to sleep
53:25
take milk thistle for your liver and
53:27
then you take an amino acid
53:29
called n-acetylcysteine apparently which
53:32
is inhaled as mist i looked it up you
53:34
can inhale it as missed
53:35
then take vitamins b1 b6 and b12 and
53:38
some frankincense
53:39
you do that where are we gonna get all
53:42
this stuff
53:44
i thought you might be growing them in
53:46
your garden i think it'd be easier for
53:47
me to find a coffin some hay and a swiss
53:50
lady
53:52
yeah um anna i love the fact that in a
53:54
time where we cannot buy
53:56
tomatoes or pasta you're recommending
53:57
people go out and get themselves some
53:59
frankincense
54:00
if you go to tesco the frankincense
54:03
aisle is completely empty at the moment
54:06
you should be able to inhale it as a
54:08
mist so just go and buy a packet of mist
54:09
in your local shop
54:13
there hasn't been as much of a run on
54:15
mist as there has been on eggs for
54:17
[Laughter]

01:17
hello and welcome to another working
01:20
from home episode of
01:21
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:25
coming to you from our respective
01:27
solitary pods
01:29
my name is anna tashimsky and i am
01:31
sitting here in my home
01:33
and in their homes we have james harkin
01:36
andrew hunter murray and
01:37
historian greg jenner and once again we
01:40
have gathered around the microphones
01:41
with our four favorite facts from the
01:43
last seven days
01:44
in no particular order here we go
01:47
starting with you greg thank you very
01:49
much okay
01:50
my fact is in 1825 britain's most famous
01:54
actor was nearly murdered by his own
01:56
furious audience
01:58
i mean was it was was he murdering a
02:00
role at the time
02:02
no no it's quite a complicated story so
02:04
his name was edmund keane
02:06
and he was an absolute genius he was the
02:08
greatest actor of the 19th century
02:10
still to this day greatly revered as a
02:12
shakespearean actor
02:14
but he was an absolute bellend he was
02:15
just the worst guy i love him he's my
02:17
favorite
02:18
he's sort of the star of my new book
02:19
because he everything he does is just
02:21
great and bad
02:23
simultaneously such mixed messages here
02:26
and he
02:27
he had been this was in america at the
02:29
time this was his second american tour
02:30
it's 1825
02:32
he's in the city of boston and
02:34
previously he'd been there in 1821
02:36
and he had he'd basically angered the
02:38
crowd by refusing to go on because there
02:39
weren't enough people in the audience a
02:41
bit of a diva
02:42
okay and uh and he sort of you know he'd
02:44
looked around the curtain and gone no
02:46
there's not enough people i'm edmund
02:47
keane i'm the great edmund keane
02:48
i'm refusing to go on it basically left
02:52
a sort of sour taste in the mouth the
02:53
bostonians told him to never come back
02:55
and then in 1825 he comes back and he's
02:58
just come off the back of a huge sex
03:00
scandal
03:01
and he thinks he'll run to america and
03:03
get away from the scandal in britain
03:05
but they all read the papers so he turns
03:07
up comes back to
03:08
new york they chuck oranges at his head
03:10
which is you know not too bad
03:12
but he gets to boston and five thousand
03:14
people storm the theater and try and
03:16
kill him
03:16
wow oh my goodness five thousand that's
03:19
quite a big gig
03:21
yeah that's what i'm getting out of that
03:24
i read that they turned up
03:25
after the start of the show they do yeah
03:28
his audience was probably several
03:29
hundred people
03:30
and then an extra five thousand sort of
03:33
break down the door smash their way in
03:35
it's kind of good news and bad news
03:36
isn't it because on the you know good
03:38
news 5000 more people want to come and
03:39
see you
03:40
but the bad news is they also want to
03:41
kill you yeah they probably weren't
03:43
paying i guess
03:45
no and what happened did he presumably
03:47
he survived right yeah he does he throws
03:49
down his wig he runs out the back door
03:51
he sprints up the street and he hides in
03:54
i think it's one of
03:55
the theater employees houses around the
03:57
corner and he
03:58
runs in the door and hides in the linen
04:00
basket oh wow
04:01
it's so clever it's so clever because
04:04
because he's an actor he's a master of
04:05
disguise
04:06
but for him just taking off a wig is a
04:08
disguise
04:11
true but um the audience do track him
04:13
down and they come to the door but
04:15
luckily the theater employee's wife is
04:17
pregnant and it sort of calms them down
04:20
because she comes to the door looking
04:21
you know vulnerable and and sort of like
04:23
please don't
04:24
stop my house and they kind of go oh
04:27
yeah right then i guess i guess we won't
04:29
murder the english guy
04:30
so he gets away with it and comes back
04:32
to britain
04:33
and then is this right greg that then he
04:35
carried on the top
04:37
because this is what i love about evan
04:39
keane he doesn't really take his uh
04:41
subtle cues very well so yeah he carried
04:43
on with the tour
04:44
um well it can only get better from that
04:46
quite low starting point presumably
04:49
well i read that the rest of the tour he
04:51
did philadelphia but there were protests
04:53
and then he did baltimore but the night
04:56
was cancelled when a mob refused to let
04:58
the curtain go up
04:59
and then he did charleston and the crowd
05:01
loved it so it was such a
05:03
we've all had those tours haven't we
05:04
where you kind of do
05:06
norwich and it's good and then bristol
05:08
and it's good and then you do dunstable
05:09
and you get chased out by a baying mom
05:13
and then craig i want to know if this is
05:14
true right this i read this
05:16
in a book called rogues and vagabonds by
05:18
vivian ellicott
05:19
and they said that he then did a
05:21
canadian tour and
05:23
he got really drunk after one of the
05:24
gigs and then disappeared and went to
05:26
live with some native americans
05:28
why is that true it's true he has made
05:31
an honorary member of the huron
05:33
indigenous tribe there
05:34
they give him a full ceremony and he
05:36
wears the stuff
05:38
back in london he wears the sort of the
05:39
headdress and the clothes
05:41
he's got a pet lion as well which he
05:43
walks around with so
05:44
he isn't it true that he did the gig and
05:46
then he just disappeared
05:48
and no one could find him anywhere it
05:49
eventually turned up in a wig lamp
05:51
but this was pig edmund keane this was
05:53
him to a tee he was famous for
05:54
vanishing uh mid dinner party mid gig i
05:57
mean my favorite story before he becomes
05:59
famous
05:59
is that he was meant to be playing
06:01
charles ii in a play
06:03
and he doesn't turn up for the gig the
06:04
theater manager has to go on in his
06:06
stead
06:06
it doesn't really know the lines the
06:08
audience start booing because the play
06:09
is going poorly you know
06:11
the manager sort of looking down at his
06:12
script trying to read the lines as he is
06:14
on stage
06:14
and suddenly a voice calls out from the
06:17
royal box
06:18
and it's this voice going keep going lad
06:20
you're doing really well
06:21
and it's edmond and he has drunkenly
06:24
he's
06:25
he's an he's a raging alcoholic so he's
06:26
stumbled off to the pub he's got a skin
06:28
full
06:29
he suddenly goes i should i'm meant to
06:30
be in the theater but he can't remember
06:32
how or why so he stumbles into the
06:34
theater to watch his own play
06:36
and then what's lovely is that he starts
06:39
out with encouraging heckles
06:40
and then gradually he starts to agree
06:42
with the audience the player's crap
06:43
and starts tackling his own cast mate
06:46
and he's then carried out
06:47
or forced out by security and fired from
06:49
the gig he was a child
06:50
like a minor child star uh he played
06:54
flay didn't he was that his first role
06:55
when he was six that's right so
06:58
the thing you should know about edmund
06:59
keene is that he's very small and he's
07:01
very weird looking
07:02
he kind of looks a bit like steve
07:03
buscemi he's kind of got these furious
07:05
features
07:05
and as a kid he was a brilliant gymnast
07:08
so his mum
07:09
who was a bit of an absent mum but at
07:11
one point she was in his life
07:12
she described him in the sort of place
07:14
as a sort of child genius but he was
07:16
actually a teenager
07:17
he basically he was so small that he
07:20
could pass for a child
07:21
but he was in his teens so he was
07:23
briefly famous in his teens
07:25
then he had an absolute disaster and was
07:28
a wandering actor who nearly starved to
07:30
death on several occasions at one point
07:32
he and his pregnant wife walk 180 miles
07:34
from birmingham to swansea for a gig
07:37
they don't have any money and they're
07:38
sleeping in hedges
07:40
in the height of summer she's seven
07:41
months pregnant oh god
07:43
really riches no wonder he didn't know
07:45
how to deal with the enormous wealth
07:46
when it came
07:47
it really is he literally overnight fame
07:49
literally overnight
07:50
it's incredible but that's a lot of
07:51
planning to get to if you know we've got
07:53
a gig in swansea
07:55
in a fortnight yeah but you can now
07:58
you can book all your hedges in advance
08:02
so we should say that keane was as well
08:05
as being a bit of a rogue was as you
08:06
said a brilliant actor apparently as far
08:09
as we know right and um
08:10
i think william haslam was very
08:11
impressed with him and sort of friend of
08:13
the show
08:14
friend friend of the show big willy h
08:18
yep good old willy he sort of
08:20
kick-started his career although
08:22
he was asked to give a review so i went
08:24
to see him in uh i think he was playing
08:26
08:27
um his first big role and he was asked
08:29
to give a favorable review which i
08:30
didn't realize people do you sent a
08:31
review to the theater but you'd say
08:32
yeah but make it a really good review so
08:34
how's that had to be a bit like
08:36
look i was asked to give a favorable
08:37
review but i really do mean it this time
08:40
it's great um but he was particularly
08:42
good at villains
08:43
it seems i think wasn't he seemed to
08:45
play he played richard the third very
08:47
well he played iago
08:48
he played and he played this guy
08:50
called the giles overreach
08:52
and i'd never heard of this play but
08:54
apparently it was one of the most
08:55
popular plays in the 19th century it's
08:57
called a new way to pay old debt
08:59
and it was written by a contemporary
09:00
almost contemporary of shakespeare just
09:02
after him
09:03
and it sounds great it's by a guy called
09:05
philip massinger
09:07
and um he were about 50 plays
09:10
apparently and we've lost about half of
09:12
them and a whole bunch of them we've
09:14
lost because
09:15
they were collected by an antiquarian
09:17
sort of book
09:18
book collector and his cook who was
09:21
called betsy baker
09:22
fittingly uh didn't realize how precious
09:24
they were and used them all as pie
09:26
baking dish liners so they were just
09:29
there to line dishes for pastry and
09:31
we've lost them
09:32
but he was this great like he's he's not
09:34
known at all anymore not really
09:36
no no a lot of playwrights of that
09:38
period actually don't really
09:39
have a modern reputation it's kind of
09:41
interesting but i mean it reminds me the
09:42
bio tapestry was briefly used i think as
09:44
a wagon covering
09:45
um like yeah i think i think so yeah i
09:48
mean several
09:49
sort of priceless things now you kind of
09:51
look back and go there was a brief
09:52
period where we were
09:53
basically using that as blue tag i read
09:56
um just going back on to
09:57
keane he um became very rich very
10:00
quickly
10:00
like you said and then he was living in
10:02
london so he's living in quite high
10:04
society yeah right
10:05
but he also ha he was a bit rough around
10:08
the edges as we've learned
10:09
right so i read that he people used to
10:12
make fun of him because he would
10:13
sprinkle greek and latin into the
10:15
conversation but he wouldn't really know
10:17
what they mean like delboi
10:18
yeah yeah it's one of my favorite facts
10:20
about him one of the reasons i love him
10:22
and he's
10:22
absolutely my favorite because on the
10:23
one hand he's such an on the
10:25
other hand
10:26
he's sort of man of the people he didn't
10:29
speak greek or latin
10:30
but he didn't let that stop him and so
10:32
he
10:33
he would go to dinner with his posh
10:34
friends lord byron and william hasla he
10:36
hung out with
10:37
the the king and the princesses uh and
10:39
he would stand up and give a speech
10:41
in dead languages that he couldn't speak
10:44
to people who spoke to them seems like
10:45
the opposite of boris johnson boris
10:46
johnson obviously speaks dead languages
10:48
to people who can't speak them as a way
10:49
of showing off how clever he is
10:51
edmund keane did the opposite and
10:52
everyone was like that is not
10:53
[Laughter]
10:55
um but what i like is that he would
10:57
leave he
10:59
sort of midway through the speech he'd
11:00
be like yeah this isn't really working
11:01
and i don't really like these people
11:02
anyway my people
11:04
are my drinking buddies the wolves and
11:06
his drinking club were called the wolves
11:07
and they were all kind of this
11:09
rowdy bunch of people he'd meet in the
11:10
pub and so he'd leave these parties
11:12
midway through a speech or whatever
11:15
wouldn't say goodbye he'd just go and
11:16
he'd be found a week later comatose on
11:18
the floor of a pub in deptford
11:20
surrounded by his drinking buddies but
11:22
what's brilliant about keane is that he
11:23
was also incredibly vengeful
11:25
he was such a petty guy and so he used
11:27
the wolves as his own personal
11:29
um kind of fan group to go and boo every
11:32
actor who'd ever
11:33
sort of wronged him or any stage manager
11:36
who hadn't hired him or anyone who'd
11:38
ever crossed him in his entire career he
11:40
would use the wolves to go and sit in
11:41
the front row and just
11:42
boo and heckle the entire play amazing
11:45
um here's the thing greg that i read and
11:47
i want to know if this is true or not
11:49
so keane was considered to be the best
11:51
actor in england which is true
11:53
i think um but what that was like was
11:56
like being a heavyweight boxer
11:58
and whenever another upstart kind of
12:00
actor came along they would challenge
12:02
you
12:02
to say i'm a better actor and the way
12:05
they would do this
12:06
is have a contest of othello where
12:09
whoever was the best actor would be
12:10
othello and whoever the upstart is would
12:12
be
12:13
iago and they would just kind of do this
12:16
play
12:16
to try and upstage each other like a
12:18
heavyweight boxing championship is that
12:20
right yeah
12:21
yeah absolutely right and you also had
12:22
these two main theaters the jewelry lane
12:24
theatre and the coven garden theater
12:26
and you would quite often see people
12:28
mounting the same play at the same time
12:31
to see who was the better who was who's
12:32
better richard iii who would be the
12:34
better
12:35
hamlet and so yeah it was a it was a
12:38
very much a way of
12:39
of keeping in check who the new kids on
12:42
the block were
12:42
did you have to i mean if you were
12:44
trying to decide did you have to run
12:46
between the two
12:47
theaters during the performance to
12:49
compare and contrast not it wouldn't be
12:50
on the same night it would be roughly a
12:52
roughly similar period so you know
12:53
within a few weeks of each other you'd
12:55
be able to sort of cook
12:56
okay that makes it easier for audrey
12:57
yeah absolutely it's all flicking over
12:59
from channel four to channel three no
13:01
itv um but keane was so jealous and so
13:04
vengeful
13:05
that he would set out to try and destroy
13:08
all of his rivals
13:09
and so he would do his absolute best to
13:11
undermine them
13:12
he would often refuse to act alongside
13:14
people he fired any actor who was taller
13:16
than him and he was five foot four so
13:17
that was most
13:19
fired any actor who was better than him
13:21
or any actor who is better looking
13:23
so much so um that famously people would
13:25
go and watch edmund keane act but they
13:27
would leave before the end of the play
13:29
because all the other actors were crap
13:32
and he also famously later on had a lot
13:34
of power in in
13:35
deciding which players would be put on
13:37
at the drew lane theater and
13:38
he rejected 500 scripts because other
13:41
actors had good parts
13:42
and he was jealous of them no wonder
13:44
people thought he was the best actor of
13:46
his time
13:46
no one else was allowed to do anything
13:48
all these other five foot three actors
13:51
insanely ugly in fact it was a great
13:54
time to be
13:55
a five foot three ugly actor tom cruise
13:59
would have fit right
13:59
yeah i mean that's mean he's a very
14:02
handsome man
14:06
okay it is time for a fact number two
14:08
and that is
14:09
my fact my fact this week is that it
14:11
wasn't until 1913
14:14
that we finally figured out how to stop
14:16
our food
14:17
tasting like our cutlery it was just all
14:20
everything tasted like metal before that
14:23
it all just depended how tasty your
14:24
fault
14:26
so i was sort of reading about the
14:28
history of stainless steel which is
14:30
effectively when this revolution
14:31
happened and being able to taste your
14:32
food rather than your cutlery
14:34
and before stainless steel was invented
14:37
and finally applied to
14:38
cutlery in 1913 we'd had metal tools
14:42
obviously since you know the um
14:44
iron age the copper age things are made
14:46
of copper and the bronze age
14:48
but they all are quite reactive with the
14:50
stuff you put on them
14:51
the only thing that doesn't react with
14:53
the food that you're putting on it
14:54
is gold but that obviously was out of
14:57
the reach
14:58
of your use and your mies so most people
15:00
couldn't do that yeah
15:02
you know when they moved from the copper
15:03
age to the bronze age
15:05
to the iron age or whatever did
15:06
everything just start tasting different
15:08
is that like is that the main thing that
15:11
happens to people who are living there
15:12
they're like wow
15:13
it was a revelation yeah even chicken
15:16
even chicken which tastes like nothing
15:18
starts to taste completely different
15:21
in fact actually that thing of
15:22
everything tasting like chicken would
15:23
have been true back then
15:27
have you ever had have you ever eaten
15:28
tarantula yeah it tastes a bit like fork
15:30
[Laughter]
15:34
but it's a really interesting thing
15:35
actually i mean i made a radio full
15:37
documentary about this and i got to
15:39
i was on with a material scientist and
15:41
we got to taste foods with different
15:43
types of spoon made of different
15:44
materials
15:46
who were you on with out of interest so
15:48
it's a it's a show called the origin of
15:49
stuff
15:50
and the scientist is called dr zoe
15:51
laflin yes i was reading about her she's
15:54
great
15:54
sorry she's really cool she makes stuff
15:56
like all that she's got a bbc program at
15:57
the moment
15:57
um where she makes her own trainers um
16:00
she's really cool and i was also
16:02
um on with katie brown who's the host
16:04
and a food writer called wilson and
16:06
we tried mango and strawberry can i just
16:10
say
16:10
we always are asked what's your favorite
16:12
um dinner party yeah
16:14
guests i think the four people that
16:15
you've just mentioned there is pretty
16:17
much my favorite it's pretty fun
16:19
yeah b wilson what a legend katy brown
16:22
loved her
16:23
yeah it was amazing shame about the greg
16:24
jenner aspect i mean it's a shame i
16:26
brought it down i mean i ruined it
16:27
but um yeah so what was really cool is
16:30
we tried mango and we tried strawberry
16:31
yogurt
16:32
and we tried them with copper spoons
16:35
silver spoons zinc spoons and gold
16:37
spoons
16:38
and it's amazing like the genu genuinely
16:42
you don't realize
16:43
how much you're tasting the spoon and
16:45
the metal until you're not tasting it i
16:47
did read that
16:49
eating mango sorbet with a gold spoon is
16:52
just about the best
16:53
you know epicurean treats you could
16:54
possibly have is that
16:56
it does sound really good doesn't it i
16:57
mean it does it doesn't
16:59
yeah it doesn't sound like you're
17:01
slumming it they don't have it at many
17:03
motorway service stations do they
17:05
it sounds better than you know a muller
17:07
fruit corner with a bus ticket
17:11
there was a point in the radio show
17:13
where i stopped talking and i was just
17:14
eating the mango
17:15
just happily i just like everyone else
17:16
was talking about the science and i was
17:18
just sitting there eating all the mango
17:19
because it was amazing but what was
17:20
really interesting is that
17:21
copper makes sweet things much sweeter
17:25
and it makes other things much more
17:27
bitter so savoury things much more
17:28
better like vegetables
17:29
when you eat it with a copper spoon
17:31
tastes really metallic and sharp and
17:32
bitter
17:33
but when you did the strawberry yogurt
17:35
it tasted incredibly sweet
17:37
as if you'd poured loads of artificial
17:38
sweetener into your yogurt what about
17:40
foods that are bittersweet
17:41
like uh chocolate that's 85 cocoa
17:45
that'll be really interesting wouldn't
17:46
it i don't know actually weirdly i had
17:48
some 85
17:49
cocoa last night if only i'd waited 24
17:51
hours i could have tested this right now
17:53
right here do you have a copper spoon uh
17:56
yeah i bring my copper spoon everywhere
17:57
with me it's in my front pocket
17:58
yeah good point well people used to
18:01
though in the past they used to have
18:02
their own personal cutlery you'd go
18:03
everywhere with your own knife
18:05
and that was uh it would be your knife
18:07
and you'd carry it everywhere and you'd
18:08
only with your own knife
18:10
um and then gradually people started to
18:12
introduce forks because forks come
18:14
quite late didn't people carry it around
18:16
in sort of cutlery shoulder bags aren't
18:17
there lots of those throughout history
18:19
that like
18:20
you take your cutlery satchel to a party
18:22
how much cutlery are you taking
18:24
are you taking your asparagus food as
18:26
well yeah your terrapin
18:28
fork of course if it's not a 13 course
18:31
meal i'm not going to the event in the
18:32
first place
18:33
so so if this is true about the cutlery
18:36
that you're having does the phrase
18:38
being born with a silver spoon in your
18:40
mouth is that a bad thing
18:42
does that mean it doesn't mean oh yeah
18:43
he was born with a silver spoon in his
18:45
mouth
18:46
everything tasted like for him yeah
18:48
that's what i originally meant
18:49
well so silver is less reactive than
18:52
most metals but it still apparently and
18:54
greg would know does leave a pretty
18:55
pronounced taste
18:57
yeah it does and you really you taste it
18:59
as soon as you then taste the gold which
19:00
tastes of nothing
19:02
um and the gold was just amazingly
19:05
interesting because it doesn't taste of
19:06
metal it doesn't taste of anything
19:07
you're just tasting the food
19:09
whereas the copper was like really
19:11
reactive because it's all about the
19:12
electrons and you know
19:13
how free they move around so gold is
19:16
inert
19:17
but copper conducts electricity really
19:19
well so it kind of
19:20
you just sort of get that activity in
19:22
the mouth you're really feeling all the
19:24
kind of taste buds going wow what's
19:25
happening
19:26
uh where is goal's much more sedate and
19:28
gentle i mean
19:29
your mate zoe dr zoe did say i think at
19:32
the end of this event which i'm so
19:33
excited you attended
19:34
she said you haven't lived until you've
19:36
eaten off gold so that's a bit of a blow
19:38
for most of us almost everybody yeah
19:40
yeah
19:41
but should we get back to the actual
19:43
original fact anna the 1913 thing
19:46
that's harry really isn't it and yes
19:48
yeah we should talk about him
19:49
got a hero you want wanna tell us about
19:51
what do you want to
19:52
do it oh yes i guess since i sort of
19:55
brought him up initially fine
19:57
so we have a historian here it's like
20:01
you know why do we have to do all the
20:02
work this week exactly i figured i could
20:04
put my face up for god's sake
20:06
right fine 1913.
20:09
there's a metallurgist called harry
20:11
bruley and he's actually working as all
20:13
the best inventions often came from sort
20:15
of trying to work on
20:16
weapons because really all countries
20:18
want to pump money into his war
20:20
so he was working on alloys for gum
20:22
barrels to try and make the steel and
20:23
gun barrels harder
20:24
and um he so he was testing out lots of
20:27
different alloys
20:28
steel alloys and he added chromium to
20:31
one
20:31
and when he was doing this to test sort
20:34
of how strong it was he had to etch into
20:36
it with various chemical additives
20:38
and he noticed that the chromium was
20:40
very resistant to these and the thing is
20:42
this had been spotted before so
20:44
stainless steel is basically you add a
20:45
certain amount of chromium to steel
20:47
this had been spotted but the theory is
20:49
that the reason harry breely realized
20:51
how useful it would be for cutlery
20:52
is because he was working in sheffield
20:55
and sheffield for many hundreds of years
20:57
as i'm sure any listeners in sheffield
20:58
will know has been famous as a cutlery
21:00
manufacturer so straight away
21:02
when he saw this material shoved it in
21:04
his mouth went oh wow that tasted
21:06
nothing i can use this
21:09
because he was working on gun barrels
21:10
would it be fair to say that harry
21:12
braley
21:12
literally brought a knife to a gun fight
21:15
which is in a way what the first world
21:16
war was
21:19
that's exactly what he did and that's
21:20
where the saying comes from wow
21:22
yeah yeah very strong but the
21:24
interesting thing about brielle is that
21:25
he um he was not the first person to be
21:27
experimented with this and i think
21:28
various other countries have claimed
21:30
their own scientists got there first
21:32
but he yeah uh he turned into cutlery
21:34
which is a huge change
21:36
in sheffield yeah exactly um and the
21:38
other you don't have sheffield in france
21:39
do you
21:42
think
21:45
and he was he was quite a socialist
21:47
really wasn't he and
21:49
um basically they never painted the
21:52
um invention of stainless steel in
21:54
britain so it meant that anyone could
21:55
make it
21:56
and also any money they did make he
21:58
wanted to share with everyone else in
21:59
his company
22:00
and his bosses weren't particularly
22:01
happy with that but they did pay to tear
22:03
around the world so it meant that um
22:05
if anyone made stainless steel in usa
22:07
canada italy france or japan
22:09
they had to get a license from sheffield
22:11
to do it so that's how they made all
22:12
their money
22:13
and then eventually he retired and he
22:15
started a charity called the fresh gate
22:17
trust foundation
22:18
which he said he hoped would help lame
22:20
dogs over styles
22:22
it's good to have an ambition isn't i
22:25
don't know exactly
22:26
i don't know if he was like giving legs
22:28
to dogs or lowering styles i'm not
22:30
really sure but one or the other
22:32
are we 100 sure it wasn't a metaphor
22:33
yeah it feels like it's a metaphor or
22:35
harry styles
22:36
does he mean getting sheepdog to jump
22:38
over harry styles
22:41
that's really nice yeah it is nice isn't
22:44
it i like to think it's not a metaphor
22:45
and it's an
22:46
exact explanation of what he was doing
22:49
i think it sounds i actually i believe
22:52
that because it sounds
22:53
what you need when you've got a
22:54
charitable campaign is a little big
22:56
thing they say or a big little thing
22:57
you know which is where it taps into a
22:59
problem that we all know
23:00
so instead of saying let's solve plastic
23:02
pollution let's say let's take this one
23:04
particular example
23:05
so rather than saying let's just replace
23:07
all styles with gates which is an
23:09
impossible dream
23:10
you say let's just help lay dogs over
23:13
styles and it's achievable
23:14
yeah it's good and yet that invention
23:17
doesn't seem to have lasted in the same
23:18
way that stainless steel has i don't
23:20
know about your guys dogs but my
23:21
my lame dog still can't make it over
23:22
those damn styles i'm constantly
23:24
whenever i see a style there's a queue
23:26
of sad looking dogs
23:28
with little crutches next to it
23:32
okay it is time for fact number three
23:34
and that is
23:36
andy my fact is that ants have a special
23:38
stomach which is just to contain
23:40
food to throw up into the mouths of
23:43
other ants
23:45
isn't that lovely and then do they go
23:47
down the line so do those recipient ants
23:49
then throw up their food into the mouth
23:51
of other ants i mean how many times does
23:53
food get eaten
23:54
the recipe ants i don't know that's such
23:57
a good point
23:58
you don't want to be at the end of that
23:59
line do you like the human centipede
24:01
it's the worst position i think is at
24:03
the end of the ant vomit line
24:05
that's definitely true it's not quite as
24:06
bad as a human centipede
24:09
in fact the human centipede if it was
24:10
the human ant would be very different it
24:13
would just be two people
24:14
sellotaped by their mouths i don't want
24:17
to talk about this i don't want to
24:18
i i know i mentioned this because it's
24:20
got a weird analogy to human life but
24:22
i've
24:22
already repeated it go on talk us
24:25
through it then
24:26
okay so this is a process called
24:27
trophallaxis and
24:29
uh it's it's a it's another way events
24:32
talking to each other basically so they
24:33
they make noises they touch each other
24:35
they
24:36
have pheromones and they also throw up
24:38
into each other's mouths
24:39
uh it's all liquid mouth-to-mouth
24:42
stuff it's actually i say that it's not
24:44
all mouth-to-mouth sometimes it's
24:46
uh bottom to mouth anal secretions
24:51
are imbibed according to the scientific
24:52
way of describing it yeah that is a bit
24:54
human centipede isn't it
24:55
yeah it is i know yeah but it's it's
24:58
very
24:58
useful because this is a it has a
25:00
purpose they're not just doing it for
25:02
fun
25:02
um they have information
25:06
in this stuff they're throwing up so it
25:09
might contain
25:10
hormones and maybe
25:13
you can feed these hormones to a lava
25:16
and it will change the way
25:18
uh that the lava's life develops so a
25:20
lover which receives this kind of
25:22
vom is twice as likely to become a
25:24
larger workaround so your whole life can
25:26
be changed by someone else throwing up
25:28
in your mouth
25:28
as an ant i find that amazing it's like
25:31
captain america super serum
25:32
you can you can supercharge you into a
25:35
supercharger it isn't
25:36
it is basically like that yeah and the
25:40
the amazing thing about this research is
25:41
how it was done so the researchers
25:43
they had to collect this fluid from the
25:46
mouths of ants which were returning to
25:47
the colony after a while away collecting
25:49
fluid
25:50
and they they kidnapped them they
25:52
anesthetized them
25:53
and then they squeezed them very very
25:55
gently until
25:56
they threw up this stuff and they
25:58
collected 0.34
26:00
millionths of a liter per ant
26:03
and then had to analyze what was in that
26:05
what kind of
26:06
dexterous tiny fingered researcher did
26:08
they find
26:10
[Music]
26:13
it's very hard you're getting the tiny
26:14
chloroform rag over there
26:17
so if the ant-man movie had been
26:19
anything like the science then it would
26:21
have been michael douglas taking a dump
26:23
in his mouth
26:25
and then he saw the superhero is this
26:27
fact going to be a string of superhero
26:29
references that i don't understand
26:31
yes i'll just laugh along um do you
26:34
reckon that this
26:35
stuff that they vomit up could be milked
26:38
for human
26:38
consumption if you had enough ants
26:41
um yeah i guess it could i think it's
26:45
a very much a last resort
26:48
i know you're getting to the end of your
26:49
canned goods at this point
26:57
yeah okay yeah maybe the big beans first
27:00
um ants are not the only animals who do
27:02
this are they who are
27:03
vomiting each other's mouths for various
27:06
different reasons
27:07
vampire bats do it so they vomit blood
27:10
into each other's mouths which
27:11
i would argue is one step more
27:13
disgusting than the ant version
27:15
yeah um do you want to do a batman thing
27:18
here gregor yeah absolutely yes
27:23
in order to defeat fear you must become
27:24
fear which means you have to vomit
27:26
blood into your mates yeah it's yeah
27:28
it's
27:29
lovely they're really sweet aren't they
27:31
no they are they do it to
27:33
they do it to strangers or to people who
27:34
they've just met basically yeah
27:36
is it like a handshake because that has
27:38
to be a viral nightmare yes exactly
27:40
we're not allowed to handshake anymore
27:42
but we're definitely not allowed to
27:43
vomit blood into each other's faces
27:45
you can't do anything these days
27:49
but yeah so so when you first meet a
27:51
vampire bat
27:52
and you want to be friends with them you
27:54
vomit blood in their mouths and they
27:55
gradually raise the stakes so it's their
27:57
way of making friends
27:58
so you start off with vomiting a small
28:00
amount of blood is doing a
28:01
small favor for someone and then as you
28:03
get to know and like each other and
28:04
trust each other
28:05
you will end up sharing lots of food
28:08
with the other vampire bats it's really
28:10
sweet
28:11
that's cute i was pretty surprised that
28:13
wolves do it because we're not talking
28:14
about edmond keane's friends
28:17
the wolves drinking glove yeah i bet at
28:19
some point actually edmond keane's
28:20
wolves did throw up into each other's
28:21
mouths
28:22
but uh also gray wolves do this
28:25
and which i find very sweet but they
28:27
leave the vomit in special piles and
28:29
then it's for their cubs so their cubs
28:31
come along
28:31
and chew it up and when i was reading
28:33
about this they
28:34
um they do it with blueberries so you
28:36
think of wolves they're sort of
28:38
tearing apart bray animals which they do
28:40
but they love blueberries apparently and
28:42
so they'll go and pick loads of
28:43
blueberries from bush
28:44
throw them up and then their kids eat
28:46
them that's right that reminds me
28:48
of pliny the elder do you know the story
28:49
i mean you must know the story of the
28:50
indian ants
28:51
implemented uh natural history but i
28:53
mean we all do but why don't you just
28:55
tell us anyway yeah yeah yeah so
28:56
i mean pliny the elder is one of the
28:58
sort of great naturalists of the ancient
28:59
world he's he's fascinating he's really
29:01
interested in in science and all sorts
29:02
of things he writes this lovely section
29:03
about ants
29:04
and how collaborative they are and what
29:06
they do and it's really lovely and it's
29:07
quite accurate and you kind of read it
29:08
and go oh
29:09
that's good that's right and then he
29:10
gets this weird paragraph where he's
29:11
like and in india they have indian ants
29:13
which are giant and they are the size of
29:15
foxes or wolves
29:16
and they hunt and mine gold and they dig
29:19
it up in the ground and they carry it
29:20
back to their lairs and any passing
29:22
indian
29:22
who happens to sort of pick up the gold
29:24
is torn apart by these giant ants
29:27
it's pretty terrifying and modern
29:29
scholars are like well that sounds
29:30
not like an ant that's probably a marmot
29:33
or some sort of other creature
29:35
um but they were convinced in the
29:36
ancient world that there was a sort of
29:37
race of giant mega ants that hoarded
29:40
gold like dragons
29:40
it doesn't sound much like a marmot if
29:42
i'm honest
29:44
it doesn't no but uh so it's probably a
29:46
translation era but it's quite a nice
29:48
bit
29:48
that comes after a long bit about ants
29:50
being you know really interesting
29:52
animals and then
29:52
to be yeah he did let his imagination
29:55
run away with him sometimes didn't he
29:56
yeah it's all right a few drinks
29:57
yeah yeah i think it's okay to riff but
30:00
this is the weird thing is that it is
30:02
weirdly socialized because the theory is
30:04
that lots of
30:05
insect colonies like ants or termites
30:07
they basically have one collective
30:08
stomach
30:09
and so forager ants deliver food
30:12
at a rate which depends on how full the
30:14
individuals they
30:15
encounter before so if everyone you come
30:18
across is really hungry
30:19
then forage rents kind of raise their
30:21
game and food flow rates
30:23
kind of get matched to how hungry the
30:25
overall colony is
30:26
based on the information you're taking
30:27
in that's amazing that's really
30:29
it's really neat how how do you spot
30:31
hungry aunt do they sort of
30:32
limp and drag them because i don't know
30:34
if a television aunt had lost weight for
30:35
it
30:36
um if it's so weak that it can't get
30:38
over a style then it's a very hungry end
30:42
um forager ants actually self-isolate do
30:44
they very
30:45
very thoughtful yes they would have been
30:47
absolutely nailing it around this time
30:49
probably are
30:50
so they go out and pick up food from
30:52
outside the colony and so they're the
30:54
most exposed to pathogens and stuff
30:55
because they're in the outside world
30:57
and scientists find that when they
30:59
deliberately expose them to a fungus
31:00
that kills them after a few days
31:02
if they infect them with it they'll
31:04
avoid going back to the nest and this is
31:06
even before they get sick
31:07
they've got an instinct that seems to
31:08
know they've been infected with a fungus
31:10
they don't go back to the nest so they
31:11
don't infect their friends
31:13
and even their fellow forage ants will
31:16
also not go back to the nest you know as
31:18
if like they've come into contact with
31:19
this
31:20
ant who's infected and they won't go
31:22
back to their nest and then meanwhile
31:24
the nurse ants inside the nest will
31:25
retreat deeper and deeper into the nest
31:27
but is it not true that the ones who are
31:29
self-isolating do come out once a week
31:31
to applaud the nurse
31:32
[Laughter]
31:36
it's very moving actually if you put
31:38
your ear to the ground you can hear it
31:40
on thursday another another animal that
31:42
does this vomiting thing
31:44
is uh honeybees so if you're
31:47
living in a honeybee house or a hive
31:50
as they call it it might get too hot
31:53
right
31:53
it might get too hot and so when it gets
31:55
too hot what happens is some
31:57
water collector bees go out they drink a
31:59
load of water
32:00
and then they come back and then vomit
32:02
it over everything and everyone
32:05
so wow it's almost like incredible yeah
32:08
like a hosepipe kind of thing
32:09
or a fountain it's a fireman like a
32:11
fireman yeah yeah yeah
32:13
there is a thing about the the nectar
32:14
the bees drink isn't it which is because
32:16
they
32:17
they drink the nectar and then they come
32:18
back to the hive and they regurgitate it
32:20
into
32:21
honey pots basically um for
32:24
you know the workers in the hive but
32:26
there's been a study done i think within
32:27
the last
32:28
couple of months saying that the the
32:31
sweeter the nectar is the harder the
32:32
bees find it to regurgitate
32:34
so if it's not very sugary it's very
32:37
easy for them to regurgitate because
32:38
it's not very viscous it's quite thin
32:40
and it takes four or five seconds so
32:42
they just you know they lean over the
32:43
honey pot they get another ant to hold
32:44
their hair back
32:45
a few seconds and it's fine but if
32:47
they've been drinking really really
32:49
sweet honey
32:50
uh or really really sweet nectar rather
32:52
um it takes about 30 seconds for them to
32:54
come up and they basically have to lean
32:56
over the honeypot and straight they just
32:58
sit there going
33:00
it takes ages to come out do you
33:02
remember when we went to john
33:03
mitchinson's birthday party a few years
33:05
ago and all the elves sat in the kitchen
33:07
and drank mead
33:08
oh yeah yeah that what you explained
33:11
there is exactly how i felt the next one
33:14
we all performed the honeybee ritual
33:16
later
33:19
um so there's uh one partic one
33:21
regurgitating creature
33:22
makes a seriously massive sacrifice
33:24
that's the desert spider
33:26
so she regurgitates food for her
33:28
offspring as soon as they've hatched
33:30
but what she does she eats enormous
33:32
amount of food um so that she can feed
33:34
it to them
33:35
and then it goes into her stomach and
33:37
then in order to
33:38
like she needs to pre-digest it for her
33:40
offspring and so her stomach properly
33:42
digests it
33:43
and this involves her stomach creating
33:45
massive amounts of digestive enzymes so
33:47
that she can throw up enough to feed all
33:49
of her offspring
33:50
and her stomach creates so many enzymes
33:52
and so much stomach acid
33:53
that it starts to eat her from the
33:55
inside out as well
33:57
so she throws up all this food for her
33:59
kids and then after about two weeks once
34:01
they finish the food
34:02
her body's been eaten away enough that
34:05
the kids can eat her
34:06
as their last supper that's so weird
34:09
it's weird but it's good parenting
34:12
actually in a way
34:13
yeah it's short-term parenting because
34:15
once they've eaten you you can't do much
34:18
you can't take them to the park after
34:19
that you're right that's when the dad
34:20
really has to step
34:21
up that's a bit like um have you ever
34:25
heard of the medified man
34:26
thing it's i think it's medieval arabia
34:28
top of my head people who at the very
34:30
end of their life
34:31
this is a thing you could do you just
34:33
only eat
34:34
honey you just only eat honey and very
34:37
gradually your body becomes
34:39
sort of sweet and then when you died
34:41
they would bury you mummify you
34:43
and then many years later on people
34:45
would eat you and
34:47
you'd be sweet tasting and it was a sort
34:49
of a religious thing it's kind of yeah i
34:50
was going to ask what the incentive is
34:52
for this
34:53
i don't know i think if you've if you
34:55
earlier in life got to eat someone who
34:57
was a sort of honey
34:58
honey monster lying under the ground
35:01
then
35:02
i would be willing to enter that scheme
35:03
where after my death people could do
35:04
that to me
35:06
imagine if they rebranded sugar puffs
35:08
with a
35:10
mellified man on the front box the
35:12
rotting corpse of a person who wants
35:15
hazel's honey
35:18
i'm not convinced that if you ate the
35:21
like presumably by this point
35:23
quite well decomposed body of someone
35:25
who ate honey for a while before they
35:26
died i
35:27
don't even know if that would taste of
35:28
honey by that point would it i mean did
35:30
it work
35:31
oh don't spoil it it's just gonna taste
35:34
a very
35:34
slightly sweet human corpse isn't it i
35:36
think so
35:37
if it depends what fork you're eating it
35:39
with doesn't it
35:42
i've read it so this is just briefly
35:44
back to ants
35:45
um i just want to share with you the
35:48
intro of an article in the new scientist
35:49
about a particular kind of ant okay it's
35:51
a couple of sentences
35:52
i think it's worth telling you the
35:55
article begins
35:56
suppose you could have sex with your
35:58
brother or sister in the full
35:59
and certain knowledge that any children
36:01
would be safe from the harmful effects
36:02
of inbreeding
36:03
would you be more willing to commit
36:05
incest the long-horned crazy ant
36:07
certainly is
36:10
wow that does feel like the journalist
36:12
has gotten lucky by finding that
36:14
answer doesn't it he's already written
36:18
the first two sentences
36:20
i mean i didn't know it was i didn't
36:22
really know it was about ends when i
36:23
clicked
36:23
on it i was very disappointed
36:27
yeah what a what a start an opening and
36:29
would you though
36:31
no yeah i think that's probably the
36:33
right answer isn't it
36:35
probably well queen cleopatra did of
36:37
course yeah
36:39
two of her brothers and she didn't even
36:40
do that in the certain knowledge that
36:42
she would be free from the damaging
36:44
effects of interest
36:47
on regurgitators do you remember last
36:49
week uh you won't remember this greg
36:51
because you weren't here but
36:52
um andy you talked about human ostriches
36:54
do you remember
36:55
oh yeah yeah um so they would swallow
36:57
bits of metal and bits of glass and
36:59
stuff like that
37:00
and the modern day you know uh version
37:03
of that they have the sword swallowers
37:04
but also you have
37:05
regurgitators so on britain's got talent
37:08
a few years ago there was someone called
37:09
stevie starr
37:10
who could swallow a rubik's cube that
37:13
was mixed up and then when he
37:14
regurgitated
37:15
it was all solved no way he couldn't
37:19
no throat is big enough for a rubik's
37:21
cube it was a small it was a small round
37:23
as well
37:24
this makes tying a knot in a cherry
37:26
stalk look like
37:28
really child's place okay which do you
37:30
think would be harder learning how to
37:31
solve a rubik's cube with the inside of
37:33
your stomach or
37:34
learning how to swallow two rubik's
37:36
cubes one pretty solved
37:38
before you do the show yeah and then so
37:42
a lot of people think i've read a lot of
37:44
forums
37:44
[Laughter]
37:46
a lot of people think that maybe he did
37:48
your trick which is having two rubik's
37:50
cubes inside him and one of them comes
37:51
out
37:52
but then a lot of people who do this
37:54
kind of regurgitation they think well
37:55
you know what maybe it is possible to do
37:57
that no
37:58
way and he definitely does but he
38:00
definitely does
38:01
other tricks with his regurgitation
38:03
apparently he learned his skill when he
38:05
was
38:06
um a child and he swallowed his pocket
38:08
money so no one would steal it
38:10
wow nice and then when he brought it
38:12
back up it was what a different
38:13
denomination
38:17
he's like a bureau of charge that's
38:20
amazing james i don't did he not win
38:24
no he didn't win what that's an amazing
38:26
talent there's no justice no
38:28
who won as some singer probably that
38:31
that dancing dog but in fairness do you
38:33
remember that dancing dog in fairness it
38:35
could get over styles so
38:36
[Laughter]
38:38
quite skillful in terms of um the the
38:41
guy who
38:42
the human ostriches did you talk about
38:43
polyphagus nero's
38:46
um so an emperor nero according to
38:48
cetonus the roman
38:49
um writer talked about nero having a
38:52
a kind of a pet man who was probably a
38:55
slave but we're not quite sure and he
38:56
was known as polyphagus which is greek
38:58
for all eta
38:59
eats all things and he would eat
39:01
anything including humans
39:02
alive apparently you could throw him a
39:04
human and he would eat the humans
39:06
wow how big was polyphagus well
39:09
apparently he was a very large man and
39:10
he was sort of a glutton or a gourmand
39:12
who would eat anything at all and he
39:13
would devour
39:14
he sounds like a very large man with big
39:16
claws who hibernates every winter to me
39:18
well
39:19
so that is that's one of the actual
39:21
interpretations of
39:22
story to like are you sure it's not a
39:23
bear but um yeah so
39:26
pet man i'm trying to work out which is
39:27
the worst thing to be a slave or a pet
39:29
man
39:31
both are very bad it does sound like a
39:33
very bad euphemism for an enslaved
39:35
person
39:36
he's not a slave it's a pet man it's
39:38
awkward you don't have the sound of that
39:40
andy because that is what your wife
39:41
calls you when she refers to you
39:42
but unbelievable never mind
39:47
okay it is time for our final fact of
39:49
the show and that is
39:51
james harkin okay my fact this week is
39:53
that ancient
39:54
egyptians had artificial egg incubators
39:57
but they didn't have thermometers so
39:59
they measured the temperature of the
40:01
eggs by holding them
40:02
to their eyelids really nice
40:05
isn't that lovely so um very quickly on
40:09
this
40:09
egypt has been famous for a long time
40:11
for its egg ovens
40:13
and they have been going back from at
40:16
least
40:16
the late period of the new kingdom which
40:18
is 500 bc
40:20
onwards um and we know that because
40:22
aristotle wrote about them
40:24
he said that the people in egypt make
40:26
eggs that are hatched spontaneously in
40:28
the ground by being buried in dung heaps
40:31
and then 200 years later there was
40:33
another historian called diodorus
40:35
siculus sorry greg i don't know how you
40:37
pronounce that
40:38
and he also said that these um egg
40:41
hatching was really amazing that the
40:42
egyptians did
40:43
and then throughout history you get
40:45
loads of people writing about what great
40:47
egg hatches the egyptians are
40:49
and i was reading an article about the
40:52
modern day egg hatches in egypt and they
40:54
said that they still use
40:55
all the old techniques including this
40:57
way of telling
40:59
if it's too hot which is they put them
41:01
next to their eyelids because that's
41:02
what one of the most sensitive parts of
41:03
your body is
41:05
and apparently it's still done today and
41:07
they've been doing it for thousands of
41:08
years i had no idea that
41:10
it was still happening today that's very
41:12
very cool yeah
41:13
yeah isn't that amazing wow and it's
41:15
extraordinary the
41:16
ability to i guess they were mass
41:19
producing egg
41:19
because what's interesting is that
41:20
chicken eggs were not eaten in egypt
41:23
for like all the pharonic period you
41:24
know so when you're thinking of
41:26
pharaohs and tombs and and um pyramids
41:29
they don't have chickens at all
41:30
and then they were introduced as you say
41:32
about 500 bce probably and then they
41:34
went mad for them they were like yeah we
41:35
love eggs it's brilliant they're
41:36
producing tens of thousands of them
41:38
so like i say it wasn't ancient ancient
41:40
ancient egypt
41:42
it was just before the romans yeah right
41:45
yeah i i would i would argue that's
41:47
ancient egypt
41:48
depending on where you're looking from
41:50
which is now
41:51
this is the problem with ancient egypt
41:53
is that ancient egyptians were aware of
41:54
themselves as an ancient culture
41:56
so they they were ancient egyptian
41:58
pharaohs who did archaeology on ancient
42:00
egyptian pharaohs which is amazing
42:02
they were kind of and this herodotus
42:05
used to travel he used to you know
42:06
apparently he traveled to egypt to go
42:07
and look at the ancient
42:08
stuff so an ancient greek philosopher
42:11
and writer
42:12
went to egypt to go and look at the old
42:13
stuff which is quite cool yeah yeah
42:16
and so yeah and everyone who went to
42:18
egypt or wrote about the egyptians
42:20
always seemed to mention these amazing
42:22
egg buildings which they used to make
42:23
their eggs so
42:24
in the 18th century there was a french
42:27
scientist called
42:27
renee antoine first showed the warm air
42:30
and he said
42:31
that egypt should be more proud of its
42:33
hatcheries than of its pyramids
42:35
fair enough ray moore actually who yeah
42:38
he was one of the people who went and
42:39
reported on them
42:40
he i love him because he's the guy who
42:43
almost gave us paper but then didn't so
42:46
he was a guy who
42:48
was mainly an entomologist and he
42:49
studied paper wasps
42:51
and he suddenly looked at paper wasps
42:52
and he said oh my god these guys are
42:54
chewing up
42:54
wood into pulp and then mashing it
42:56
together to make paper guys
42:58
we should do this and he wrote that in a
43:00
in a paper which wasn't on paper
43:02
ironically
43:04
but people ignored it and then they
43:05
didn't we didn't figure out how to make
43:07
the paper that we know today for about
43:08
another hundred years
43:09
so wow but i've always loved the idea
43:12
that wasps were making paper for just
43:14
thousands of years before we figured it
43:15
out yeah
43:16
what did they do with it though good
43:18
point they're not writing eulogies are
43:19
they they never call they're never right
43:22
but he's one of the brilliant men of the
43:24
18th century there are lots of fantastic
43:25
french scientists in this period
43:27
sort of milling around being quite fancy
43:28
and clever and he was an entomologist
43:30
but he had all sorts of interest
43:31
but what was really fun about him is
43:33
that he was really fascinated by birds
43:35
as well as
43:35
insects and he used to advise king lou
43:39
the 15th as well
43:40
uh who was the king of france after
43:42
louis the 14th and
43:43
louis the 15th to get back to eggs louis
43:46
the 15th was really
43:47
into his soft-boiled eggs he was really
43:49
really like he really enjoyed them and
43:51
he would have them every sunday
43:53
and he had an ability to swipe the top
43:55
of the egg off with a single blow of his
43:56
fork
43:57
like a little execution thing and which
44:00
point which louie was this
44:01
louis the 15th so pre-revolution
44:05
pre-revolution in 1750 there's a bit of
44:07
irony there
44:08
that he was able to do that yeah
44:10
absolutely
44:11
he could he could guillotine his egg uh
44:14
with a single blow
44:15
and people would gather to watch the
44:17
king eat his sunday egg
44:18
and and the valet would announce it by
44:22
hushing the room and saying
44:23
the king shall now eat his egg and then
44:25
everyone would go quiet and then he
44:26
would do his little swoosh thing
44:28
decapitate the egg and some people in
44:29
the audience started thinking
44:31
yeah that's a good idea
44:35
can i just say like i don't want to put
44:37
myself
44:38
as some kind of amazing french king but
44:41
i can
44:41
chop the top off an egg in one swish as
44:43
well no you can't
44:45
i can what i'm saying is it's not
44:48
exactly swallowing a rubik's
44:50
cube as far as skills go is it it's not
44:53
that great no you're right
44:54
18th century france has got talent was a
44:56
much less good show
44:58
but james can you do it in front of an
44:59
audience because that's where the
45:00
pressure is it's like going on you know
45:02
a quiz show
45:03
we can all answer stuff you know in our
45:04
lounge but when you've got people
45:06
watching
45:06
that's when the pressure's on true
45:08
you're absolutely right you're so right
45:10
i would almost certainly freeze under
45:11
the pressure
45:13
and also you specified that he was doing
45:14
it with a thought for god's sake
45:16
this was in the early days of forks
45:18
people barely knew which way around to
45:20
hold them and he's decapitating eggs
45:22
okay fine he nailed it yeah did you see
45:25
a few months ago
45:26
archaeologists found some roman eggs 1
45:29
700 years old there were chicken eggs
45:31
that had not been opened
45:33
and they'd been deposited as part of a
45:35
sort of an offering to the gods
45:36
and they accidentally cracked them and
45:38
the smell was
45:40
intense wow like one thousand
45:42
seven-year-old rotten egg
45:44
really really intense sulfury smell
45:46
pretty full on
45:47
oh my god i have had i have eaten 100
45:51
year egg i don't know if anyone else has
45:52
had that wow
45:53
it's that's what it's called like in
45:55
chinese cuisine they call it the 100
45:57
year egg but actually i think it's just
45:59
a very slightly got off egg
46:01
or something or they they cook it in
46:03
some way that it look then it smells a
46:05
bit sulfurous and it tastes a bit kind
46:06
of bitter but
46:07
i don't think it's a hundred years old
46:09
it's not dated back to previous seasons
46:11
okay no no you've got a supply issue
46:16
um but yeah i can only imagine what the
46:18
1 000 year old
46:20
or 2 000 1 700 years old yeah it's from
46:23
this i think fourth century
46:25
and i think a couple of the eggs they
46:26
didn't correct so they've got two
46:27
preserved roman eggs and then i think
46:29
they broke a couple
46:30
those must be the oldest extant hens
46:33
eggs
46:33
in the world surely there can't be any
46:35
older than that i don't know
46:37
i've not asked the round but they're
46:38
pretty good because the one of the eggs
46:40
one of the eggs in the world will be the
46:41
oldest one wouldn't it that's just
46:43
matter
46:44
that's true i don't even know if that's
46:45
maths
46:47
that's philosophy philosophy
46:52
were the romans super keen because it's
46:54
weird when you look at the popularity of
46:55
eating chicken
46:56
that um it really didn't become the uh
46:59
meat of choice it wasn't particularly
47:00
popular meat until the last couple of
47:01
hundred years maybe i think people ate
47:03
such a wider variety of birds
47:05
but the romans were quite into chicken
47:07
right yeah they were i mean they also
47:08
had sacred chickens too uh so there's
47:10
that famous story of claudius paul care
47:12
who is a roman general
47:13
a naval general and he was just before a
47:16
battle he was going to do the thing
47:18
called
47:18
um augury um or i think the word is
47:22
ornithomancy where you're trying to
47:24
fortune tell using
47:25
um birds and what he did is he put down
47:28
some some corn for the bird to eat the
47:29
chicken to eat
47:30
and the hope would be that the chicken
47:31
would eat the corn and that's a good
47:32
omen for your battle
47:33
and the chicken didn't eat and all the
47:35
soldiers on the ships were freaking out
47:37
they're like oh my god we're gonna lose
47:38
the battle and so claudius pulcare he
47:40
freaked out
47:41
he picked up the chicken and he threw it
47:42
over the side and said maybe it's
47:43
thirsty
47:44
and and it did not go well they lost the
47:48
battle the soldiers panicked because he
47:49
drowned the chicken and there was a sort
47:50
of inquiry afterwards about doing this
47:52
this terrible thing for sacred chickens
47:54
interesting isn't it because actually
47:56
obviously the chicken not eating has
47:58
nothing to do with the battle
47:59
but in a way it does because he threw it
48:01
overboard and everyone got worried about
48:03
it and there's like a placebo
48:05
yeah it's a morale issue yeah it's a
48:06
placebo effect it's kind of
48:08
it's kind of funny so the soviet union
48:12
tried to incubate some eggs in space
48:16
and it worked eventually um they brought
48:19
quails because they're kind of smaller
48:20
than chickens
48:21
a lot easier to have as a quail in a
48:23
spaceship than it is to have a chicken
48:26
so they had a problem and that was that
48:28
when the chickens were born or when the
48:30
quails were born
48:31
the they couldn't eat or drink and that
48:33
is because if you get a quail
48:35
when it's born it can't lift its head up
48:37
because it's not strong enough
48:38
but that's fine because all its food is
48:40
on the ground and if it wants to eat is
48:41
on the ground so it just kind of lies
48:43
there with its head on the ground and
48:44
eats and eats and eats eventually gets
48:46
strong enough to lift its head up
48:48
but in space of course you don't have
48:49
the gravity to bring the head down to
48:51
the ground
48:52
so its head and neck were just kind of
48:54
floating around
48:55
in the space and it meant that they
48:57
couldn't feed so if you put some food
48:59
down for the quails they couldn't eat it
49:01
and so the cos one doesn't the food
49:04
float
49:05
exactly can you not lift the food to the
49:07
level of the floating quail
49:08
you can and that's what they did but
49:10
they had to do it every two hours
49:12
ah oh and these cosmonauts had other
49:14
things to be getting
49:17
they couldn't just be feeding the quails
49:19
every two hours
49:20
and so eventually unfortunately the the
49:23
quails
49:24
cocked it did they actually yeah they
49:26
did but then they tried it again a bit
49:27
later and they made tiny little hammocks
49:29
for the quails which are
49:31
heads of place and then they could hold
49:33
the food in place as well and so they
49:35
the next lot were fine i had pet quails
49:37
when i was young
49:39
yeah because i'm allergic to cats and
49:40
dogs and other animals and
49:42
uh my dad was like get you a bird but we
49:45
don't want a bird in the house
49:46
so we'll get you some quails so i had
49:48
some quails in the garden did you try
49:49
all the animals until you settled on
49:51
quiet it feels like
49:53
you tried cats allergic tried dogs
49:55
allergic tried
49:56
marmot's allergic yeah i tried indian
49:58
ants they were feral and furious they
50:00
tried to steal my gold
50:02
and then i tried a pet man but he tried
50:05
to eat me
50:08
we ended up with quail yeah and sadly
50:09
actually my brother who is a very small
50:11
at the time he crushed the quail legs
50:13
in his hand accidentally because you
50:15
know he didn't understand his own
50:16
strength and so that was the end of our
50:17
quail oh my god
50:18
like uh lenny from a mice and men or
50:21
whatever yeah it was a sort of sad
50:24

but i do think i loved it in the mind of
00:46
like a nine-year-old
00:47
it's about basically a bunch of animals
00:49
an array of animals who go around
00:51
solving crimes together with the league
00:52
character this really adventurous kind
00:54
of spunky gal called mickey
00:56
it's fab yes and actually the other
00:58
person who's on this week's show as well
01:00
as myself and anna and anne
01:01
is of course andrew hunter murray and of
01:03
course he has a book as well which we
01:05
should mention
01:06
uh and that's for people whose reading
01:08
age is above the age of nine so have you
01:10
read that anna
01:11
i have indeed so here i have to slip
01:12
into my ten-year-old self
01:14
uh to really get to grips with that um
01:16
no that's called the last
01:18
day and it's brilliant if what you're
01:19
looking for to escape
01:21
this kind of current dystopia is a
01:23
fictional and much more exciting
01:25
dystopia
01:26
you want to go to the last day the
01:28
concept is amazing so the concept is
01:30
that
01:30
the world stops spinning and half of
01:32
it's plunged into darkness half of it's
01:34
in light
01:35
and it's all the repercussions of that
01:37
combined with a
01:38
thriller story and again a great spunky
01:41
female character i think it might be
01:43
mickey when she's grown up
01:44
oh wow imagine that if that's the same
01:47
universe
01:48
it is oh my god this whole thing has
01:50
been blown wide open
01:52
all right so go and look up both of
01:53
those books the last day and mickey and
01:55
the animal spies
01:56
yes especially at the moment when it's a
01:58
really good time to be supporting
01:59
authors and buying books
02:01
it's such a good time to buy books the
02:03
whole book industry is massively
02:05
struggling so it's just think of it as a
02:07
good thing to do
02:08
for the world as well as yourself to go
02:10
out and buy books okay
02:11
on with the show
02:23
[Applause]
02:26
[Music]
02:27
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:29
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
02:31
coming to you
02:32
not from the qi offices in covent garden
02:34
but from four
02:36
rooms across the country
02:39
my name is andrew hunter murray and with
02:41
me today are anna tashinsky
02:43
james harkin and anne miller and once
02:45
again we have gathered around the
02:47
microphones with our four
02:48
favorite facts from the last seven days
02:51
and in no particular order
02:52
here we go starting with you anna
02:56
my fact this week is that loafers are
02:59
edible
03:00
mmm a yummy snack
03:03
yeah um this is i didn't say they tasted
03:06
nice but
03:07
uh luffas which i find it a really funny
03:10
word
03:10
um so loofahs are plants from the luffa
03:14
or the luffa
03:14
plant so i think i assumed and maybe
03:17
other people did that real loofah
03:19
sponges that you get in the shower
03:20
are sponges like the animals the
03:22
organisms
03:23
but they're not they're a plant they're
03:25
a gourd in fact
03:27
and you can grow them i realized that
03:29
there's this plant that i've been
03:31
looking at in my local shop in london
03:33
pre pre-lockdown obviously um that i've
03:36
never known what it is and it's this
03:37
it's just a loofah sponge in its early
03:39
days no yeah
03:41
it looks like a ridged courgette and
03:44
um yeah basically it's like a gourd and
03:47
the
03:47
loofah that you have hanging in your
03:48
shower is when it's past its
03:51
delicious phase and more in the dried up
03:54
desiccated phase and it's like if you
03:57
think of a pumpkin when you empty a
03:58
pumpkin out to make a face out of it
04:00
then all the the white stringy stuff in
04:02
that when that dries up in the loofah it
04:04
turns into a sponge
04:06
luffas are really luffy's have so many
04:07
uses that i didn't know about
04:09
um so researchers in mumbai they've made
04:12
bricks
04:12
out of looters and they they have more
04:15
air pockets than a standard brick so
04:17
you can't you have to dry it and grind
04:19
it down and mix it with
04:20
aggregate material kind of like concrete
04:23
is you know it's
04:24
mixed together with other stuff but
04:25
they're really porous and they can
04:27
harbor plant and animal life inside the
04:29
brick
04:30
and they're so poor is they have kind of
04:32
mini water tanks inside them so that
04:34
cools the building down
04:35
so loofahs sound like the ideal brick
04:39
home building material okay but but one
04:41
thing you shouldn't really use lufus for
04:43
is scrubbing your back in the bath isn't
04:45
that right
04:46
according to some microbiologists
04:49
they're like
04:49
a breeding ground for bacteria
04:52
because they have lots of air pockets
04:54
lots of holes where bacteria can get in
04:56
and dead skin cells
04:57
you get dead skin cells in there what do
04:59
bacteria like to eat
05:00
dead skin cells where do they like to
05:02
live in warm
05:04
damp environments what is a bathroom a
05:06
warm damp environment it's perfect
05:09
i've read a bit of advice saying you
05:10
should chuck away your loofah pretty
05:12
much every week
05:13
which feels like you're going through so
05:15
many loofers yeah so the three packs
05:16
should last you about a month yeah
05:17
that's too many yeah
05:19
but loafers are quite long i've seen one
05:21
at kew gardens and it's much longer than
05:22
a loofah you put in the bath maybe you
05:24
just cut a bit off maybe it grows back
05:25
like celery
05:26
take the end off it maybe it does
05:29
we're not sure anybody can buy one from
05:31
that shop when it reopens
05:33
i will well if they're anything like
05:34
your average kind of gourds you know
05:36
when you try to grow courgettes and you
05:38
end up at the end of the season with two
05:39
hundred thousand courgettes or marrows
05:41
by that point
05:42
no i don't know maybe i've never grown a
05:45
mara
05:47
this this might be your experience but
05:48
it's not a universal human experience
05:52
i think anyone who's ever done gardening
05:54
and garden with uh
05:55
courgettes that turn into marrow will
05:57
know i remember this in my childhood
05:58
that
05:59
they grow much better than any other
06:01
vegetable so you get so sick of eating
06:03
them for every single meal please write
06:05
in if you found them
06:06
don't say that you're going to get
06:07
hundreds of thousands of emails now
06:12
um the one thing you can do if you don't
06:14
want to throw your loot away is
06:15
microwave it
06:16
that's one advice from the luffa experts
06:19
they say
06:20
to eat it or clean it that's a great
06:22
point i don't know how it cooks in a
06:24
microwave but if you have a loofah in
06:26
your
06:26
bathroom and you're worried that it's
06:28
getting a bit germy apparently if you
06:29
shove it in the microwave for
06:31
30 seconds or a minute then it'll don't
06:34
put it just start with 10 seconds okay
06:37
don't put it in for too long yeah the
06:39
microwaves always the way with the
06:40
microwave though
06:41
start for 10 seconds build up to giving
06:43
it an hour yeah
06:44
take it out stir it around nice um do
06:47
you guys know that there's only one
06:48
hotel
06:49
in the uk that grows its own loofahs
06:52
really
06:53
yeah one hotel where it's near bath
06:56
it's near bath that's funny um
06:59
a place called stone eastern park and
07:03
not only do they make their own luffas
07:05
they have
07:06
a an annual event the luffa harvest
07:09
where you can go to the hotel
07:10
and see the loofahs being harvested
07:14
the end of october or the start of
07:15
november every single year so hopefully
07:17
it won't be affected by the current
07:18
lockdown
07:19
fingers crossed and the gardeners will
07:21
take you down and
07:22
advise you on your own luther
07:24
cultivation and then they'll give you a
07:26
demonstration
07:27
on how to de-skin your louver and then
07:29
you get a two-course lunch
07:30
i don't know if there's any luther's
07:32
part of that both courses
07:35
and then you get a loofah demonstration
07:37
and at the end of the day you get to go
07:39
back to the garden and pick your own
07:40
loofah
07:41
wow what a day out that would be
07:44
it sounds amazing yeah hey you know who
07:47
would love that so i was looking up
07:48
um gerds and squashes so gerd is
07:50
basically generally used for the
07:52
inedible ones and squash are the ones
07:53
that we eat
07:54
um but the american gourd society they
07:56
began in 1937
07:58
and they are big enthusiasts of all the
07:59
kinds and i was having a look at other
08:01
kinds of gourds because the loofah
08:02
obviously great
08:03
do you know about the bottle gourd no so
08:06
it's basically it's long
08:08
and when you dry it out it kind of
08:10
becomes hollow and it's got a long uh
08:12
stem which works like a handle so you
08:13
can use it to carry water around oh no
08:15
it's kind of useful i was just thinking
08:17
the word god i think i first came across
08:19
it in the asterix books
08:21
did he used to carry like magic potions
08:23
in his god and stuff
08:24
oh that does so well yeah yeah because
08:27
you'd definitely drink out of them like
08:28
like use them as mugs and stuff wouldn't
08:30
you well anna you must have a nightmare
08:32
with your 200
08:33
000 cool jet mugs every year my
08:35
cupboards are full
08:37
i've never been to one of anna's
08:39
drinking parties where we all drink
08:41
tequila out of a god
08:43
all the drinks taste of courgette this
08:45
is actually not very pleasant
08:47
we're here for a god time not for a long
08:49
time
08:50
that could be the tagline um on other
08:53
historical using of luffas
08:55
it was a real craze in the end of the
08:57
19th century so this is when people
08:58
really picked up on the loofah as being
09:00
handy
09:01
and it was because friction baths had
09:02
just become very popular
09:04
and so this was the idea that it began
09:07
with the
09:08
concept that um showering oh washing was
09:11
bad for you so about 200 years it was
09:13
quite common not to wash much because
09:15
people thought that
09:16
getting hot opened up your pores and let
09:18
in lots of little bad guys
09:20
and then they decided that scrubbing was
09:23
something
09:24
really rough and sandpapery
09:27
so women used to use mohair or flesh
09:29
brushes if you scrubbed and scoured your
09:31
skin that would get all the bad guys out
09:33
and then they discovered loofah which is
09:34
perfect for scraping out
09:36
all these tiny little creatures yeah
09:39
the bad guys um i guess we'd now call
09:41
them sort of pathogens or something
09:43
but there was this this craze for
09:45
friction bars and it was
09:47
uh invented by a guy called louis kuhn
09:50
and it was the friction sitz bath and
09:52
what you did was you sat in a bathtub
09:54
but the water was about 10 to 14 degrees
09:56
centigrade so
09:57
cold unpleasantly cold and you rub
10:00
your lower abdomen hips and genitals
10:03
very vigorously with a rough cloth or a
10:05
loofah
10:06
and the nerve stimulation was thought to
10:09
evacuate all the toxins
10:11
wow and then you go straight to bed i
10:13
wonder if that's part of the luffa day
10:15
out that uh james i started to go off
10:18
the loofah day out if that's part of it
10:21
the genital stimulation you have to pay
10:23
extra for that part
10:24
um some of the people are not people
10:27
actually the opposite of people
10:28
animals some animals that have friction
10:31
baths
10:32
are sperm whales and now sperm whales
10:35
people are animals
10:36
you're right it's not the opposite it's
10:38
harl is it animals are not people though
10:40
no
10:41
well some animals are people this is
10:43
contentious guys and for another day
10:46
um okay so anyway animals that have
10:49
friction baths
10:50
include sperm whales and what they do is
10:52
they get together
10:54
and they exfoliate by rubbing against
10:56
each other so normally sperm whales are
10:58
quite solitary or they'll be in small
10:59
pods of maybe 10 or 15
11:01
but every now and then about 70 of them
11:04
will come together
11:05
and they'll all start rubbing against
11:06
each other to get the bad guys off
11:09
because they have they have like bad
11:11
guys who attach themselves to the skin
11:13
like limpets and
11:14
you know stuff like that parasites and
11:16
theirs genuinely serves a natural
11:18
purpose doesn't it so it's like
11:19
temperature regulation if you're covered
11:21
in algae it's hard to regulate your
11:22
temperature
11:23
or you've got proper parasites whereas
11:24
for humans it's kind of bizarre
11:27
that we exfoliate or i i obviously don't
11:30
because i'm not a fool
11:31
um but it's bizarre that exfoliating has
11:35
become such an accepted thing
11:37
i mean what is it there's no scientific
11:39
evidence to say it's doing anything
11:40
useful
11:40
find it kind of gets rid of those gross
11:42
bumpy things on the back of our arms
11:44
which i'm kind of fond of
11:46
but that might also be personal to you
11:49
i think you need to see someone about
11:50
those huh oh no
11:53
but when i when i was reading about the
11:54
different kinds of gerds that they've
11:56
made apparently a warty guard is quite a
11:58
thing because it's like it's even more
11:59
distinctive so they like a warty girl
12:01
they wouldn't want to
12:02
i don't think hannah's saying that her
12:03
elbow looks like a warty god well
12:05
actually it sounds like it to me yeah
12:07
you've been spending too much time
12:09
rolling around in the courgette patch
12:10
[Laughter]
12:14
okay it's time for fact number two and
12:16
that is
12:17
anne my fact is that the man who
12:20
invented jumanji
12:21
did so because he hated monopoly wow
12:25
if only we could all kind of channel
12:26
that hatred for monopoly into some
12:28
creative stuff
12:30
i mean we've all been there right um
12:32
yeah he's awesome so his name is chris
12:34
van alsberg he is a children's author
12:36
and illustrator
12:37
and he's got really interesting ways of
12:39
how he gets ideas
12:40
um so as well as right he wrote jumanji
12:42
the original picture book and he also
12:44
wrote the polar express which also
12:46
turned into a big movie
12:47
and um he said that when he was younger
12:49
he used to find it frustrating that if
12:50
you were playing cludo
12:52
you couldn't actually interrogate
12:53
colonel mustard if you were playing
12:55
monopoly
12:56
you didn't get any money you weren't
12:57
actually rich at the end even if you
12:58
built lots of hotels and had all the
13:00
expensive properties
13:01
and then he also thought well what are
13:03
things that i see a lot like see
13:05
everyone's seen footage of a rhino
13:06
stampede but they haven't seen a rhino
13:08
stampede in a living room
13:09
and then he was like ah a jungle game
13:11
that comes to life that's what i'm gonna
13:13
make
13:14
okay yeah that was this huge thing but
13:16
which game was he playing when he
13:17
decided to do polar express
13:20
um i think that would be that train game
13:22
which i've forgotten the name of that
13:23
goes through europe oh ticket to ride
13:27
wow and was he annoyed that at the end
13:28
of ticket to ride you're not in but a
13:30
pest
13:32
like this guy has very high demands of
13:34
his board games i would say i think
13:35
everyone else accepts the fundamental
13:36
conceit that the end of monopoly
13:38
you don't get 30 grand and the hilton
13:42
so yeah it's interesting it's another
13:43
interesting leap isn't it that he went
13:45
from monopoly to rhinos he must have had
13:47
a jungle ponchant
13:48
running alongside his hatred of monopoly
13:51
yeah he does sound very cool
13:52
um no i love him and his approach to a
13:55
story so he shared a letter that a fan
13:57
wrote to him
13:58
and this is a girl called alexandra and
14:00
she said dear mr van
14:02
aalsberg i love the books you write i am
14:04
glad your books are so weird because i
14:06
am very weird
14:07
i think you are weird but great i wish
14:09
the volcano and flood would be in my
14:10
room
14:11
okay what a silly thing to wish for
14:15
a very very troubled home life that
14:17
we're not really going to have time to
14:18
get into
14:19
properly i think my favorite origin
14:21
story actually for a board game
14:22
is um there's the two men who invented
14:24
trivial pursuit in 1979
14:26
and it's an incredibly boring story uh
14:29
if you get to the bones of it it's like
14:30
the two businessmen who thought yeah
14:32
should we invent trivial pursuit
14:34
they so it came about i think one of
14:36
them said they were inspired
14:38
to invent it when they were playing
14:40
scrabble and some of the pieces were
14:42
missing
14:42
so they couldn't play it anymore now if
14:44
you think about it
14:45
if you have pieces missing in scrabble
14:48
it doesn't matter
14:50
if the piece that's missing is the bard
14:52
then that's a problem that's the crucial
14:54
yeah
14:54
it's the only absolutely crucial piece
14:56
no i think there are lots of different
14:58
ways in which
14:58
you lose pieces so for example if you
15:00
lose all the vowels
15:02
that is going to be a tricky game of
15:04
scrabble to get through and that would
15:05
actually be a great prank to play on
15:07
someone
15:07
[Laughter]
15:09
maybe it was the holder for the counters
15:11
and they couldn't find a way to display
15:12
them without the other person seeing
15:14
what they had
15:15
must have been the holder that's very
15:16
good we found three different ways in
15:18
which
15:19
this origin story stacks up
15:23
i like the origin of operation do you
15:25
know that game
15:26
it's like um it's a guy in a hospital
15:28
and you have to pick out bits of his
15:30
body with tweezers right
15:31
and if you hit the sides then it makes a
15:33
buzz now this
15:34
was invented by a student in the 1960s
15:38
he was a design student and it was for
15:39
his
15:40
exam but before that benjamin franklin
15:44
invented operation in the 1700s okay
15:48
he invented a game which was basically
15:50
the same it was called treason
15:51
and it had a picture of king george ii
15:54
and you had to get a crown out of him
15:57
and if you touch the sides then it would
15:59
make a buzzing noise so benjamin
16:01
franklin
16:01
invented operation isn't that amazing
16:03
that's incredible james
16:05
if real life operations were anything
16:07
like operation then surgeons would open
16:09
up their patients and go oh there
16:11
are no organs in here at all
16:14
who's taken the organs is that what
16:15
happens in operation do you just lose
16:16
the organs over time
16:18
pretty immediately okay i've never i've
16:20
never owned a set
16:21
oh no now's a good time to get one andy
16:24
yeah that's true
16:25
i've only got four board games one of
16:26
which i bought for an earlier episode of
16:28
fish which was the cattle semen trading
16:30
board game great up to elite cow
16:32
wow i've got the and then one of the
16:35
others is the qi ball game and one is
16:37
scrabble i don't have a very good cover
16:39
do you think they could turn the you
16:41
know how jumanji is like
16:43
kind of a board game but then also a
16:45
movie
16:46
do you think they could turn the cattle
16:48
semen trading board game into a movie
16:50
yes i absolutely do i think some bad
16:53
bad guys uh hold the world's cattle
16:56
human stock to ransom
16:58
and the rock will have to be involved
17:00
somehow because they did have monopoly
17:02
the movie didn't they or no they're
17:04
making
17:04
now they're making money i think they've
17:06
i think they've tried before but they're
17:08
making a new one
17:09
with kevin hart who was in the new
17:10
jumanji movies so i feel like he's going
17:12
to absolutely conquer board game movie
17:14
crossovers
17:16
well it's going to be very very long
17:18
that's the only thing we know about the
17:19
monopoly film
17:20
it'll be 16 hours long you know they're
17:22
about to ruin monopoly i think they
17:23
might have ruined it already
17:24
by inventing a new updated version
17:28
where it's cashless so they want to get
17:30
in tune with the modern
17:32
man or woman and so they've got a
17:34
cashless monopoly where basically
17:36
mr monopoly is the banker so no player
17:38
gets to be the banker anymore
17:40
mr monopoly is a top hat a big top hat
17:42
who sits in the middle of the board
17:44
and uses voice recognition technology to
17:46
know which player's talking to him and a
17:48
player will say
17:49
i want to buy park lane and then he'll
17:51
just deduct that amount from your amount
17:53
that's cheap so it takes away the joy of
17:55
cheating as the banker which is the only
17:56
reason anyone plays monopoly in the
17:58
first place
17:58
exactly the whole point is to cheat yeah
18:00
well anna i know which version you
18:02
should get because they've also made
18:03
monopoly the cheetos edition
18:05
where part of the game is to try and
18:06
steal from the bank lie about your dice
18:08
rolls and it comes with a set of
18:09
handcuffs
18:10
like a token of handcuffs great
18:13
embracing the cheating
18:14
but there's tons of um like noble team
18:16
enough police i had to look at a big
18:17
list of them and
18:18
just the ones beginning with a include
18:21
abba monopoly
18:22
alton towers monopoly alice in
18:24
wonderland alpaca monopoly that's an
18:26
unofficial one and aberdeen monopoly
18:30
there are so many and if you if you look
18:32
up monopoly and
18:33
if you're attempting to find facts about
18:34
it then half the news results are
18:38
different places you know kingston upon
18:40
thames is getting its own monopoly set
18:42
and i wonder
18:43
i do wonder what the advantage of this
18:45
is or whether they franchise it or
18:46
whether
18:47
because it seems like no one you know i
18:49
used to live quite nicking so i didn't
18:50
want a kingston monopoly set
18:52
well i think they're all pandering to
18:54
this one guy who has the world record
18:56
most number of monopoly sets
18:59
okay he's called neil scallon and he has
19:01
the guinness world record
19:03
and how many monopoly sets do you think
19:05
he owns completely
19:06
each one is completely different 312.
19:09
i'm gonna go i think there's over a
19:11
thousand novelty ones i'm gonna go a
19:12
thousand
19:13
a thousand and one and each other i'll
19:15
say 400. he has
19:16
as of the 25th of january 2019 so a
19:19
while ago
19:20
he has 2249
19:23
different monopoly sets and if you go
19:25
into the amazing website
19:27
worldofmonopoly.com you can see a list
19:29
of all the ones that he has
19:30
my god but like oh that's not a cheap
19:33
game that's a lot of money on when he
19:35
almost could have like real monopoly i
19:37
know i know
19:38
and also um anna you and i have a copy
19:41
of an extremely random monopoly set
19:43
don't we
19:44
we do the university of kent right yeah
19:46
and this guy also has
19:48
that no way yeah that's so good
19:51
christmas in this guy's household must
19:53
be hell i was so sure we would have one
19:55
that he didn't have but that is amazing
19:57
jesus christ i wonder what his like like
20:00
the most sought out after it the most
20:02
the rarest like special monopoly is
20:04
because i read about one they made for
20:05
wall street where it's like made of like
20:06
solid gold pieces which i think is a bit
20:08
overkill
20:08
but i wonder if there's like a i don't
20:10
know what's a
20:12
like from a tiny village somewhere who's
20:14
just got their own one and selling it in
20:15
the post office i wonder what's the
20:16
hardest to get
20:17
i went onto ebay and i looked for the
20:19
most expensive
20:20
monopoly set at the moment and it was a
20:23
bulgarian
20:24
monopoly uh i guess for some reason
20:27
there weren't many made or something
20:28
like that but yeah
20:29
it was quite a few it was about 700
20:32
pounds or something for a
20:33
whoa bulgarian monopoly and so you got
20:35
it on the q a credit card
20:37
exactly i just i don't want neil scallon
20:39
to have it
20:41
to stop him i wonder if um chris van
20:43
allensburg ever
20:44
like makes up with monopoly they could
20:46
make a jumanji monopoly that would be
20:47
quite fun
20:48
oh there must be one i don't think
20:51
i don't think the world needs more
20:53
editions of monopoly i have to say it's
20:55
so interesting how people
20:56
who play board games in any serious way
20:59
all
20:59
hate monopoly so much so the guardian
21:02
asked people for their least favorite
21:04
board games for a feature they were
21:05
writing
21:06
and one of the responses just said
21:08
monopoly is awful because of the
21:10
vice-like grip it has over how the
21:12
british public perceived board games
21:14
i'm going to a board game night at a
21:15
local comic shop this evening
21:17
nobody will be playing monopoly and if
21:18
it was suggested then i would assume
21:20
it was a sick joke of some kind
21:24
they had in 2016 hasbro now makes
21:27
monopoly
21:28
um announced they were operating a
21:29
special hotline on christmas day
21:31
where people who'd been traumatized by
21:33
their monopoly-based experiences could
21:35
cool
21:35
uh it actually ran from christmas eve to
21:37
boxing day and i just feel so
21:39
devastatingly sorry for whatever intern
21:41
was asked to perform
21:44
by hasbro they literally it wasn't a
21:46
recorded message they said
21:47
we'll have experts on hand with the
21:49
official rule books to instantly settle
21:51
any disputes and advise on how to
21:53
resolve common complaints
21:54
god okay so it's christmas day you're an
21:57
intern
21:58
you have to work and you're sat by the
22:00
phone
22:01
would you rather no one called you or
22:04
someone called you to talk to you about
22:05
monopoly
22:06
oh god it's sophie's choice isn't it i'd
22:09
rather go directly to jail to be honest
22:10
with you
22:13
i was reading some monopoly strategy um
22:15
and i'm sure
22:16
so there was basically an article in the
22:18
new york magazine with the headline you
22:19
don't hate monopoly you just suck at it
22:21
and said the reason we hate it is we
22:23
can't play it properly
22:24
but if everyone can play it properly
22:26
then we all suck at it again because
22:27
there are only so many
22:28
key skills and tricks and you can get
22:31
but the main things they say are if
22:32
you're after the oranges it's good to
22:33
stay in jail because there's more chance
22:35
of rolling a double in completing your
22:36
set
22:37
um when there are not so many properties
22:39
available it's good to sit in jail
22:40
because then you have to pay any rent
22:42
and they were very cross about the some
22:44
people play a version where you collect
22:46
the money
22:46
um from fines if you land on free
22:48
parking and they are very angry about
22:49
that because apparently it messes with
22:51
the game
22:51
and makes it more random oh it's the
22:53
only joy of monopoly is getting to pick
22:55
up that money
22:56
and i hate the people who won't let me
22:58
do it well you hate the people who use
23:00
the actual rules of monopoly
23:01
i hate them you need that hotline
23:06
um i read an article with the 2015 uk
23:10
championship winner natalie fitzsimmons
23:12
wow um and she gave her tips of how to
23:15
win monopoly
23:16
and this is i mean i think this is
23:18
terrible what she does
23:19
so she basically goes and buys all of
23:22
the property she can
23:23
and then mortgages the ball and so she
23:25
gets the money back
23:27
but she doesn't collect any um rent but
23:29
it doesn't matter because the rent's so
23:30
small
23:31
and then she collects one group and then
23:33
puts four houses on each of those groups
23:35
she doesn't put um
23:36
a hotel on there or anything like that
23:38
and then she tries to get into jail for
23:40
as long as possible
23:44
and apparently this is the best
23:46
technique to win the game
23:48
wow isn't that amazing amazing and
23:51
another another thing she says is
23:52
sometimes you can get
23:53
instead of mortgaging them all you um
23:56
get a few different groups
23:57
and then you always put four houses on
23:59
each so there's not enough houses left
24:01
for anyone else to build houses
24:05
well you just run out the pieces of the
24:06
game yeah there's not enough houses in
24:08
the box for everyone to put four houses
24:10
on each thing so if you put four on all
24:12
yours it stops anyone else from being
24:14
able to do it
24:14
that can't be in the rules it is
24:21
younger we used to just put like a
24:22
thimble instead of a house but
24:24
that we were doing it wrong oh my god
24:27
wow
24:28
that's amazing i suppose that's
24:29
realistic yeah you've run out of
24:31
building materials you can't replace
24:32
them with a thimble
24:33
that's true we've actually never
24:36
mentioned on this podcast although i
24:37
think we have on qi
24:38
the origin story of monopoly so
24:41
basically there's this guy charles
24:43
darrow and if you go on the monopoly
24:44
website actually
24:45
if you look at find the history which i
24:47
think they've buried
24:48
uh deeper than it used to be it still
24:51
says charles darrow who dreamed up
24:53
monopoly in the 1930s and this guy daryl
24:55
went around saying he just come up with
24:57
it
24:57
in one interview someone said you know
24:59
where did it come from and he had no
25:00
origin story he just said
25:02
it was like magic it just came to me so
25:05
in fact what happened and this was only
25:06
really uncovered in the 1970s
25:09
was that there was a woman about 30
25:12
years earlier in 1903 called elizabeth
25:14
mcgee
25:15
and she sounded so awesome she was very
25:17
unusual a proper self-made woman
25:19
who was independently made living she
25:22
was a secretary she wrote poetry and
25:23
short stories
25:24
she did stand-up she comedy came second
25:28
in a beauty contest
25:33
um and you wouldn't have thought that
25:34
someone so fun would invent monopoly but
25:36
she did she called it the landlord's
25:37
game
25:38
and the whole point of it at the time
25:41
was that it
25:42
exposed the folly of capitalism so there
25:44
were two sets of rules
25:46
there was the anti-monopolist rule where
25:47
everyone is rewarded for the wealth that
25:49
they create
25:50
and then there was the monopoly rule
25:52
where you build up monopolies and crush
25:53
your opponents and she didn't quite mean
25:54
for humanity to fully embrace the second
25:57
one
25:57
and decide that was the one we wanted to
25:58
play um but she played it and she
26:01
showed it to her friends and it caught
26:02
on and eventually
26:04
you know quite a few people played it in
26:05
a certain part of the state and it
26:07
reached charles darrow through a friend
26:09
and he sort of like slightly tweaked it
26:12
and
26:12
published it claimed the patent sorted
26:15
he's a hero
26:16
wow that's terrible he needs to go
26:19
straight to jail
26:21
uh we're gonna have to move on in second
26:23
uh i just have one thing i went off on a
26:25
bit of a tangent here
26:26
because uh it was about jumanji and i
26:28
was and this what this guy didn't like
26:29
about monopoly was the fact you couldn't
26:30
go
26:31
into the game you know and experience it
26:33
so i was looking up other kind of going
26:35
into immersive reality experiences
26:38
and i just came across this short story
26:40
that i read
26:41
and it's called pygmalion spectacles
26:44
from 1935
26:46
and i think it's the earliest reference
26:48
to virtual reality
26:49
uh sort of 3d amazing experience glasses
26:52
so it's by this guy called stanley
26:54
weinbaum and it starts out with a man
26:57
who's a bit drunk at a party and
26:58
stumbles out onto the street
27:00
meets a professor who says wouldn't you
27:02
love to see a film that was really
27:04
realistic
27:05
gotta bear in mind this is the 1930s so
27:07
the guy was like yeah but that could
27:08
never exist
27:10
and he said what if i give you these
27:11
glasses and this chat puts on the
27:14
glasses
27:14
and suddenly he can see hear feel
27:17
taste and smell um everything and he has
27:20
this incredible adventure
27:22
and it's really really exciting and then
27:24
he takes the glasses off and he's like
27:25
that was magic
27:26
and then the professor says it's not
27:27
actually i just dip these glasses in a
27:29
chemical electrical solution which did
27:31
all the audio input and the woman you
27:33
fell in love with is actually my niece
27:34
she's an actress like in one of these
27:36
immersive reality
27:38
theater things okay but what i wanted to
27:40
tell you was
27:42
um he said so the guy was like how did
27:44
you make all the trees seem so real you
27:46
know it was like jumanji he was in a
27:47
forest
27:48
and he said ah the trees they are simply
27:51
now what do you think they were uh
27:54
toilet brushes
27:55
incorrect andy you might know moss it
28:00
was
28:04
enlarged by a lens now i don't know if
28:06
we have mentioned openly on the podcast
28:08
before but andy's been insisting for
28:10
years
28:10
that club moss looks exactly like trees
28:13
and now
28:14
this is vindication vindication
28:18
vindication
28:22
okay it's time for fact number three and
28:24
that
28:25
is james okay my fact this week is that
28:28
there is a man
28:29
in brazil who nobody is allowed to go
28:31
within five miles off
28:34
and is this that he hasn't showered for
28:36
a long time
28:38
it's not a social isolation well it is a
28:40
social isolation thing but not a
28:42
um and actually it is on government
28:45
advice as well
28:46
so it's kind of similar to what's
28:47
happening but he is the last survivor
28:50
of an uncontacted tribe he lives in the
28:52
amazon rainforest
28:54
and basically what happened in brazil
28:56
for a long time
28:58
is these people who are living in the
29:00
rainforests
29:01
they would try and contact them and try
29:03
and assimilate them
29:04
into modern life and obviously um or
29:07
maybe not obviously but i think we now
29:09
know that that is not a particularly
29:11
good idea because basically you're
29:12
bringing pathogens over there you
29:14
you're kind of destroying the ways of
29:16
life they lose their languages they lose
29:18
their culture stuff like that
29:19
and so the current idea is a thing
29:22
called policy of no contact
29:24
where you just let people live their
29:26
lives you don't have to
29:28
get in touch with them you don't have to
29:29
give them stuff if they want to come to
29:31
you they will come to you if they need
29:32
stuff they'll come to you and get it
29:34
but you need to leave them on their own
29:36
and so there is this one guy who's
29:38
living
29:39
on his own it seems he's the last member
29:40
of the tribe and
29:42
in 2007 brazil declared a 31 square mile
29:46
area around him to be completely off
29:48
limits for anyone else so no one else is
29:49
allowed to go there
29:50
and it was later expanded by 11.5 square
29:53
miles so
29:54
about 3 000 hectares and now you are
29:57
definitely not allowed to go
29:58
anywhere in that area because you'll be
30:00
disturbing his way of life
30:02
wow yeah so cool does the government
30:05
have to keep proving that he
30:07
exists that's a good point actually um i
30:10
think the last time they saw him was a
30:11
few years ago
30:12
but i think they do have ethnologists
30:14
who go there every now and then just
30:15
checking up to see
30:16
um to see what's happening because he
30:18
builds lots of different huts from place
30:21
to place and goes from one place to
30:22
another
30:24
he makes traps for animals which he then
30:26
eats
30:27
and he also makes markings on trees
30:29
which they think
30:30
may be some kind of spiritual thing so
30:32
he's constantly
30:33
using his environment for various things
30:35
and so you can see when he's moving
30:37
around and what he's doing
30:38
doesn't he also um dig quite deep holes
30:41
and people are because obviously nobody
30:42
can ask him they're not quite sure
30:43
whether that's for him as shelter
30:44
whether it's a trap for animals whether
30:46
it's something spiritual
30:47
um it's quite mysterious yeah that's so
30:50
weird
30:50
is that why they call him the man of the
30:52
hole uh yeah we haven't said that he's
30:54
called the man of the hole actually but
30:55
that's
30:56
that is one of the things they call him
30:57
yeah james if this guy
30:59
moves does the zona exclusion move with
31:02
him
31:02
so could he move to the center of rio de
31:05
janeiro and everyone would have to
31:07
go you're absolutely right this is one
31:10
fundamental
31:10
flaw with the way that i've worded my
31:12
fact no one
31:14
is allowed to go within five miles of
31:15
him if he stands in the middle of his
31:17
range
31:18
oh do you know what i mean so if he goes
31:21
right to the edge of the area which has
31:23
been given to him then actually you
31:25
could stand right next to him
31:26
you could stand within two meters of him
31:28
if he happened to be standing at the
31:30
edge of that area
31:31
okay otherwise it would be tragic if he
31:33
ever tried to make contact
31:34
people just sprinting away from him and
31:36
screaming yeah but i guess that's nice
31:38
because then if he wants to greet people
31:40
or meet someone he can go to the end and
31:41
there are people there exactly that yeah
31:44
because i was i was reading about the um
31:46
centellis islanders and they are
31:48
basically
31:49
hardly anyone has had contact with them
31:50
there was a group of anthropologists who
31:52
made two trips to try and make contact
31:54
and the one way they managed to do it
31:55
was they went in their boat and they
31:57
floated coconuts over to the island and
31:59
the islanders don't have coconuts so
32:00
they took them and that was sort of like
32:02
beginning of a barter system um but then
32:04
when they went back they were not quite
32:06
so keen the next time so it's sort of
32:07
trying to
32:08
make contact if people want to make it
32:10
but not to impose yourself
32:12
yeah especially you don't want to with
32:14
the sentinelese because they're famously
32:16
um they're not i wouldn't say unfriendly
32:19
i'd say
32:19
quite murderous oh strangers i read one
32:22
thing about those guys that
32:24
if you go onto their island and they
32:26
don't want you to be there the first
32:28
thing they'll do is turn their back on
32:30
you
32:30
and go down on their haunches and
32:32
pretend to defecate
32:33
and that is kind of their putting two
32:35
fingers up saying off get off our
32:37
island kind of thing
32:38
and then if you don't pay hee to that
32:40
then they'll start firing arrows at you
32:42
and
32:43
and try and kill them that's really
32:44
interesting but can you imagine the
32:46
slight shame of the anthropologists who
32:47
went all the way there being like we're
32:49
going to do it we found a way to make
32:50
contact
32:51
and then they say and what happened they
32:52
buried their bombs and pretended to
32:54
defecate
32:54
you can't really use us you can't give a
32:56
big lecture tour based on mooning i
32:58
don't think
32:59
do you know if you um google map north
33:02
sentinel island which is where they live
33:04
uh it's you can zoom right in and you
33:07
will see there's actually a bar there
33:09
so that does yeah uh it's a curry house
33:12
and bar
33:13
it's got a series of five star reviews
33:17
and uh at the moment there is a sign
33:19
underneath it that says ours may be
33:20
affected by covert 19 which is
33:22
understandable
33:23
um but so the reviews include a good
33:25
getaway especially given current events
33:27
dinner good but interrupted by arrows
33:29
and death threats from waiters
33:32
so what is it is that a joker it's a
33:34
google joker's actually
33:36
someone sent it to me a guy called harry
33:37
johnston wrote in a fan of the podcast
33:39
saying have you seen this about a year
33:40
ago
33:41
and it's just stayed up there that's all
33:43
the curry house and bar yeah
33:45
so give it a visit don't um i
33:48
also went on google maps for this area
33:50
where this guy is living the brazilian
33:52
guy and it's an area called valle du
33:55
havari a lot of people call it like one
33:58
of the last unexplored areas of the
33:59
world
34:00
but actually of course lots of people
34:02
live there because you have lots of
34:03
amazonian tribes who live there
34:05
but if you go on google maps and you
34:06
search for it it's basically just a gray
34:09
square
34:10
and then you can zoom out and zoom out
34:12
and zoom out and zoom out and it's still
34:14
just a grey square with like a river
34:16
going through it and there's literally
34:17
nothing
34:18
and you can zoom out to about the size
34:19
of of like england and wales
34:21
and you can still not see any towns or
34:23
anything it's just a grey square it's
34:25
absolutely amazing
34:26
but in this area there is a mountain
34:29
called pico de neblina and this is the
34:33
highest mountain
34:34
in brazil and no one knew it existed
34:36
until the 1950s
34:38
wow that is how isolated this is the
34:41
tallest mountain in the whole country is
34:44
there
34:44
and no one knew it was there isn't that
34:46
amazing
34:48
and in theory what happened is someone
34:49
was flying over it in an airplane and
34:51
thought oh there's a big mountain there
34:52
where it's not supposed to be
34:54
and they went maybe someone could check
34:56
this out and then they measured it and
34:57
it was way taller than anywhere else
34:59
wow that's awesome um i was having a
35:02
look at other
35:02
um remote places places that are hard to
35:04
get to and
35:05
you know there's a section of america
35:07
where they still receive their post by
35:09
mule
35:09
it's part of the official us postal
35:11
service um there is an indian
35:13
reservation at the bottom of the grand
35:15
canyon
35:16
and so it's hard to get helicopters down
35:18
there and if it's windy they can't fly
35:19
at all but the mules go
35:21
whatever the weather every day so they
35:23
go by car
35:24
by road to the edge of the grand canyon
35:26
and then it is a three hour trip down by
35:27
mule
35:28
uh down to the bottom it's a posty
35:30
called charlie chamberlain it's his job
35:32
and he they basically anything you could
35:34
put a stamp on they will take they take
35:35
food they take supplies they take post
35:37
um and they've got a joke if you want
35:38
the express service they just let one of
35:40
the mules
35:41
go free and run to the bottom i would
35:43
have thought
35:44
the express service would be throwing a
35:46
mule off the edge of the grand canyon
35:49
it's a highly trained special mules andy
35:52
that's air mail
35:55
i was looking up the other loneliest
35:57
people in the world
35:58
uh people like this so um
36:01
there's one person who missed neil
36:04
armstrong saying
36:05
this is one small step for man one giant
36:07
leap of mankind
36:08
guess who it was uh michael collins
36:12
it was michael collins michael collins
36:14
was on the other side of the moon
36:15
and could not get that line so
36:19
so many other people in the world would
36:20
have had access to that and people keep
36:22
asking michael collins who's still alive
36:24
um about his isolation because
36:27
for 76 hours when armstrong and
36:30
aldrin were on the moon collins was
36:32
orbiting
36:33
and for 48 minutes every two hours he
36:36
was on the far side of the moon so he
36:37
was completely out of contact with
36:38
everybody
36:39
and you know there was there was only
36:40
one person on that side of the moon
36:42
out of three billion people on the other
36:45
side of the moon
36:46
um and he keeps being uh but he's so
36:50
he's now enraged anytime anyone asks him
36:52
so
36:53
he says um he keeps being asked mr
36:56
collins weren't you the loneliest man in
36:58
the whole lonely history of this lonely
36:59
planet by your lonely self behind the
37:01
lonely moon in this lonely orbit
37:03
weren't you terribly lonely and he says
37:06
he was really happy
37:07
he had nobody mission control weren't
37:09
yakking away in his ear
37:10
he was absolutely delighted out there
37:12
yeah sounds like that journalist could
37:14
have done with a thesaurus
37:18
yeah i think the person who's got the
37:20
guinness world record for the most
37:21
isolated person is uh the
37:23
other guy i can't remember this is just
37:25
from memory but it's the other person
37:27
alan warden yeah he also went around the
37:29
back of the moon didn't i really
37:30
why does he get the record i think he
37:32
was there for longer okay while they
37:34
were exploring
37:35
cool i think it was three days it's kind
37:37
of a it's kind of a
37:38
kind of a burn on him and his social
37:39
life to give him a guinness world record
37:41
for
37:42
loneliest dude ever do you not think
37:43
it's quite a good line in a bar
37:45
let's go hi i'm i'm the world's
37:47
loneliest man
37:49
why is that a pickup line do you think
37:51
it's a bit needy
37:52
i think it is what i think it is it's a
37:54
bit intense as an icebreaker
37:59
i was reading about life in the amazon
38:02
did you know
38:02
that there are no bridges across the
38:05
amazon river
38:06
the whole river it's the longest either
38:09
the longest or the second longest river
38:11
in the world depending on how you
38:12
uh measure it and there's no bridges
38:14
across a whole thing and do you know why
38:16
that is
38:17
it's because it's massive what is that
38:20
oh you mean there's a massive
38:21
because it's wide because it's wide yeah
38:24
yeah it's not always wide it's wide at
38:25
its mouth
38:26
but it's narrower at its source isn't it
38:29
yeah obviously it's narrow in the source
38:30
i know that i'm just saying
38:33
you know it's most of it seems pretty
38:35
big to me
38:36
well i guess you're kind of half right
38:38
hang on we're surely we can work this
38:40
out
38:41
um is it is it because um the
38:44
bits where it's narrow enough to put a
38:46
bridge across it's protected or sacred
38:49
territory no not really it's more that
38:51
in the bits where it's narrow enough to
38:53
put a bridge across no one lives there
38:55
so it's basically you know at the mouth
38:58
of the river there are a few cities
39:00
and really it's too wide there to to put
39:03
bridges across
39:04
really it's kind of super wide but in
39:07
where it gets a bit narrower no one
39:09
lives there and there's a few kind of um
39:11
boat crossings and stuff like that but
39:13
really there's no roads
39:14
so why would you need a bridge jesus i
39:17
can't believe there's not an
39:18
in-between zone yeah you'd think so
39:20
wouldn't you that's an amazing fact yeah
39:23
yeah do you know that there's a bridge
39:24
over the
39:27
this is another boris atlantic fantasy
39:29
yeah there is over the whole atlantic
39:31
no go on so i was on holiday uh on the
39:34
west coast of scotland a wee while ago
39:35
and that was one of the local
39:36
attractions so it's a
39:38
it's a stream that comes off the
39:39
atlantic so they claim it as the bridge
39:41
over the atlantic because it's the same
39:43
and i thought that was amazing it's in
39:44
my head it's from cornwall to new york
39:46
what do what do you mean as a stream
39:49
it's a bit of water that comes off there
39:50
i can't remember the details i didn't
39:52
actually get to visit it so sadly i did
39:53
not get the information guys they claim
39:55
it as the bridge of
39:56
the atlantic what do you do do you go
39:57
and look at it or do you
39:59
yeah and you can walk across it right
40:01
yeah well if i'd gone i could answer all
40:02
these questions so you know
40:04
basically i think anne's parents took
40:06
her on holiday and told her they'd been
40:08
to america when in fact they'd been
40:10
a small stream on the west coast of
40:11
scotland but she walked across the
40:13
bridge
40:14
no we know we did it we didn't get to go
40:16
anna this is my dream
40:18
you didn't even get to go we went near
40:19
the bridge over the atlantic
40:22
amazing one more thing about living in
40:24
the amazon
40:26
uh one issue is they have piranhas
40:29
but what do you think would happen if
40:31
you actually tried to swim with piranhas
40:33
i know go on anna you've got your hand
40:35
up
40:36
if you fall in a river that's full of
40:37
piranha they'll strip off your skin like
40:39
your skin a banana there's no time for
40:40
screaming there's no time for groans in
40:42
45 seconds you're nothing but bones
40:44
that was an amazing bit of improv thank
40:46
you very much what's that from
40:47
i just happen to know the answer to your
40:49
question what is it from that
40:51
it is a random poem from my childhood
40:54
and i'm sure it's scientifically
40:55
accurate
40:56
what really happens i'm really sorry for
40:58
whoever wrote that poem but that's not
41:00
true
41:01
oh god um piranhas they're kind of
41:03
scared of big animals they don't really
41:05
want to go near you if you
41:06
fall in the water and you don't bother
41:08
them they'll just hide away and they
41:10
don't want to go anywhere near you
41:11
now if they're in the dry season where
41:14
they're not getting any food
41:15
or if they're in the breeding season
41:17
then you might have a bit more problem
41:18
but really they're more like vultures
41:20
they're more like scavengers so if a bit
41:22
of dead meat goes in there they'll go
41:23
after it
41:24
but if a human goes in there they'll
41:26
think it might be something trying to
41:27
attack them and they'll just hide away
41:28
oh really so most of the time you'll be
41:31
completely safe if you fall in a piranha
41:32
pool
41:33
and another kind of type of piranha that
41:36
definitely won't kill you is the
41:37
vegetarian piranha
41:40
which is a thing that exists there is a
41:43
species of piranha that is a vegetarian
41:45
and they just eat seeds and fruits and
41:47
stuff that falls into the water
41:49
i love them but those those guys are
41:52
they seem innocuous but they can strip a
41:54
courgette
41:54
right down in 45 seconds
41:57
you're nothing but pulp
42:02
there is a hermit in scotland just while
42:04
we're on the subject of
42:05
lonely people okay um and he's obviously
42:08
he's
42:08
playing amateur league hermiting if he's
42:10
in scotland he's supposed to in the
42:11
middle of
42:12
completely nowhere but he uh he's quite
42:15
elderly he's called ken
42:16
smith and he was injured this year
42:19
by a log pile falling on him but he was
42:22
rescued
42:23
via texas so he
42:26
he has an emergency beacon on him and he
42:29
can press a button
42:30
and it flags up with an american
42:32
satellite and it goes to
42:34
a command post in texas saying the
42:37
hermit in scotland
42:38
has had a mishap
42:42
they contact the coast guard in scotland
42:44
and they say one of your hermits is
42:45
injured and then they have to send out a
42:47
team to go and check them but they just
42:48
go over that bridge of the atlantic
42:50
don't they to go
42:54
that's why they built it yeah
42:58
but the amazing thing is that is the
42:59
second time it's happened in two years
43:02
and he's been rescued from the gods it's
43:03
amazing what
43:05
what what does he keep doing is he very
43:06
clumsy he's got a wood pile and
43:09
i guess it's improperly stacked because
43:10
it keeps falling on him
43:13
hey he's doing that all by himself
43:15
there's no one to help him build it
43:16
safely i guess
43:17
no true it's like a real you know how
43:19
jumanji is a real-life board game
43:21
this is like the real-life gender that
43:23
he's living
43:27
[Applause]
43:28
okay it's time for the final fact of the
43:30
show and that is my fact
43:32
my fact is that in 19th century osaka
43:35
flat residents owned the rights to their
43:38
own urine
43:39
but the rights of their poo belong to
43:41
their landlord
43:43
amazing so okay yeah and
43:46
tenancy agreements must have looked
43:48
absolutely bizarre
43:49
yeah much messier so this was
43:53
a great article on aon.com which i will
43:56
try and put up on my twitter and it's
43:57
all about the
43:58
relationships between humans and human
44:01
excretions basically and how it's been
44:03
used throughout history and the
44:05
the kind of commercial arrangements that
44:07
we've made over it
44:08
and in 18th and 19th century japan
44:11
and particularly in the city of osaka
44:15
there were complicated arrangements
44:16
because feces were used for fertilizer
44:19
and if you lived in a an apartment
44:21
building
44:22
the rights to your feces belong to the
44:24
building's owner who would
44:25
um have arrangements in place to sell
44:29
that
44:29
uh and it would be loaded onto ships and
44:32
taken away but you
44:33
owned your own we that was something you
44:35
had
44:36
so feces were valuable because they
44:39
would help to grow crops so
44:40
um it would affect your rent um if there
44:44
were lots of people living in your flat
44:46
then you would produce lots of poo for
44:48
your landlord to sell
44:50
and your rent would be slightly lower as
44:51
a result whereas if you're a single
44:53
occupancy you'd pay slightly more
44:55
not just because you got your own flat
44:56
but also because you weren't producing
44:57
enough of the uh
44:58
the brown gold and could you say to your
45:01
landlord if you're a negotiator you know
45:03
i eat a lot of curry
45:04
i actually have quite extravagant bowel
45:06
movements honestly you'll be getting
45:08
triple the average from me
45:10
i think that was something she could
45:11
negotiate i don't think so
45:14
so i was talking to a friend of mine in
45:16
tokyo called john perry he
45:18
is a writer of quiz books
45:21
and pretty much my go-to expert on
45:24
japanese history and he said that what
45:28
you say is true but it's very slightly
45:29
different in the it's not the landlords
45:32
who had the rights to your poo
45:33
it was like the managing agents because
45:35
the landlords they would live
45:37
miles and miles and miles away and would
45:38
have nothing to do with this they would
45:39
own your
45:40
house but they would really not be
45:42
involved in your day-to-day life
45:43
and what would happen is you'd have
45:45
these people um who were called
45:48
and they would be slightly higher than
45:50
the tenants in importance but not much
45:53
higher
45:53
um but they had a full-time job where it
45:55
was like looking after the house
45:56
collecting the rent doing the repairs
45:58
settling disputes stuff like that
46:00
and they would be able to read and write
46:01
whereas the tenants might not be able to
46:03
read or write
46:04
and they would take the poo and they
46:06
would sell it and they would get the
46:08
money but
46:09
the money was kind of expected to be
46:11
used it would
46:12
pay their wages but it was also used for
46:14
all the tenants as well so
46:16
they would buy um rice cakes for new
46:18
year out of the money from the poo
46:20
and so it would go it would all go back
46:22
into the community all the poo money
46:24
nice oh isn't that cool that's very cool
46:26
and they're called oh yeah
46:28
which sounds like the noise they would
46:29
make as they're collecting your poo
46:31
you'd walk into someone's bathroom and
46:32
go
46:33
oh yeah that is that's a bad one it
46:36
sounds like the noise you make while
46:37
you're
46:38
making the poo doesn't it
46:41
and you were saying about um like if
46:43
you've had a curry you would
46:44
tell people or something hannah yes
46:48
well sort of what i'm saying yeah it's
46:49
sort of what you were saying but the um
46:51
the value of your night soil which is
46:54
what they called it depended on
46:56
how rich you were so if you were rich
46:58
you had a really good diet and it meant
47:00
that your poo was better as a fertilizer
47:02
so you'd be able to sell it for more
47:04
so it's kind of a monopoly thing whereas
47:06
the rich get richer do you know what i
47:07
mean
47:08
yeah yeah but in a way in a kind of poo
47:10
sense
47:11
because their their poo is literally
47:12
richer
47:14
but this is not james a version of
47:16
monopoly i would like to play
47:19
i don't think i need to play 19th
47:21
century feudal japan monopoly
47:23
look there are 2 500 different types of
47:25
monopoly
47:26
i haven't looked through the whole list
47:27
for all i know there is a poo monopoly
47:31
it would be called monopoly i'm sorry i
47:34
just needed to say that
47:35
it's good that you got it out yep thank
47:37
you
47:41
in 1724 in oscar there was a
47:45
fight that broke out over the collection
47:47
rights to poo
47:49
so there were two groups from the
47:51
villages of yamazaki and takasuki
47:54
and they um had the right to
47:57
buy the poo from the um the managing
48:01
agents
48:01
and then they would give them to the
48:03
farmers but they kind of fought against
48:05
each other and it turned into a massive
48:07
riot in the
48:08
city really a lot of kind of
48:10
slinging
48:11
yes there was a lot of that going on and
48:13
it was got so valuable people would
48:15
steal it so
48:16
people would just um in the dead of
48:17
night come into your
48:19
apartment and steal all your poo i mean
48:22
it's sort of it depends on the scale of
48:24
the crime doesn't it
48:25
whether it's worth it for you because if
48:27
you just go into
48:29
i just wonder about someone walking into
48:31
their living room in the morning after a
48:32
night's sleep and looking at
48:34
the turd cabinet and thinking oh my god
48:37
we've been robbed
48:41
was it stealing large consignments i
48:43
wonder that probably makes more sense
48:44
than individual
48:45
burglaries yeah i don't think they would
48:47
just take a single stool from each
48:49
household there used to be quite harsh
48:52
penalties in japan for it didn't they
48:53
because you know it was lucrative and
48:57
we should say this continued for
48:58
hundreds of years and still
49:00
up until the 1980s people would go
49:03
around to
49:03
people's houses in japan and in lots of
49:06
the east actually so in china was a huge
49:07
thing as well
49:08
but in japan in the 1980s there were
49:10
vacuum trucks that would drive around to
49:12
your house
49:12
and you plug them into your sewage tank
49:15
i guess and they suck the poo out
49:17
and then it's gone and it's sold but
49:20
yeah china as well
49:21
uh was uh used feces human feces to
49:24
enrich their soil for many hundreds of
49:26
years
49:26
and it was crucial so a lot of people
49:28
think that it was
49:30
part of the reason that chinese
49:31
agriculture did really well in a time
49:33
when
49:33
a lot of western countries didn't and
49:35
there was a soil scientist i think this
49:36
is in your article andy that you sent
49:38
us a soil scientist in 1911 called fh
49:41
king
49:42
who estimated that over 180 million tons
49:45
of human manure
49:46
was collected annually in the far east
49:48
to enrich the soil
49:49
and now that equates to 1.2 kilos of poo
49:53
per person per day which is quite a lot
49:56
so we do wonder if he overestimated
49:57
slightly
49:58
[Laughter]
50:00
even if you're efficiently collecting it
50:01
from every single person
50:03
that's you know
50:06
you know earlier i mentioned the the
50:08
bricks that you could make out of luffas
50:11
there's another way of making bricks uh
50:13
out of human urine so this is another
50:15
as they call it biobrick that you can
50:18
produce um
50:19
and it's urine and living bacteria so
50:22
you get urine you get sand you get
50:24
bacteria you put it all in a brick
50:26
shaped mold and there is a chemical
50:27
reaction which ensues and that gradually
50:29
solidifies the brick kind of like baking
50:31
a cake
50:32
kind of like baking kind of it kind of i
50:35
don't fancy your chances of the great
50:36
bake off next year only
50:38
for my showstopper i've made a piss
50:40
brick
50:43
um but the really good thing about this
50:46
is that astronauts might one day be able
50:49
to piss their own moon bases
50:51
that's how that's basically what you can
50:53
do you go
50:55
you take a load of the molds up there
50:56
and you slowly you know
50:58
we your own home into existence so that
51:01
means
51:01
as the food on the space station is
51:03
depleted the space station has been
51:04
built around you presumably yes exactly
51:06
yeah but you only get food or shelter
51:09
right
51:09
that's true you're not very far up
51:12
maslow's pyramid of needs
51:15
nice um they do call it cake actually in
51:19
like the bio solids that are used in all
51:21
of our farming lest we forget um
51:23
so sewage is picked up and it's treated
51:25
and then it's often used as fertilizer
51:27
but when they talk about the digestates
51:30
of basically poo
51:31
and other types of matter like that they
51:34
do refer to it as cake and it comes in
51:36
these cake shaped and cake textured
51:38
particles that um you know you order if
51:41
you're a farmer
51:41
so for the great british bake off you
51:43
could say i'm going to be making a cake
51:44
today
51:45
yeah you could get away with it i think
51:47
you would be voted out
51:48
but you could call it a urinal cake and
51:51
that has a
51:52
that's like a triple meaning of the word
51:54
cake they're always making cakes aren't
51:55
they in the shape of weird things
51:57
yeah so you could make it could be in
52:00
the shape of the urinal cake but it
52:02
could be made of biosolids so it's
52:03
almost it's like a trick you think
52:05
you're getting
52:06
one disgusting thing but you get one
52:07
even more disgusting thing
52:09
how's that halfway through the first
52:11
bite you think no don't worry guys i
52:13
know this
52:14
looks like a rival cake it's actually a
52:16
normal cake
52:17
made of my piss
52:21
bon appetit
52:23

hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from our four respective
00:21
homes in the uk while we're all on
00:23
lockdown
00:24
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:26
sitting here with andrew hunter murray
00:28
anna tajinski and james harkin and once
00:30
again we have gathered around the
00:31
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:33
from the last seven days
00:35
and in no particular order here we go
00:38
starting with you anna my fact this week
00:41
is that pt barnum
00:43
once tried to buy william shakespeare's
00:45
birthplace
00:46
and transport it to america would that
00:49
technically have made shakespeare
00:50
american
00:51
if his house where he was born was moved
00:53
to america yeah i think that's how
00:57
would citizenship been ideal for him he
00:58
could have worked in america that's the
01:00
dream
01:01
so pt barnum the very famous 19th
01:03
century
01:04
showman entertainer circus man and
01:07
businessman
01:08
and great pr man above all
01:11
who very famous guy i think there was a
01:13
film about him recently was it the
01:14
greatest show was that about him
01:16
the greatest man
01:19
it's all in the title uh so yeah this is
01:22
in 1844
01:23
we know it actually happened because as
01:24
well as barnum reporting on it
01:26
he reported on every detail of his own
01:28
life pretty much and lots of details
01:29
that maybe weren't in his own life
01:31
uh but as well as barnum writing about
01:33
it his signature is in the visitors book
01:35
in the house so it was in 1844 and he
01:38
signed the visitors book and he said he
01:40
signed it along with tom thumb who was
01:42
one of his
01:43
acts he signed it saying this is pt
01:45
barnum with
01:46
or or carer of tom thumb but i couldn't
01:48
tell if tom thumb was actually there or
01:50
if that's just how he signed stuff
01:51
he was just like bonnie carer of tom
01:53
thumb and
01:55
yeah he he visited and he thought it was
01:57
pretty great
01:58
and as he wrote later i obtained through
02:01
a friend
02:01
the refusal of the house i.e like a
02:03
friend said he had dibs on the house
02:06
and i plan to take it in lots of boxes
02:08
to new york but the project leaked out
02:10
and british pride was touched so several
02:12
english gentlemen
02:13
interfered and purchased the premises
02:15
for the shakespeare association instead
02:18
so sadly his plan was thwarted but
02:21
actually
02:21
these english gentlemen who interfered
02:24
um they had been planning to interfere
02:26
for quite a long time
02:27
they had gotten together a group that
02:29
was always going to buy this
02:30
house and they put the wheels in motion
02:33
in 1835
02:35
but they've just been really
02:36
procrastinating and not really doing
02:38
anything
02:38
and it was only when barnum came along
02:40
and actually a few other americans who
02:41
thought they were going to buy this that
02:42
they went
02:43
oh [ __ ] we better get our asses in gear
02:45
and we better buy this house
02:47
one of the people who was involved was
02:49
dickens yeah
02:50
wow and in the end they started putting
02:52
on all these kind of
02:54
shows to get money together and um
02:56
dickens was part of those shows and put
02:58
on like
02:59
shakespeare plays to try and fundraise
03:02
yeah he did he played justice shallow in
03:03
the merry wives of windsor i think
03:05
and then they also made this what
03:07
appears to be a kind of
03:09
mashup called this house to be sold
03:12
great name
03:13
uh it was a new play but it featured
03:16
lots of kind of shakespeare characters
03:17
along the way
03:18
it sounds simple it hasn't yeah written
03:20
partially by dickens
03:22
no written by ben elton yes
03:27
so barnum was um was insane
03:30
uh the things he did we've mentioned him
03:33
a couple of times before we mentioned
03:34
um one of his first claims to fame was
03:37
this lady joyce heth
03:39
who was a very elderly african-american
03:42
woman
03:42
who he claimed was 161 years old and
03:46
have been george washington's nurse mate
03:48
he also said that at one point she when
03:51
that sort of that ruse was being sort of
03:53
uncovered uh and exposed he then said
03:56
that she was
03:57
an automaton uh and that she would say
04:00
yeah yeah he sold her as an automaton
04:03
and said that she was being
04:04
um manipulated by ventriloquist for the
04:06
uh sound
04:07
and uh if you look close you can see the
04:09
cogs and so on
04:11
anyway joyce has died and doctors
04:13
examined her and said yep this is an
04:15
elderly woman but
04:16
not 161 year old woman and barnum
04:19
wrote in his autobiography about it he
04:20
said the doctors disagreed and this dark
04:23
subject will probably always continue to
04:25
be shrouded in mystery there's an
04:28
interesting bit in this book
04:29
about joy's head so we should say one of
04:31
the reasons we're talking about this is
04:32
there's this new book out which
04:34
is quite a big deal barnum and american
04:36
life it's the latest barnum
04:38
biography um but he says that one thing
04:40
that petey barnum did quite well was
04:42
sort of play with his audience half
04:44
acknowledging that a lot of his things
04:46
were a ruse
04:47
so for instance with joyce heath he'd
04:49
claim you know she's 161 and then he'd
04:51
be like or is she guys
04:52
is this a big old trick why don't you
04:54
come and see and judge for yourself
04:56
there's this strange tightrope he walked
04:58
uh i was looking at some of the less
05:00
exploitative acts in his um circus
05:03
so when you went as well as these people
05:05
um you could see glassblowers
05:07
they had there cool um they had a guy
05:10
called the lightning calculator
05:12
i can't work out what he did i think
05:13
it's him like
05:15
taking large numbers from people and
05:17
then multiplying them together really
05:18
quickly
05:19
rather than the hearings of lightning
05:20
and some thunder and working out how far
05:22
away it is
05:24
like every dad could do it he was the
05:28
first dad to do that that was
05:29
so amazing do you think you know when
05:32
you go to a festival and there's
05:34
quite there's a main stage and then
05:36
there's some quite [ __ ] tense on the
05:37
edge
05:38
is that that's glass blowing right like
05:40
when you've got a woman with 17 heads
05:42
doing trapeze acts in a big tent who's
05:44
going to see the glass blowing
05:46
only when it's raining do they go to the
05:47
glass blowing tent
05:49
that's right this museum the american
05:51
museum it sounds amazing so more people
05:53
went to it proportionately i think than
05:55
have been to
05:56
disneyland or disney world or whatever
05:57
it is and but the museum it did have a
06:00
lot of acts
06:01
or exhibits which were not great so they
06:03
had um
06:05
a living cow with five legs and two
06:07
tails
06:08
well all right um they had the preserved
06:11
hand and arm of a pirate called tom
06:13
trouble
06:14
uh they had some some black bugs found
06:17
in the stomach of a distressed maryland
06:19
lady
06:20
and a hat made out of broom splints made
06:22
by a lunatic
06:25
okay that's the least good stuff he had
06:28
basically and this this museum was in
06:30
the center of new york city this was on
06:32
broadway
06:33
which is amazing i to think of this
06:36
astonishing building with all these
06:37
oddities in there and you could go up to
06:39
the top of the roof they had daily hot
06:41
air balloon rides that would leak no
06:43
from this yeah from the roof of the
06:44
building it's just bizarre location
06:47
nice can we talk about his wife a bit
06:50
or his wives so he was married to
06:52
charity his wife for
06:54
40 years um and then she died
06:57
but they weren't very close i think
06:59
because he got the news that she had
07:01
died when he was off buying racing
07:02
ostriches in hamburg
07:04
and then he didn't go to the funeral so
07:07
maybe a sign there imagine if he'd
07:09
turned up to the funeral with the racing
07:11
ostriches
07:13
i can't find anyone to look after them
07:15
they're gonna have to come i came as
07:16
quickly as i could
07:18
on an ostrich like whenever it's called
07:20
birdie winters on
07:24
um you mentioned tom thumb earlier so
07:27
tom thumb general tom thumb as he was
07:29
nicknamed uh
07:30
had dwarfism uh he was only three foot
07:33
high and barnum took him on as an
07:35
act basically but because he was only
07:38
about four years old when barnum took
07:40
him on
07:41
barnum then aged him up and said this is
07:43
an adult who has dwarfism rather than
07:45
this is a child who would be small
07:47
anyway who also has dwarfism he just
07:49
liked
07:50
adding ages to people didn't he just
07:52
like making people
07:53
older than he loved he absolutely you're
07:55
absolutely right he doubled
07:56
the ages of every one of his most famous
07:58
acts because it's more impressive he
08:00
would be amazing as one of those people
08:02
who made fake ids when you're a kid
08:05
that's probably how he started um
08:08
but he married tom thumb off to another
08:11
lady with dwarfism
08:12
and then there was a there was an
08:13
intense rivalry over her affections i
08:16
think she was called lavinia
08:17
um between tom thumb general tom thumb
08:19
and then a third dwarf who was called
08:21
commodore nut
08:22
and they and he i think barnum set up
08:25
this love rivalry between the three of
08:26
them
08:27
amazing these people all came from
08:29
military backgrounds
08:30
[Laughter]
08:35
okay it is time for fact number two and
08:38
that is
08:38
james okay my fact this week is that in
08:41
1547
08:43
the venetian government assassinated two
08:45
men
08:46
to stop them from revealing how mirrors
08:48
were made
08:50
so good yeah well i read this uh
08:54
on a website called longreads.com an
08:56
article called the ugly history of
08:58
beautiful things and it's all about
08:59
mirrors
09:00
uh and they mostly used as a source um a
09:03
book called the mirror a history by
09:05
sabine melchwa
09:06
bonnet or bonnet and this is all about
09:09
the fact
09:10
that mirrors were made in venice for
09:12
hundreds and hundreds of years and no
09:14
one else around the world
09:15
knew how to make them so venice had a
09:16
complete monopoly on them
09:18
it was in fact even in venice it was
09:20
just this one island called murano
09:22
where all the glassmakers lived and all
09:25
the mirrors were made and they were
09:26
extremely expensive
09:28
if you wanted to buy one in england for
09:29
instance henry viii bought one
09:31
the cost of one venetian mirror was
09:33
about the same as buying a large naval
09:36
ship that's how much one mirror would
09:37
cost
09:38
it was incredible they basically
09:40
completely carded the market
09:42
but everyone else wanted to know how to
09:43
make these mirrors so they wouldn't have
09:45
to pay such massive amounts
09:46
and then in 1547 two venetian workers
09:49
moved to germany to try and
09:51
like sell their wares over there and the
09:53
phoenician government were having
09:54
absolutely none of it and sent some
09:56
assassins out to try and kill them
09:58
and they did kill god and they did kill
10:00
them yeah they i mean
10:01
they from what i read on that article as
10:03
well the stuff that they would do to
10:05
these people if they attempted to leave
10:06
the island so if you went off the island
10:09
they would hold your family hostage on
10:10
the island to make sure that you came
10:12
back
10:13
and i didn't want you giving out those
10:15
secrets yeah unbelievable
10:17
the mirror island it's amazing never
10:19
heard of it it was it was policy
10:21
basically wasn't it venetian policy and
10:22
it lasted for hundreds of years
10:24
like you say so there was even in 1665
10:27
this rule still existed that if you took
10:28
the secrets away with you then the
10:30
government could track you down and kill
10:31
you
10:32
and there was this huge diplomatic
10:34
incident in 1665 because the french were
10:36
gagging for mirrors
10:37
and for the technology to make mirrors
10:40
and so the french ambassador was sent to
10:41
venice
10:42
and told you've got to get some of those
10:43
murano workers back with you
10:45
and so he sort of bribed a few of them
10:47
and said you know i'll give you shed
10:48
loads of money come with me
10:50
they went back to paris and it was awful
10:52
for them because they were working in
10:53
these paris factories
10:55
um they still because they wanted to
10:56
keep the secrets they wouldn't let any
10:58
of the french workers see them work
11:00
so it's kind of pointless because the
11:01
french weren't able to find out their
11:03
secrets
11:04
and they just kept having nervous
11:05
breakdowns because venice kept sending
11:08
threatening messages in various ways so
11:10
them saying we're gonna get you we're
11:11
gonna kill you
11:12
you better come back now. and they sent
11:14
sort of fake messages from their wives
11:15
saying you must come home now
11:17
and then the french responded by sort of
11:19
abducting their wives and bringing
11:21
them to paris in the hope if i was the
11:24
french if i was the french government i
11:25
would send a mirror right from the
11:27
mirror island
11:28
um but i would write on the frame of the
11:30
mirror this guy's dead
11:32
if we ever get him isn't that right you
11:35
know
11:35
that's a great idea oh my god
11:39
yeah you would have been an excellent
11:41
renaissance diplomat
11:42
[Laughter]
11:45
yeah and in the end the french did get
11:46
it didn't they got all the technology
11:48
and they built the
11:49
hall of mirrors in versailles which is
11:51
he did was a big
11:52
[ __ ] you to venice wow it's an opening
11:55
move a whole hall
11:56
that's awesome and it did collapse the
11:59
venetian industry didn't it so it kind
12:00
of went to show that hundreds of years
12:01
of obsessive secrecy was totally worth
12:03
it because as soon as the secret got out
12:05
the industry died yeah yeah it was kind
12:08
of if you're a venetian mirror maker
12:10
you kind of had some good bits and some
12:12
bad bits so
12:13
the good bits were that you were really
12:15
important in society so you're
12:17
you're one of the few people in venice
12:18
that was allowed to have a sword
12:20
at all times and your daughters
12:24
were allowed to marry into affluent
12:26
venetian families because there was like
12:27
a
12:28
almost a caste system where you know you
12:30
weren't allowed to marry outside of your
12:32
level but the
12:33
glassblowers were allowed to but then on
12:35
the downside they worked with mercury
12:37
and so they all went mad
12:38
yes yeah yeah there's a contemporary
12:41
account uh from 1713 by a guy called
12:43
ramazzini who said
12:45
that the curse of that of having to work
12:48
with mercury and the
12:49
the insanity that came off it but having
12:51
to look at yourself as you were going
12:53
insane
12:53
in these mirrors uh watching the madness
12:57
take you over
12:57
is yeah so even if your daughter brings
13:00
home her
13:01
affluent new husband you think he's a
13:03
pickle because you've gone mad
13:05
because of the mercury is that that's
13:07
the curse
13:08
that's it i'm not sure if it was that
13:10
specific kind of
13:11
insanity but you think people are
13:13
pickles
13:15
it was more of a descent into madness
13:17
like there was a quote where they said
13:19
that the mirror makers scowled at their
13:21
reflection
13:22
of their own suffering in the mirrors
13:24
and cursed the trades that they have
13:26
chosen
13:27
mind you if they could have hung on for
13:28
another couple of hundred years they
13:29
would have found a career with pt barnum
13:31
because you've got glass blowing
13:33
and it sounds like they're kind of loopy
13:34
by that stage yeah
13:36
that's true great circus performance uh
13:39
yeah we seem to
13:40
we i mean humanity seemed to make
13:42
mirrors for
13:43
quite a while so there were mirrors in
13:44
ancient rome uh and then in the dark
13:46
ages like
13:47
with a lot of stuff they sort of
13:49
disappeared right and then this
13:50
technology took a while to come back
13:52
but they definitely had them in ancient
13:54
times and good mirrors and i read the
13:56
caligula who obviously made a bit of a
13:58
living and a reputation out of scaring
14:00
the [ __ ] out of people
14:01
caligula used his mirror to practice
14:03
scary faces
14:04
that was really that was the side hustle
14:07
for caligula though that's just
14:08
something he did
14:09
in the course of being emperor he didn't
14:11
have a sort of
14:12
spooky emporium that's great though he
14:15
practices faces
14:16
i love that yeah that's really good you
14:17
don't hear that about evil dicks
14:19
no you just think it comes natural right
14:23
yeah you've got to work hard at these
14:25
things then yeah
14:26
yeah guys i've got a mirror mirror
14:28
question for you
14:29
oh quite cool are you looking in your
14:31
your bathroom mirror at your face
14:33
and your neck maybe your shoulders and
14:35
you want to see your whole body
14:36
and you imagine you've got a massive
14:38
bathroom how are you going to make it so
14:40
the mirror reflects your whole body
14:42
get a full-length mirror no go as far
14:45
away from the mirror as possible
14:46
and eventually you'll be able to see
14:48
yourself i would crouch on the basin
14:51
yeah if i want to see my whole body i'll
14:53
just awkwardly crouch on top of the back
14:55
how
14:55
unbelievably strong is your
14:59
andy doesn't have a toilet in his
15:00
bathroom actually he just uses this
15:02
thing for everything
15:04
it's multi-purpose well i'm astonished
15:07
to say this but andy's right i'm afraid
15:09
uh so i was amazed by this you are
15:13
always the same size
15:14
in a mirror no matter how far back you
15:16
go you're never going to be able to see
15:18
any more of your body and that size is
15:21
half of your actual size
15:22
so let's say you look in a mirror uh
15:24
close up and you get a permanent pen
15:26
and you draw the your face or you draw
15:29
you know the
15:30
yeah you draw a circle around your face
15:31
of where your face image is in the
15:33
mirror
15:33
if you stand back 20 yards and get
15:35
someone close to the mirror to do it
15:37
again
15:38
it's going to be in exactly the same
15:39
place wow
15:41
isn't that this i found this amazing but
15:43
it's so
15:44
like it's obvious when you actually
15:45
think about the old boring
15:47
physics lessons about mirrors because
15:49
it's about the fact that you know the
15:51
angle of incident so where the light
15:52
hits the mirror and then where it
15:54
reflects off the mirror
15:55
always has to be the same so imagine
15:57
you're standing really close to a mirror
15:59
and you want to see your feet
16:01
then the light from your feet goes up to
16:03
the mirror
16:04
at a steep angle and then has to reflect
16:06
at that exact same
16:08
angle to get to your eyes for you to see
16:10
your feet right
16:11
but when you go away from the mirror
16:13
it's going to be exactly the same
16:14
problem if you couldn't see your eyes
16:16
there when you go away from there you
16:17
won't see your eyes further away
16:19
because the light has further to travel
16:20
so even though the angle
16:22
is smaller the light travels further and
16:24
goes over your head draw a diagram and
16:26
you'll understand
16:27
so even if i have a very very very long
16:29
bathroom let's say i've got a bathroom
16:31
that's 100 meters long and i have a
16:32
mirror at the end of it
16:33
that i can't see my feet in up close
16:35
even at the other end of the bathroom i
16:37
still won't be able to see my feet
16:38
you'll never be able to see your feet
16:40
well the thing that's confusing me is
16:41
the other person standing next to the
16:43
mirror who's drawing the head because
16:45
if you were standing at the back of the
16:47
room and i was next to the mirror and
16:49
you said can you see what's in my teeth
16:51
and opened your mouth
16:52
it feels odd to me that i'd be able to
16:53
see your head as a real-sized head
16:56
despite the fact that you're all the way
16:57
over there no you've misunderstood that
17:00
great because that person is a different
17:03
person so this is just about
17:05
how it looks so the reflection how it
17:08
looks to you the person
17:09
obviously to the person standing next to
17:11
the mirror you're going to look like
17:12
you're in a completely different place
17:13
and etc but so we can't test your idea
17:16
of drawing the circle then
17:17
the other person drawing your circle no
17:19
you'd have to tell the other person what
17:21
to draw
17:21
yeah you have to guide their hand with
17:23
your words gotcha okay yeah
17:25
but what you're describing dan and not
17:27
quite understanding that is something
17:29
called the toilet of venus illusion
17:32
and that is that there's a lot of
17:34
paintings
17:35
of the toilet of venus and that is venus
17:37
is lying down
17:38
kind of sideways on a painting and
17:40
there's a cherub holding a mirror
17:42
and then you looking at the painting can
17:44
see venus and can see her
17:46
in the mirror okay and most people think
17:49
that she's looking at herself in the
17:50
mirror but the fact is if you can see
17:52
her face
17:53
she can't see her face in the mirror she
17:55
can actually see you in the mirror
17:56
so she would theoretically be looking at
17:58
the person who's painting the painting
18:00
yeah she wouldn't be looking at herself
18:02
but most people when they see those
18:03
paintings think that she's looking at
18:05
herself
18:06
she's not as vain as people think yeah
18:08
that's very cool
18:10
you know that thing of practicing faces
18:12
in the mirror um
18:14
the caligula uh yeah uh there's a nice
18:16
thing which is that
18:18
um kate winslet uh keeps her oscar
18:21
in her bathroom because she knows that
18:24
everyone wants to practice giving an
18:26
oscar speech
18:29
great idea and she yeah and she can tell
18:31
when people
18:32
are um are doing it because she'll say
18:34
the flush goes and it's almost as if
18:35
they clock it's in there and they just
18:37
spend an extra few
18:38
minutes in there silently doing their
18:41
speed you know what
18:42
i think generally speaking this is a
18:44
non-controversial statement
18:45
generally speaking it's a bad idea to
18:47
have a secret camera in someone's
18:49
bathroom
18:49
but in this case i would love to see
18:52
people doing that speech that would be
18:54
amazing she could pick up some ideas
18:57
i thought you were going to say she
18:58
keeps it in her bathroom so that she can
19:00
pretend she's got two oscars
19:01
i thought you're going to say that or
19:04
maybe she has a mirror behind the mirror
19:06
and it looks like she's just got
19:07
infinite infinite oscars but gradually
19:09
more more green as they go on
19:11
um there is if we're on movie stuff um
19:15
have you guys seen um terminator 2
19:18
i watched it just this week okay amazing
19:21
for the first time
19:22
did you like it i did actually yeah and
19:23
i watched terminator 1 as well for the
19:25
first time oh nice okay well it's a
19:27
zinger but okay in terminator 2 there is
19:28
a scene it might be any extra um
19:30
features but there's a scene where
19:32
there's a mirror shot okay
19:34
and it's the two humans operating on
19:36
schwarzenegger the robot
19:38
and they're unscrewing his brain case
19:40
and they're opening his head up
19:42
and you can see the operation happening
19:43
in the mirror as well
19:45
that wasn't done using a mirror because
19:47
there's no film crew reflected in the
19:49
mirror
19:49
of course and you would think oh well
19:51
they might just remove the film crew
19:53
with cgi
19:54
they didn't do that they literally had a
19:56
cut out space
19:58
so they had a fake arnie in the
20:00
foreground and then the reflection shot
20:02
in the mirror is the real
20:03
arnold schwarzenegger except he's not in
20:05
a mirror he's just sitting opposite a
20:06
dummy of himself
20:08
and that's it um linda hamilton who
20:10
plays sarah connor
20:12
she has a twin sister who did the
20:14
reflection
20:16
uh or did the did the foreground stuff
20:18
and then the house was in the reflection
20:20
so you see both of them
20:21
and they're mirroring each other's
20:22
movements but they are
20:24
not actually being shown in the mirror
20:26
there are there are two
20:28
i know isn't that insane that's
20:29
incredible amazing
20:31
yeah do you know there's an animal that
20:33
has mirrors in its body
20:35
no and that is the scallop
20:38
the humble scallop so it has eyes made
20:41
of mirrors
20:42
scallops have about 200 eyes each
20:46
and rather than having a lens like we
20:48
have to focus the light as it comes in
20:50
they have what most telescopes have now
20:52
to focus the light which is the mirror
20:54
so the light hits a mirror
20:55
that's curved and then obviously it like
20:57
bends and focuses
20:59
so this means that their retina is
21:01
actually on the ceiling
21:03
of their eyes um so with us our retina
21:05
is behind our lens so the light hits our
21:07
lens and then it's focused on our retina
21:08
which is just behind it
21:10
with them it hits these mirrors which
21:12
are their eyes and then bounces
21:13
up onto the ceiling of their eyes which
21:16
is the retina isn't that cool
21:17
that's really cool if you were to get
21:19
let's say
21:20
20 000 scallops and remove all of their
21:23
eyes
21:24
and then paste it on a piece of
21:26
cardboard would you be able to make a
21:27
mirror that's usable um
21:31
it's a bit of a [ __ ] up mirror isn't
21:32
it i don't think people come around your
21:35
house
21:35
yeah i just thinking that the french
21:37
could have used this technology instead
21:39
of going to
21:40
venice it could have been a very
21:41
different world
21:44
could have been what a world we could
21:45
have had where the venetians have good
21:47
mirrors and everyone else has to kill a
21:49
million scholars
21:54
yeah um would you guys get your haircut
21:56
without a mirror
21:59
um yeah i have done yeah many times i
22:02
have to
22:03
um well there is sorry dad
22:07
why do you have to when you go to the
22:08
hairdressers do you say sorry no mirrors
22:12
are you a vampire no i technically so
22:15
because i wear glasses and i can't see
22:18
very well i have to take them off for
22:19
the haircut so there's a mirror in front
22:21
of me i can't make out what is in front
22:23
of you don't force them to remove the
22:24
mirrors
22:27
turn it to face the wall um no there is
22:31
a there
22:32
there's only one hairdressing salon that
22:33
i've found although i haven't looked
22:34
very hard
22:35
where this happens but this is in
22:37
peckham in london and
22:38
it's instead of a mirror you get given a
22:41
piece of modern art
22:43
and then your hair is cut and you have
22:44
to look at the modern art for nearly an
22:46
hour
22:47
isn't that because like one of the worst
22:48
things about sitting in a hairdresser's
22:50
i find
22:51
is having to look at myself the whole
22:52
time because i'm like oh my god what a
22:54
mess
22:54
but if i was looking at a picasso for
22:56
instance where the nose
22:58
is where the ears should be and stuff
22:59
like that i think i'd feel even worse
23:01
about myself
23:02
oh but you'd think oh at least i don't
23:04
look like that guy at least my eyes are
23:06
on different sides of my face
23:10
fair enough
23:13
[Applause]
23:14
okay it's time for fact number three and
23:17
that is my fact
23:18
my fact this week is that the longest
23:20
car in the world was so long
23:22
that it had a literal backseat driver
23:24
now what do you mean by this
23:25
someone at the very back of it having to
23:27
shout really loudly to the driver in the
23:29
front
23:30
i thought it's that you needed someone
23:31
in the back seat of a normal car but
23:33
with very long arms
23:34
to reach to the front stretch armstrong
23:37
yeah yeah well this is this is a limo
23:40
that was built called the american dream
23:42
and it was a hundred foot long
23:44
and it has 26 wheels it has things like
23:47
there's a helipad on the back there's a
23:49
jacuzzi there's multiple interior rooms
23:51
you can play
23:51
putt-putt in the middle of it um but as
23:55
one solid unit
23:56
as a hundred foot long you can't take
23:59
corners it's too long to
24:00
take any corners so what the car had
24:02
built into it
24:04
was a bit in the middle where you could
24:06
hinge it apart
24:07
and when you see on bendy buses where
24:09
they have that sort of um
24:10
the accordion style thing this car would
24:12
have that and in the second half of the
24:14
car there was a second booth
24:16
for another driver to be changing the
24:18
angles of the wheels
24:19
back there so it had a backseat driver
24:22
as well as a front seat driver
24:23
dan can i ask what happens if the person
24:26
in the back seat slams on the brakes
24:28
and the guy in the front seat carries on
24:29
going does he come back and smash him in
24:32
the face like a cartoon
24:34
yeah you're right it would stretch out
24:35
to probably 110 feet
24:37
and then yeah lob itself it's like the
24:39
blackbird sr-71 plane which as we all
24:42
remember
24:42
stretches and compresses depending on
24:45
which altitude it is
24:46
why are you bringing that up why are you
24:48
bringing up these old wounds
24:51
um so this is this is a limo which is
24:52
guinness world record certified as the
24:54
longest car in the world
24:55
and it's built by a man called jay
24:57
orberg who lives in america
24:59
and is one of the great car makers for
25:02
movies um that there's ever been he's
25:05
the man behind the delorean
25:06
in back to the future um he built cars
25:09
for
25:10
uh like kit for knight rider he not the
25:13
original but he built one that was a
25:14
modified
25:15
one that they used in the series um he
25:18
did cars for the flintstones movies
25:20
uh which was that was a more basic
25:22
engineering
25:23
challenge wasn't it it was yeah yeah he
25:26
did the batmobiles for the tim burton
25:27
batman return movies
25:29
so he's he's an amazing designer and
25:31
this was his big dream to create this
25:32
super luxurious
25:34
100 foot long car um but unfortunately
25:37
no one wanted it and it sort of fell
25:39
into disuse and went to a garage and
25:42
it's wasting away now
25:43
but it's been it's being um repurposed
25:45
now as wad
25:47
it's been bought by the uh auto museum
25:50
or the auto zoom i think it's called in
25:52
new jersey and they've bought it to
25:54
teach
25:55
children to teach their students how to
25:57
do up cars so a bunch of students
25:59
started rebuilding it in 2016
26:01
um and i think it's they said it'll take
26:03
years and years to rebuild it properly
26:05
but
26:05
you know it's been used as a teaching
26:06
tool so it's finally found a purpose
26:08
great but i have a question about this
26:11
car yeah
26:12
um it said it's got a jacuzzi or in some
26:15
more um enthusiastic articles a swimming
26:18
pool
26:19
and it also says it has a diving board
26:22
yes the depth of a pool that you can get
26:25
into a limo because it's not a super
26:26
high limo
26:28
it's just car height if you're diving
26:30
off that you're breaking your neck
26:31
very good point very good point i mean
26:33
these things were never actually driven
26:35
anywhere were they not really
26:36
they're always publicity gimmicks aren't
26:38
they yeah yeah yeah because i remember i
26:40
saw one interview with someone who had
26:42
basically it was like a stretch limo
26:44
that had been turned into an
26:45
entire jacuzzi and swimming pool as in
26:48
literally
26:49
everything about it was a swimming pool
26:50
apart from the bit where you drive
26:52
uh and they said yeah we would never
26:54
drive this anywhere because all the
26:55
water would just splash out
26:57
yeah yeah we just take it to car shows
27:00
to show that it's something we can do in
27:01
theory and
27:02
yeah so i was looking up other guinness
27:04
world records that are held by
27:06
cars and one which was set at a auto
27:08
sports international show in birmingham
27:11
um was the record for the titus parallel
27:14
park
27:15
oh yeah and this was done live in front
27:17
of an audience uh
27:19
at birmingham um so the tightest
27:21
parallel park
27:22
is 7.5 centimeters
27:25
that's the gap on each side or
27:27
altogether yeah yeah that this
27:29
i think all together that this that this
27:30
person going in was allowed
27:32
yeah that's insane that is quite because
27:35
if i see a space which is
27:37
smaller than twice the length of my car
27:39
i think
27:41
i'll drive around a bit longer
27:44
yeah this is aleister moffat 2015 he set
27:47
it in birmingham
27:48
that's amazing and the car's still there
27:50
he hasn't been able to get it yet has he
27:53
have you heard of the world's hairiest
27:54
car no no
27:56
no this was owned by maria lucia mugno
28:03
in italy they were hairdressers and they
28:06
thought what better way
28:08
to advertise our business by sweeping up
28:10
a load of human hair off the floor
28:12
and gluing it to our car wow and that's
28:15
what the actual human hair from the
28:16
customers
28:17
actual human hair and it's legal you're
28:19
allowed to drive it because
28:21
um yeah who would come up with the law
28:23
yeah what
28:24
what sick legislator would think of that
28:26
i mean also
28:27
bad their customers couldn't see them
28:29
stealing the hair behind them because
28:30
they had the modern art in front of them
28:34
yeah um and oh my god it's legal and
28:36
they there's only one part of the cow
28:38
you're not allowed to put the hair
28:40
oh oh oh don't tell us don't tell us um
28:42
i would say
28:45
yes yeah no because you could like comb
28:47
it out of the way
28:48
instead of me instead of windscreen
28:49
wipers it has two massive combs
28:53
center passing very bold um i would say
28:56
on
28:57
the uh steering wheel because
29:00
this is a legal thing yeah but i think a
29:03
hairy steering wheel would be a hazard
29:05
to road users other road users i don't
29:07
think so i would say
29:08
okay you could just have a hairy
29:09
steering wheel in the rest of your car's
29:11
normal and that would be fine wouldn't
29:12
it yeah
29:13
hairy gear stick that's a horrible
29:15
euphemism
29:16
[Laughter]
29:18
i'd say the accelerator pedal because
29:20
the hairs might get caught underneath
29:22
somehow
29:22
tie up and then you can't lift it back
29:24
up such a good answer
29:26
the answer is engine because if you put
29:28
it on the engine it might set on fire
29:29
okay better answer yeah
29:33
so you're saying it's allowed to put a
29:35
moustache on your brake pedal if you
29:37
want to
29:38
in italy what about the number plate i
29:42
thought it was illegal to conceal your
29:44
number plate you know what when i asked
29:45
this question i didn't think you were
29:47
all gonna come up with a million great
29:48
answers
29:49
well let's be honest almost every part
29:51
of a car is a terrible place to put hair
29:54
yeah but no you can get invented with
29:56
that because if you have gray hair you
29:57
can spell out the words
29:59
and letters sorry numbers and letters no
30:01
just with different color hair
30:02
that's very easy to do really at that
30:04
point yeah i i
30:06
do you know what then i think if your
30:08
car is covered in hair
30:10
no one needs your number plate police
30:20
[Applause]
30:21
okay it's time for our final fact of the
30:23
show and that is
30:24
andy my fact is that ancient british
30:27
fruit varieties
30:28
include the hens turd apple and the
30:32
bloody bastard pear
30:34
so this is just about amusing names of
30:37
fruit
30:39
it doesn't get much more amusing than
30:40
that andy doesn't know um
30:42
there are there are amazing there are
30:45
hundreds of varieties of
30:46
of apple and pear and other fruits uh
30:49
which have kind of gone out so
30:51
for example one ancient one is called
30:53
the shits mock plum
30:55
which apparently has a laxative effect
30:57
if you eat too many of them
30:58
i believe the bloody bastard pair also
31:00
has a lightsaber effect and i think
31:02
that's where that got the name as well
31:03
oh
31:04
wait so how does that i think you're on
31:06
the toilet you've got
31:07
bloody bastard ah
31:10
it doesn't create bloody stool oh that
31:12
sounds like you shouldn't be
31:14
well it just sounded like that was what
31:15
you were suggesting yeah no i wasn't
31:17
intending to suggest that um well that's
31:20
a relief because i've just eaten seven
31:23
they are inedible can i just say if you
31:26
see
31:27
if you go to the shops and see a bloody
31:29
bastard pair do not eat it they are
31:30
inedible they're irresponsible for them
31:32
to be selling it
31:35
they are there's a load of pears in the
31:37
uk which are inedible pears
31:40
but they used to make perry they used to
31:41
make alcohol
31:43
so perry is the per version of cider and
31:46
bloody bastard is one of the ones that's
31:48
used to make this but you can't eat them
31:50
because they'll give you the shits
31:51
right and similarly in fact with a cider
31:54
apple i don't know why so many of these
31:56
fruits have this effect there's a cider
31:57
apple called slack mcgirdle
31:59
which is again a reference to the fact
32:02
that
32:02
you're gonna have to drop your trousers
32:04
once you've eaten this guy wow
32:05
can i get can i give you some funny
32:07
names with apples and pears just for
32:09
fun yes so i was looking for the bloody
32:11
bastard pair
32:12
and it's enshrined in uk legislation so
32:15
they have certain apples and pairs that
32:18
are able to be used to make cider or
32:20
perry it's by the apple and pear
32:22
research council order of 1989
32:25
and there's a big long list of them and
32:27
the apples include
32:28
balls bittersweet bloody turk
32:32
crummy norman and as anna says slack my
32:35
girdle
32:35
yeah and perry pears include bastard
32:39
sack
32:39
clipper dick golden balls hairy knob
32:43
and margaret
32:46
and they're all official um fruits that
32:49
you should use to make
32:50
cider or perry they also have on that
32:54
government list
32:54
they have the startle [ __ ] pair which is
32:58
and now i think people can now guess
32:59
because there's been a pattern why it's
33:01
called the startle [ __ ]
33:02
is it a does it is it like a viagra a
33:04
natural viagra
33:05
ah it's not that that's one of the
33:08
things it could have been you're right
33:09
does it fall to
33:10
does do the fruits fall from the tree to
33:13
the ground
33:13
shortly before dawn waking up cockrells
33:18
what a sweet and wholesome explanation
33:20
uh no it's because it's a diuretic so
33:22
your [ __ ] is literally startled into
33:24
urinating when you eat it
33:25
apparently okay or when you drink the
33:27
cider i suppose
33:28
yeah you know you say oh god my cock's a
33:31
bit startled
33:33
i've never heard anyone say that that's
33:35
i think that's a new phrase that we're
33:36
going to bring into the lexicon
33:38
isn't it whenever you need to go to the
33:39
bathroom it's a polite way of saying i
33:41
want to go to the little boys room or
33:42
little girls room
33:43
just say oops my cock's been startled
33:47
i'll be back in a minute
33:50
um so naming apples happens today as
33:53
well though so there are new
33:55
name varieties have you guys been
33:56
reading about the cosmic crisp
33:58
no no okay so this is a new apple that
34:01
was launched
34:02
last year with a 10 million dollar
34:04
marketing budget it's basically
34:06
it's i know it's it's the one of the
34:08
biggest apple launches that has not been
34:10
of
34:11
an apple why is it called again it's
34:13
called the cosmic crisp
34:14
and um it's got pr people um
34:17
who have said it's enormously crunchy
34:20
and wipe your face
34:21
juicy are you under the thumb a big
34:23
apple
34:26
but it's i find it so normally apples
34:28
get launched with a bit of fanfare but
34:30
this is an unusual apple so it's got tag
34:32
lines which include
34:34
the apple of big dreams and imagine the
34:36
possibilities
34:37
um they've hired an ex-astronaut called
34:40
leroy chao
34:41
to be a social influence of plugging the
34:43
apple wow
34:44
and it's it's it's actual name is wa38
34:47
and it was patented
34:49
by uh washington state university they
34:51
developed it and so
34:52
this has been launched as a thing so
34:54
this is all sounding a bit hashtag spawn
34:56
but it is and i'm just feeling sorry for
34:58
the career of leroy chao which has
35:00
clearly taken a dip
35:04
i think he was a commander on the iss
35:06
well okay now he's flogging apples
35:08
i know but anyway so because you can
35:12
patent an
35:12
apple every time someone buys one of
35:15
these a bit of the money goes to
35:16
washington state university because they
35:18
were the people who
35:19
cross-bred it yeah it's a really
35:21
controversial thing isn't it being able
35:23
to patent fruits and
35:24
seeds and stuff and some people think
35:26
it's really important because then you
35:28
get
35:28
more varieties which helps you know feed
35:31
people but then other people think well
35:33
how can you paint it an apple yeah
35:36
i'm not saying which side of the
35:37
argument i come on but no
35:39
so yeah we used to have lots more
35:40
varieties of apples and pears
35:42
than we do today but it seems like
35:44
they're making a bit of a comeback this
35:46
fact suggests people are getting more
35:47
interest in these
35:48
quirky new varieties and especially you
35:51
mentioned perry pear cider
35:53
so perry is also making a comeback so
35:55
all these different types of pear
35:57
are starting to be bred again and most
35:59
of the pear cider that you get
36:00
in pubs i didn't know this most of the
36:02
personality that you order like a basic
36:04
pear cider is just apple cider
36:06
and they've put pear flavoring into it
36:08
no yeah wow
36:09
and it's only the problem yeah isn't
36:12
that weird
36:14
unless you're getting nice proper
36:15
expensive perry or whatever or you're
36:17
going to
36:18
devon for it i feel like i've been
36:20
really ripped off by that
36:21
i'm so sorry i'll be honest i'm not sure
36:23
i've ever bought it but i still
36:28
one thing that i have drank which is
36:30
definitely perry i think is baby sham
36:32
right
36:32
yes yeah baby sham is perry um so
36:36
and that's definitely made of pears i
36:38
think that's made of
36:39
baby sham you're right but the perry
36:41
industry is a bit annoyed about baby
36:43
sham because it doesn't have a massively
36:44
high brow reputation
36:46
and they want perry too and one of the
36:48
people who's trying to rejuvenate
36:50
perry's reputation
36:51
is the kind of leading uh pear cider
36:54
bloke in the world i'm gonna call him
36:56
he's called tom oliver
36:58
so he's staging this big comeback he's
37:00
an award-winning herefordshire cider
37:01
maker
37:02
and his other job is being tool manager
37:03
of the proclaimers
37:06
wow just two pretty weird
37:09
it's amazing isn't it that these people
37:10
who had such amazing jobs like astronaut
37:13
and top manager of the proclaimers would
37:14
then go into bridge yeah
37:19
hey i found that um in italy 275 meters
37:24
below the surface of the earth are
37:27
10 000 tons of apples
37:30
what yeah what are they doing there dan
37:34
so this is this is a way okay so um
37:37
something that uh is well known is that
37:40
uh apples that you eat are often not
37:42
freshly picked they're kept for a year
37:44
or so in storage facilities to be able
37:46
to
37:46
uh make them last longer so you can pick
37:49
them and you can put them in storage
37:50
and they do that by reducing the oxygen
37:52
right down to one percent basically
37:54
so in italy what they've done is they've
37:57
taken over these old mines
37:58
um it's throughout the dolomites in the
38:01
um
38:02
the italian mountains and underneath it
38:04
they've converted these mines
38:06
into giant refrigerators where they're
38:09
stocking
38:10
up to they say 20 000 tons of apples so
38:13
at any given time there must be a
38:14
different amount but yeah if you visit
38:16
there
38:17
amazing yeah wow they say that it this
38:20
is what the article said when compared
38:21
to a standard above ground storage space
38:23
the state the savings by having them
38:25
underground
38:26
are equal to 10 olympic swimming pools
38:28
of water being saved a day
38:29
and 10 hectares of land wow wow yeah so
38:33
that's why they do it but yeah
38:34
there's a lot of apples underground in
38:36
italy god every time i bite into an
38:38
apple now
38:38
i'll reflect more on what an adventure
38:40
it's been able to get here
38:43
through the bowels of the earth um i
38:45
found some other fun
38:47
fruit names actually there was a good
38:48
article on bbc future about
38:50
how again we've lost our passion for um
38:53
these smaller smaller scale fruit
38:55
varieties
38:56
and this article was saying that um fist
38:59
fights used to break
39:00
out over which tomatoes were better
39:01
those grown in mississippi or those
39:03
grown in new orleans
39:04
and uh now only dedicated foodies know
39:07
of
39:07
lee's golden girl tomato and radiator
39:10
charlie's mortgage lifter tomato
39:14
mortgage lifter that's right radiator
39:16
charlie's mortgage lifted tomorrow
39:18
you can still get it it just sounds like
39:21
you've put four random words
39:25
was it supposedly so good that it would
39:26
allow him to pay off his mortgage
39:28
it was exactly that it was thought that
39:30
any seller of it would be able to pay
39:31
off
39:32
and he must have had quite a big house
39:34
with all those radiators
39:38
um there are some people who are devoted
39:40
to finding these
39:41
old fruits um
39:44
they're often detectives as well so
39:46
there's a guy called david benscott who
39:48
worked for the fbi
39:49
and then started tracking down apples
39:52
after the head of the fbi or whatever
39:54
becomes an apple detector
39:56
what is going on um there's david carp
39:58
who
39:59
was a wall street trader and a latin
40:02
translator
40:02
and he only got into fruits to impress a
40:04
woman and she wasn't impressed but he
40:06
just kept detecting fruits for the rest
40:08
of his career john bunker the apple
40:11
whisperer
40:12
he is amazing he's an american guy
40:15
come on it's much easier to be an apple
40:17
whisperer and tame an apple than it is
40:19
to be a robert redford style horse
40:20
whisperer
40:22
but go on well he's tracked down a
40:25
hundred varieties and saved them from
40:27
extinction and when you think about it
40:30
it must be incredibly hard because
40:32
you know maybe where an apple was last
40:34
grown and but you have to
40:35
comb through historical records for what
40:38
these apples look like for drawings of
40:40
them
40:41
for the taste and he will
40:44
study these records and he will
40:45
sometimes go to towns or villages where
40:48
they were last seen
40:49
and he will put up wanted signs
40:53
i swear to god this is have you seen
40:56
this apple
40:57
yeah he will put up a sign saying wanted
40:59
alive narragansett apple
41:01
last seen in york county originated on
41:04
this farm
41:05
and and he does he works miracles with
41:07
these things
41:08
so he once went to a place and he said
41:10
have you seen this apple
41:11
and an old man said i know a related
41:14
apple which was also exchanged
41:16
and this old man said i used to eat from
41:18
this tree when i was a boy um
41:20
and the tree was almost completely dead
41:22
there was one two inch wide strip of
41:24
living tissue and there was one branch
41:27
right and he took a cutting of that and
41:29
he successfully managed to regrow
41:31
the entire apple breed right
41:34
from that tiny strip and so that's great
41:37
considering you just made it up
41:40
it's all true it's an amazing profile
41:43
how annoyed you're gonna be if you go to
41:45
all that trouble and it tastes like crap
41:47
which is so likely
41:48
um is this that's john bunker right yeah
41:51
because he seems to have
41:52
a side project i guess when you've got
41:54
these skills you've got to monetize them
41:55
whichever way you can so he identifies
41:57
other people's apples
41:58
so i think he said what he's looking for
42:00
is the ones he can't identify but people
42:01
are queuing every day saying you know
42:03
what's this what's this
42:07
delicious granny smith
42:10
he just looks at the sticker usually
42:15
uh that's a problem isn't it that
42:16
basically it's become homogenized and
42:19
all we're basically just growing the
42:21
same apple trees everywhere and stuff
42:23
like that and the same pear trees and
42:25
you can kind of get invasive pear trees
42:27
and things like that can't you there's
42:29
one i was reading an article
42:31
in vice when i searched for pears and um
42:34
the title of the article was here's why
42:36
the trees on your streets smell like
42:38
semen
42:40
okay okay the linden trees yeah
42:43
they're called these ones are not the
42:45
linen trees which also famously smell
42:47
like
42:47
semen these are pear trees uh it's
42:50
called the pyrus
42:51
caloriana tree and this pear tree is
42:55
taking over they were grown on
42:57
like linden trees were but they kind of
43:00
you get one and then someone plants
43:02
another one and then they hybridize
43:03
together and you get new types of this
43:05
particular type of pear tree and they're
43:06
really good at taking over in an area
43:09
and just wow out competing all the other
43:13
pear trees
43:14
all right you know nigel farage
43:17
they're better at the job it's a less
43:20
nice way of imagining
43:22
the song which ends and a partridge in a
43:24
pear tree if the pear tree in question
43:26
smells of semen
43:27
if you're being given those on the 12
43:29
days of christmas you're not gonna be
43:30
happy about it yeah because actually the
43:32
first 11 days you think these are quite
43:33
i mean it's
43:34
a bit awkward having all these swans and
43:36
drummers and stuff
43:37
but they're quite good gifts and at the
43:39
end you just get the jizzy tree
43:42
i've been blaming you've been blaming
43:44
the lords are leaping until now
43:54

00:14
hello
00:14
and welcome to another working from home
00:17
episode of no such thing as a fish
00:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
00:21
undisclosed locations in the uk
00:24
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:26
here with anna chazinski
00:27
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four
00:32
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with you james okay
00:39
my fact this week
00:40
is that if you were to take a con on the
00:43
cub and remove
00:44
each colonel in a row while saying she
00:46
loves me
00:47
and then she loves me not then she will
00:49
always love you not
00:51
right no yeah how many how many
00:54
that's quite a long version of that game
00:56
i'm guessing
00:57
well it's row by row right row by row
00:59
yeah so it's not that long
01:01
it's long and disappointing for any
01:02
lovers doing it
01:05
there's no jeopardy it's just a
01:06
guaranteed lose there's an argument that
01:08
it's not quite as romantic as sitting
01:10
wistfully
01:11
in a field taking petals off a flower
01:14
just going to your fridge and grabbing
01:15
an old corn on the cob
01:17
but um this is basically i mean the fact
01:19
is that there are
01:20
even number of kernels on every row of a
01:23
card in the cup
01:24
the best way to check it yourself is to
01:26
get a con on the cob from your fridge or
01:27
your supermarket
01:29
cut it in half widthways and then look
01:31
at the sliced part
01:32
and you'll get a circular cross section
01:34
with the inside of the cob surrounded by
01:36
corn kernels
01:37
and then if you count those kernels
01:38
there will always be an even number
01:40
sometimes it's kind of difficult to see
01:42
because you might have a little runty
01:44
kernel
01:45
where the um the bigger ones have kind
01:47
of squished it out of the way you know
01:48
like if you lose a tooth and everything
01:50
kind of
01:50
squishes back in that direction but it
01:52
always be true
01:54
always an even number and it's due to
01:55
the way that khan and the cops grow
01:57
and by the time you finish this process
01:59
not only does she love you not but she's
02:01
had enough time to escape as far away
02:02
from you as possible
02:04
that's true is it even possible to peel
02:07
off a row
02:08
i really wanted to try this but i so i
02:10
hate sweet corn and i would never touch
02:12
call on the cob so i don't know if a row
02:14
can come off all in one row
02:15
no but like i say if what you do is cut
02:18
your card on the cub in half then you'll
02:19
be able to see the cross section and
02:21
you'll see the row itself and then you
02:23
can just pluck off the
02:24
individual curve if you want so you just
02:26
have to say she loves me not and she
02:28
loves me really slowly as you're
02:29
plucking each individual curve
02:31
yeah i mean if you start with she loves
02:34
you not then she loves me then she loves
02:36
me not then you're fine
02:37
but it's just basically there's an even
02:38
number i mean what what can i say
02:41
it's because of the way that they grow
02:43
if you were to look at it you'll find
02:44
most of them have like 14 16 18
02:46
something like that
02:47
yeah and apparently this is just a big
02:50
old well-known
02:51
thing that people who are into corn or
02:53
growing corn uh
02:54
you know know about and it used to get
02:56
hit the news i think sometimes it still
02:58
doesn't hit the news if someone finds
03:00
an odd numbered colonel like i found a
03:03
newspaper report from 1949.
03:05
it was it was sort of local rather than
03:07
national news but it was all capital
03:09
letters
03:10
freak ear reported in uh in
03:13
an iowa newspaper wow so did you know
03:17
so i repeat i was trying to find out
03:18
other you know secrets of corn
03:21
and um yeah i read a huffington post
03:24
piece which was headlined
03:26
five myths about corn you should stop
03:28
believing oh
03:29
okay well lower those expectations
03:32
they're much less juicy than i would
03:34
have thought because um
03:35
one of them is that corn is unhealthy
03:38
which i didn't think it was i was
03:39
firmly at the opinion it was mostly most
03:42
of my days vegetables
03:43
um better than a magnum yeah better than
03:45
a magnum exactly although kind of a
03:46
similar shape
03:47
um but one of the myths is that we can't
03:50
digest
03:51
sweetcorn oh which i think i do yeah i
03:53
believe that yeah so
03:55
you can i've seen it now i've seen it
03:57
andy well
03:58
okay here we go um well it does have
04:01
large amounts of insoluble fiber but you
04:04
can digest the inside so the inside is
04:05
pure starch so you digest that
04:07
but the outside is just a husk of
04:09
cellulose which is not digestible
04:11
so it looks like you haven't digested it
04:13
but you have can i just say that
04:15
if you're taking your feces and taking
04:17
out the calm colonel
04:18
saying she loves me and she wants me not
04:21
you might get lucky and have an odd
04:23
number but i think it's unlikely you'll
04:25
get lucky in any other ways
04:27
well you haven't heard how i met my wife
04:29
[Laughter]
04:32
that's very cool when you say um the
04:34
outside of the yellow
04:36
skin i guess bit is made of cellulose so
04:38
you don't digest it but
04:39
presumably the ones that come out the
04:41
other end are the bits that you didn't
04:42
chew it's not like you've digested the
04:44
inside and then you've remade the
04:46
perfect shape of a piece of sweet corn
04:47
but with just the eggs right
04:49
you're right if you chew it with your
04:50
teeth and obliterate the yellow outside
04:52
you won't be able to notice that
04:53
although it will still be there because
04:55
that
04:55
that's the fiber which is not soluble
04:58
but you won't be able to see it but if
04:59
you're shooting sweet corn then
05:01
it'll all go straight through you yeah
05:04
absolutely yeah
05:06
i don't know if people do that i don't
05:07
eat it if it came in shots i think you
05:10
might eat it
05:11
yeah you're right you know me so well um
05:13
if you found an odd-numbered cob
05:15
and you were a slave in america in the
05:18
19th century you could earn your freedom
05:20
apparently this was well there was one
05:23
incidence of this it was in an 1838
05:25
farmer's cabinet magazine and it said
05:28
that a
05:28
slave owner said to his saves if any of
05:30
you finds an odd numbered cop
05:32
i'll be so astonished i'll free you and
05:34
so this they came to him two years later
05:37
said i found one
05:38
and the master was just like jaw on the
05:39
floor said okay please tell me how you
05:41
did that you must have cheated
05:43
and so the slave said okay look you have
05:44
to promise to free me anyway
05:46
and then he explained that he'd gone and
05:48
he tampered with it and if you tamper
05:49
with them
05:49
very early on to remove that um one of
05:53
the rows
05:53
then it'll grow in a way that that road
05:56
disappears
05:57
and so the master freed him but kept the
05:59
cob and displayed it
06:00
at dinner parties from then on as an
06:02
amazing anecdote that there was an
06:04
odd-numbered
06:05
cob this was entertainment in the 1830s
06:08
cool yeah alex was so
06:11
terrible then i mean andy we are doing a
06:15
podcast
06:15
entirely based on the fact that you
06:17
don't get out of the car of the cubs
06:24
[Laughter]
06:25
i didn't realize how much corn is used
06:27
in uh
06:29
daily item like products that we use
06:31
every day so
06:32
um i didn't realize for example if you
06:34
eat corn for dinner
06:35
before you go to bed you're cleaning
06:37
your teeth again with other corn
06:40
uh because bits of it that are broken
06:42
down are put into toothpaste
06:43
so yeah so corn if corn wasn't in
06:46
toothpaste it's not obviously not for
06:47
all toothpaste but if it wasn't in there
06:49
it wouldn't have that sort of
06:50
sweetish taste it would taste more like
06:52
soap um so they use
06:54
it as a flavoring um so it's from the uh
06:57
sorbitol which is a glucose derivative
06:59
of the
07:00
corn so yeah we're cleaning our teeth
07:01
with corn as we go to bed that's very
07:03
interesting
07:04
yeah not all of the corn is necessarily
07:06
sweet con right i think
07:08
um so in america sweet corn that you
07:10
would think of as corn on the cob stuff
07:12
it accounts for only one percent of all
07:14
the corn grown in america
07:16
and the rest of it is stuff like field
07:18
corn and and all that kind of stuff is
07:20
used in industry perhaps for this i'm
07:22
not sure
07:22
which one is used for toothpaste but to
07:24
feed animals and things like that
07:26
it's unbelievable so there was a great
07:28
article on the uh the atlantic website
07:30
which was about
07:31
it was about a woman actually called
07:32
christine robinson who is severely
07:33
allergic to corn
07:35
she had no idea what she was getting
07:36
into when she got this allergy she
07:38
thought oh well i won't be able to have
07:39
corn on the cob
07:40
or you know tacos made of corn it turns
07:42
out
07:43
everything has corn in the usa so table
07:46
salt
07:46
has corn derivatives sort of put in it
07:49
iced tea
07:50
bottled water sometimes have minerals
07:52
which is processed with water you can't
07:53
have bottled water
07:55
supermarket meat bagged salad fish
07:58
grains
07:58
fruits tomatoes milk all of these things
08:00
are sprayed with lactic acid which is
08:02
made from corn sugars
08:05
if she's traveling she can't wear a
08:06
wetsuit unless she knows that it hasn't
08:08
been washed in a detergent
08:10
that does not contain corn she
08:13
says she loves my god she said she can't
08:15
dive if her partner's
08:17
on the diving trip have been eating corn
08:19
chips i mean it sounds like the most oh
08:20
my god
08:21
i know i mean if you went to a diving
08:24
place
08:25
and they said here's your wetsuit and
08:26
you said excuse me you just got any corn
08:28
on this they just think you're insane
08:30
i know i know it's
08:33
in everything wow yeah it's astonishing
08:36
poor woman
08:37
yeah jeez i like the way you said she
08:39
had no idea what she was getting into as
08:40
though she sort of elected
08:42
her i know it's so unfair i i misspoke
08:45
there
08:46
yeah yeah right there's a corn belt in
08:48
america you can drive for 1500 miles and
08:50
only see corn
08:51
she must hate that yeah i don't think
08:53
she goes there very much
08:55
um yeah that's the um it's the great
08:57
american bottom isn't it
08:59
yeah that's what it's called where most
09:01
of the corn is grown in america
09:03
that is funny it's the floodplain of the
09:05
mississippi and basically there was
09:06
glaciers there and they all retreated
09:08
and it was a great vast bit of extremely
09:11
um fertile land and it's known as the
09:14
great american bottom
09:15
and is is that name related to the fact
09:17
that sweet corn comes out of your bottom
09:22
it can be amazing looking i mean it can
09:24
be so beautiful can't it
09:26
it's a shame it's disgusting but um
09:29
it's great i'm gonna defend corn here by
09:31
the way i love corn
09:32
look you're wrong um but that's okay
09:34
don't feel bad fair enough um
09:36
but i do like some of the non-yellow
09:38
varieties god you're an easy one to beat
09:40
in an argument
09:43
one nil um so sweet corn can come
09:47
in loads of different colors and lots of
09:49
varieties it's a bit like we were
09:50
talking about um different types of pear
09:52
a couple of weeks ago but it's corn you
09:54
can get in bloody butcher variety
09:56
shaman's blue the country gentleman
10:00
and the best variety is this one called
10:02
glass gem
10:03
corn look it up it was originally bred
10:06
by this
10:07
old man this 80 year old man who's half
10:09
cherokee and he wanted to get in touch
10:11
with his native american roots and it
10:13
was extremely important to native
10:14
americans
10:15
and so he started growing lots of
10:17
different varieties of corn and
10:18
experimenting and cross-breeding them
10:19
and he bred this glass gem corn and it's
10:21
rainbow corn
10:23
if you guys seen this it's every little
10:25
bit of corn is a different color and
10:26
it's
10:27
bright red purple green blue yellow
10:30
orange is absolutely stunning not very
10:33
edible but
10:34
that's the problem i was wondering why
10:36
we haven't seen that in tesco's
10:38
yeah it's the edible thing but it looks
10:40
great okay um
10:41
you know the you know the movie
10:42
interstellar yeah yeah christopher nolan
10:45
movie um that cost 165 million dollars
10:48
to make
10:48
and um to help pay back that money uh
10:51
christopher nolan sold corn
10:55
wow how much yeah did he sell like um
10:58
i i haven't got the exact number but
11:01
it's uh
11:02
if you've seen the movie you know that
11:04
it's largely set in a cornfield
11:06
there's huge scenes of cornfield and
11:09
rather than doing that by cgi
11:11
uh christopher nolan consulted with
11:13
superman director zack snyder who'd also
11:16
grown corn for his movie
11:18
to say where's the best place to grow
11:19
corn for your own movie
11:21
so he spent a hundred thousand pounds by
11:23
finding a location in calgary
11:25
in canada which was next to a mountain
11:27
range and they grew the cornfields from
11:29
scratch for the movie
11:30
wow and they were told that by the time
11:32
they filmed it that the corn wouldn't be
11:34
usable but it turned out it was
11:36
so christopher nolan sold off all the
11:39
corn
11:39
um to help pay back his movie imagine if
11:42
you're at your local vegetable market
11:43
and you had christopher nolan trying to
11:44
flog you some sweet corn
11:46
it would be very surreal except i don't
11:48
you'd recognize him actually so maybe it
11:49
wouldn't
11:50
would he he would have to tell everyone
11:52
he was christopher nolan every time and
11:54
you wouldn't believe him would you most
11:55
people would say who's christopher nolan
11:57
for a start
11:58
yeah you go home and say this weird
12:00
sweet corn dealer kept trying to tell me
12:02
his name today
12:06
you would think that someone who worked
12:07
in such a high-profile job to begin with
12:09
would go into per growing not into
12:11
sweetcorn manufacturing
12:15
last week can we pause or quickly listen
12:17
to last week's episode
12:20
do you know that today's sweetcorn is 1
12:22
000 times larger than it was nine
12:24
thousand years ago
12:25
wow that's quite a lot bigger isn't it
12:28
a thousand times you mean the individual
12:31
pieces or the cobs
12:33
the whole thing but i think the
12:34
individual pieces would be a lot smaller
12:36
as well maybe not a thousand times
12:37
because they would be invisible to me
12:39
yeah i think they used to be two
12:43
centimeters long
12:44
the cobs and then so i i didn't find
12:46
that fact james but i did find that
12:47
farmer started selectively growing it
12:50
and it was you know a very early plant
12:52
to be domesticated
12:53
but according to the source i wrote
12:55
within 6 000 years the farmers had got
12:57
it from
12:58
two centimeters long a cob to 2.5
13:00
centimeters long
13:03
very slow rate of return wow and how
13:07
long did you say that was six thousand
13:08
years
13:10
do you think like after six thousand
13:12
years
13:14
you must think to yourself it might not
13:15
be worth carrying
13:18
but that's only because we know where
13:19
it's got to these days back then that
13:21
might have looked freakishly
13:23
it might have been like whoa beginner's
13:25
world records get over here
13:28
but how did they even that's so
13:29
invincible how do you pass on the wisdom
13:31
that you have to keep reading it because
13:33
if you're talking to your grandad and
13:35
he's saying look
13:36
your cob look at it it's that is half a
13:38
millimeter
13:39
bigger than mine you're very lucky i
13:42
can't believe they bothered
13:44
you wouldn't notice you wouldn't like
13:46
you just look at a corner of the cup and
13:48
go well this is
13:49
one tenth of a millimeter bigger than
13:50
normal and then plant it would you
13:52
i can't account for it i honestly i have
13:55
no working to show on this fact
13:58
native americans used to worship corn
14:00
mother and
14:02
because corn was so important to them
14:04
and she was very interesting so
14:06
the myth of corn mother was that she
14:08
would feed hungry tribes with corn and
14:11
the story there are various stories
14:12
about how she came into being and what
14:14
uh people did with her one of them is
14:16
that she fed a hungry tribe with corn
14:18
and saved them all
14:19
but suddenly one of them realized how
14:21
she was doing it and the way she did it
14:23
was
14:23
she rubbed her body really really hard
14:26
until her skin crumbled off and became
14:28
sweet corn and they were so grossed out
14:30
by that
14:30
that they sent her away or i think in
14:32
some versions they killed her
14:33
and but she was so nice that they said
14:35
we're gonna kill you because that's
14:36
really rank what you're doing
14:38
um and she said okay but here are
14:40
special instructions for how to leave my
14:42
corpse to make sure it keeps growing
14:44
corn for you guys
14:45
wow wow self-sacrificing women and
14:47
another one
14:48
she gave them all corn but then one of
14:50
the members of the tribe
14:51
had sex with an ear of corn that looked
14:53
a lot like a vulva
14:54
and she was so offended that she ran
14:56
away hmm
14:58
she loves me not call on the knob more
15:01
like
15:03
actually it was that joke that offended
15:05
her and then she ran away
15:12
it is time for fact number two and that
15:14
is anna
15:15
my fact this week is that mayan gods
15:18
include
15:19
flying scab gathered blood and
15:22
pus demon they've actually got a lot of
15:26
gods
15:26
um and about 800 i think but these are
15:29
some of the best these are the
15:30
underworld gods so
15:32
i should be clear these aren't sort of
15:33
good guys these are the guys in the
15:35
underworld who represent things like
15:36
disease and death
15:38
uh they're the bad guys they don't sound
15:40
like good guys they don't it's quite
15:41
obvious from their names isn't it
15:44
but you think a hell of a job for a pr
15:45
person isn't it when you're called
15:47
a flight scout plus demon yeah
15:51
these are these are mostly mine gods
15:53
that were
15:54
worshipped when the mayan empire was at
15:57
its height
15:57
which i think it sort of started to
15:59
collapse and disintegrate around the
16:00
10th 11th century but there are still
16:02
mayans alive today there are about six
16:04
million or seven million mines in
16:05
central america
16:07
and they you know believe in these gods
16:10
and i really like the story of these
16:12
particular ones because they're involved
16:13
in the creation
16:14
story of mayan mythology whereby there
16:17
were these
16:18
twins these hero twins and
16:21
who had their own weird creation story
16:23
actually where they were born because a
16:25
decapitated head spat on their mother
16:27
and impregnated her anyway they
16:30
they ended up there were so many
16:32
different ways of getting pregnant in
16:33
the old days however
16:36
it was like sex education classes must
16:38
have been really
16:39
if a swan comes here you watch out it
16:42
might be
16:42
like i like going to get ivf and hearing
16:45
all the options
16:48
coming through the magazine what would
16:49
you go for i don't think you'd pick the
16:51
decapitated head spit
16:54
i think that's one of the cheaper ones
16:57
um
16:57
anyway so these um hero twins went to
17:00
the underworld and they took on the gods
17:02
and tried to defeat the gods of death
17:04
and disease and they were also things
17:05
like jaundice demon
17:07
and bloody teeth and this is all written
17:10
down in their holy book which is called
17:12
popal vu
17:13
and has been passed down but yeah they
17:16
beat these gods they probably beat these
17:17
girls by
17:18
playing lots of ball games with them
17:20
which is why then
17:21
in me so america ball games were such a
17:23
big important
17:24
part of their lives um anyway the twins
17:26
beat the underworld gods and then the
17:27
twins became the sun
17:29
and the moon and the world was born and
17:31
everything was fine
17:32
oh that is a good story happy ending
17:35
they worked in pairs right
17:37
the these actual gods as well so it's
17:39
not just the twins who came down but you
17:40
would always
17:41
so you'd have them working uh to do a
17:44
specific thing so flying scab and
17:45
gathering blood
17:46
uh were two that worked together who
17:48
would sicken people's blood so i'm
17:49
guessing sepsis kind of stuff
17:51
um pus demon and jaundice demon would
17:53
cause bodies to swell up
17:55
bone staff and skull staff turned dead
17:58
bodies into skeletons uh sweeping demon
18:00
and stabbing demon
18:01
hide in the unswept areas of people's
18:04
houses and stabbed them to death
18:06
that's a quite a specific one
18:09
if you're sorry if your house is so
18:12
unswept
18:12
that can conceal a big enough demon to
18:15
stab you to death
18:16
i almost think you deserve to die for
18:18
bad housekeeping
18:19
but i think these gods were in some ways
18:22
metaphors for overcoming illness and
18:23
death and i wonder if there's a slight
18:25
hygiene message in sweeping's demon and
18:28
stabbing demon
18:29
i don't know but this was all oral
18:31
tradition until the 16th century when it
18:33
was first written down
18:35
so there might be some some i think it
18:37
must be right it must be like people
18:39
telling their kids you better
18:40
sweep the corners properly otherwise
18:42
you're going to get stabbed to death
18:46
that's what my mum always told me yeah
18:49
i i now look in the corners every night
18:51
six times
18:53
what happens though if you're away on
18:55
holiday you come back there's a big lot
18:56
of dust in the corner who are you
18:58
sending in
19:00
to deal with that who's the least
19:02
favorite kid in the family
19:04
sorry dan you i feel like you had a last
19:06
pair
19:07
i did um they're called wing and pack
19:09
strap um
19:11
so not great names you know you had a
19:13
really strong theme going and then
19:14
pack strap do you know anything about
19:16
them they cause people to die coughing
19:18
up blood while they're out walking on a
19:19
road
19:20
oh so what's the public health message
19:22
there don't leave your house
19:23
yeah don't leave your house um one
19:25
famous thing about the mayans
19:27
is that they predicted the world was
19:29
going to end in 2012.
19:30
oh yeah supposedly oh that's what a lot
19:32
of people thought right
19:34
so this is um the fact that the main
19:37
calendar has
19:38
a thing called a back turn which is 20
19:41
cycles of their calendar
19:43
and it's equal to 394
19:46
years and there had been 13 of them
19:49
since the start of the calendar
19:50
the particular calendar and we were
19:52
getting to the end of that cycle
19:53
okay because after 13 they would start
19:55
again and so people thought that oh
19:57
that means the world's going to end
19:59
because previous times that had happened
20:01
the world had ended according to mayan
20:03
mythology
20:04
but we only have one text which refers
20:07
to the end of
20:07
that back turn which was in 2012 and it
20:10
said that
20:11
it will be the display of bologna that's
20:15
what would happen
20:15
on the 21st of december 2012 and we all
20:18
remember that right
20:20
well i looked into bologna i looked into
20:23
him and we don't really know much about
20:24
him
20:25
we don't really know who he is it seems
20:27
like he might be the god of the nine
20:28
steps
20:30
um and so what i thought it might be
20:33
referring to
20:34
is on the date of the end of the world
20:37
that was the day that gangnam style by
20:39
sai was the first video to reach 1
20:41
billion views on youtube
20:43
so that is going from 999 million 999
20:47
999 up to a billion so that's like the
20:50
nine steps
20:51
if you get what i mean and this is the
20:53
great the great display of the god of
20:55
nine steps was clicking up from nine
20:58
nine nine nine
20:59
to one billion so i think that might
21:01
have been what they were predicting the
21:03
mayans
21:04
you have blown this wide open the
21:07
lengths you'll go through to prove the
21:08
mayan's right
21:12
there was a lot of um a lot of people
21:14
did genuinely get concerned that they
21:16
were correct in their prediction in the
21:18
lead up to 2012
21:20
so there was an ipsos poll which is a
21:21
sort of global um
21:23
poll taking company and they they pulled
21:25
16 000 adults in 21 countries
21:27
they found that 8 of them had an anxiety
21:30
or fear over the fact that it was gonna
21:32
be
21:33
true that it was gonna end um and in one
21:36
case
21:37
one sort of quite highly publicized case
21:39
two reality stars who were together
21:41
heidi montag and spencer pratt who
21:44
were from the hills in america so it was
21:46
a massive reality tv show back in the
21:48
day
21:48
they got so rich off the back of
21:49
subsequent things that they managed to
21:51
do
21:52
from their publicity on that show that
21:53
they wrapped up 10 million american
21:55
dollars
21:56
but they thought the world was going to
21:57
end so they spent it all
21:59
before it got to 2012. what did they
22:02
spend it on do we know oh
22:03
um they yeah it was random stuff so they
22:05
just started leading a very extravagant
22:07
lifestyle so he said i would give my
22:08
friends fifteen thousand dollars for
22:10
their birthday just cash i would
22:12
buy people cars every valet i met i gave
22:14
them a couple hundred pounds tip i would
22:16
pay
22:16
people 200 just to open doors for us
22:20
um and uh yeah so he said here's some
22:22
advice definitely do not spend your
22:24
money
22:24
thinking asteroids are coming the world
22:26
did not end
22:27
they lost valuable advice how ironic
22:30
that two reality stars had
22:32
not a single grip on reality whatsoever
22:40
okay and it's time for fact number three
22:42
and that is
22:43
andy my fact is that in pre-industrial
22:46
sweden
22:47
some people used slugs as grease to
22:49
lubricate their cartwheels
22:51
um so this is all based on a paper that
22:54
was published in the journal of
22:55
ethnobiology
22:56
and it's titled black slugs as greece
22:59
and it was quite a recent paper
23:01
as to describe this old custom uh that
23:04
goes back to the 18th century is known
23:06
to go back at least
23:06
then i'm sure it goes back further um
23:09
it's by ingrass fanberg from uppsala
23:11
university
23:12
and people would sometimes use other
23:15
methods they would use
23:17
tar they would mix in lard from swine or
23:20
or fat from boiled animals feet uh so
23:22
none of these methods of lubricating
23:24
your cart axles are
23:25
especially uh nice sounding but
23:28
sometimes you would not have those
23:30
things available
23:31
and you would need to cast around and
23:33
pick up a slug
23:34
and some wagons actually had a slug tub
23:36
hanging behind them
23:38
uh well you if you just put it just hop
23:41
in a sludge
23:41
shove another slug on the wheel is that
23:43
what they did yeah basically and you
23:45
just this poor slug you just have to
23:46
mash it up basically
23:48
because they're so slimy that they
23:49
produce excellent lubrication between
23:51
the uh between the wheels and the axle
23:53
oh right yeah yeah so they did mash them
23:55
up because i thought they could do it
23:56
where they just put a slug on a wheel
23:58
and they leave it to crawl around the
23:59
whole wheel
24:00
absolutely oh that's a really good
24:02
sustainable way of doing it isn't it
24:05
pop it back in the tub yeah you're right
24:08
yeah no i wish that would be the
24:09
children's book version of this story
24:11
anna
24:13
this paper was a way of trying to use
24:16
popular ethnology because they put out
24:19
an appeal on radio to say have you ever
24:20
heard of this have you done it
24:22
and it turns out it was done into the
24:23
1940s and people listened to this radio
24:26
show in sweden
24:27
they phoned in yeah and all over
24:29
northern europe as well
24:30
including colchester in essex
24:33
no yeah there was someone who wrote in
24:36
from colchester
24:37
and said that in the 1970s children who
24:40
lived near a railway line would go to
24:42
the railway line and gather slugs and
24:43
sell them to the workforce on the trains
24:46
so they had something to lubricate
24:47
workout wheels no
24:49
that's right it's in this paper
24:53
this is this place that's the workforce
24:54
being kind to the kids that's the
24:56
workplace going oh yeah that's so
24:58
helpful thanks so much and then using
25:01
their industrial lubricant
25:03
apparently yeah apparently there was a
25:05
um
25:06
there was a rumor in denmark that german
25:08
glassblowers
25:09
would use black slugs to smear on their
25:11
frying pans when they made pancakes
25:13
instead of using oil so yeah this is
25:17
is that is that a sick burn on the
25:19
german glass blowers
25:20
it's hard to tell isn't it cheap yeah
25:23
they said that they used bachelored or
25:25
bacon rind or they used
25:26
slugs if they couldn't get any of those
25:28
bachelored i mean bachelor does sound
25:30
harder to get hold of than a slug it
25:33
does
25:34
it does sound like it could appear in a
25:36
high quality restaurant now i can really
25:38
imagine it being a michelin london
25:39
restaurant
25:40
with yes pancakes with baja lard and
25:43
slugs
25:44
there were some um there were some
25:47
places oh it's nordic countries as well
25:49
actually children would sing rhymes to
25:50
slugs
25:51
does that help them produce more slime i
25:53
don't think so i can't remember what i
25:55
can't remember can we hear one of the
25:56
rhymes
25:57
no i've forgotten it and i'm definitely
25:59
not going to look it up so that i can
26:00
you forgot it when you committed it to
26:02
memory
26:04
at some point shall i tell you shall i
26:06
do it oh yeah
26:08
i'm certain my pronunciation will be
26:09
terrible but this is just reading it
26:11
as it looks so sneagle sneagle snorray
26:15
rak ut nala ngahon
26:18
saka dufa n skapa khan hem til dina
26:25
and that means snail snail snot
26:28
reach out your long harms and you will
26:30
receive a bushel of barley
26:32
to take home to your kids your kids in
26:34
the nestle
26:38
isn't it so then they'd give this nails
26:40
a bushel of barley
26:41
i think it was just it was just nursery
26:44
rhyme
26:46
the extra detail at the end the kids in
26:48
the nest so you give it to your kids
26:50
the kids in the nest yeah it's a sort of
26:53
i know where you live
26:54
kind of statement wow i didn't think it
26:56
was quite that worried it feels
26:57
aggressive to me the slugs make nests i
26:59
don't think these children know what's
27:00
going on
27:04
so many holes in these rides yeah
27:08
slugs are very um right hand side
27:11
centric
27:11
so all the all the that's really
27:13
important to them in fact is on the
27:14
right hand side they've got their
27:16
breathing hole
27:16
which is the pneumostome which is if you
27:18
look at a slug you can see it's so cool
27:20
it's just like a big gaping
27:22
what looks like a wound in their head
27:23
which is what they breathe through
27:25
but they also have their genitals i
27:28
think their anus and their genitals
27:30
are towards the front of their body
27:31
because they evolved from snails and
27:34
snails have to have all of that stuff
27:36
at the front because if it's stuck in
27:37
their shell you're just pulling in your
27:38
own shell
27:39
and so they've got their anus and their
27:41
genitals at the front all on the right
27:42
hand side as well
27:43
but i think that would be a really
27:45
exciting plot point the right
27:47
everything being on the right-hand side
27:48
thing if you had let's say a slug
27:49
hospital drama
27:50
and you've got this slug spouse turning
27:53
up and
27:54
you know the doctor slug says i'm so
27:56
sorry mrs slug
27:57
one half of her husband's body was
27:59
completely obliterated by the accident
28:04
which half was obliterated the left half
28:07
oh well that's fine
28:08
and then you know there's stephanie
28:10
there which half and then the credits
28:12
rule i love it
28:14
anna though surely there must be some
28:16
use to the other half the slug otherwise
28:18
all slugs would evolve into being half a
28:20
slug that's true that's absolutely well
28:22
maybe they're half
28:23
they're on the way there you know in a
28:25
million years time slugs will only be
28:26
half a slug and everyone will always say
28:28
i wonder where the other half is
28:32
you know some slugs eat birds oh come on
28:35
no nature's reversed itself they're
28:37
eating bugs
28:38
it's actually a bit of a problem i think
28:40
researchers in poland were the first
28:41
ones to discover this
28:43
and they looked in bird's nests where
28:45
there are little chicks
28:46
uh being you know nestlings and they saw
28:49
a slug there
28:50
they were like no worries just a slug
28:51
the mum will probably eat it came back a
28:53
few days later
28:54
and the birds had been eaten and it
28:56
turns out the slugs will gnaw away
28:58
at little chicks in nests and the
29:00
mothers don't even stop them from doing
29:02
it because
29:03
well we think they haven't really
29:04
evolved this defense mechanism yet
29:06
because it doesn't happen often enough
29:07
that they've evolved
29:08
so they just watch these slugs nor away
29:11
using their radula which is their tongue
29:13
which is covered in little teeth
29:14
and they eat the little birds alive i
29:17
have to say
29:18
the fact that it doesn't happen very
29:19
often is not an excuse
29:21
for the bird mum i would say if that
29:22
happened once that requires intervention
29:25
i agree i think that's evolution going
29:27
wrong if you don't automatically know if
29:29
you see a slug eating your baby
29:31
you should stop it happening what i
29:33
think is quite interesting is that this
29:34
uh nursery rhyme said bachelor valley to
29:37
take home to your kids
29:38
kids in the nest it doesn't say kids in
29:41
your nest
29:42
so maybe these children in denmark they
29:44
knew about this kind of behavior of
29:46
slugs
29:48
this is like the time you proved the
29:49
mayans right earlier
29:54
so slugs used for lubricants lots of
29:56
other things have been used for
29:58
lubricants in the past haven't they
29:59
uh seaweed used by people in japan for
30:03
thousands of years if you get red
30:05
seaweed and boil it up it gives you this
30:07
liquid called
30:08
carrageenan and it's extremely
30:10
gelatinous and slippery and it's been
30:12
used as lubricant for
30:14
forever james are you talking about
30:16
tribology here
30:18
uh am i i think you are so tropology is
30:21
the science
30:22
of friction and lubrication and it is
30:24
such a recent science that it was only
30:26
named in 1966
30:29
wow but it covers basically everything
30:32
everything you can imagine all
30:33
mechanical processes have
30:36
friction and lubrication elements in
30:37
them um
30:39
so there's geotribology which is about
30:41
tectonic plates and glaciers there's
30:43
nano tribology which is in
30:44
you know computer disk storage there's
30:46
bio tribology which is hip joints and
30:48
how they work and how
30:50
you know replacement hips can stay
30:51
working for longer and everything
30:53
and we met a tribologist when we were in
30:55
vienna you know what i was just about to
30:57
ask that was he
30:58
was he not the guy who said he coined
31:00
the word tribology
31:01
well i've come across different accounts
31:03
of who coined it i've heard that
31:05
a guy called peter jost also did but we
31:07
met friedrich franek who is a senior
31:09
tribologist
31:10
in vienna and he was great yeah kept
31:13
slipping over didn't he
31:17
yeah but his cart his cart outside was
31:20
so
31:20
well oiled
31:24
um that's amazing well i believe him
31:26
he's our friend
31:28
yeah yeah let's go with him all right i
31:29
think that's how loyalty works
31:31
um i was reading about nose grease do
31:34
you know about this
31:35
no so the oiliest and greasiest bit
31:38
on the human body is the little bit
31:40
that's connected between the nose and
31:42
the face
31:43
and it's it's got so many uses
31:45
observatories with telescopes would use
31:47
it
31:47
to sort of minimize the scratches
31:50
on the surfaces of the telescope it
31:52
would be really effective for that
31:54
and if you ever have a beer this is just
31:55
for a tip next time you have a pint of
31:57
beer if the head of the beer is too much
32:00
you can take your nose grease and you
32:01
can stir it into the head
32:03
and it will melt and it will make it'll
32:05
dissipate
32:06
that really quickly not yet because i
32:09
read it this morning and i thought it
32:10
might be
32:11
um so we read once on qi
32:14
that if you take ear wax and put it into
32:16
beer
32:17
then that will also make the bubbles go
32:19
away and we were going to do it on the
32:21
show but no one thought to try it
32:23
and then on the day of recording we
32:24
actually got some beer and we thought in
32:26
rehearsal let's just quickly try it to
32:28
make sure it works and it really did not
32:29
work
32:30
it didn't work just ended up with bubbly
32:32
earwaxy beer
32:34
oh well dan i can't wait to go out for a
32:37
nice pint
32:37
all of us when this is all over and just
32:40
see you
32:41
rubbing your nose into your glass
32:44
i'm not going to put my actual nose at
32:45
the glass
32:47
cut out the middleman of the finger
32:52
i don't think we produce enough grease
32:54
do we on i'm
32:55
we're all stroking this bit of our nose
32:56
i can see you're all doing the same as
32:58
me sorry so this is the bit of your nose
32:59
wait because dan when you said between
33:00
the nose and the face i thought you
33:02
meant on the inside
33:03
i couldn't work out what you meant but
33:04
you mean the the outer bit
33:06
below your eyes i think it's
33:08
specifically the bit
33:10
between like let's say your cheeks and
33:12
your nostrils
33:13
like that little the little indentation
33:15
the side
33:16
the side bits of your nose yeah those
33:18
are greasy bits yeah
33:20
it's very soft actually i've never
33:21
noticed before but it is quite soft but
33:22
i still don't think it is enough to be
33:24
stirring usefully into anything
33:26
for culinary purposes i think if you've
33:28
got a telescope and a tiny little
33:30
aperture then i can see it might be
33:31
useful for that
33:32
but if you're going to do it for a pint
33:34
you're probably going to have to go
33:35
around the whole pub
33:36
getting bits with everyone's nose to
33:38
give you anything
33:40
by coincidence i have these two things
33:42
next to me this is really a coincidence
33:44
but i could test it out oh you could
33:45
test
33:46
a beer and a glass and there's no way
33:47
we're not going to demand
33:51
it's it alcohol though so i don't know
33:53
if that might not produce a head
33:55
yep oh there we go
34:00
get my nose okay so
34:03
here's the beer just poured it in
34:07
here's my nose oh this all stacks up so
34:10
far
34:11
oh yeah so uh wow look at all my solving
34:16
immediately
34:18
look at that oh look at that it is
34:20
disappearing this is a good tip if
34:22
you're a barman and you ever pour a bad
34:23
point just get some grease off your face
34:25
dip your finger in
34:26
okay that actually that is quite
34:28
impressive it is now we do need to see
34:30
it with a control where you're not using
34:31
the grease
34:33
yeah maybe next week yes next week's pod
34:36
yeah
34:36
tune in cool that was good nice yeah
34:38
well done though good experiment
34:40
well i've got i've got one more fact if
34:43
we have time for one more on this one
34:46
um so i just read a story that happened
34:48
in 2002
34:49
about a case of um greece uh causing a
34:52
lawsuit
34:53
so a man sued a pub for slipping on pork
34:55
chop grease
34:57
um his name was troy borin and the story
34:59
says
35:00
a man slit a man who slipped on a trail
35:02
of grease left on a pub floor by a
35:04
patron wearing pork chops on his feet
35:06
was awarded more than 23 000 pounds
35:09
yesterday by an australian court
35:12
um so many questions yep troy borin he
35:16
broke his arm he was at the janely inn
35:18
in south sydney and um this was back in
35:21
1997 that the incident actually happened
35:24
and uh basically what happened was
35:26
another guy there called ross
35:28
lucoc had won the meat the pork chops
35:31
in a uh raffle and a pub rathful but
35:34
then the pub
35:35
refused him service at the bar because
35:37
he was barefoot
35:38
so he returned a short time later with
35:40
the chops strapped to his feet
35:43
and walked around everywhere even
35:44
playing pool in the pub
35:46
and um poor old troy borin was then
35:49
walking along
35:50
and they hadn't cleaned away the grease
35:51
left behind and slipped on it and
35:52
successfully sued both the pub
35:54
and the man wearing the pork chops on
35:56
his face this guy was australian you
35:57
said wow
35:58
[Laughter]
36:04
okay it's time for our final fact of the
36:05
show and that is my fact
36:07
my fact is in 2019 69 pilgrims made a
36:11
journey from the cern abbess
36:13
giant which is that nude chalk man
36:15
that's carved into the hillside in
36:17
england
36:18
to cern in geneva or as they put it
36:21
from the large hard on to the large
36:23
hadron
36:25
so this was a pilgrimage that happened
36:27
april last year
36:28
uh 69 pilgrims got on a double decker
36:31
bus after starting a sort of
36:33
pagan druid style ritual at the cern
36:36
abbas giant
36:37
they went through italy and stayed in a
36:39
place called damanhur
36:40
which is a community that's up there and
36:42
then they went through
36:44
to switzerland where they ended up at
36:46
the cern
36:47
large hadron collider and they performed
36:50
another
36:51
bizarre pagan ritual there they wanted
36:54
to imminentize the eschaton which is the
36:56
idea is that they wanted to bring
36:58
the beauty of the after world into the
37:00
current
37:01
world so heaven basically brought into
37:03
the world that was all very interesting
37:05
down but the main bit i got from that is
37:07
that they went from
37:08
england to geneva and went through italy
37:10
that's not
37:11
it's not on the way it sounds like more
37:13
of a jolly than a pilgrimage
37:18
i think you're right most pilgrimages
37:20
aren't on a double-decker
37:23
but yeah so this was done by someone
37:25
called daisy campbell and it was told to
37:27
me by a friend of
37:28
fish dr david bramwell who is a author
37:31
and he was actually part
37:33
of the group of 69 pilgrims except that
37:36
he didn't go with them but he was one of
37:38
the 69
37:39
he was at the serene giant wow so we
37:41
know that not all of them were there
37:43
yeah i'm guessing so 69 feels like it's
37:46
a crucial number though or was that just
37:48
happy
37:48
coincidence you know because no
37:50
intentional i guess i guess you're right
37:51
maybe he was number 70
37:53
and uh i'm pretty sure though he said he
37:55
was 69.
37:56
yeah if he's number 70 it ruins the joke
37:58
so yeah can't go
37:59
yeah we should say they were doing it
38:01
for a joke right so they
38:02
they are quite funny and when you read
38:04
the write-up it's obviously a very
38:06
humorous thing they're doing
38:07
this pagan thing um yes and they call
38:10
themselves discordians which is a sort
38:12
of faux
38:12
pseudo-religion started in the 60s and
38:15
it's sort of based around
38:17
chaos and like chaos is as important as
38:19
order and stuff like that right
38:21
absolutely yeah and but they are a lot
38:24
of people who
38:25
are druids do it and they do they do buy
38:28
into a lot of
38:29
magic and folk um but yes it's all done
38:32
with a great
38:33
tongue and cheekiness about it yeah can
38:34
we just quickly mention this place that
38:36
they visited in italy because it's
38:37
incredible
38:38
i've never heard of this dam and her but
38:41
grandma's been there before hasn't he
38:44
yes he has yeah
38:45
many times i want to go it's an
38:48
extraordinary place it's
38:49
a um it's a community that was set up by
38:52
this one guy
38:53
who claimed that he was the
38:55
pre-incarnation
38:56
of an alien from the future so the idea
38:59
is that there was
39:00
a panel of aliens talking in the future
39:02
about the destruction of planet earth
39:03
and they pinpointed it to the fact that
39:05
earth
39:06
lost its way in life and became a very
39:07
negative place and destroyed itself
39:09
so he thought i'm going to stop that
39:10
yeah james uh it's just andy's looking
39:12
quite skeptical about this story
39:14
yeah a little bit well wait till wait
39:16
till you hear where it goes andy
39:17
[Laughter]
39:19
reveals so so he pre pre-incarnated by
39:23
thousands of thousands of years and
39:24
landed himself in the italian hills
39:27
and he set up this community and they
39:30
they decided under the cover of darkness
39:32
to build a temple
39:33
to time travel that would help save
39:36
humanity
39:37
using just their hands largely to begin
39:39
with and then eventually drills
39:41
and to look at pictures of it highly
39:42
recommend it look at damon here yeah
39:44
it's one of the most beautiful things
39:45
you'll ever see it's
39:47
so this is aside from that it's
39:49
obviously just a bunch of crazy people
39:51
but
39:51
these temples are unbelievable and they
39:53
kept it secret for 15 years didn't they
39:55
so this little community in italy
39:57
digging a hundred feet underground under
40:00
a mountain
40:00
and it was only in 1992 when someone
40:03
reported them to the police
40:04
and the police went and to be fair to
40:06
the police the police said
40:08
oh you've made some really really nice
40:09
huge temples inside a mountain
40:11
good on you let's open it up to the
40:13
public i'm just thinking that when they
40:15
were digging into this mountain in
40:16
northern italy did they not come across
40:18
the 100 000
40:19
apples that are in there
40:23
just as one more call back to last week
40:25
yeah
40:28
so they pitched up there they uh they
40:29
saw the temples and then they
40:31
went on to cern into yeah i don't
40:34
understand anything that's been said in
40:35
the last five minutes
40:38
well let's talk about the chalk have a
40:40
shitload so the cern abbas giant we
40:43
should say is 180 foot
40:44
tall naked man with a club and he has an
40:47
absolutely enormous penis
40:50
yes is that fair to say didn't always
40:52
used to be as big
40:53
no that was i know this is the crazy
40:55
thing this is the um
40:57
sort of area 51 of britain is this chalk
41:00
giant's penis
41:01
which used to be tiny no it used to be
41:04
normal sized
41:05
it was a normal 12 foot long piece it
41:07
was 16 feet long which is a normal size
41:10
for a giant that size so basically
41:13
he was like he was 200 feet tall and he
41:16
had a 200 inch penis so it's the same as
41:19
a six foot tall
41:20
man having a six inch penis so it's you
41:22
know it's a completely normal size
41:24
but then in 1908 chalk cutters merged
41:28
his penis with his belly button
41:30
and made it um seven feet longer which
41:32
now makes it look completely out of
41:34
proportion
41:36
now if that wasn't a chalk gutter trying
41:37
to compensate for something
41:39
i don't know why the phrase compensating
41:40
for something was over invented
41:43
but do you know who found out about this
41:45
um this disturbance because
41:47
it's it's been described to a few
41:49
different people some people say it was
41:50
done in the 50s by contractors and other
41:52
people blah blah blah
41:54
um or locals did it but rodney castleton
41:57
is a kind of freelance archaeologist and
41:59
he developed a system of working out
42:01
where the soil had been disturbed and he
42:04
said i've made a trial run
42:05
down the phallus and obtained electrical
42:07
measurements indicating a joint
42:09
so he worked out that that the penis had
42:11
definitely been
42:12
extended to the former belly button and
42:14
then the national trust who owned the
42:16
site
42:16
they had to decide whether to give the
42:19
certain abyss giant a
42:20
a penis uh penisectomy penis trim
42:24
reduction cut reduction thank you a
42:27
penis reduction
42:28
and they decided not to do it i guess
42:31
because it's been 100 years since it was
42:32
extended and it must be
42:34
that's now what it's like but and also
42:36
because of the adverse pr that it would
42:38
have
42:38
created i think for them yeah it's like
42:41
squatters rights at that point
42:44
yeah they do top it up every 25 years or
42:47
so give it a sort of
42:48
uh makeover um and it's 17
42:52
000 tons of uh chalk that's used
42:55
no it's not 17 what am i talking about
42:58
yeah sorry
42:59
it's 17 tons of chalk that is used 17
43:02
000 very sorry
43:03
um what a penis that would be
43:07
the white cliffs of dover are no more
43:16
yeah every 25 years except for when
43:18
there's problems so they had to give him
43:19
a nose job at one point
43:20
because erosion had been too unkind on
43:22
him so
43:23
maybe he was just trying to deform a
43:25
beer
43:29
did you read dan did you read the report
43:30
of the last uh the last job they did
43:33
because it's volunteers who do it so
43:35
it's you know there are dozens of people
43:37
who go
43:38
and they they trimmed the grass verges
43:40
because obviously it's cut into a chalk
43:42
hillside
43:43
and they interviewed the national trust
43:45
man um
43:46
because some chalk figures have now been
43:49
redone in concrete
43:50
which is obviously easier but actually
43:52
obviously it's not very historical and
43:53
it's a bit uh
43:54
it's a bit lazy and the national trust
43:56
man um
43:58
called martin papworth said i think
44:00
there would be an outcry if we tried to
44:02
cut corners says papworth
44:04
who ironically is here to help cut the
44:06
corners
44:09
that's really good yeah it's high
44:11
quality
44:12
so we don't fully know when this was
44:14
made right we i always assumed this was
44:16
quite ancient but there's a lot of
44:17
suggestion
44:18
that it's um dates from the 17th century
44:20
because that's the first mention that we
44:22
get of it
44:23
and a lot of theories about why it came
44:25
about one is that it was a sort of
44:26
satirical piece
44:28
on oliver cromwell and they believed
44:29
that there were missing bits from it
44:31
there used to be a dismembered head
44:32
at the bottom and a cloak in the other
44:35
arm
44:35
that's not holding the club but no one
44:38
truly knows
44:39
because a lot of sources do claim that
44:40
it's older don't they there was an
44:42
article in the independent that casually
44:43
referred to it as 2 000 years old but
44:46
it seems impossible that this thing
44:49
would have existed
44:50
for 1500 years and no one mentioned it
44:53
until 1694 i mean surely
44:56
someone would have written down at some
44:58
point by the way we've got this massive
45:00
naked man on a hill there's a land
45:01
survey in 1617 that talks about this
45:04
hill
45:04
and doesn't mention the massive
45:05
nakedness and it just
45:07
seems like if you were to buy a house
45:10
and the survey came back and it didn't
45:11
mention there was a massive naked
45:13
man on the side of your house you would
45:15
complain wouldn't you
45:16
yeah you would you would um there is one
45:19
theory
45:19
i've heard and i like this so much so um
45:23
the people of dorset were interviewed
45:24
about it in the 18th century
45:26
and this was a i think a local reverend
45:29
who was a bit of an amateur historian
45:30
taking this record from the locals
45:33
and the people there at the time said
45:35
that it represented a giant
45:38
who had stolen sheep from the people
45:40
living nearby
45:41
uh for his own food and then he'd laying
45:43
down to rest
45:44
in this field and the villagers had
45:47
killed the giant in his sleep
45:48
and then they'd put an outline around
45:50
him meaning
45:52
that the chalk giant would be a literal
45:54
crime scene chalk
45:58
figures
46:00
when you have a murder and you see the
46:02
chalk line on the floor they don't
46:04
put the penis in there to show you how
46:07
long it was today
46:10
for final indignity
46:15
that's brilliant it has been covered up
46:17
for other reasons in the past
46:18
so in the 19th century classic
46:20
victorians they apparently they let
46:22
foliage grow discreetly over the penis
46:24
so you couldn't see the penis in the
46:26
victorian age and then in the war
46:29
we covered up uh the cern giant and all
46:32
of our other chalk hillsides i think
46:34
which if you're listening from abroad
46:35
you should know that england
46:37
the south of england specifically just
46:39
has this weird habit of drawing massive
46:41
chalk figures on hills
46:42
and then come world war ii we had to
46:44
sort of like paint a lot of them green
46:46
or
46:46
cover a lot of them in grass and stuff
46:48
because they're quite obvious
46:49
yeah you didn't want the german bombers
46:51
to be able to use them
46:52
as a navigation like following the
46:55
direction of the penis
46:57
bristol this way
47:06
okay that's it that is all of our facts
47:08
thank you so much for listening
47:10

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from four undisclosed
00:21
locations in the uk my name is dan
00:24
schreiber and i am sitting here with
00:26
andrew hunter murray anna tsujinski and
00:28
james harkin and once again we have
00:30
gathered round the microphones with our
00:32
four favorite facts from the last seven
00:34
days and in no particular order here we
00:36
go
00:37
starting with
00:39
james my fact this week is that hagfish
00:42
can eat by sitting inside their dinner
00:44
and absorbing the nutrients through
00:46
their skin
00:49
isn't that amazing wouldn't that be
00:51
incredible if you could just sit inside
00:53
your curry and just eat the food like
00:54
that there will be some foods that would
00:56
be worse for or messier for god
00:59
if you had to get inside a sausage
01:01
before eating it
01:03
do you think you're very big i think
01:04
it's going to be messy almost whatever
01:07
food you're climbing inside yeah
01:09
i think with a sausage you might just
01:11
rub it against your skin rather than
01:12
climbing you just try to strap the
01:14
sausage to yourself i think so that
01:15
slowly absorb it that's what i would do
01:17
if i was a hacker that's a good idea i'd
01:19
like to see a hack for shaking a sausage
01:20
because they look a bit like a long
01:21
sausage so it'd be like watching a
01:23
sausage sausage
01:26
i should probably explain what a
01:27
hackfish is shouldn't i oh yeah well it
01:30
kind of looks like an eel and it is most
01:34
famous among people on the internet for
01:36
creating loads and loads of slime
01:39
that's what they do basically when
01:40
they're threatened they create this
01:42
incredible amount of slime and it stops
01:44
them from being able to be eaten but the
01:46
way that they eat they have a few
01:48
different ways of eating they can rasp
01:50
things with their tongue they've got
01:51
extremely hard tongues that can rub
01:53
against some meat and bring it into
01:55
their digestive system or they can
01:57
actually just absorb it through their
01:59
skin and actually weirdly enough the
02:01
skin one is a slightly better way of
02:03
them getting nutrients
02:05
bizarre it's better for them to absorb
02:08
food or they can do it faster or more
02:09
effectively they consume more
02:10
efficiently yeah and you know what i
02:12
thought i was thinking about this why
02:13
don't we all just absorb food through
02:15
our skin why do we have it through our
02:17
stomach and i don't know if this is
02:18
right but i did wonder if maybe
02:21
if you eat a sandwich and it goes inside
02:23
your stomach then no one else can get at
02:26
it once it's in your stomach yeah eating
02:28
it but if you sellotaped it to your face
02:30
then someone might be able to come and
02:31
steal it off you so maybe that's one
02:33
reason why it's better to eat stuff
02:35
that's what i was thinking if you were
02:36
sort of sat next to them you could just
02:38
stick your finger in it and like a straw
02:39
just suck at it yeah
02:41
i don't think that's the reason can i
02:42
just say that i don't think that's the
02:44
reason the stomach evolved is it that's
02:45
because people
02:47
i don't think i think it is a size thing
02:49
and that
02:51
so for example some very small organisms
02:53
can absorb oxygen directly through their
02:55
skin even some tiny frogs but larger
02:58
animals have such a large volume in
03:00
relation to the skin area they have that
03:03
it's inefficient for them to do that it
03:04
wouldn't be possible to absorb all the
03:06
so i think humans might need so many
03:08
calories a day that you couldn't absorb
03:11
you know 20 sausages a day through your
03:13
skin you know what i'm going to email ed
03:15
young and ask him because i read this
03:17
fact in an article in the atlantic
03:19
written by ed young and by the way if
03:21
you have like a few hours or a day or a
03:24
week to spare go on the internet and
03:26
search for ed young and read everything
03:28
that he's ever written because he's a
03:29
brilliant science writer oh it's heaven
03:32
to read his articles yeah so true such a
03:34
good shout out go and read that um what
03:36
do they eat by the way is it dead sharks
03:38
or is it
03:39
right in this case yeah and this they
03:42
can eat lots of different things but in
03:43
this case where they're sitting inside
03:45
something has to be something a lot
03:46
bigger than them and so it'll be like
03:49
anna says probably whale carcasses or
03:51
something like that um so they don't
03:52
have a lower jaw that's the other thing
03:54
about them they've only got upper teeth
03:56
because they're quite badly put together
03:58
animals and the only way they can bite
04:00
something is they can tie themselves in
04:02
knots really easily and they tie a knot
04:04
at their tail and then they work the
04:07
knot all the way along their body until
04:09
it gets to where the lower jaw would be
04:11
and that provides a lower surface for
04:13
them to squeeze their upper jaw against
04:15
i mean they're really they're so awkward
04:18
also awkward they also use the knots
04:20
actually for scraping themselves free of
04:22
slime don't they when they eject all
04:24
their slime they knot themselves up and
04:26
they've got a knot at their head and
04:28
they'll pull the knot down to the tail
04:30
to lose the slime it's multi-purpose
04:32
knots the slime is the real headline i
04:34
mean the the absorbing stuff is good but
04:36
the amount of slime that they make is
04:38
incredible it's amazing and the and the
04:40
slime that they produce the way that it
04:41
expands
04:42
at the rate it expands is just insane so
04:45
jung puts in the article that it can
04:47
expand by 10 000 times in the fraction
04:49
of a second and there's been cases of
04:52
that very famous photo actually online
04:54
of a truck of hagfish overturning and
04:57
covering
04:58
an entire car and slime the entire road
05:01
just slime everywhere in a second we
05:04
should say that it's not although the
05:05
main purpose of their slime is so that
05:07
they can go viral on the internet um it
05:09
has a sub purpose of being a very useful
05:13
protective device so basically not a
05:16
single predator with gills is able to
05:19
consume them because they would be quite
05:21
easily consumable otherwise because they
05:22
eject this slime and immediately it
05:24
clogs up all of a predator's gills so if
05:26
you're a shark or something your gills
05:28
are suddenly clogged up you can't
05:30
breathe anymore and we don't know
05:31
there's a lot we don't know about
05:32
hagfish but we don't know if this
05:34
actually kills them because we've seen
05:36
videos of them get clogged up when they
05:38
swim away and then we don't really know
05:40
how they'll get the slime off so they're
05:42
safe from any predators with gills it's
05:45
mostly water the slime isn't it it's
05:47
99.996
05:49
water and each time they release a
05:51
bucket's worth of slime or a jug of
05:53
slime it's only 40 milligrams of actual
05:57
stuff that they are
05:58
giving off from their body mucus and
06:00
proteins there's almost none but it
06:02
reacts so quickly with the water that it
06:04
generates this massive amount otherwise
06:05
it would be the slime they would have to
06:07
have this massive slime tank inside them
06:09
yeah the amount they have inside them is
06:11
extraordinary um in terms of the fibers
06:13
that then turn into the slime so a bit
06:15
sort of two-toned slime production
06:17
equipment they've got these lengths of
06:19
fibers in their body and then they've
06:21
got some mucus and the length of fiber
06:23
in their body the total length is 20 000
06:26
kilometers
06:27
of fiber wow so and it comes in these 15
06:31
centimeter long threads so it's lots of
06:33
these little threads coiled up in these
06:35
tiny little storage boxes inside their
06:37
body so the threat that means that the
06:38
threads are essentially 10 million times
06:41
longer than they are wide i think and
06:43
just coiled up i read one i read one
06:45
explanation of this you might have read
06:47
the same thing anna which is it's the
06:48
same as stuffing one kilometer of
06:51
christmas lights into a shoe box without
06:53
having a single knot or tangle that's
06:56
because the slime glands are so small
06:58
and these threads are so numerous well
07:00
they're big generally the skin on them
07:03
so um there was a study that was done
07:04
that was showing that in a lot of cases
07:07
the slime that they released to
07:08
predators let's say to clog their gills
07:10
is actually released after they're
07:12
bitten and they try to work out how they
07:14
survive after they're bitten and it
07:16
turns out that the metaphor they use is
07:18
basically their skin is like really
07:20
loose pajamas
07:22
like they they're just so flabby with
07:24
extra skin that if you injected them
07:26
with the same volume of stuff that's in
07:28
them you could get 40 percent more of
07:30
them into them before their skin starts
07:32
to stretch
07:33
they are yeah they're like a sausage
07:34
with a very massive skin
07:36
and it's only attached in a few places
07:38
as well it's again so that they can
07:41
avoid being bitten if they get bitten
07:42
the shark is mostly biting skin really
07:45
yeah and they're also they're the
07:46
bloodiest animals on the planet or close
07:49
to it so
07:50
there's 17 milliliters of blood per 100
07:53
grams of mass which is a lot at least
07:56
twice as much as any other fish i think
07:59
and also apparently they maybe have the
08:01
blood because they need something to
08:02
fill the space between their flesh and
08:04
their skin they've just got to put some
08:05
liquid in there so they're like well i
08:07
guess i'll make more blood to fill
08:08
myself up that's so weird it seems so
08:11
inefficient as a fish to have a loose
08:13
set of pajamas on
08:17
um what's going on with their name i
08:19
wonder hagfish because they're not
08:21
they're not witches no no i just wonder
08:23
if there's any link between that and
08:25
hagrid which is a you know that's a word
08:28
for bedevilled by witches isn't it or
08:30
that was the origin of the name hagrid
08:31
yeah i think it's just it goes back to
08:34
the i think 1603 or something is really
08:37
what quite a long time and it is just
08:39
because they thought they were
08:40
although it would have been a worse
08:42
series of books if a giant hagfish had
08:44
turned up and slimed harry potter are
08:46
you choking i don't know
08:49
come on
08:50
a hag fish in harry potter would
08:52
absolutely turn the figure lights
08:54
wouldn't it be brilliant
08:56
it does seem like a missed opportunity
08:58
for a great superhero
09:00
the hagfish just i can't believe i mean
09:02
it's amazing that this is the one fish
09:04
that nothing can eat no no anything
09:06
without gills can eat it yeah oh of
09:08
course you can eat it happily of course
09:10
south koreans can eat it they obviously
09:12
lack gills that's one of the first
09:14
things everyone knows about people in
09:15
south korea
09:16
yeah they're hugely popular they eat
09:17
about is it five million pounds of
09:19
hagfish meat every year wow and you get
09:22
hagfish wallets you do don't you those
09:24
are very useful adaptation because
09:26
obviously if someone tries to mug you it
09:27
immediately sweats this gloop and the
09:30
mugger is unable to actually grip your
09:32
wallet very handy
09:34
it's called it's eel leather isn't it i
09:36
think
09:37
that's right um so if you've got
09:38
anything that's eel skin leather it's
09:39
actually hog and apparently i read
09:42
somewhere that it's sort of a more
09:43
ethical alternative to actual leather i
09:46
think on the ethical hierarchy maybe it
09:49
sort of was more ethical to get some
09:50
hagfish than
09:52
some cow or whatever but there you go
09:54
if you think that's more ethical you
09:56
should have a hagfish wallet it sounds
09:58
like you don't think it's more ethical i
09:59
cover made up my mind andy i don't have
10:01
an opinion we just present the facts and
10:03
we let other people draw their
10:04
conclusions
10:06
does anyone know how hag fish have sex
10:09
oh
10:10
do they tie themselves in not uh
10:11
actually anna's right nobody knows
10:14
so that was the question does anyone
10:16
know how long cagfish live
10:18
no seven years no again again nobody
10:21
knows how long hagfish live
10:24
and does anyone know why 90 of them
10:27
appear to be female another no it's
10:29
crazy
10:30
no it's a no yeah but isn't that
10:32
interesting like of all the had fish
10:33
that we've caught 90 of them are female
10:35
and we don't really know why it might be
10:37
that 90 of them are female or it might
10:40
be that the females are easier to catch
10:41
we don't really know
10:43
all that they're all hermaphrodites but
10:45
when they sense they're about to be
10:46
caught they throw away their penises
10:48
that's equally well i mean it's all you
10:50
know it's not equally likely
10:53
have you so supposedly is it really hard
10:56
to find their eggs and i think this is a
10:58
bit like do you remember we talked about
10:59
eels and how hard it is to find their
11:01
gonads but
11:03
supposedly in the 20th century
11:05
scientists found a total of three
11:06
hagfish embryos and that was it because
11:09
they live really deep down before that
11:11
there was one man called bashford dean
11:14
and in 1896 he found 800 eggs including
11:18
150 embryos
11:20
and he is the kind of hero of hagfish
11:22
research but he had two main interests
11:25
in life one of them was hagfish and
11:27
zoology and the other was uh armor
11:29
military armor right and and when he
11:31
wasn't collecting hagfish embryos he was
11:34
obsessed with collecting medieval armor
11:36
he started bidding in auctions age nine
11:39
for medieval stuff and anyway he became
11:42
he was getting too much pocket money if
11:44
that was the age of bidding he did get
11:46
outbid he got outbid in his first few
11:47
but he he was he became a museum curator
11:50
and was immensely um well regarded in
11:52
his field and then the first world war
11:54
happened and absolutely
11:56
all the work he'd done over his life
11:58
paid off because he started designing
12:00
helmets based on medieval
12:02
military armor because the us army
12:04
needed a metal helmet basically that
12:06
would stop bullets and he designed
12:08
several prototypes one of them was
12:10
designed exactly on a 15th century
12:12
italian knights helmet so it looks like
12:14
a proper full face visor with a tiny
12:17
slit for the eyes and that was being
12:18
built in the 20th century because of
12:20
bashfuddine so we used medieval helmet
12:22
designs for the first world war because
12:24
i thought we'd moved on from then well
12:26
it was for people that that particular
12:28
one was for people who were in a forward
12:30
position say they were an extremely
12:31
dangerous environment and they needed
12:33
lots of protection for a short space of
12:34
time because it was so heavy this helmet
12:38
the helmet weighed six kilos alone sorry
12:40
can i just ask when you say he found his
12:42
10 million embryos or whatever and we've
12:44
only ever found three where are we
12:46
finding them was it no sotheby's when he
12:48
was 10 years
12:50
old um where he
12:53
support the story is that he collected
12:54
them from fishermen who had been
12:55
dangling lines with bait on them and i
12:58
don't know why that couldn't then be
13:00
just done again but they we think maybe
13:02
they hide their eggs on the floor of the
13:04
ocean or that yeah so there are lots of
13:06
theories
13:07
do you guys know the u.s navy's been
13:09
experimenting with hagfish in warfare
13:12
mmm what's it well for the slime thing
13:14
or are they getting nutrients for the
13:16
slime thing all right so they're not
13:17
getting the soldiers to climb inside a
13:20
whale cops
13:21
no not not that yet i'm sure that's on
13:23
the cards though they have been trying
13:25
to use the slime as a non-lethal way of
13:28
stopping these boats and destroying them
13:30
by chucking it at the propellers of the
13:31
boats so if you can slime up the
13:34
propellers you would stop their rotors
13:36
from turning and and you would disable
13:37
the ship entirely and are they going to
13:39
extract the slime from hanford
13:41
separately or do you just get a big tub
13:42
of fish and then chuck it at the end
13:44
you feel it yeah you feel like that
13:46
could be just that right like it's they
13:48
produce so much but no i think they're
13:50
synthesizing it i think they're turning
13:52
it into something um yeah what they do
13:53
is they put the genes that create
13:55
hagfish slime into e coli bacteria and
13:58
then the bacteria can create the slime
14:00
themselves so you can do it on a larger
14:02
sort of manufacturing scale seriously
14:04
yeah nice that feels and without
14:06
scraping thousands of pack fish off the
14:08
floor of the ocean i suppose it's more
14:10
ethical i would say it's pretty much
14:12
ethical yeah the bacteria don't think so
14:13
james no you're right who will speak for
14:16
the bacteria if not alexinski the
14:18
bacteria's friend
14:19
[Laughter]
14:23
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:25
that is my fact my fact this week is
14:27
that 1982's time person of the year was
14:30
the personal computer the article
14:33
announcing it was written on a
14:35
typewriter
14:36
very bizarre yeah so this is uh
14:39
obviously time had the tradition of
14:40
doing person of the year and this was
14:42
the first year in which they did machine
14:43
of the year they stepped away from
14:45
person of the year and they gave it to
14:47
the computer but the time officers in
14:49
1982 were still running almost entirely
14:52
on typewriters they wouldn't upgrade
14:54
their systems for another year so they
14:56
were behind the times with their own
14:58
person of the year
15:00
um was it do we think it was a hint to
15:02
the owners you know making it
15:05
guys we still don't have one of these
15:07
okay
15:08
the article was quite interesting
15:10
because it referenced apple's first
15:12
personal computer which was called lisa
15:14
but steve jobs was really annoyed about
15:16
it and that's because he expected to be
15:18
named person of the year that year and
15:20
so he was really annoyed that the
15:22
computer got his title and he was also
15:24
annoyed because it said that he had a
15:26
daughter named lisa but he denied
15:28
paternity of that daughter so he was
15:30
just ultra pissed off with that he was
15:32
really bad in that article steve jobs
15:34
the way he denied the paternity he said
15:36
that 28 of the male population of the
15:38
united states could be the father of
15:40
this child seems unlikely though they
15:42
have just seen them like
15:44
why did he say that he took a paternity
15:46
test which showed that there was 94
15:49
percent chance that it was his case oh i
15:51
see because the way that you said it
15:53
sounded like he was being unbelievably
15:54
misogynistic about his ex-partner saying
15:57
that that's true slept with
15:59
like pretty much every sexually active
16:01
man in the entire country that's so true
16:03
i should have yeah i should have
16:05
qualified that that's absolutely what i
16:06
took it out but that's not necessarily a
16:08
negative that's actually incredibly
16:09
impressive if that's what he meant
16:12
so time person of the year is an
16:13
interesting concept and also has not
16:16
been timed personally here for very long
16:17
so in fact at this time when it was time
16:19
computer of the year it wasn't replacing
16:21
the time person of the year tradition it
16:23
was time man of the year so it only got
16:25
changed to time person of the year i
16:27
think in 1999
16:28
before that it was always time man of
16:30
the year except we should say three
16:33
crucial occasions since the 1920s when
16:36
an individual woman got time woman of
16:38
the year so wallace simpson got it 1936
16:41
um and that was obviously because she
16:43
shagged up shag ducking and then in 1981
16:46
it was that woman who had sex with 100
16:47
million men in america wasn't it
16:50
yeah
16:51
we were just so impressed
16:54
between 1927 and 1999 when they changed
16:57
it to person of the year individual
16:59
women won it the same number of times as
17:01
franklin d roosevelt the u.s president
17:04
wow yeah that was which was three it was
17:06
yeah it was it was queen elizabeth as
17:09
you say wallace simpson and the
17:10
president of the philippines but it's
17:12
not always good to get you know
17:14
if you get it doesn't mean it's a mark
17:16
of high standards no no and i think the
17:18
point is because i think people have
17:20
said this is a sexist award and it's not
17:22
time magazine is just reflecting who has
17:23
power and influence and what it
17:26
reflected was that women had no power
17:28
and influence and shamefully the third
17:31
person who got it was corazon aquino who
17:33
was president of the philippines who i
17:35
knew nothing about but who was a
17:38
definite good guy in what she did she
17:39
overthrew
17:40
ferdinand marcos established kind of
17:42
democracy in the philippines or tried to
17:44
and she got it in
17:45
1986 but it it's a bad thing in that it
17:50
shows what a i guess still mailed
17:53
um world we live in yeah so 1998 which
17:57
is i guess the final year where it was
17:59
man of the year it was given to two men
18:01
uh which was bill clinton and ken starr
18:04
and clinton not for good reasons it was
18:06
for his role in the clinton impeachment
18:08
but the thing is is that in theory it
18:10
should have gone to someone very
18:12
different that year because they held
18:14
their first online poll where they asked
18:16
members of the public who do you think
18:18
should be the man of the year and the
18:20
winner with over 50 of the votes was a
18:23
wwf wrestler called mick foley
18:26
who plays a character called mankind who
18:28
wears mr socco a sock puppet on his hand
18:30
and throws himself off high cages he got
18:33
50 of the vote um but he was then pulled
18:35
from the pole and they gave it to
18:37
someone else but it turns out that the
18:39
poll doesn't reflect who they give it to
18:40
anyway it's it's a useless poll sure
18:42
that's what they claimed after the poll
18:44
when he won it we were never gonna make
18:46
this decide yeah that's so funny that
18:48
should have been the warning about
18:49
donald trump shouldn't it that long ago
18:52
and democracy the inevitable decline of
18:54
democracy that we're seeing today when
18:55
people are voting for a wwf wrestler no
18:58
offense i know you like wwf yeah mick
19:00
foley's amazing i think it was when um
19:02
bell and sebastian won a brit award for
19:04
best newcomer instead of steps and that
19:06
was done by the public i think that was
19:08
when it all went wrong well look we've
19:10
all got our moments where the rocks set
19:11
in in our opinion
19:13
you know
19:14
we can all disagree it's bad um
19:17
you mentioned donald trump because he's
19:18
obviously got loads of history with time
19:19
magazine so
19:21
he was told off by time magazine for
19:23
making up his own
19:24
time magazine cover and putting it on
19:26
the wall of his golf club the magazine
19:29
pointed out look the date that you've
19:30
put on this fake magazine kate winslet
19:32
was actually on the cover and trump has
19:34
also claimed that he's been on the cover
19:35
more times than anybody else which is
19:37
not true this is not person of the year
19:39
it's just the cover of the magazine but
19:41
it is a u.s president who's been on the
19:42
front more than anyone else do you know
19:44
who obama
19:45
oh nixon it's nixon it's richard nixon
19:47
he's been on about 55 times something
19:49
crazy like that yeah actually it was
19:51
nixon's successor of course who was one
19:54
of the only three presidents u.s
19:56
presidents who haven't been the time
19:58
person of the old time man of the year
20:00
since it started so embarrassing and the
20:02
first two were very early on so the
20:03
first two were coolidge and hoover and
20:06
we've talked about how irrelevant
20:07
coolidge was before and i think one of
20:08
my favorite dorothy parker quotes when
20:10
she was told that he'd died and she said
20:12
something like how can they tell and so
20:15
coolidge and hoover were pretty crap and
20:17
then the other person the other poor
20:18
president who didn't get on there ever
20:20
was gerald ford
20:21
and i hadn't realized about gerald ford
20:23
that so famously he never won a u.s
20:25
election of course he just stepped in as
20:27
the replacement when nixon had to go but
20:30
he stepped in because he was vp i hadn't
20:31
realized that he hadn't even won the
20:33
election as vp the only reason he was
20:35
vice president was that in 1973 spirit
20:38
agnew who had been vice president had to
20:40
resign on completely different um fraud
20:43
and bribery related charges and so he
20:45
stepped in as the default replacement as
20:47
vice president and then found himself as
20:49
the default replacement as president wow
20:51
and really it's no surprise that he
20:53
never quite met the time person of the
20:54
year i think the biggest slam in the
20:56
time person of the year is from 2006
20:59
when the winner was you which basically
21:02
means everyone was the winner uh and it
21:04
was because people were um you know
21:06
making lots of content on the internet
21:08
but then the runner-up was president
21:10
ahmadinejad of iran
21:12
so what i think that means is he doesn't
21:15
count over the you part so everyone else
21:17
in the world came first and he came
21:19
second
21:21
so the you the only people who qualify
21:24
to be part of the you are people who
21:26
were content providers before 2006. so
21:29
that means if you had a myspace account
21:31
for example and you uploaded anything
21:33
then you qualify so i know that
21:35
definitely three of us must qualify anna
21:38
have you even heard of the internet in
21:40
2006 look i was joined with ahmadinejad
21:44
second place and i'm comfortable with
21:46
that okay
21:48
um do you know it started off as a
21:49
mistake the time
21:51
man of the year or it started off to
21:53
rectify a mistake the magazine had made
21:54
they were really embarrassed because in
21:56
1927 charles lindbergh crossed the
21:58
atlantic flew across it a very big deal
22:01
first time and they didn't put it on the
22:03
cover they just completely flubbed it
22:05
they put a picture of king george v and
22:07
his wife in costume on the cover instead
22:09
that week
22:10
huge editorial blunder and they thought
22:12
at the end of the year hey you know what
22:14
we could do we could just say we've been
22:16
saving him up to call him the man of the
22:18
year and that was how they started wow
22:20
and they yeah the profile of him is
22:21
hilarious in that magazine because
22:23
obviously they were still working out
22:24
the form so the profile had you know
22:27
word colon and you know so they had feet
22:29
large
22:30
uh
22:31
because when he arrived at the embassy
22:32
in france there were no shoes big enough
22:34
for him oh i thought you might feet as
22:36
an f-e-a-t as in what he did was an
22:39
extremely large feet no
22:41
they they listed uh his habits they said
22:44
smokes not drinks not does not gamble
22:48
eats a thorough going breakfast avoids
22:50
rich dishes it just went on like this
22:52
these don't feel like the leading
22:53
elements of charles lindbergh's
22:55
character do they large feet non-smoker
22:58
they also described him as a very
23:01
taciturn person all the adjectives were
23:03
things like modesty taciturnity
23:05
diffidence women mate in blush
23:07
apparently singleness of purpose
23:09
occasional curtness and phlegm
23:12
which although we do refer to being
23:15
phlegmatic these days we very rarely say
23:16
that someone has he was part man part
23:19
hackface
23:23
just back on computers for a second um i
23:25
was reading about the lisa so this was
23:27
the computer that was um given as part
23:30
of the machine of the year and lisa had
23:33
a problem so you know the y2k problem
23:35
yeah have you guys heard of the wine
23:37
1995 problem no
23:39
why 1995.
23:42
so this was uh lisa for the same reasons
23:45
that all computers had the problem with
23:46
y2k the lisa computer only had a 15-year
23:50
time limit so it was launched in 1981
23:53
for some reason they backdated its time
23:55
limit to 1980 and it only had 15 years
23:58
to run before the clock freaked out and
24:00
so that was a big problem for the lisa
24:02
computer it's not like apple to create a
24:04
product that becomes obsolete for a
24:05
certain amount of time
24:07
that's true and that's why it wasn't a
24:09
problem in the end that's why we haven't
24:11
heard of the white in 1995. um 1982 as
24:15
well the first computer virus that went
24:17
through personal computers from one to
24:19
another to another uh there were there
24:21
were a few viruses before that but this
24:22
was the big one it was called the elk
24:24
cloner and it was invented by rich
24:26
skrenter who was a 15 year old student
24:29
and it spread by floppy disks so he
24:31
would put a game on a floppy disk give
24:32
it to his friend and they would put it
24:35
into their computer and after 50 times
24:37
they played the game they'd get a blank
24:38
screen and then a poem would come up
24:40
saying it will get on all your disks it
24:43
will infiltrate your chips yes it's the
24:46
cloner
24:47
and then it found itself a little place
24:49
to live in your computer and then the
24:51
next time you put another floppy disk on
24:52
it would go on there and it's spread by
24:54
oh wow think about 15 year olds this
24:56
they're very good with computers but
24:57
often they don't have a way with words
24:59
what do you mean i haven't told you the
25:01
second stanza yet because
25:03
it will stick to you like glue it will
25:05
modify ram too send in the cloner i
25:09
think we can all agree he was the w.h
25:10
orden of the 1980s
25:14
um just one other thing that i found on
25:15
computers specifically in 1982 for the
25:18
first time ever a movie tron had used
25:21
computers to do cgi
25:23
but they weren't nominated for an oscar
25:25
at that year's oscars because the
25:27
academy saw it as cheating to have used
25:29
a computer so no nomination and the best
25:32
special effects went to e.t for that
25:34
bicycling across the moon wow pretty
25:36
that's pretty good and because they
25:38
didn't use special effects they did
25:39
manage to actually get someone to
25:41
bicycle across the moon and then film it
25:42
didn't they yeah they fired them out of
25:44
a massive cannon didn't they yeah that
25:47
small child
25:49
what they did was that was a real moon
25:51
shot that they'd taken and they used a
25:53
load of charts and stuff to work out
25:55
exactly when the best shot of a moon
25:57
would be and where they had to go to
25:58
america and they shot this amazing real
26:01
scene and then they put green screen to
26:03
put someone like a model of a bike going
26:05
in front of it wait hang on because when
26:07
you say moonshot moonshot has a
26:09
different meaning doesn't it is it
26:10
doesn't it
26:11
moonshot is oh this is a real moon shot
26:13
you know it's a
26:14
one-and-a-million attempt to do
26:16
something i assumed you meant it was a
26:17
bad bottom i don't i haven't seen it but
26:19
i don't think it's a massive bear bottom
26:21
that's at the you haven't seen e.t
26:24
you just told us an amazing story about
26:26
the most famous shot in the entire film
26:28
yeah well i i know all about it why
26:30
would i watch it now i'm joking i
26:32
haven't seen that obviously like no that
26:34
is criminal i'm just still shocked
26:36
sometimes when you say that you haven't
26:38
because i know you've watched lots of
26:39
films i've watched all modern films yeah
26:41
but i haven't watched anything old
26:42
really i haven't seen either i feel like
26:44
i'm too old you haven't seen eater i'd
26:46
have to give you fair trade reactions
26:52
i've seen it at least three times so i'm
26:53
covering us all don't worry andy
26:55
nice i hope they don't give time person
26:57
of the year for everyone who's watched
26:58
e.t
27:00
it's just
27:03
[Laughter]
27:08
okay it is time for fact number three
27:10
and that is anna
27:12
my fact this week is that in order to
27:14
decide which direction to go and preach
27:17
every day franciscan spun round and
27:20
round until they were so dizzy that they
27:21
fell over and then went in whichever way
27:23
their head was pointing
27:26
this was just this was just a group of
27:28
early franciscan preachers so in the
27:31
early 1200s who got into this and i
27:34
learned this
27:35
this is kind of transgressing in a way
27:38
that we haven't transgressed before i'm
27:39
bringing the adverts into the podcast
27:42
because i learned this on a great
27:43
courses course oh oh my god
27:50
i'm getting a huge amount in order to
27:51
share this fact it's not even true uh no
27:54
look i'm sorry i'm listening to this
27:56
amazing lecture series it's by a guy
27:58
called flip die leader who's it's a
27:59
lecture series on the high middle ages
28:01
and there was this bit about franciscan
28:03
monks and they are fascinating so the
28:05
reason that they preached in this way
28:07
was because they didn't really believe
28:08
in planning for the future they thought
28:10
that was all very sinful because god
28:12
should decide what you do it's up to god
28:15
everything you do and planning from the
28:16
future is like you saying i know better
28:18
than god and so you know they mustn't
28:20
choose which direction they walk in
28:22
they'll leave it to god and it was
28:23
actually portrayed in a film wasn't it
28:25
which i've never seen but i really want
28:26
to call the flowers of saint francis
28:28
rossellini film where i think
28:30
some franciscans do it at some point i
28:32
think saint francis does it and in that
28:35
i'm not sure in that movie but the
28:36
flowers of saint francis was like pretty
28:39
much a biography of saint francis wasn't
28:40
it yeah and so they say that he did it
28:43
and that's why his followers did it
28:44
right yeah yeah so francis sounds like
28:46
an interesting dude yeah apparently
28:49
would sometimes strip to his pants while
28:51
preaching his undergarments i'm not sure
28:54
i don't think they had m s y fronts back
28:56
in the day but uh he would give his
28:58
clothes away and he played i haven't
29:01
been able to find out more information
29:02
about this he played a kind of
29:03
proto-guitar while preaching which had
29:06
been condemned by the authorities and he
29:08
played his own songs on it and he
29:10
encouraged he's basically the red hot
29:12
chili peppers isn't he getting down to
29:14
his pants and playing the guitar
29:16
in front of a massive crowd yeah i've
29:18
never thought of him like that but yeah
29:20
i don't think he thought of himself like
29:21
that
29:24
yeah he was strange he converted
29:26
according to one story when a crucifix
29:28
spoke to him just hanging out in a
29:30
church a crucifix said hey you need to
29:32
go and rebuild this church roof so he
29:34
thought well yeah the crucifixes told me
29:35
i'll do it and he went and begged for
29:37
money and stones to do that and his
29:40
parents were very embarrassed by his
29:42
crazy behavior and his stripping down to
29:43
his underwear and
29:46
uh he did a lot of weird stuff so when
29:48
trying to work out what rules to include
29:49
in the franciscan order for his monks he
29:52
just got a bible and again because he
29:53
loved the randomness he just said we'll
29:55
randomly open the bible on three pages
29:57
and the first three things we see will
29:59
have them as the rules unfortunately
30:02
they were quite good things
30:05
even i think he must have done that a
30:07
few times because the bible is a very
30:08
big book with a lot of crazy yeah yeah
30:11
some weird yeah only ever owned 13
30:14
goats on a tuesday then we have to go
30:16
and attack the
30:21
a canaanites of his early attempts
30:22
failed
30:23
that's really interesting he didn't used
30:25
to just exclusively preach to humans
30:27
either he would preach to animals he
30:29
would preach
30:30
yeah that's what he's famous for isn't
30:31
it the most famous thing really oh glad
30:34
to glad to mention the most famous thing
30:35
did you get that out of the way
30:38
i don't actually know much about this
30:40
guy um
30:41
yeah he he once persuaded a wolf uh to
30:43
stop attacking some locals um the they
30:46
came to an agreement whereby they would
30:48
feed the wolf but that was due to his
30:50
his great communication skills with
30:52
animals
30:54
all literally all i knew about him
30:56
before this research was is sort of an
30:57
image of a guy with a bird landing on
30:59
his outstretched hand yeah he's sort of
31:01
the patron spirit of all these animals
31:04
he went to the middle east to try and
31:05
stop the crusades from happening
31:08
very ballsy he visited saladin's nephew
31:11
who was in charge of the defense against
31:14
the christian invaders and they spent a
31:15
week talking and they had a really good
31:17
summit about all sorts of stuff and
31:19
saturday's nephew was very impressed
31:20
with him and then francis went to speak
31:23
to the cardinal who was in charge of the
31:26
invasion effort cardinal pelagius
31:28
galvani and said look i've had a great
31:30
summit with this guy and i think maybe
31:32
you should call off this crusade and it
31:34
did not work
31:35
right
31:36
so he went to the wrong guy he just got
31:38
pissed with a nephew an irrelevant
31:40
nephew for a week
31:42
had his attempts rejected he um but he
31:45
was a bit naive i think he sent a bunch
31:47
of francis and monks to go preaching in
31:49
germany so this was in italy that the
31:50
order started he sent the 60 of his
31:52
members to go preaching in germany but
31:54
because you weren't supposed to really
31:55
plan for the future and you just had to
31:56
trust god he said you don't need to
31:59
learn german because if god wants you to
32:01
be able to communicate with him
32:03
you will and so they turned up and they
32:06
picked up that yeah was a thing that
32:08
meant yes and that was it and so it was
32:10
all fine while people were saying hey
32:12
are you nice guys do you want a drink
32:14
and they were like yeah yeah and then
32:15
when they said are you guys heretics you
32:17
guys criminals and they kept going yeah
32:19
yeah yeah and they all ended up sort of
32:21
being arrested and then having to return
32:23
to italy what they should have done is
32:24
got a guidebook and then open it on a
32:26
random page and just said whatever it
32:28
said on the guidebook
32:31
i think we've got any asthma medication
32:35
um favorite thing that i read about
32:37
francis so one of the things that we
32:39
have actually mentioned before is that
32:40
he's accredited with creating the first
32:42
nativity scene in case you missed that
32:43
episode ages ago he's responsible for
32:45
that used live animals to do it uh but
32:47
my favorite thing is that he once had to
32:50
put a stop to something which was the
32:52
dead body of a dead franciscan was
32:54
performing too many miracles
32:56
and it was causing traffic jams in the
32:59
town basically where it was happening
33:00
because just all these miracles kept
33:02
happening so people kept coming so he
33:03
had to pray for the miracles to stop
33:06
because it was too chaotic no and they
33:08
did
33:08
yeah what kind of miracles was it just
33:11
like a hippopotamus appears in the
33:12
middle of the road i don't know i guess
33:14
it's someone who could suddenly walk
33:15
again you know that kind of stuff when
33:16
you go near something that's of
33:17
religious importance um and so this was
33:20
anna that's jumanji you're thinking
33:23
you're right
33:24
yeah so this isn't james jumanji was a
33:26
1995 film much like e.t i've watched
33:29
jumanji it was came out last year oh oh
33:31
my a heretic
33:35
uh yeah this was a franciscan called
33:37
peter cattini and this was in 1220. what
33:40
kind of traffic jams could you have in
33:41
1220 i know like human traffic i guess
33:45
it was just it was not good for the area
33:47
you could have a cart jam there was
33:49
actually there was a car filled with
33:50
hankfish slime three carts
33:54
day and the franciscans themselves they
33:56
got in trouble in 2001 for hiring a
33:59
milanese fashion designer to redesign
34:01
their habit
34:03
they said the old one is too heavy and
34:06
it was cliched that's fair
34:08
i think i mean i guess whether you're
34:10
cliched or not shouldn't be a worry when
34:12
you're a monk yeah i think the point of
34:14
franciscan's being entirely
34:16
anti-materialist and you know you don't
34:18
really want to have any physical
34:19
possessions to deploy a milanese fashion
34:21
designer well the new one they said it
34:24
was meant to be simpler cleaner more
34:25
dynamic and professional and it also had
34:28
a breast pocket for a mobile phone
34:30
and the other orders were very envious
34:32
of the franciscans but there was a bit
34:33
of a kerfuffle about it here's another
34:35
cliche about monks is the tonsier which
34:38
is their haircut
34:40
um so they have like hair just going
34:42
around the side of their head don't they
34:44
and then it's all bowled on top and the
34:46
reason that they have that is because
34:48
they want to replicate the crown of
34:50
thorns that jesus wore
34:52
but there's loads of different versions
34:53
of it and the
34:55
roman catholic one is the one that most
34:57
people will recognize like friar tuck
34:58
had and stuff that goes around like a
35:00
crown of thorns but before that in
35:02
britain they had a celtic one and it was
35:04
basically you shaved a triangle in the
35:07
top of your head so you had a massive
35:09
triangular bald patch at the top of your
35:10
head and you had hair everywhere else
35:13
and i just think that that sounds like
35:15
that's the next thing in milanese
35:16
fashion houses isn't it
35:19
a triangular bowl patch i had no idea
35:22
that that was a crown of thoughts
35:24
to do with i thought it was just genetic
35:25
male pattern boldness affects monks
35:28
the same way it affects out all of us
35:31
yeah i mean it might be you know like
35:32
when your sights go bold and then you
35:34
start shaving your head it's like no no
35:36
it's a crowd of thorns honestly
35:39
and another person with a haircut like
35:40
that willie thorne interesting
35:43
the snooker player
35:45
it's a very niche reference for our
35:47
listeners
35:49
our demographic of listeners to no such
35:51
thing as a fish i'm not sure how many of
35:52
them know who willie thon is but there
35:54
are a couple of middle-aged men
35:56
guffawing away
36:00
i found a few other bizarre people from
36:03
that time so st joseph of cupertino he's
36:06
an interesting character much like i was
36:08
saying with the other guy peter causing
36:10
traffic with his constant miracles
36:12
cupertino had a problem where he was
36:14
constantly flying so he was known as the
36:16
flying saint and people if they'd
36:18
mentioned jesus he would just start
36:20
levitating up and this was a constant
36:22
thing that would happen and it became a
36:24
problem in his life i'm not surprised
36:26
yeah if he is a preacher people are
36:28
gonna be mentioning jesus all the time
36:30
to him even if someone just hits their
36:31
thumb with a hammer and says jesus does
36:33
he start floating he starts floating it
36:34
got even worse for him it went if you
36:36
started mentioning saints any saint he
36:38
would start flying so it became very
36:40
disruptive to the point where people
36:41
didn't like it and they ostracized him
36:44
they got rid of him and said you can't
36:45
be part of this how did they do it they
36:47
did they just keep going jesus say jesus
36:49
say jesus
36:50
until he floated away so far they
36:52
couldn't see him anymore yeah no he
36:54
ended up in a monastery and they kept
36:55
him in a cell by himself so he he must
36:57
have done some other things wrong other
36:58
than just floated but he's uh yeah so
37:01
that was a problem um awful being kept
37:03
in a cell as well he must have hit his
37:04
head on the ceiling
37:07
and constantly once he hits he goes
37:08
jesus
37:10
that's a horrible loop
37:12
i like the fact that another one of the
37:13
leading preachers at the time who
37:15
actually ended up being labeled a
37:17
heretic even though he was basically the
37:18
same as francis of assisi was
37:20
waldo
37:22
wow the waldensians but there was a big
37:25
search for him wasn't there afterwards
37:27
there was yeah he was always in crowds
37:29
though right because he introduced huge
37:30
crowds
37:32
another guy sent dennis have you heard
37:34
of st dennis he had his head chopped off
37:36
but continued to walk and preach
37:37
afterwards and he was made the patron
37:39
saint of headaches
37:41
if you had your head cut off yeah would
37:43
you have phantom head syndrome no i
37:45
think you'd have phantom body syndrome
37:46
wouldn't you yeah because your mind is
37:49
in the head part i don't think he lasted
37:51
too long i think he picked up his head
37:53
and walked for six kilometers and buried
37:54
it and then fell down so
37:57
i think he did last quite a long time if
37:58
that's what he did
37:59
i think that's much more impressive than
38:02
i could handle that's true the twirling
38:05
monks are still a thing to a certain
38:06
extent oh yeah oh yeah so uh in 2019
38:09
last year there was a buddhist monk and
38:12
she was called master hui yen she was in
38:14
taiwan and she was blessing a temple and
38:16
you can see footage of her doing us
38:18
online and she blesses the temple by
38:20
going along the red carpet up towards it
38:22
twirling 150 times in a row wow
38:25
unfortunately she then throws up
38:28
and it's a less spiritual ending to the
38:30
video than you would expect that would
38:32
be an easier way of doing this francis
38:35
thing wouldn't it it's like whatever
38:36
direction the vomit goes
38:38
follow it follow follow follow your
38:40
gender so there is a modern day follower
38:42
of the franciscan faith and this is in
38:46
brazil uh it's a lady she's a
38:48
grandmother in brazil and she as part of
38:51
her faith would pray to saint anthony of
38:53
padua
38:54
apart from her grandchildren realized
38:56
that she wasn't praying to a figurine of
38:58
saint anthony of padua atoll she was
39:01
praying to a figure of elrond lord of
39:03
riverdale and lord of the rings
39:07
and she'd been praying to this elf every
39:08
single day for a couple of years and it
39:11
turned out it was just an elf she had
39:13
lovely pointy ears at the end of it
39:16
uh we need to move on in a sec guys i
39:18
was just looking into other leading
39:19
religious figures in this period and
39:21
someone who's particularly amazing is
39:22
hildegard of bingham so i didn't know
39:24
much about her vaguely heard of her but
39:26
she was this crisp very very influential
39:28
christian mystic and she sort of
39:31
traveled around a lot very unusual for a
39:32
woman to independently travel around and
39:35
used to draw these huge crowds she was a
39:36
rock star and um she was a composer
39:40
she's actually the only person really
39:42
whose music we still play from the
39:44
middle ages so it's still played and
39:45
sung today
39:47
and she was a philosopher she's like the
39:49
founder of german natural history she
39:51
was amazing and she was very religious
39:52
none but she also invented her own
39:55
language and i think it's the first
39:56
person we have evidence of doing kind of
39:59
what we do with esperanto which is
40:00
trying to invent a perfect language a
40:02
new alphabet and we've got this whole
40:04
glossary of her language that she wrote
40:07
in it's over a thousand words and she
40:09
just made up this language it's full of
40:11
saids and it's really weird stuff like
40:13
she's got a specific word for great
40:14
great great great grandfather and she's
40:17
got you know drunkards vaginas urine she
40:21
just made up her heart she covered all
40:22
the main the main subjects
40:25
my drunk great great great great
40:27
grandfather's got a vagina she could say
40:29
that yeah and it's full of europe
40:31
[Laughter]
40:35
okay it is time for our final fact of
40:37
the show and that is andy my fact is
40:40
that in 2004 a canadian cheese maker
40:42
dropped 50 000 worth of cheese into a
40:45
lake to make it taste better but then
40:47
lost the cheese oh no
40:50
i know oh god
40:52
so that could possibly be like the most
40:54
tasty bit of cheese that's ever been
40:56
made and we'll never find it i know
40:58
after 15 years in the lake it's probably
41:00
approaching its peak perfection
41:04
so this was a canadian cheese maker he
41:06
ran a fromagerie called la fromagerie
41:09
brava he dropped 800 kilos of cheese
41:13
into the water of this lake in 2004 and
41:16
he let it sit there for a year and
41:18
he was really confident that it would be
41:20
delicious once it had had a bit of lake
41:22
treatment but they started looking for
41:24
it it wasn't in the spot they left it in
41:26
and then they ramped up the search a bit
41:28
so they started sending in divers and
41:30
then they sent in some tracking
41:31
equipment after three dives they still
41:33
hadn't found the cheese and the cheese
41:35
maker was called lukewarm he said it got
41:38
too expensive at some point you can't be
41:40
crazy
41:41
and they just called off the search so
41:43
this is a phantom cheese that the world
41:44
will never get to so the reason that
41:46
they thought to put all this cheese in
41:48
the water is actually because a
41:51
fisherman had come to them a few years
41:52
earlier and said that he'd found a bit
41:55
of their cheese at the bottom of a lake
41:57
now i don't know how that bit of cheese
41:59
got there but he'd found it and the
42:01
first thing he thought when he got this
42:03
cheese out of the lake is i'll just try
42:04
it and see what it's like and he said it
42:06
was the most tasty cheese that he'd ever
42:08
had and so obviously this fromagerie guy
42:11
thought well i'll just put all the rest
42:13
of my cheese in the water
42:15
so this is the uh complex science on
42:18
which fromagia's depend is just the
42:20
random word of a crazy fisherman who
42:21
eats cheese off the bottom of the lake
42:23
basically yeah he just ripped the
42:25
hagfish off
42:28
and also they should have seen it coming
42:29
right because it wasn't the lake called
42:31
bay dahaha yes it's one of the few
42:33
places in the world which has
42:34
punctuation in the name of the place
42:36
because haha has exclamation marks after
42:38
it yeah yeah even if they had found the
42:41
cheese there is serious doubt over
42:43
whether they would have been able to
42:44
sell it because the canadian food
42:46
inspection agency are real sticklers
42:48
about just put dropping food in a lake
42:50
and then selling it to the public and
42:52
they said yeah we would have needed to
42:54
check this throughout its aging process
42:56
and then they interviewed afterwards one
42:58
of the divers who was looking for the
42:59
cheese a guy called mr daphor
43:02
and they said oh you know are you not a
43:03
bit sad that you didn't find the cheese
43:05
he's like no i'm really optimistic
43:07
because the titanic sank in 1912 and it
43:10
was only found in 1985 so
43:14
as far as he's concerned there's still
43:16
plenty of time to find this cheese i
43:18
like the idea that the oscar winning
43:20
film in the year 2060 is going to be a
43:22
film called bravan's cheese where they
43:24
finally dredge up the giant cheese from
43:26
the bottom you know what i would have
43:28
thought that would be better than
43:29
titanic because i haven't seen titanic
43:31
but
43:32
a surprise surprise you know what's
43:34
going to happen at the end don't you
43:35
whereas in this cheese it's an actual
43:37
mystery of what happens at the end
43:39
you're right and i read also an article
43:41
this was in was it in 2005 andy yeah and
43:44
obviously in 2005 is quite a slow news
43:47
year and so it was in the news a fair
43:49
amount and then afterwards they said
43:51
that he was going to do it again and he
43:53
was going to fit the cheddar with a
43:56
tracking device
43:57
so amazing but then i couldn't find if
43:59
he's actually done it and there's
44:00
nothing on his website to say that he's
44:02
done it so i don't know maybe he looked
44:03
back to that quote that andy gave us
44:05
where he said at a certain point of
44:07
crazy you've got to realize you've got
44:08
to stop and turn around and he reflected
44:11
a little bit
44:12
they used a one million dollar
44:14
multi-beam sonar device to find this
44:16
cheese what
44:18
is amazing it's absolutely amazing
44:21
it's basically the canadian nessie is
44:23
this cheese yeah yeah um there is lots
44:26
of when you're probing cheese or when
44:28
you're trying to do experiments on
44:30
cheese so there has been a new method
44:33
developed in the last year uh in uruguay
44:35
uruguayan scientists developed a method
44:37
to non-destructively probe emantile
44:40
cheese which is massive news for the
44:42
industry does cemental have holes in it
44:44
it does so surely it's easy to probe
44:46
without destroying it you just go
44:47
through one of the holes
44:49
there aren't holes on the outside
44:50
because obviously it's right and i think
44:51
you knew that and you were teasing me
44:53
basically you need to measure when the
44:56
eyes as they call the holes are big
44:57
enough and when when they're at the
44:59
right size the cheese is ripe and if
45:01
it's too long then the eyes will merge
45:03
into each other and the cheese collapses
45:04
disaster so you make a batch of cheese
45:07
and to measure it normally you would
45:09
need to sacrifice a wheel of cheese
45:11
every time that's a lesser known bit of
45:14
the bible isn't it where they sacrifice
45:15
the wheel of cheese
45:17
abraham says to god i won't give you my
45:20
son but i will give you this baby bell
45:24
so anyway so normally you need to as i
45:26
say sacrifice one of your precious
45:28
cheeses every time you want to measure
45:29
the bubble size but these uruguayan
45:31
scientists have invented a kind of magic
45:33
cheese hammer it's kind of a sonic
45:35
electrical probe uh which allows you to
45:38
tell from the sound it's like a tuning
45:41
fork
45:42
or for cheese but they're very
45:44
specialist instruments obviously you
45:46
need a lot of training to tell to
45:48
understand whether a cheese is right but
45:50
the new method is an electrical hammer
45:52
which allows any old schmo who doesn't
45:54
have years of training and expertise to
45:58
tell the rightness of the cheese without
45:59
destroying it so this is big news i was
46:01
in a cheese shop the other day
46:03
no the other month
46:05
in
46:06
france when we're allowed to go outside
46:08
and um they had like the back room you
46:11
could look into the back room and they
46:12
had all the massive wheels of cheese
46:15
you know like they're really really
46:17
expensive aren't they and they use them
46:18
as like lone collateral and stuff like
46:21
that and it was just really amazing to
46:23
see how big these massive wheels of
46:25
cheese are because they're absolutely
46:26
huge
46:27
how big we talking give us an animal
46:31
i would say 350 weasels
46:35
wow thank you that's huge that's done
46:37
nothing for me
46:39
is that an elephant what is that could
46:40
we not pick one animal
46:42
it's kind of a big really big pig yeah
46:44
or a small pony like a shetland pony but
46:48
if you squashed it down into a circle
46:50
yeah are you cutting the legs off you're
46:52
bending the legs into the body and then
46:54
making it into a circle either way i
46:56
think the authorities will be taking a
46:58
close interest
47:00
actually the most interesting canadian
47:01
cheese i could find was a giant cheese
47:05
the mammoth cheese this was prepared for
47:07
the chicago world fair of 1893 but it
47:09
came from canada from ontario which is
47:11
one of its biggest cheese producing
47:13
provinces
47:14
and it weighed 9 900 kilos which i
47:18
was trying to see what that was the
47:20
equivalent of and it's the equivalent of
47:22
144 average sized women
47:25
how many is that in weasels
47:30
you're gonna have to do the weasels to
47:31
women conversion yourselves at home it's
47:33
amazing
47:34
it was an amazing undertaking they used
47:36
milk from dairies all over the country
47:37
all over canada and they had a special
47:39
railway car made because the first one
47:41
they put it on it just fell through the
47:43
bottom
47:44
so they had to transport it by this
47:46
railway from ontario to chicago and they
47:50
had a cheese timetable which they sent
47:51
ahead to all the stations so everyone in
47:53
the stations between the two places
47:55
flocked to their station when they
47:57
checked the timetable for when the
47:58
cheese was pulling in
47:59
so that they could come and see it and
48:01
by the time it got to chicago it had so
48:03
many thousands of signatures on
48:19
it sounds like it must have stopped at
48:20
the stations but i don't think anyone
48:22
was boarding and getting on and it
48:23
wouldn't have been a sole train just for
48:24
the cheese you'd have a carriage for it
48:26
wouldn't you would you no they probably
48:28
just had a carriage
48:29
you wouldn't send a whole train and just
48:31
have all the other carriages empty and
48:32
just one cheese in one character also
48:34
equally you wouldn't be like sat in
48:36
carriage a or b of a train and have to
48:38
climb around the massive cheese to get
48:40
to the buffet cart that's true
48:42
that is the buffet
48:46
what year was this anna uh 1893 1893 oh
48:49
okay because i found another mammoth
48:51
cheese from 1866 which was also shipped
48:53
around to toronto and new york and i
48:56
only know about it because of the famous
48:58
poem that was written about it do you
48:59
guys know the cheese poet of canada no
49:02
um there's a guy called james mcintyre
49:05
acknowledged to be one of the worst
49:06
poets ever he was born in the early
49:08
1800s and he was a poet but no one knew
49:11
this until after he died he only got
49:13
fame because he was included in
49:14
collections with titles like very bad
49:17
poetry um which got him famous and his
49:20
most famous poem is called ode to the
49:21
mammoth cheese weighing over seven
49:23
thousand pounds
49:25
and as it is at james read some poetry
49:26
i'll give you a quick extract we have
49:29
seen the queen of cheese lying quietly
49:32
at your ease gently fanned by evening
49:34
breeze thy fair form no flies dare sees
49:38
all gaily dressed soon you'll go to the
49:41
provincial show to be admired by many a
49:44
beau in the city of toronto
49:46
[Laughter]
49:48
so to the mammoth cheese weighing over
49:51
seven thousand pounds that is brilliant
49:52
yeah that's another one that should have
49:54
started computer code
49:56
another canadian cheese
49:58
craft you know craft cheese so cheese
50:01
slices they're canadian um the guy who
50:03
invented craft cheese was canadian uh he
50:05
invented pasteurized cheese which
50:07
everyone wanted to call embalmed cheese
50:10
when he first invented it because all
50:12
the cheese makers thought you can't have
50:14
this kind of industrial process making
50:16
cheese it should only be our special
50:18
cheeses that we make that you can sell
50:20
and so you're going to have to call it
50:22
in balm cheese and then in the end they
50:23
had to call it processed cheese of
50:24
course but he fought against that and he
50:27
had a business partner he was going to
50:29
go out of business but he decided to
50:30
have a business partner and he made
50:32
jesus christ his business partner this
50:35
is on the craft website if you go on
50:37
there i didn't think jesus had a very
50:39
good head for business did you not say
50:40
jesus christ
50:41
[Music]
50:43
i didn't say jesus christ but that's
50:45
what he remarked himself as
50:48
uh no it's on the website it says that
50:51
basically he was doing really badly and
50:53
then he decided to make jesus christ his
50:55
business partner he gave 25 of his
50:57
personal profits to the church and
51:00
suddenly everything picked up and he
51:01
became really really popular and then a
51:03
few years later he brought in his
51:05
brothers charles herbert frederick
51:06
norman and john into the business
51:08
wow what a slam for the brightest to
51:10
have been invited after jesus christ
51:12
industry
51:15
so we have god to thank for craft i was
51:17
actually reading a there was a book
51:19
written by a random guy who visited the
51:20
craft family a few years ago and the
51:23
family tradition says has been passed
51:25
down that the reason he got the
51:27
inspiration to pair up with god jesus as
51:29
his business partner was when he was
51:31
just he was selling cheese in canada
51:33
like one trotting around the streets in
51:34
his cheese cart and the donkey that was
51:36
pulling the wagon from which he was
51:37
selling turned around to him and told
51:40
him that he had to make things right
51:42
with god and get him involved in the
51:44
company and it was only after the donkey
51:47
spoke to him that um he went into this
51:49
very lucrative business partnership
51:50
talking donkey
51:53
it's basically shrek yeah
51:55
i mean i haven't seen shrek but i think
51:57
there is a talking donkey in it isn't
51:59
that
52:00
so annoying how you're beating me with
52:01
all the film references
52:04
that is amazing uh we're gonna have to
52:06
wrap up in a second anyone got anything
52:08
else they want to add before we do i
52:10
like that um the cyclops in the odyssey
52:12
basically ran a cheese factory
52:14
just just looking at old cheeses
52:18
he um
52:19
if you look at the odyssey from a
52:21
different angle then odysseus is really
52:23
the villain here so he goes with all his
52:25
men to the cyclops big caves and so you
52:28
probably know the cyclops had a big
52:30
sheep farm because the way they all
52:31
escaped at the end is by clinging to the
52:33
underside of this sheep as they counted
52:35
out of the caves but basically all these
52:37
men snuck into the cyclops caves and
52:39
they found that the cyclops has been
52:40
milking all of his sheep and then
52:42
keeping storing the milk in his caves
52:44
kind of like rock forest is stored in
52:47
order to mature into cheese and so they
52:50
sort of stole the cheese from the caves
52:53
and escaped but i just love the fact
52:54
that the cyclops was just a cheese
52:56
farmer that story honestly the cyclops
52:59
is the good guy in that story isn't he
53:02
because they yeah they blind him he's
53:03
only got one eye to begin with and they
53:05
blind him
53:06
and then they steal all of his stuff
53:09
i always hated that story you know they
53:11
blind him so they hide underneath the
53:13
sheep so they can't feel him because he
53:15
feels the top of the sheep doesn't he
53:17
i don't know i think that's sneaky and
53:18
not very nice he's going to eat them
53:20
isn't he he specifically says when i
53:22
come back i'm going to kill you that's
53:24
just nature but that's too soft because
53:26
they've eaten all of his cheese he's got
53:27
nothing left to put in his sandwiches i
53:29
think the theory is that it's um it's
53:31
feta or that it's a kind of proto-feta
53:34
isn't it is it sheep's cheese feta i
53:35
think so yeah i weirdly don't know this
53:38
story we've talked about it on this
53:39
podcast don't read it i love that you do
53:41
though james i love that there's a
53:42
period where you stop
53:44
taking stuff in but then you're going to
53:45
pour it back enough
53:47
and you pick it up again yeah
53:50
that's very good we've just told you the
53:51
story in such a weird order now i wonder
53:53
what your head is like trying to piece
53:54
together this is like this is like that
53:57
movie memento that i haven't seen where
53:58
everything's in a weird order
54:00
oh my gosh
54:08
okay that's it that is all of our facts
54:10
thank you so much for listening if you'd
54:12
like to get in contact with any of us

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from four
00:21
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
00:23
is dan schreiber and i am sitting here
00:25
with anna tajinski
00:26
james harkin and andrew hunter murray
00:29
and once again
00:30
we have gathered round the microphones
00:31
with our four favorite facts from the
00:33
last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order here we go
00:37
starting with fact number one and that's
00:39
my fact my fact this week is that early
00:42
proposals for raising the titanic back
00:44
to the ocean's surface
00:45
included filling it up with ping pong
00:47
balls
00:48
injecting 180 000 tons of vaseline into
00:52
it
00:53
and turning the ship itself into an
00:56
iceberg that would have been ironic
00:58
what if another ship came along and then
01:00
hit the titanic
01:03
it'd be a great reveal if you did hit an
01:05
iceberg and it cracked open
01:06
and suddenly there's the actual
01:10
exactly what i mean who's got enough
01:12
ping pong balls to do
01:14
the first one of these things that is a
01:16
large number of ping-pong balls are
01:18
these all entirely serious suggestions i
01:19
guess is what i'm trying
01:20
yeah well to an extent they are um you
01:22
know they're not they're not necessarily
01:24
practical
01:25
but in most of the cases we've seen that
01:27
some of these methods work so for
01:29
example the ping pong ball
01:30
um idea um that was actually used not
01:33
not actual ping pong balls but the
01:35
premise of putting ping pong balls into
01:37
a ship
01:37
um was used by a danish engineer called
01:40
carl croyer
01:40
and back in 1964 there was a crash of a
01:43
ship in the harbor in kuwait
01:45
city and the ship went down six thousand
01:47
sheep were on it
01:49
and so they were going to block the
01:50
ocean and the problem is is that the
01:52
harbor is where they pumped drinking
01:54
water from for the city so
01:55
they needed to get the sheep out as
01:57
quick as possible and they needed to get
02:00
the ship
02:00
up in one piece so this guy carl croyer
02:03
had the idea
02:04
of filling it with ping pong balls an
02:06
idea which he got from an
02:08
old disney uh comic strip of donald duck
02:11
and how he salvaged a ship by pumping it
02:13
full of ping pong balls
02:14
and it raising and he developed these
02:16
sort of new ping pong balls
02:18
um that was sort of a lot smaller sort
02:20
of pearl size
02:22
and they did it they successfully raised
02:24
the ship that's not a ping pong ball
02:26
if it's a size if it's that small it's
02:28
not a ping pong ball anymore because i'd
02:30
love to see you try and play ping pong
02:31
with one of those
02:32
but no so but this guy raised a bunch of
02:35
ships using this method and he tried to
02:37
patent it
02:38
but the patent was rejected because they
02:40
said the idea comes from donald duck
02:42
he's the original holder of this idea
02:44
yeah because it was in a cartoon so they
02:46
refused him the patent
02:47
flash forward to modern times the
02:49
mythbusters tv show successfully raised
02:52
a ship
02:52
using ping pong balls um the ship was
02:54
called the mythanic 2
02:56
and they pumped 27 000 ping pong balls
02:58
into it and it brought the boat back to
03:00
the surface
03:01
so they claim it's plausible it's not a
03:03
busted idea that donald duck could raise
03:05
a ship with ping pong
03:06
so we're saying that the titanic thing
03:07
is feasible is that what you're saying
03:09
not really because when you get that low
03:11
the ping pong balls would be crushed
03:12
they'd be decimated uh before they even
03:14
got to the bottom
03:15
oh yeah because of the pressure exactly
03:18
so that's where it's not practical
03:19
however the idea of
03:20
lifting a ship is practical cool what's
03:23
with the ping pong balls is it just that
03:24
they're flotation devices so it's like
03:26
having a really weird looking life
03:28
jacket
03:28
yeah exactly um that's exactly it yeah
03:31
they float that's why you never see
03:33
you'd never see ping pong players being
03:34
lost at sea it just doesn't happen
03:36
because they always keep a few in their
03:37
pocket just in case yeah
03:39
yeah and you can use the bat as an awe
03:42
once you get to the surface and get
03:44
yourself to safety there was a proposal
03:47
to use dynamite to get the ship
03:50
uh back up well there was a proposal to
03:53
blow it up with dynamite five days after
03:55
it
03:55
was that an idea that was come up with
03:56
by wiley coyote yeah
04:02
um so this was genuinely five days after
04:04
it sank still april 1912.
04:06
um vincent astor who was the son of john
04:09
jacob astor
04:10
the richest man on board the titanic uh
04:12
his father had been
04:13
lost on the titanic and he said we
04:15
should just
04:16
drop a powerful explosives to recover
04:18
the bodies
04:19
sort of to dislodge uh the bodies from
04:22
the ship
04:23
number of problems with this firstly no
04:25
one knew exactly where the ship was it
04:26
turns out that it's
04:27
you know in two pieces 600 meters apart
04:29
and
04:30
he was only deterred from this project
04:32
when people said that the extreme
04:34
pressure would have uh compressed
04:35
all the passengers on board so they were
04:37
jelly um
04:39
so you wouldn't get the bodies of your
04:40
loved ones back you would just get a
04:41
kind of jelly that actually turns out to
04:43
be wrong
04:43
but oh really uh that the people did not
04:46
turn into jelly
04:47
okay okay um what happened i think they
04:50
is it that the water down there is
04:52
really low in calcium
04:54
and so your bones kind of dissolve i
04:56
think i read that
04:58
okay i think um so let's look at some of
05:00
the other ideas that they had done this
05:02
thing about vaseline
05:03
i looked at the website that you sent
05:05
which had all of these ideas on
05:07
and on the website it says there is no
05:09
proof that vaseline can float
05:12
yes so uh not a practical suggestion
05:14
there must be some
05:15
evidence about whether vaseline floats
05:17
that's what i thought right it must be
05:19
because it's not
05:20
beyond the realms of man to check right
05:23
i don't have any vaseline in my house
05:25
and i can't leave the house to buy some
05:27
so
05:27
i don't have any evidence and i googled
05:29
it and if you search
05:30
does vaseline float or vaseline doesn't
05:33
float or vaseline floats
05:35
there doesn't seem to be any answers on
05:36
google so i actually still don't know
05:39
where the vaseline floats out
05:41
i've got a tub of vaseline in my home
05:43
let's do it
05:44
oh it's another experiment experiment
05:46
you'll take us to the bathroom
05:48
should i go and get it yeah yeah let's
05:50
see okay hang on hang on
05:51
we've become blue pizza
05:53
[Laughter]
05:55
okay okay andy's back with vaseline
05:58
yep i've got some water to go with that
06:00
vaseline i've got some water i'm just
06:02
pulling it this is the stuff that
06:04
mythbusters rejected as being not
06:06
quite good enough to make the grade okay
06:08
so can you see this so i've got yeah we
06:10
got it i've got a little measuring jug
06:12
of water like a pirate
06:13
i'm just i'm just gonna try the whole
06:15
tub of vaseline right okay
06:17
the whole tub floats but it's mostly air
06:19
so that proves nothing
06:20
but you could what you could do is get a
06:22
maybe a hundred thousand of them and
06:24
treat them like
06:24
ping pong balls
06:28
okay okay i'm just gonna scoop out
06:31
uh a little a knob of vaseline
06:35
uh okay i'm dropping it in three
06:38
two one it floats
06:42
there we go we still have one of life's
06:44
great mysteries looking you're trying to
06:45
trying to make it not float and it keeps
06:47
floating yeah so your finger
06:49
your finger's the titanic
06:53
you're airborne look how good that is
06:55
what an underwhelming
06:56
[Laughter]
07:00
we should mostly stick to just talking
07:01
about facts i'm thinking just based on
07:03
the last couple of episodes
07:05
of experimenting so what about the
07:07
iceberg whose idea was that
07:08
the iceberg this um this first cropped
07:11
up as far as i can tell
07:12
in a 1977 issue of new scientists and it
07:16
was
07:16
a man called arthur hickey an
07:19
unemployed haulage contractor from
07:21
walsall
07:22
who claims to be the officially
07:24
appointed salvage master
07:27
of the titanic salvage company he claims
07:29
okay so it's not verified in the article
07:31
whether that's true or not
07:32
that's interesting though that you said
07:34
that he's unemployed but also
07:36
a haulage contractor and also the head
07:38
of this
07:39
titanic raising thing he sounds like the
07:42
least unemployed person i've ever heard
07:43
you're right this guy's too much work
07:45
yeah um so uh yeah so he approached
07:48
um and this is according to uh the new
07:51
scientist says according to a recent
07:52
issue of the boc group newspaper
07:54
which is the british oxygen company he
07:56
approached them off the back of a
07:58
vivid dream that he had about turning
08:00
the ship into an iceberg
08:02
and allowing it to float to the surface
08:04
and i tried to find more about it i
08:06
think the idea is that they'd have to
08:07
pump
08:08
like half a million tons of liquid
08:10
nitrogen down to it
08:11
in order to do it and i think the idea
08:13
was there was going to be a
08:14
mesh a wire mesh that they would create
08:17
around the titanic
08:18
for that to then be the the basis for
08:21
the block
08:22
of which it would stop and then that
08:24
would slowly bring it back up to the
08:26
surface
08:26
it is quite ethically dubious to get any
08:29
of the titanic back isn't it i think
08:31
a lot of the survivors were really anti
08:33
it um when they were still alive and
08:35
a lot of the families of the survivors
08:37
now are saying look you know
08:39
people died and they ended up at the
08:41
bottom of the sea and probably it's not
08:42
a good idea to
08:43
you know disturb the rest yeah yeah
08:46
exactly
08:46
yeah it's sort of mass grave sites isn't
08:48
it but
08:50
it can be extremely useful dredging up
08:53
ships uh because it might tell us the
08:55
origin of the universe
08:56
so sunken ships are a really really
08:59
crucial source
09:00
of certain of what's called low
09:02
background metals
09:03
and low background metals are totally
09:06
essential for experiments like looking
09:08
for dark matter
09:09
so looking for like all this dark matter
09:10
in the universe so we don't know where
09:11
it is
09:12
we're looking for antimatter they're
09:14
also really important for making geiger
09:16
counters for instance because
09:18
they don't emit any radiation at all
09:20
they don't emit any particles
09:22
and the reason is this is why they're
09:23
called low background metals
09:25
that they're on ships that were built
09:26
before the nuclear testing that started
09:28
in the 1940s
09:30
and so all metal that's been
09:32
manufactured taken out of the earth and
09:33
made into something useful
09:35
since then has had radioactivity in it
09:38
just like we all do
09:39
because of all that nuclear testing that
09:40
left the world very radioactive
09:42
so all these ships built before
09:44
non-radioactive and then they were sunk
09:46
to the bottom of the sea so they're
09:48
totally protected from the radioactivity
09:50
and they're the only place that you can
09:52
find these
09:53
low background lead and steel which
09:55
experiments
09:56
need so for instance when they dredge
09:58
them up there's always this
09:59
debate between archaeologists who are
10:01
like we want this for our museum please
10:04
and the scientists who are like but we
10:05
want to melt it all down for our
10:06
experiments please
10:08
and then the gravesite people who say
10:10
please leave it there isn't that cool
10:12
that is really amazing yeah i've got an
10:14
ethical dilemma for you okay
10:16
titanic related would you get married on
10:19
the titanic
10:20
are we talking about now because that's
10:22
quite a wet
10:23
wedding yeah two people two people have
10:26
genuinely got married on the titanic do
10:28
you mean since it's
10:29
impossible so they dive down in a diving
10:32
bell or something
10:32
they dive down in a submersible they're
10:35
called david leibowitz and kimberly
10:36
miller
10:37
and they won a trip to the titanic but i
10:40
think they only won one ticket and they
10:41
were told by the guys organizing it
10:43
we'll let the other one of you come
10:44
along but only if you agree to get
10:46
married
10:47
wow because they i mean they were a
10:49
couple um
10:50
and it was a way of raising publicity
10:52
for this thing this trip
10:53
and they had to wear flame retardant
10:55
suits and they had to crouch down on
10:56
their knees for the ceremony because the
10:58
submersible they room was so tiny but
10:59
they were actually on the bow of the
11:01
ship
11:02
um you know where the famous scene is in
11:04
the movie i'm the king of the world all
11:05
of this
11:06
and um anyway raised a lot of
11:08
controversy as you can probably imagine
11:10
and the reports of it are really good
11:12
the the apparently the couple
11:13
rejected the assertion that their
11:15
marriage was typically american
11:17
and the height of bad taste and the guy
11:20
organizing it said what's got to be
11:22
remembered is that every time a couple
11:24
gets married in a church they have to
11:26
walk through a graveyard to get to the
11:27
altar that's such a good fight
11:29
well it's a point it's a point
11:33
incredible good on them yeah imagine how
11:35
claustrophobic that would be
11:36
i think that's the least enjoyable
11:38
wedding i can imagine and
11:39
i think so also like if one of them
11:41
changes their mind just before it
11:43
happens
11:44
they've got a very long trip back up to
11:46
the surface in a very
11:47
very awkward yeah one person who is seen
11:51
as the person who survived the longest
11:54
in the ocean and then was rescued and
11:56
survived
11:57
was a guy called charles yaffin um he
11:59
was the chief
12:00
baker on board the titanic and when he
12:02
plunged into the ocean he was seen
12:04
plunging with two bottles of whiskey on
12:06
him
12:06
which he downed while he was in there
12:08
and he survived for two hours most
12:10
people perished after 15 minutes but he
12:12
survived two hours
12:13
he had the two bowls of whiskey and the
12:15
alcohol somehow
12:16
um they claim helped him to uh keep his
12:19
his body temperature
12:20
going he was also on a rough made out of
12:22
baguettes though wasn't it
12:25
surely you would make yours out of
12:27
baguettes rather than your raft
12:29
i guess the baguette is a multi-purpose
12:31
tool you can lash
12:32
you can lash a hundred together
12:36
um he was a complete legend so they
12:38
interviewed him after the titanic sunk
12:40
and it sounds like he was just
12:41
chilled the whole way through and he
12:43
wasn't just downing whiskey he did try
12:45
and save lots of people first so he made
12:47
sure the lifeboats were all stocked with
12:48
all his baked goods aside from the stuff
12:50
he used to make the raft and
12:52
he threw lots of deck chairs overboard
12:54
to make makeshift kind of rafts for
12:56
people so they could grab onto
12:58
and then he said he just went back to
12:59
his bed down whiskey watched the water
13:01
come
13:02
under the door pretty calmly just kind
13:04
of chilled and then
13:06
eventually uh he he knew that it was
13:08
best to stay
13:09
on the ship much like jack in titanic
13:12
stay on the ship until the very last
13:13
second
13:14
because you want to minimize your time
13:15
in the water went in the water
13:17
usually if you're hammered which he was
13:19
that would be really awful for you
13:21
because all your vessels are vasodilated
13:23
and you lose all the heat super fast
13:25
but they think because he was so relaxed
13:27
because of this whiskey and his general
13:28
personality
13:29
um it overrode the shock i think it's
13:31
the shock that kills lots of people
13:33
right the trauma often is what kills you
13:37
imagine being that chilled as a human
13:40
that even
13:41
at the titanic crash and sinking you're
13:44
still like
13:44
ah it's all right i can't believe
13:48
i mean we always hear about rearranging
13:50
the deck chairs on the titanic
13:52
and this is the first evidence i've ever
13:53
heard of what actually happened to the
13:55
deck test
14:01
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:04
that is
14:05
james okay my fact this week is that in
14:07
1927
14:09
an owl was found that had another owl in
14:12
its stomach
14:13
and that owl had a third owl in its
14:16
stomach
14:17
that's incredible i guess you could say
14:20
they were
14:21
cannibals you still could say that
14:25
honestly i've been trying i've been
14:26
waiting to say that since you sent this
14:27
fact around to all of us to research
14:29
and it was underwhelming as a moment for
14:32
me so
14:34
it was up there with the floating
14:35
vaseline for all of us and
14:37
underwhelming stakes this is amazing
14:41
yeah this is what is called an
14:43
interspecific
14:44
owl trophic chain which basically means
14:47
an hourly canal which eats another owl
14:50
and it's pretty much the only version of
14:53
it i could
14:54
find uh in owls at least and it was a
14:57
bad owl
14:58
um it was shot in new england and when
15:00
they opened it up it had a long eared
15:02
owl inside it
15:03
and when they opened that up it had an
15:04
eastern screech owl inside it
15:07
and what we can say about it is that
15:09
owls
15:10
they do eat other birds and they eat
15:12
other owls we've kind of um
15:13
we can learn about what they eat by
15:15
looking in their stomachs but it also
15:17
shows the second album must have eaten
15:19
the third owl
15:20
quite quickly before it was eaten itself
15:22
do you know if you know
15:23
so it wasn't even remnants it was almost
15:25
russian dolls it was almost russian
15:27
dolls
15:28
it wasn't full because obviously you
15:30
have to chew your owls before you can't
15:31
eat a whole owl
15:33
i forgot that you don't just down an
15:34
alpha yeah but also
15:36
russian dolls would be incredibly
15:38
distressing if you open them up and
15:39
there were just the minced remains of
15:40
another russian doll inside that
15:42
and then inside that were more bloodied
15:44
remnants it would be more realistic
15:46
though
15:47
so it would be absolutely right yeah
15:50
uh and yeah owls they they eat other
15:53
owls they eat lots of stuff they're
15:54
amazing
15:55
well so why did so this is the only
15:57
example of this what's it called
15:59
trophic something or other well action i
16:01
call it outlander
16:03
i'm calling it interspecific al trophic
16:06
chain but you can't call it kind of
16:08
bowelism if you want
16:09
it's oh i'm gonna go cannibalism because
16:11
i think scientists need to wait
16:13
for more than one instance of something
16:14
before they come up with an
16:16
unnecessarily long and convoluted name
16:18
for it
16:18
i think andy might well have coined a
16:20
new scientific
16:22
term here this is exciting
16:25
term very quickly this is like um the
16:27
only example of
16:28
an animal eating an animal eating an
16:30
animal of the same species the closest i
16:32
could think of was something we covered
16:33
in one of the book of the years which
16:34
was when a shark was eaten
16:36
by a shark that was caught by the shark
16:40
greg norman i forgot about that
16:44
he's a golfer whose nickname is the
16:45
shark yeah so he was fishing
16:48
otherwise we're just saying the shark
16:49
whose name is greg norman it doesn't
16:50
make any sense
16:53
if you have a pet shark you're very
16:55
unlikely to name it greg
16:58
you're gonna call it snappy or something
17:01
but yeah greg norman the um the golfer
17:03
was fishing and he caught a shark and
17:04
then that shark started eating another
17:06
shark so it's a three shark
17:08
yeah we have a couple of examples in the
17:11
fossil record
17:12
of animals eating other animals that
17:14
have just eaten other animals
17:15
um so for instance they found a fish
17:18
which was eaten by an amphibian which
17:20
was then eaten by a shark
17:22
and that was found in southwestern
17:24
germany and then we also found
17:26
a snake which was eaten by a lizard
17:28
which had just eaten a beetle
17:30
and weirdly so these are the only two
17:32
versions i can find in the whole fossil
17:34
record and that was also found in
17:35
germany so it seems
17:37
there's something about german animals
17:39
in the
17:40
late cretaceous
17:43
don't want to get racist about it but it
17:45
seemed like they were up for this kind
17:46
of thing
17:47
i'm not counting the beetle no i just a
17:50
beetle what's that what the hell is that
17:52
that doesn't count as an impressive
17:53
matryoshka that's if you get to the end
17:55
of your matryoshka and there's a grain
17:56
of rice at the bottom or something and
17:58
you're supposed to count
18:00
you need something that's effectively
18:01
the same size as the thing that's eaten
18:03
it to be impressive
18:04
okay yeah right sure so the an owl is
18:08
the opposite of a duck
18:09
i think that's nice yeah an owl is the
18:13
opposite of a duck
18:14
i think you're going to have to tell us
18:15
a bit give us a bit more my question
18:16
still holds
18:18
so um what is a duck famous for
18:21
quite yeah okay and owls don't
18:23
quack of course yeah
18:24
like it's it's famous for having like
18:27
feathers which
18:28
kind of repel water right water off a
18:30
duck's back and so it can live in the
18:32
water and whenever
18:34
any whenever it rains on them or
18:35
whenever any water gets on them it just
18:37
goes straight off them
18:38
but owls are one of the few birds that
18:40
don't have this at all
18:42
and they have got rid of any ability to
18:45
repel water from their feathers
18:47
and so if they get wet it's an absolute
18:49
nightmare if they go into the water to
18:50
try and catch a fish or something like
18:52
that
18:53
they can't even jump out and fly away
18:55
because the feathers
18:56
it's like a sheep trying to fly away the
18:58
feathers are just so full of water they
19:00
can't get out
19:01
and so they'll end up swimming instead
19:03
of flying
19:04
that's how bad they are but the reason
19:07
is
19:07
that if they had oil on their feathers
19:10
they would make more noise when they
19:12
flew around and they want to be as
19:14
stealthy as possible so they can catch
19:15
their prey
19:16
and so they've done away with the
19:18
ability for water to flow off them
19:20
in order to be more stealthy which i
19:22
think is really cool
19:23
that is amazing they are the opposite of
19:25
ducks
19:26
point-proven presumably if it starts
19:28
raining at night when al's hunting you
19:30
do hear the sound of owls just dropping
19:32
out of the air and onto the ground
19:36
you can't hear owls basically until they
19:39
are about three feet from your head
19:41
by which point it is too late because
19:43
they're so silent
19:44
and so you we don't really we've got
19:47
some idea about
19:48
why they're so quiet but i think the
19:49
full mechanism has yet to be properly
19:51
explained there was a review
19:52
last year about just why they are so
19:55
quiet
19:56
yeah they've looked at their feathers
19:57
haven't they and they found that they've
19:58
got like little
19:59
wrinkly bits on the side which means
20:01
that when air comes
20:03
yeah it kind of forms tiny little
20:05
vortices which make less
20:06
noise than if there was a load of
20:08
turbulence wow is that unique in the
20:10
the world of birds is it i haven't
20:12
checked them all i think it is
20:14
i i think i mean there are about 200
20:15
species of l and some of them are really
20:17
loud there's the largest owl in the
20:18
world is the
20:18
i think it's called the blackeston's
20:20
fish owl and that because it's hunting
20:21
fish
20:22
the fish can't hear anything that you're
20:24
doing above the water and they don't
20:26
care so
20:27
those owls are incredibly loud because
20:29
they're not trying to listen for mice
20:31
yeah but most most owls are unbelievably
20:34
quiet very cool and they're really slow
20:36
as well this is the thing i think
20:38
apart from birds that can actively hover
20:40
um owls might be the slowest birds in
20:42
the world
20:43
they can fly as slowly as two miles an
20:45
hour
20:46
so you could easily outrun an owl um no
20:49
that's not what i'm saying i'm not
20:51
saying that top speed is too much
20:53
so when they come at you and they're
20:55
only three feet away it's fine because
20:57
you have plenty of time to react
20:59
you just walk over to the other side of
21:01
the garden stroll away
21:03
um did you know that owls were uh
21:06
responsible for the second world war
21:08
oh god this is from the book owl there's
21:11
a book all about owls by desmond morris
21:13
and um there was a as a mythical bird
21:17
called the chick charney owl i think it
21:19
was caribbean it was on andros island
21:21
that's where it was
21:22
um and it looked like an owl and it was
21:24
based on a real hour which had gone
21:25
extinct a few hundred years before
21:26
anyway as a young man neville
21:28
chamberlain was chopping down trees on
21:31
andros island
21:32
and he came across uh a chick charlie
21:34
nest and nested this i must say mythical
21:36
bird this is all in the book
21:38
al um his workman refused to touch the
21:41
nest but he
21:42
ignored them and he chopped down the
21:43
tree himself and this created a curse on
21:46
him
21:47
then some years later he became the
21:49
british prime minister
21:51
okay and failed to stop hitler's
21:54
aggressive expansion and that's
21:55
supposedly why his failure at uh the
21:57
munich conference happened
21:59
why is andy left to say this kind of
22:00
22:02
i think he's not i mean who's supposing
22:05
that is it desmond morris the author of
22:06
the book al who i must say has a vested
22:08
interest in giving owls a stronger role
22:10
in history
22:12
who supposed that this curse happened i
22:14
don't think he created this story i
22:15
think the story is probably
22:16
one that's quite local to the region and
22:20
quite historically specific i'm not
22:22
saying it was the only factor in the
22:24
second world war but i don't think we
22:25
can discount it
22:26
that's a good point um hey i was looking
22:28
into people who've had owls for pets
22:30
because i i know that some people do
22:32
keep owls but i wondered if that was
22:34
ever a fashion i didn't find many people
22:36
but one person who did have an owl for a
22:37
pet was florence nightingale
22:40
um florence nightingale she had an owl
22:42
that she got from athens which was
22:44
called
22:44
athena and um she when she left athens
22:48
she took with her
22:49
not only the owl but she had a cicada
22:50
called plato and two tortoises mr and
22:53
mrs hill
22:54
um unfortunately they must have felt
22:57
like such
22:57
intellectual inferiors at the dinner
22:59
table with athena at plato
23:02
well mr and mrs hill were they um
23:04
married or were they brother and sister
23:06
uh oh not specified very good well they
23:08
could have been unrelated hills i guess
23:10
and then mrs hill got married to another
23:12
hill i guess
23:14
tortoises but then still hung out with
23:16
her brother yeah
23:18
and then and then she presumably split
23:19
mrs hill up from her husband the other
23:21
mr hill in order to adopt them as pets
23:24
exactly all the evidence points towards
23:26
the spouses doesn't it
23:27
it does it does unfortunately um the
23:30
animals became so there were four of
23:32
them they became three
23:33
when um unfortunately athena ate
23:37
plato um cicada um
23:40
so but she saw that as two pets merging
23:42
into one which was more convenient
23:43
because she carried
23:44
she carried the owl around with her a
23:46
lot in uh when she went on the
23:48
walks and so on um wow but i wonder how
23:51
many parents have ever tried that excuse
23:53
on their children
23:53
when the dog has just eaten the cat no
23:56
it's all right you've got both of them
23:58
now
24:01
so athena unfortunately you know
24:03
florence nightingale known as someone
24:05
who nursed a lot of people in the
24:07
crimean war um
24:08
athena is actually a casualty of the
24:10
crimean war because
24:11
when florence went to the crimean war
24:13
she left athena
24:15
in her house in the attic with some food
24:17
and assuming that she would survive on
24:19
any
24:19
mice that would be running around and um
24:21
she abandoned that house and they
24:23
eventually went back and they found
24:24
athena dead inside the attic because
24:26
obviously
24:27
i know what you're saying but i wouldn't
24:29
say that's a casualty of the crimean war
24:32
it didn't show up in the weekly stats
24:37
that's that's something you read out at
24:39
the end of the traumatizing news of
24:40
another battle of the crimean war added
24:42
lighter news and owl has been abandoned
24:44
to die
24:47
well if you live in london you can still
24:49
visit athena the owl because
24:51
um it was there's no point now it was
24:53
recovered and sent to taxidermy so
24:55
athena the owl is kept at saint thomas's
24:58
in the florence nightingale museum i
25:00
wonder if anyone's opened up athena to
25:02
see if plato's still there
25:08
okay it is time for fact number three
25:11
and that is
25:12
andy my fact is that almost every
25:14
englishman at the battle of agincourt
25:16
ate a small amount of soil
25:18
just before the battle started wow
25:21
why did they do that yeah why did they
25:24
do that it's a good question
25:26
um i think it was symbolic
25:30
i well obviously it was symbolic because
25:33
there was no practical
25:34
there was no nutritional value to this
25:36
no so we should say briefly what
25:38
what azuka was it was one of the
25:40
principally remembered battles
25:42
of uh the hundred years war or the
25:44
series of wars that we now we know is
25:46
the hundred years war it was in 1415
25:48
and the reason it's widely remembered in
25:50
england is because it was a big english
25:51
victory over france and a lot of the
25:53
other
25:53
battles of the hundred years war have
25:56
slightly been allowed to slip into
25:58
um they're quite well well known in
25:59
france i would say the other battles of
26:01
100
26:02
as well 100 between the two sides we're
26:04
covering
26:05
yeah memorials of all matters except the
26:07
exclusive fans
26:08
all our french listeners right now going
26:10
well i've not heard this they've dug up
26:12
something really neat
26:14
they genuinely in france it's not really
26:16
taught i mean do write in
26:18
if you have heard of it but i think it's
26:19
not famous at all in france which is
26:21
bizarre because for any non-british
26:23
listeners
26:24
agincourt is extremely well known here
26:27
for that reason even though it was super
26:28
short it only lasted maybe half an hour
26:30
i found the brilliant website um it's
26:33
run by the university of southampton
26:34
that has a list of
26:35
everyone who was fighting agincourt uh
26:38
actually everyone who was
26:39
who they could find from the whole
26:41
hundred years war um but they have the
26:43
specific people who they know are at
26:44
agincourt
26:45
uh and it's a great long list obviously
26:47
there were thousands of thousands of um
26:49
soldiers
26:50
um so i went through that and we had one
26:53
guy called thomas sadler
26:54
who actually was a saddler that was his
26:57
job that's right there was a guy called
26:58
john horsey who was a knight
27:00
and there was a guy called matthew bower
27:02
who was an archer
27:04
brian and they also have the whole
27:07
french team as well
27:08
like all the french soldiers that were
27:10
there and there were 64 french soldiers
27:13
at the battle of agincourt called colin
27:15
really wow and four of those were called
27:18
colin poisson
27:19
calling the fish fish colin poisson
27:21
there were four colin poissons at the
27:23
battle of asian car
27:24
seriously wow are we sure that's real
27:28
those weren't there's no plato cicadas
27:30
there
27:32
it's real they should get the academics
27:34
onto this list because
27:35
there's been debate raging since the
27:37
battle of ashen court about how many
27:39
soldiers fought there and it's still
27:41
very very vigorous um so they should
27:43
just count all the names on that
27:45
because there's all sorts of
27:45
exaggerations so the english got taught
27:47
for a good few hundred years that they
27:49
were outnumbered about 10 times
27:51
um or 20 times you know the french had
27:54
hundreds of thousands of times more
27:55
soldiers but i think they think now that
27:57
it was about two to one don't they
27:58
in terms of outnumbering yeah which is
28:00
still good like that but the english had
28:02
more archers twice as many arches
28:03
so if you do again if you're a broad
28:05
listener if you do a word association
28:07
agincourt i think people go longbow
28:10
because that was the huge deal at
28:13
agincourt it was the english decided
28:15
we're gonna just rely on having most of
28:17
our people being archers
28:19
uh we've got this great long boat that
28:21
the welsh gave us thank you wales
28:22
and we're just gonna fire at them from
28:24
behind whereas the french
28:26
were a bit more into their chivalry and
28:28
their knights in shining
28:30
heavy annoying armor and they didn't
28:33
really like the bow they thought it was
28:34
a bit ungentlemanly
28:35
so they just had shed loads of cavalry
28:37
which as it turned out when it was
28:39
pissing with rain and the mud was thigh
28:41
deep
28:41
and the horses just sank into it was a
28:43
disadvantage well the thing is it's like
28:45
in theory it's not that much of a
28:47
disadvantage because if you're wearing a
28:49
full suit of armor
28:50
there's not many places that those
28:51
arrows can get in like it could hit you
28:54
in the neck it could hit you in the
28:55
groin
28:56
there's one or two other places all the
28:57
places where it could hit you and not
28:58
very nice but the chances are it would
29:00
bounce off you
29:01
but of course what happened was the um
29:03
arrows hit the
29:04
horses and then the horses just went
29:06
crazy because they'd been hit by an
29:08
arrow
29:08
and they unseated the riders who were
29:10
then in a whole load of mud
29:12
with a whole load of extremely heavy
29:14
armor and
29:15
just we're sitting ducks for the for the
29:18
english
29:19
the opposite of sitting owls
29:20
[Laughter]
29:24
there was a moment just before the
29:25
battle because all the all the english
29:27
archers
29:27
um were facing a lot of them facing the
29:29
french lines they had a stake in the
29:30
ground in front of them as an
29:32
anti-cavalry device
29:33
you know which is a good and when you
29:34
say steak you need a piece of wood
29:37
no i mean i mean a nice t-bone mistake
29:40
that they would leave the um ground it
29:43
was
29:44
it was to try and freak out the french
29:46
horses they say we're gonna this is what
29:47
you're gonna have be after this battle
29:49
right sorry they had a massive sharpened
29:52
wooden stake and that yeah they stuck it
29:53
in the ground
29:54
you know facing the french lines but
29:55
there was this weird moment just before
29:56
the battle where all the
29:58
english were told can you advance a bit
30:00
so that we are in range of the french
30:02
cavalry because the french hadn't lined
30:04
up and started moving yet
30:05
and the english had to come around to
30:07
the front of their stake all these
30:09
archers
30:10
heave the stake out of the ground very
30:12
um strong exercise required to do that
30:14
it's quite an
30:15
exertion um move the stake forward a
30:17
fair bit so you're in line
30:19
you so that you're in range of the
30:20
french and then hammer the steak back
30:22
into the ground facing the french
30:24
cavalry again wow and you have to do all
30:26
of this
30:26
while you're completely exposed your
30:28
back is to the enemy and the french
30:30
observed this happening and did nothing
30:31
about it it was a really strange
30:34
lapse on the french side and like yeah
30:36
i'm sure proper historians could account
30:38
for it but i just don't know why that
30:39
happened i did
30:40
i think it was a big disadvantage to
30:42
attack so i always think the beginning
30:43
of a battle
30:44
reminds me a bit of the beginning of a
30:45
cycling race you know what those races
30:47
james you like cycling where they
30:48
in the velodrome yeah yeah yeah where
30:50
they're all really really slow to start
30:52
off with and as soon as one of them goes
30:54
oh yeah exactly omnic omni honor
30:56
something i can't remember
30:57
yes what's the disadvantage why is it
30:59
why is it bad to start
31:00
in cycling what it is is um if you're in
31:03
someone's slipstream it's a lot easier
31:04
so it's better for them to go first you
31:06
to go behind them and then you can
31:07
overtake them at the last second
31:09
uh but i don't know why it's in battle
31:11
in battle same thing it's a slipstream
31:13
issue
31:15
you're it's it's easier to defend than
31:17
to attack was the generally accepted
31:18
wisdom so you didn't want to be the army
31:20
attacking i think you probably you know
31:21
you start losing your shape when you
31:22
attack whereas you keep it when you
31:24
defend so
31:24
there was this weird moment where uh
31:26
before the battle they had their battle
31:28
lines
31:28
lined up and they sent some heralds to
31:31
meet in the middle
31:32
and say hey are you going to cave and
31:34
then the other herald said no and vice
31:36
versa so the heralds went back and said
31:38
okay we're at war
31:39
and then no one moved for ages they just
31:41
stood staring at each other
31:42
because no one wanted to be the first to
31:44
attack and yeah the french weren't
31:45
attacking one attacking and eventually
31:47
the english thought i saw it will do it
31:49
then isn't that a large ship wasn't
31:50
there that stat about
31:52
during wartime about how many bullets
31:54
were shot to miss as opposed to kill
31:56
people people would fire above the heads
31:58
of the enemy because they
32:00
they didn't want to be someone who took
32:01
a life there's like a huge number of
32:04
shots were
32:05
aimed to miss they say that about
32:07
vietnam don't they
32:08
um yeah i think that's a slightly
32:10
different thing more about the
32:11
psychology of not wanting to kill
32:13
someone isn't it
32:14
oh so you think that not starting it is
32:17
a strategy
32:18
that's what that's the way it has to
32:19
study yeah yeah yeah that girl starting
32:22
these guys did not have a problem with
32:24
killing as many people as they possibly
32:26
could
32:27
okay don't you're right the benefit of
32:29
the doubt there right
32:30
um do you know that um a few years after
32:33
the
32:33
war six years after the battle of ashen
32:36
court henry v
32:37
sent back a cavalry of soldiers back to
32:40
france
32:40
um and do you guys know why he had left
32:44
his wallet and that's him
32:48
no i don't know he he sent them in to
32:50
collect the foreskin of jesus
32:52
of course that was gonna be my next
32:54
guess yeah i knew if i gave you a bit
32:56
more time
32:56
um wow yeah so um because so he got
32:59
married to
33:00
catherine uh who was the daughter of the
33:02
french king and she was expecting her
33:03
first baby and he heard rumors that uh
33:06
france had the foreskin of jesus christ
33:08
they're one of the holy relics so he
33:10
sent his his men
33:11
back in to to pick it up without any
33:13
sort of uh hassle
33:15
or um or resistance and they brought it
33:17
back and it was brought to catherine
33:19
and supposedly as it's reported the
33:21
scent of
33:22
the foreskin helped her to give birth to
33:24
henry vi
33:25
in a nice calm way did you as if they
33:28
rub it under her nose and it
33:30
yeah the sweet scent i don't know if
33:31
they dangled it like an air freshener in
33:32
front of her if they actually physically
33:34
rubbed it
33:35
i don't think they used the foreskin of
33:37
jesus as an air freight
33:38
you wouldn't have that in the christmas
33:40
tree dangling in your car would you
33:43
what flavor is this um yeah no but
33:47
supposedly it the scent of it the sweet
33:49
scent of it helped her
33:51
for a natural growth so yeah what a
33:53
great baby shower present
33:54
that really outdoes all the other
33:55
presents at a baby shower doesn't it if
33:57
you're the one who brought jesus's
33:58
foreskin
33:59
they always say about really um like
34:01
privileged children they were born with
34:03
jesus's foreskin in the mouth
34:08
we've already been excommunicated
34:09
multiple times for mentioning jesus
34:11
haven't we so yeah why not one more time
34:14
yeah um
34:14
sorry just what we're on catherine i
34:16
read another thing which is that
34:18
um samuel peeps kissed her did he uh
34:22
what yeah but this was 200 years
34:25
between 200 years between yeah so he
34:27
wrote this in his diary it was show
34:29
tuesday 1669 and um she was buried
34:33
in westminster abbey and she had an
34:36
alabaster and all that sort of stuff but
34:37
um
34:38
a lot of attacks happened like i think
34:40
it was henry viii got rid of the
34:42
alabaster um
34:43
didn't like the idea of her and but her
34:46
um
34:46
coffin her crypt was still there and it
34:48
busted open in 1669 revealing
34:51
her corpse inside uh so the lid was open
34:54
and people could visit the open lid
34:55
of catherine and samuel peeps leaned in
34:58
and gave her a kiss
35:00
and reported it in his diary that um uh
35:03
at 36 years old
35:05
and i did kiss a queen he wrote it was
35:07
on his birthday
35:08
i mean did he really kiss a queen or did
35:11
he just
35:12
you know nuzzle of cops
35:16
yeah feels like a bit of a stretch it
35:18
feels a bit me too to be honest
35:19
a queen's a queen forever like the queen
35:21
always refers to queen elizabeth as her
35:23
majesty
35:23
as a queen elizabeth the first so okay
35:27
yeah it's i'm i'm with peeps i think he
35:29
nailed it great birthday present
35:30
it's up there with foreskin of jesus in
35:32
terms of good gifts
35:35
um some of the myths about agincourt
35:37
come from shakespeare because he wrote
35:39
um henry v um great play that is mostly
35:42
set at the battle of
35:43
asian car uh and one of the characters
35:46
in
35:46
henry v is falstaff uh and he is based
35:50
on a real person who was there
35:52
um who was not called falstaff but was
35:54
called falstaff
35:55
who was a famous person who was at the
35:57
battle and later went on to run a pub
36:00
in sonic but this guy i think the bbc
36:03
need to make
36:04
a massive budget tv series about
36:07
falstaff
36:08
because he is amazing he fought at the
36:10
battle of agincourt
36:12
he won another battle called the battle
36:13
of the herrings where he was at the sea
36:16
and the french came to attack him and he
36:18
got a load of herring barrels and put
36:20
them all in a big line
36:21
and then hid behind them and attacked
36:23
the french from there
36:24
uh he had fought against joan of arc at
36:27
the siege of orleans
36:28
um the was rumors that uh john fasdolf
36:31
was coming
36:32
and the um brother of joan of arc
36:35
decided not to tell her
36:36
because everyone was so scared of this
36:38
guy and they thought oh if they know
36:39
that
36:40
fast off is coming then everyone's going
36:41
to panic so they didn't tell her
36:43
and joan of arc said to her brother
36:45
bastard bastard in the name of god i
36:47
command you
36:48
that as soon as you hear of fastoff's
36:50
coming you will let me know for if he
36:52
gets through without my knowing it i
36:54
swear to you that i will have your head
36:55
cut off
36:57
and he was at another battle where the
36:58
english got routed
37:00
uh and he was one of the only people
37:02
whose group of soldiers managed to
37:03
survive
37:04
but it meant that everyone else thought
37:06
that he'd been cowardly when he hadn't
37:07
been cowardly it had just been
37:08
the way that the battle had worked out
37:10
and he lost his reputation and had to go
37:12
back to the uk
37:13
and he'd been a hero but everyone
37:15
thought he was a coward
37:16
he's just amazing and then all of his
37:18
money went to the foundation of modern
37:20
college
37:21
um so okay he's like this so we're
37:24
finally rejuvenating full staff's
37:25
reputation is that what we're doing
37:27
today i think so we're saving full staff
37:28
he was the baron of silly
37:30
in france i mean what more do you need
37:33
about this guy he was
37:35
your title although a bit of a
37:38
misleading title if i went to see the
37:39
baron of silly
37:40
as a movie he is shakespeare's recurring
37:42
character isn't he i always like that
37:43
there's a
37:44
you know it pops up three times yeah
37:46
feels like a funny easter egg every time
37:48
he comes
37:48
a little call back um henry v is
37:51
obviously used a lot
37:53
uh still today the that that rousing
37:55
speech
37:56
that he gives in um for many things like
37:58
football
37:59
you know if there's the world cup
38:01
someone might do an advert giving that
38:02
speech
38:03
but one person who was particularly fond
38:06
of it
38:06
and got into movies as a result during
38:08
world war ii was winston churchill
38:11
so churchill actively became a producer
38:14
or a sort of accredited help on a movie
38:17
of henry v
38:19
and enlisted lawrence olivier to play it
38:21
because he wanted it to be seen
38:23
as a stirring thing for the british as
38:26
and and trailers were released on the
38:28
day that the troops were
38:30
invading normandy and they used a
38:32
trailer where they showed modern day
38:34
london and then brought it back into the
38:35
old
38:36
london to sort of help people get
38:38
excited that you know this is something
38:40
we'll conquer and something that we'll
38:41
do
38:42
it's not the only time that winston
38:43
churchill did that either during world
38:44
war ii
38:45
he then got laurence olivier to make
38:47
another and when i say got him he
38:48
encouraged him but i guess that was a
38:50
pretty
38:50
strong encouragement during wartime to
38:53
make a movie
38:54
about um nelson and emma hamilton
38:57
because in the movie which was made
38:59
predominantly for americans he wanted to
39:01
draw parallels between napoleon
39:03
and adolf hitler and have the american
39:05
public see that movie as something
39:07
whereby they needed to come and get
39:08
behind it
39:09
um so lawrence olivier is sort of like a
39:11
bizarre propaganda spy for the british
39:13
maybe if winston churchill spent less
39:15
time directing films and more time
39:16
winning the war it wouldn't have lasted
39:18
six years
39:18
yeah well maybe if uh counterparty if he
39:21
was at chamberlain hadn't seen that owl
39:23
that time
39:24
then we wouldn't have had a good point
39:25
about the war in the first place there's
39:28
so many big ifs
39:31
okay it's time for our final fact of the
39:33
show and that
39:34
is anna my fact this week is that the
39:37
first known coloring book
39:38
was meant for adults wow and it's
39:42
just it's just been re-found
39:44
rediscovered
39:45
or in 2017 it was rediscovered did they
39:48
just find one that had been colored in
39:50
is that
39:51
is that what happened they it actually
39:53
hasn't been colored in
39:54
so someone obviously had it and then
39:56
didn't even use it because otherwise you
39:58
wouldn't be able to tell it was a
39:59
coloring in book
40:00
if it's been colored in really well it's
40:01
just a book that's a good point
40:04
imagine if you had a kid so good at
40:05
coloring in people browse through the
40:07
coloring in book just thought it was a
40:08
book
40:09
they would think that you had a really
40:10
weird taste of books
40:15
seems to be all the books on your
40:16
bookcase are just pictures of
40:18
birds
40:21
well this was pictures of flowers in
40:23
fact so this was a book called the
40:25
florist it was published in 1760 by a
40:27
guy called robert sayer
40:29
and rediscovered in a missouri botanic
40:31
garden in 2017
40:33
and it said on the front cover it was
40:35
for the use and amusement of gentlemen
40:37
and ladies and then inside i had
40:39
instructions for how to color all the
40:41
pictures in so it was just lots of
40:42
pictures you can look it up online
40:44
it's very beautiful it's all publicly
40:45
available and you know it had techniques
40:48
it told you what color you should do the
40:50
flowers so none of this freedom that the
40:52
kids have now
40:53
and it had sort of been recipes to mix
40:55
your own colors or it said you know you
40:57
can also get pre-mixed colors from the
40:59
publisher of this book fyi if you want
41:02
and it was great i don't know why the
41:03
person didn't color it in i would have
41:05
well maybe he didn't have all the
41:07
specific colored pencils that you needed
41:09
to have to do it because if you're not
41:10
allowed to have your own freedom and
41:12
color
41:12
all your flowers in black like i used to
41:14
do with all my coloring books then oh my
41:16
gosh
41:18
wow such a little god
41:22
so emo yeah you're right maybe it was
41:24
like when you know when you buy an
41:25
electric toy for a kid and they open it
41:27
up and you realize it hasn't come with
41:28
the batteries
41:29
it was like that when you got home and
41:31
then really have to order the bloody
41:32
paints
41:33
but actually isn't it true that someone
41:35
had been using the book to press flowers
41:37
i think this one that they found so they
41:39
opened it up and they hadn't colored it
41:41
in
41:41
but they seemed to have placed flowers
41:43
on top of where they should have been
41:45
colored in
41:46
yeah completely misunderstood the first
41:48
well it's true it was the first one
41:50
like it's not obvious what to do is it
41:52
yeah it's the first ever
41:53
maybe it was built as a pressure flowers
41:55
book and we we then changed it into a
41:57
coloring book
41:58
i was in you were meant to put the
42:00
flower on top of the outline of the
42:01
flower yeah and fill it in like a
42:03
football sticker album basically
42:04
yes that's panini is this the first
42:06
panini album yeah
42:07
god that would that would be such a good
42:09
idea actually as a flower collecting
42:10
book
42:10
it's explicitly not what this is he's
42:12
very clear in the instructions
42:14
but there should be one of those um anna
42:17
from the article you sent around it
42:18
looks like there were some earlier
42:20
not full coloring books but there were
42:22
illustrations distributed which were
42:24
designed to be colored in by readers
42:25
these woodcuts of christ well a lot of
42:27
people did color them in yeah
42:29
yeah they're from the 15th century and
42:31
they're all we know that people color
42:33
them in because we have all these
42:34
different versions of them where some
42:35
people
42:35
have just done it's the picture of the
42:38
crucifixion some people have just done
42:39
the blood or some people have just
42:40
colored in the the christ figure
42:41
and then some people have gone to town
42:43
and they've colored in the angels and
42:44
they've got it in the background did
42:45
anyone color everything in black oh
42:48
no no no we went through so much
42:51
charcoal when i was a child
42:56
um they're gorgeous things yeah they are
42:59
and people used to hang them up didn't
43:00
they i like the idea of the art on your
43:02
wall
43:02
being something that you'd half made so
43:04
would you say a wood cut was just when
43:06
you
43:06
they carved into wood and then they the
43:08
manufacturers
43:09
rolled ink over the wood so all the bits
43:12
that were carved
43:12
had no ink in them um and then you say
43:15
you had the outline
43:16
and then yeah people would paint them
43:17
home and hang them on the walls to
43:19
impress visitors
43:20
but when you look at some of those like
43:21
wood cuts and stuff like that from the
43:24
you know around that time which would
43:25
have been what 15 16th century
43:27
like jura for instance things like that
43:30
you kind of think you look at those
43:32
if you're in a museum and think well why
43:33
didn't people color those in it makes
43:35
complete sense
43:36
like yeah you know well they did so a
43:39
lot of book this was the first explicit
43:40
coloring book meant for the purpose but
43:42
probably inspired by the fact that
43:43
everyone was coloring in their
43:44
manuscripts all the time
43:45
so there are lots of manuscripts that
43:47
exist that people at home would color in
43:49
because there was no color printing
43:51
and so and even very limited by that
43:53
point color printing
43:55
so people just would do it themselves
43:57
that's so cool
43:58
do you guys want to know one pleasing
43:59
irony of coloring in oh yes
44:02
um in 1962 in the early 60s there was a
44:05
huge great craze for coloring in books
44:07
massive and lots of those were for
44:08
adults too barbra streisand released a
44:10
song
44:11
in 1962 called my colouring book really
44:14
and uh it was a minor minor hit for her
44:16
made me realize how well barbra
44:17
streisand is for one thing but
44:19
pleasingly there is now a barbra
44:21
streisand coloring in book oh very nice
44:23
that is good yeah
44:24
i don't think it's linked to the song
44:25
especially it's just that there are
44:26
coming books or everything
44:27
well 60s that was a huge boom for the
44:30
coloring book wasn't it and particularly
44:31
as a tool of satire
44:33
um so there were a few books there was a
44:34
jfk coloring in book which stayed in the
44:37
charts for like 14 weeks on the new york
44:39
times uh bestsellers list
44:40
but they were released not to be colored
44:43
in basically they were coloring books
44:44
that you were meant to leave alone
44:46
because they were sort of um a new
44:48
version of a great satirical cartoon
44:50
that would appear in the newspapers or
44:51
in the
44:52
the magazines so they found that there
44:54
was no boom
44:55
in sales of crayons and pencil colored
44:57
pencils in the period where there was
44:59
the boom of all these big coloring books
45:02
that were released yeah they were more i
45:04
guess like novelty humor books where
45:06
the captions underneath gave you a great
45:08
gag so there was one about
45:09
being corporate and um so you would have
45:12
to color in the suit that i have to wear
45:13
which is gray please color it in gray or
45:15
i'll be fired
45:16
that was the first one i think so i like
45:18
the fact that the first modern coloring
45:19
book
45:20
was you were supposed to color
45:21
everything in grey james you would have
45:23
loved it with your little charcoal
45:24
yeah that's a rock shape one that was
45:27
pretty dark that one wasn't it it was
45:29
like
45:29
this is my train it takes me to the
45:31
office every day you meet lots of
45:33
interesting people on the train
45:34
color them all grey and then the only
45:37
bit where you had to put any color in it
45:39
was like
45:40
this is my pill it is round it is pink
45:43
it makes me not care yeah that's pretty
45:46
dumb it is really dark it's called the
45:47
executive
45:48
executive coloring book if anyone wants
45:50
to check it out um
45:51
did you did you see the conspiracy
45:53
theory one then i thought this would be
45:54
i did
45:55
yeah yeah so good there's one it has a
45:58
blank page and it says how many
45:59
communists can you find in this picture
46:01
i can find 11.
46:05
amazing there was a modern coloring book
46:07
craze
46:08
which a lot of listeners would probably
46:09
remember which was about three years ago
46:10
um
46:11
almost all the listeners i will say andy
46:13
unless we've got some very young ones
46:14
some of our older listeners might
46:16
remember that
46:18
i mean you might not have been paying
46:19
attention to the coloring
46:21
trend oh my word
46:24
um yeah but there was obviously there
46:27
was a huge rash of new books published i
46:29
found an
46:29
article from the scottish library
46:31
website scottish national library it has
46:33
an article in 2016 headlined
46:35
yes we have coloring books in our
46:36
library but sorry you can't color them
46:38
in
46:39
and this is just clarifying what you
46:40
couldn't do that's really interesting
46:42
though isn't it if you
46:44
go to the library and you get a coloring
46:45
book surely you should be
46:47
like what's the point of getting that
46:48
out if you can't color it in that's
46:50
weird wow
46:50
quite well it said it also went on to
46:53
clarify you can come and look at the
46:54
magic eye books and squint at them
46:56
and see the pictures hidden in the pages
46:58
but you could look at but not solve
47:00
our sudoku books what you could do is
47:02
color them in
47:03
and then tip x out your coloring
47:05
afterwards and then the next person
47:07
could color over the tip x
47:09
well i i sometimes think it's fun to try
47:12
and do a crossword if you don't have a
47:13
pen on you you can just do the crossword
47:15
in your head and you know that's a fun
47:18
way of
47:19
spending time so you could do a coloring
47:20
book in your head
47:22
oh
47:27
does the website also say can the guy
47:28
who keeps pressing plants into our books
47:30
please refrain from that in the future
47:34
do we think they're good or bad there's
47:36
some controversy about whether you
47:37
should even give coloring books to
47:39
children
47:39
because maybe it's huge controversy um
47:42
what as in because it might make them
47:44
violence or something
47:46
oh wow james i know you had a very dark
47:47
upbringing but some of us put colors in
47:50
our coloring i was just thinking like
47:51
usually when there's a moral panic about
47:53
not giving things to children it's
47:55
because it's going to turn them to drugs
47:56
or violence isn't it
47:58
the call of duty coloring book might
48:00
prompt children to violence or whatever
48:01
it's a really good point um i don't
48:03
think this is something that's been
48:04
considered yet but
48:05
this was first raised in the 1950s by
48:08
the sort of leader in art education
48:10
a guy called victor lovenfeld and he
48:12
said colouring books have a devastating
48:14
effect on children
48:15
and it's because they don't let them
48:17
develop their own ideas so the idea is
48:19
that you've given
48:20
them a picture and they just have to
48:22
stick within the confines of that
48:23
picture
48:24
and he was saying they not only do they
48:25
not inspire children to be imaginative
48:28
but also they kind of make them have
48:30
really low self-confidence because
48:31
children look at these really good
48:32
pictures in the coloring book
48:34
and they think well i'm never going to
48:35
draw as well as that i've just tried to
48:36
draw sunshine and it ended up a square
48:39
and so they're not even going to attempt
48:41
to draw themselves
48:42
and there is quite a lot of back and
48:43
forth about whether it's bad for you
48:45
know
48:45
children's imagination then they start
48:47
getting violence i guess after that
48:49
and then they put punch in the face yeah
48:51
that's really interesting
48:52
you know these coloring books where they
48:54
it's colored by numbers
48:55
so yeah it might be when you look at it
48:58
sometimes you might look at it you might
49:00
not see what the image is until you
49:01
colour it in and then you realize what
49:03
it is
49:04
there was one of those in the
49:05
netherlands and it turned out that if
49:07
when you colored it in it was actually
49:08
adolf hitler
49:10
and the problem was that they had nev
49:13
they bought these coloring books but
49:14
they'd never colored them in to see what
49:16
the images were and it was only when
49:17
people took them home and colored them
49:19
in that they realized that it was that
49:20
often
49:21
wow and they said they deeply regretted
49:23
the incident
49:24
and it remains unclear why hitler was
49:26
included in their coloring books
49:28
and the guy said his suspicion is that
49:30
the man who created it because it was
49:32
someone in india who'd created this book
49:34
they just didn't know who hitler was and
49:36
they'd taken him out of a
49:37
you know just a book of historical
49:39
figures well they just took the time man
49:41
of the year for 1938.
49:47
while we're on um paint by numbers um
49:49
this is
49:50
very similar to coloring in obviously um
49:53
so dan we know who invented them uh
49:56
again because it's relatively recently
49:58
it was invented but
49:59
it was a guy called dan robbins who only
50:01
died last year actually um
50:03
it was in 1951 and he was working at a
50:06
paint company and he was given the task
50:08
of selling more paint
50:09
and he came up with this method to sell
50:12
small quantities of paint but if you
50:14
though it was popular obviously you'd
50:15
sell a lot
50:16
and um there's a there's an online
50:18
museum of paint by numbers which has 60
50:20
000 of them
50:21
and it says that he is the most
50:23
exhibited artist in the world
50:25
his work you know he does all the
50:27
drawings it has been displayed on more
50:29
walls than any other artist
50:31
which is quite a pleasing idea it's a
50:34
loose definition of the word artist
50:36
isn't it
50:37
he always said this is not when you're
50:39
doing a paint by numbers it's not art
50:41
per se but you are getting the
50:43
the same sensation as as people have
50:44
when they are creating art and that's a
50:46
it's a kind of gateway in some ways so
50:48
he was always very modest about what it
50:50
was so was the idea that
50:52
like if they had a lot of orange paint
50:54
to sell for instance yeah
50:56
they might do a load of paint by numbers
50:59
with umper lumpers in them or something
51:00
like they would yeah they would sell the
51:02
oranges yeah
51:04
i knew there was something famous that
51:06
was orange in color but i just can't
51:08
think of it wasn't i almost went for
51:10
blackpool football kits
51:12
oh wow that would have been niche it's
51:14
too niche
51:15
if they had a lot of black paint to sell
51:17
they specifically marketed to the
51:19
family he always claimed that he was
51:21
inspired by leonardo da vinci so in his
51:23
autobiography he wrote that he'd once
51:25
heard leonardo da vinci would hand out
51:27
numbered patterns to his apprentices in
51:28
his workshops and then the apprentices
51:30
could fill in the colours and
51:31
i must have wasted about six hours
51:33
yesterday trying to find any
51:35
original evidence that leonardo da vinci
51:37
or michelangelo which is also what
51:38
sometimes claimed
51:39
did this and i can't so i'm begging you
51:42
any art historians out there if you've
51:43
got evidence of this
51:45
yeah please write in but they used to be
51:47
hung on people's walls which i find odd
51:49
when i did paint by numbers
51:50
it wasn't the sort of thing my mum would
51:52
then frame put on the wall but
51:53
people would hang them on their walls in
51:55
the 50s what were you doing
51:56
president eisenhower had them hung up in
51:58
the uh like corridor in the world
52:00
really that's so cool if donald trump
52:03
could do it without going out of the
52:04
lines he would do exactly the same thing
52:12
okay that's it that is all of our facts
52:14
thank you so much for listening if you'd
52:15
like to get in contact with any of us
52:17
about the things that we've said over
52:18

[Music]
52:56
i've wasted a full a full cycling trip's
52:59
worth of vaseline here
53:01
what do you do where do you put it for
53:02
your cycling oh anna
53:04
you will be able to find that if you
53:05
look it up online yeah okay
53:08
it's certainly not going inside your
53:09
pants put it that way
53:11
no hang on

53:24
pants

[Music]
00:14
hello and welcome to another working
00:17
from home episode of no such thing as a
00:19
fish a weekly podcast coming to you from
00:21
four undisclosed locations in the uk my
00:24
name is dan schreiber i'm sitting here
00:26
with andrew hunter murray james harkin
00:28
and anna tajinski and once again we have
00:30
gathered round the microphones with our
00:32
four favorite facts from the last seven
00:34
days and in no particular order here we
00:37
go
00:38
starting this week with my fact my fact
00:40
is sand dunes are brilliant at social
00:43
distancing
00:45
okay topical
00:47
very topical so uh they're safe sand
00:50
dunes are inanimate objects
00:53
okay so i would suggest that if they're
00:55
two meters apart they will always remain
00:57
two meters apart is that as in they're
00:59
not moving are they they sand dunes do
01:02
move they constantly are traveling
01:04
through the desert they are a body that
01:06
falls over on itself and and travels uh
01:10
so yeah sand dunes are constantly
01:12
shifting and that's why when deserts
01:13
encroach on places you've got these
01:15
giant waves of sand dunes that head
01:18
towards you it's like an army but
01:20
scientists in cambridge university have
01:23
sort of simulated they've built an
01:24
experiment whereby they've been able to
01:26
study the movement of sand dunes and
01:28
they've discovered that basically they
01:31
do communicate with each other in in you
01:33
know inverted commas communicate with
01:35
each other by sending signals to not
01:37
encroach on their patch so they don't
01:39
collide
01:40
we still fully don't understand why it
01:42
is i mean it's pretty extraordinary the
01:43
latest theory that they've come up with
01:45
is it's much like if you're in a boat
01:47
and there's the wake of the boat pushing
01:49
the water back behind you it's pushing
01:51
the sand dune behind it to keep it at a
01:53
regular distance although we should say
01:55
because otherwise i think people would
01:56
be confused when you say collide and
01:58
it's a mystery why they don't crash into
01:59
each other obviously the main reason
02:01
they don't clash and crash into each
02:02
other is because they're moved by winds
02:04
and air currents and so you don't get
02:06
one moving in one direction and another
02:07
moving in the opposite direction and
02:09
then galloping towards each other very
02:10
often so when we say crashing into each
02:12
other it's almost always one sneaking up
02:15
on the other or you know how you know
02:17
how calm one of them doesn't go a bit
02:19
faster than the other and it does seem
02:20
to be doesn't it that the one in front
02:23
um slow effectively slows down the one
02:25
behind
02:26
exactly and and it's worth saying that
02:28
there are different speeds though to
02:29
sand dunes so a big sand dune is much
02:32
slower than a smaller sand dune and when
02:34
i say much slower i do realize we're
02:35
talking by centimeters per year but they
02:39
do travel at different speeds and even
02:40
the smaller ones will respect a distance
02:44
gradually as of as some kind of
02:46
communication
02:47
again it's all theories so is what
02:49
you're saying like a little guy will go
02:50
really really fast until it gets a
02:52
certain distance away from the big guy
02:54
and then it'll go okay now i'm going to
02:55
respect the distance and i'm just going
02:57
to slow down to your pace
02:59
exactly and then they move at the same
03:00
pace okay it's not going to crop up as a
03:02
plotline in the fast and the furious
03:04
films anytime soon
03:07
the slow and the very very placid
03:10
they do kind of go to sleep though each
03:12
night and wake up each morning again
03:14
this is a metaphor but
03:18
because of th there's a big big
03:20
temperature change obviously they're
03:21
mostly in
03:22
um beachy and deserty environments and
03:24
especially in the desert environments
03:26
it's way warmer in the day than at night
03:29
and that big temperature difference um
03:32
stirs the sand quite a lot and
03:35
um at noon the sand dune kind of wakes
03:38
up and the little winds are generated by
03:40
the temperature difference and the
03:42
increasing temperature and they move the
03:43
surface around and that can be another
03:45
thing that moves the dunes you know a
03:47
few meters a year so is it possible to
03:49
tell the time if you're in the desert by
03:51
looking at sand
03:53
or not i mean
03:54
i think you'd look at the color of the
03:55
sky possibly
03:57
if it's completely dark i think we know
03:59
what time it is if that's the most
04:00
amazing nomad skill you could have
04:03
that'd be really good i was reading the
04:05
other day that if you're on a mountain
04:06
and you want to know how high it is you
04:08
can tell it by getting a bottle of
04:10
coca-cola and putting some mentos in it
04:13
you know that that trick that they often
04:15
do in america where you kind of put your
04:16
mento mint in there and then suddenly it
04:18
sloshes up
04:20
if you're on a mountain and you have
04:21
those two things you can put the mento
04:24
inside the coke and the amount that it
04:26
slushes up wow can tell you the height
04:28
of the mountain do you know why it's to
04:30
do with the air pressure i think it's
04:32
amazing that edmund hillary ever made it
04:34
to the top of everest without his coke
04:36
in his mentos
04:40
do you need to have quite a big bottle
04:41
presumably because if
04:44
is it the more it goes up the higher you
04:45
are or is it is it an inverse
04:47
relationship well here's the problem
04:50
anna i i didn't really read properly
04:53
so if we were gonna go on a hiking
04:54
expedition next week i'm going to have
04:56
to do a bit more research i guess the
04:58
air is it air pressure it's air pressure
05:00
yeah yeah yeah
05:01
yeah it's a didn't your coke freeze at a
05:03
sodium height though
05:05
um
05:06
would it freeze if you're on top of
05:08
mount everest which is the highest
05:09
mountain
05:10
how are they drinking maybe they're
05:11
taking up one of those thermoses that
05:13
you carried soup in on a school trip
05:14
when you were young
05:16
exactly i can't believe you had soup in
05:18
a thermos on your school trips when
05:19
everyone else had sandwiches andy is
05:21
actually an incredibly traumatizing
05:23
childhood memory i don't want to talk
05:24
about it was the worst thing ever it's
05:26
incredibly embarrassing it always
05:27
spilled everywhere on the coach no one
05:29
would want to sit next to me god i hate
05:31
my mother
05:32
[Laughter]
05:35
what was she thinking
05:36
this experiment
05:38
um we didn't quite go into it then i
05:40
think right so
05:42
basically what they had was like a big
05:44
perspex
05:45
circular tank
05:47
um with two walls so the sand dunes
05:50
could go around the circumference of the
05:52
circle right and they could kind of
05:53
chase each other but the guy who did it
05:56
was called carol bachchick
05:58
and he works at cambridge university and
06:01
the reason that he did this experiment
06:03
is he was just looking at one sand dune
06:05
going around this thing and he's
06:07
thinking this is boring it's like
06:10
it's taking ages like to get any kind of
06:13
um any kind of data and so what i'm
06:16
gonna do is i'm gonna double my capacity
06:18
and put two sand dunes in and then i
06:21
could get twice as much data i'm just
06:23
going to do that and then when he did
06:25
that it started a new experiment that he
06:27
hadn't intended to do but what's really
06:29
interesting is it's pretty much
06:30
impossible to actually make a sand dune
06:33
in the lab right for years and years
06:35
they said it was impossible this uh
06:38
experiment gives a kind of an idea of
06:40
what sanji might do but of course the
06:42
difference between that and an actual
06:45
massive you know meters and meters high
06:47
sand dune could be quite different and
06:49
so in mongolia in 2007 they got a
06:52
bulldozer and flattened a whole lot of
06:54
the desert and they set up an experiment
06:57
to see a sand dune being made from
07:00
scratch wow but surely even the longest
07:03
phds don't quite last long enough to
07:06
genuinely watch a sand dune form from
07:08
nothing and then moved do they or did
07:10
they just sit in the desert for decades
07:12
they just sat there for decades yeah
07:15
they passed it on to their children
07:16
actually
07:18
it's like a sourdough starter
07:21
well not unfortunately just as it
07:23
happens uh what they learned was exactly
07:25
what everyone thought would happen
07:27
according to the experiments they did in
07:29
the lab so they did all these
07:31
experiments and it turned out that what
07:32
happened was exactly what everyone
07:34
thought was going to happen which that's
07:35
annoying
07:36
is it lying in a way but in another way
07:39
at least they've proven their theories
07:40
are correct
07:41
yeah yeah yeah um did you know the
07:44
second highest sand dune in europe is in
07:46
wales is it it's a place which is
07:49
nicknamed the south wales sahara
07:53
it's 800 acres of sand and the dunes get
07:56
up to 200 feet tall which is actually
07:58
massive yeah yeah it's so sandy there
08:00
that lawrence of arabia was partly
08:02
filmed there really it's a stand-in for
08:05
um arabia yeah the tallest one's in
08:07
france isn't it i think i've been to it
08:09
yeah
08:13
actually i've been to the tallest one in
08:14
the world as well
08:16
that's in peru i think uh and i've
08:18
sandboarded on it as well cool
08:22
how do you go about that
08:23
um you pay money and they give you they
08:26
take you on a june buggy and they do
08:28
lots of tricks over the sand dunes then
08:30
they take you to the top of one of the
08:31
biggest ones and they put you on
08:34
what
08:35
is less like a snowboard and more like a
08:37
tea tree and they tell you just to go to
08:40
the bottom and to make sure that you
08:42
took everything because i didn't stand
08:44
up on it i kind of like bodyboarded down
08:46
it and they tell you to hide all your
08:48
limbs otherwise they'll get chopped off
08:49
and stuff it's like surfing
08:52
what environment are you going through
08:56
that's what they say
08:57
they said like if you don't tuck your
08:59
arms in then you'll probably lose them
09:01
wow
09:02
anna you'll remember tea trees because
09:03
your mum probably gave you one to
09:06
set up your
09:07
[Laughter]
09:11
what are you calling it sound boarding
09:13
sound boarding can be quite dangerous
09:16
well that's what they said
09:20
how many what kind of injuries and you
09:23
lose your arms and legs i told you you
09:25
can obviously find that when you get to
09:27
the bottom of the sand dune then all
09:28
your limbs have dropped off but
09:31
you can find this is incredibly rare
09:33
they didn't know it could happen until
09:34
2013 but you can just fall into one
09:38
so
09:39
have you read this extraordinary story
09:42
no obviously not otherwise i wouldn't
09:43
have gone sandbar
09:47
um this oven in 2013 is in a place
09:49
called mount baldy which is on the side
09:51
of lake michigan in indiana and it's a
09:53
huge sand dune it's 126 feet tall and it
09:57
swallowed a boy
09:59
i i'm just going to say right now just
10:01
so everyone's not traumatized the boy
10:03
ended up okay
10:05
but uh he was running up the top of the
10:07
sand dune with his mate and his dad to
10:09
then run down it or do james's trick and
10:12
suddenly he disappeared
10:14
and his dad looked around and he'd gone
10:15
and his friend said he just fell into
10:17
the sand and i mean
10:19
you would
10:20
even if you're not done you would
10:22
immediately think mongolian death worm
10:24
wouldn't you yeah
10:26
so that was the conclusion they all
10:27
jumped to
10:29
they spent weeks looking into that to no
10:32
avail um this is amazing bizarrely by
10:35
chance there was a geologist who was
10:37
walking by and she saw dozens of people
10:39
on the side of this sand dune just
10:40
digging away in the sand saying this
10:42
just swallowed a small boy we need to
10:44
get him out and one of the people they
10:46
heard the boys say from deep within the
10:48
june help me i'm scared and this
10:50
geologist was like that is rubbish
10:52
that's totally impossible and she just
10:54
walked on went home and then even though
10:56
she heard the child she didn't heard
10:58
that no no she didn't hear the child she
11:00
just got told by the people digging she
11:02
thought no that kid's just playing hide
11:03
and seek anyway it turned out they saw
11:06
these tiny little holes in the sand that
11:08
kind of went through
11:10
and it seemed that they were leading
11:11
towards some massive cavity underneath
11:13
it which he just dropped into and then
11:15
it got immediately covered up and they
11:17
excavated and excavated after three and
11:19
a half hours they managed to find him
11:21
hidden in a cavity in the sand dune 12
11:24
feet underground
11:25
and he was he was unconscious and like
11:28
really cold um and he spent a couple of
11:31
weeks in hospital and amazingly
11:33
recovered but
11:35
they had no idea why sand dunes
11:37
shouldn't swallow anyone up and this
11:39
geologist hated herself so much for not
11:41
believing it happened at the time she's
11:43
then led this amazing study she's called
11:45
erin aguilan
11:47
and she's found out that it's from
11:49
hollowed-out trees so the sand dunes
11:52
galloped along as they do and it's
11:54
galloped over these old trees that have
11:57
rotted then from the inside and been
11:59
encrossed with fungus so it's just got
12:01
these tubes
12:02
so it's got these weird channels leading
12:04
down through it but they don't you can't
12:06
see the openings in the in the surface
12:08
so it looks like nothing wow that's
12:10
really cool
12:11
don't sound like there's there's another
12:13
thing that they might swallow apart from
12:15
six-year-old boys
12:16
yeah which is there was a city built uh
12:20
in tunisia for
12:22
star wars and not the original star wars
12:25
films i'm talking episode one the
12:26
phantom menace the true original um but
12:29
in 2013 there were lots of news reports
12:31
and i haven't annoyingly i haven't found
12:33
what happened after these reports but it
12:35
was reported that that location city
12:37
built for the phantom menace which is
12:38
called moss espa in the movie was about
12:40
to be buried by a giant crescent-shaped
12:43
sand dune and this was really good news
12:45
actually not only because it removed
12:48
evidence of the phantom menace from
12:52
also because it's it was hard for
12:55
scientists to measure um sand dune
12:57
movement because
12:59
it's very hard to find a fixed
13:00
measurement point
13:01
because it's a nightmare when you're in
13:03
the desert you think oh well has this
13:04
moved 50 meters or has it not moved at
13:06
all we don't know because there's
13:07
nothing else here apart from more sound
13:09
but this was obviously very useful
13:10
because it was fixed in the ground and
13:12
they could kind of look at where it is
13:14
and compare it to the movie
13:16
and say okay on this date it was in
13:18
front of this part of star wars universe
13:21
and then it was here but they were they
13:23
would have to watch the phantom menace
13:25
though to do that that's true and no
13:27
scientist has been found yeah that's a
13:29
phd you really don't want to do i'd
13:31
rather stand in the mongolian desert for
13:32
20 years
13:36
one famous thing about sand dunes is
13:38
that they make this singing noise and um
13:41
marco polo wrote about it in the 13th
13:43
century he said that he heard eerie
13:45
sounds coming from the sand dunes around
13:47
him and that the logical conclusion was
13:50
that he must be in the presence of evil
13:52
spirits wow cool but it has to be really
13:55
specific sound doesn't it you can't get
13:57
on any old sand dune there aren't
13:58
actually many in the world that do it
14:00
but it's got to be a very fine type of
14:02
sand and i think it's the same sort of
14:04
mechanism that you get on some beaches
14:06
where the sand really squeaks and i've
14:08
never really had this before and because
14:10
in britain we have beaches that i love
14:12
but that are objectively quite crappy
14:15
so i'd never seen it before until i went
14:16
to visit bruni island off the coast of
14:18
tasmania at christmas and there every
14:21
time you put your foot down it sort of
14:22
shrieks at you like it's hurt you feel
14:24
kind of bad for it
14:25
yeah it is weird creaky floorboard
14:28
sounds isn't it as you're walking along
14:29
so you can't sneak up on someone on a
14:31
beach uh it's actually a very good uh
14:33
mechanism
14:34
that's why you moved here isn't it dan
14:36
because you just kept getting caught in
14:37
australia
14:38
[Laughter]
14:40
we've been giving sand dunes very mixed
14:42
messages in this country lately because
14:45
we've been trying to get them to stop
14:46
moving for years
14:48
and building fences around them and
14:51
people sometimes cover them in oil which
14:53
is very unpleasant which sort of like
14:54
weighs them down and we plant lots of
14:57
vegetation on them so if you go to the
14:58
coast you'll see vegetation planted and
15:00
then suddenly conservationists have
15:01
turned around and said oh hold on sand
15:02
dunes are supposed to move this is like
15:05
kind of nailing a horse to the floor and
15:07
so now
15:10
which is and they don't do that because
15:11
horses are supposed to move
15:13
and so now we're trying to get sanji's
15:15
moving again and the national lottery
15:17
has given four million pounds to get
15:19
sand dunes moving again wow
15:22
they've set up a new app haven't they
15:24
the couch to five meters
15:30
okay it is time for fact number two and
15:33
that is james okay my fact this week is
15:36
that according to a recent publication
15:38
people from the north of england are
15:40
more than twice as likely to be
15:42
naturally funny than people from the
15:44
south of england
15:46
sounds like a very scientific uh
15:48
publication who who conducted this oh i
15:50
didn't write that down um
15:55
[Laughter]
15:58
it was the bino
16:00
it was the comic the bino
16:02
uh but who knows comedy better than the
16:04
people who write the bino that's what i
16:06
want absolutely
16:08
absolutely so what were the details of
16:10
the study they were scanned
16:13
um it was the analysis of famous british
16:16
comedians carried out by statistician dr
16:19
jeff ellis and he looked at all the
16:21
different comedians and what their
16:23
particular
16:24
attributes are and then he surveyed
16:27
people to say how funny do you think
16:28
these people are and i think thanks to
16:31
the fact that peter k comes from the
16:32
north of england the people like peter
16:34
kay
16:35
we came at the top
16:38
uh and you guys are all not as funny
16:40
yeah didn't he also say that uh geminis
16:43
are more naturally funny than leo's
16:45
i didn't read that bit because i'm not a
16:47
gemini i only cherry picks the bits that
16:49
specifically said good things about me
16:51
ah okay he did i think there's a study
16:54
to also say that and can i just say as a
16:56
leo from the south of england i'm just
16:57
honored to be here
17:01
people who are born in a city you're
17:03
supposed to be funnier and you were born
17:04
in london i was is that again is that a
17:06
causing to apparently professional
17:08
statistician jeff ellis who must be
17:10
questioning where his career's gone
17:12
right now
17:13
the bino is pretty dry these days if
17:15
they're having to resort to statistical
17:17
analysis of famous comedians
17:20
we should quickly say there'll be a lot
17:21
of international listeners who might not
17:22
know what the bino is um this is the
17:24
longest running comic in the uk
17:27
and it is um famous for having created
17:30
dennis the menace the british one not
17:32
the american one and um that has a sort
17:35
of sister publication called dandy that
17:37
has desperate dan and so a lot of iconic
17:40
british characters came out of this
17:41
desperate dam was named after you
17:43
walking along a beach wasn't it
17:48
depraved dan was the character's
17:49
original name
17:52
deported dan after
17:54
i was caught
17:55
[Laughter]
17:59
you mentioned desperate dan in the very
18:00
olden days so it feels right that we're
18:02
correcting the balance now i think he
18:04
had to give up eating cow pie didn't he
18:06
oh yeah because of my disease we have we
18:10
all have a friend who used to work on
18:12
the bino until quite recently really
18:14
matthew highton uh comedian excellent
18:16
comedian i should say also from the
18:18
north of england very funny guy uh he
18:20
used to work for the [ __ ] yeah that's
18:22
right and he's still part of the beno
18:24
whatsapp group where everyone sends each
18:26
other messages about the bino
18:28
and i asked him if they had any facts
18:30
and so do you want to hear some facts
18:32
from that you know what's up group
18:34
so the bino offices in london are on
18:36
fleet street and it is where people
18:39
believe that sweeney todd was supposedly
18:42
uh had his barbershop and so they get
18:45
loads of tours of people who want to see
18:47
the kind of dodgy murdery parts of
18:49
london always go to the vino offices and
18:51
have a look around no they don't go into
18:53
the offices they go into like the alleys
18:55
next to the office that's that's amazing
18:57
sweetie
18:58
one of the biggest pranksters of all
18:59
time sweeney todd
19:02
well he didn't have cow pies but he did
19:04
have people pies didn't he i guess yeah
19:07
yeah probably the inspiration for
19:08
desperate dan who knows um i found out
19:12
in my bina research uh niche fact that
19:14
definitely international listeners won't
19:15
care about which is the breed of dog
19:17
that nasha is
19:19
because
19:20
if you look at nasha he's just sort of
19:22
like a big frizzy lump of black
19:24
with some legs sticking out and he's
19:26
actually a very rare breed uh he's an
19:28
abyssinian wire-headed trite pound and
19:31
he's a very rare breed of dog from the
19:33
mountains of eastern africa according to
19:35
the beno website they're world famous
19:37
for their thick black coats which are as
19:39
strong and tangled as barbed wire which
19:42
is weird because barbed wire actually
19:43
when it's erected is not tangled at all
19:46
but they're also famous they're strong
19:48
i suppose bit bits of it are you're
19:50
right the barbed bits are aren't they
19:52
sorry anna are you are you just being
19:53
silly this isn't a real kind of dog is
19:55
it yeah of course it is they're also
19:56
famous for their strong teeth that can
19:58
chew through concrete and smash bricks
20:00
did you know
20:02
did you know that nasha can speak real
20:04
people words but only on halloween oh
20:07
again that well this breed of dog is
20:09
particularly famous for that they are
20:10
extremely rare now um the the american
20:14
denis and menace we've mentioned before
20:15
the beautiful coincidence that they both
20:17
appeared at the same time these two
20:19
characters with the same name and uh
20:21
both wear red and black costume and um
20:25
american dennis the menace i was looking
20:26
into how he came about his origin story
20:29
and he was actually inspired by um this
20:32
is the story that's told in 1950 when
20:34
the artist ketchum was drawing his wife
20:37
uh came in to interrupt him to say that
20:38
their own four-year-old son dennis had
20:41
just demolished their bedroom by
20:44
putting fecal matter that he'd found in
20:46
his underpants all over the room
20:48
and um declared him a menace and so he
20:51
thought oh that sounds like a good
20:53
character name so he went helped to
20:56
clean up the [ __ ] off the walls and then
20:58
uh created dennis the menace because
20:59
there was a song a few years before both
21:02
of these characters came along that was
21:04
quite popular called dennis the men is
21:06
from venice
21:07
and most people think that the reason
21:09
that they came at the same time is
21:10
because they were both inspired by this
21:12
song which had become quite popular but
21:14
the pooh on the wall story is quite
21:16
persuasive
21:18
the poo on the wall story also features
21:19
in the music hall song doesn't it so i
21:21
think it might have taken the same
21:22
trajectory um yeah i think the creators
21:25
of the british version of dennis said
21:26
that he was inspired by that musical
21:28
song and actually i looked up the lyrics
21:31
of this song although i can't find the
21:33
melody and i really want it
21:35
dennis the menace from venice is a gay
21:36
gondolier with gold rings in his ears
21:39
and he's a massive player so the whole
21:43
song is about how he's this gondolier
21:45
who seduces other men's wives down the
21:47
canals of venice at nine in the evening
21:50
he dines with a blonde at ten he has got
21:52
a brunette at midnight you'll find him
21:54
with some ginger gal and he teaches them
21:56
all how to pet well it sounds a bit like
21:58
mambo number five doesn't it
22:04
another song exactly what it is which
22:06
originally ended up with the protagonist
22:08
smearing his poo all over the walls
22:16
there was it's obviously a lot of the
22:17
humor in the bean it was really
22:19
lavatorial and there was a plan in 2017
22:23
to do a b note takeover at the victoria
22:25
and albert museum uh in london
22:27
and what they wanted to do was amend the
22:31
they've got a cast of michelangelo's
22:32
david there and they wanted to tweak it
22:34
so that it would fart as people passed
22:36
by
22:36
and i can't find any evidence that it
22:38
happened because there was fury in the
22:40
museum that there was going to be
22:42
it was actually genuinely irritating to
22:44
people and one there was a memo doing
22:46
the rounds about the plans and somebody
22:48
replied an insider from the museum said
22:50
frankly some of the things in the memo
22:52
are disgusting while it's important to
22:54
encourage children to visit farting
22:56
statues are not the way to do it
23:00
um so bino launched in 1938 and
23:05
there's not many copies left of the
23:08
original
23:09
issue
23:10
but by weird coincidence i saw one the
23:12
other day a friend of mine yeah called
23:14
ollie driscoll he's a cameraman for uh
23:17
he works on movies like the latest
23:18
jurassic park movies and touching the
23:20
void and the fast and furious movies
23:23
back in 1999 he bought the bino first
23:25
issue for six thousand pounds wow um and
23:29
as far as he knows it's the only issue
23:32
that has the toy that it came with the
23:34
free toy which was a mask
23:36
oh my god he has you know the guy who
23:38
has that yeah he has somebody showed it
23:40
to me yeah and um he has it in mint
23:43
condition and he's up for selling it so
23:44
if anyone wants to buy a very expensive
23:46
comic book magazine uh he's got it for
23:48
sale dan i'm really interested because i
23:49
i read a bit about that thing and it
23:51
said that it came it said the toy that
23:52
it came with it called it a whoopee mask
23:54
yeah yeah and i obviously only know the
23:57
whoopee cushion
23:59
but presumably this is not a mask where
24:02
someone has to sit on your face
24:06
yeah i don't know i think i think maybe
24:07
whoopi
24:08
is it possible whoopi had a different uh
24:10
meaning to it i think it didn't fart
24:12
i've seen a picture and i can't see
24:13
where they would have got the farting
24:14
mechanism into it
24:18
yeah do you know what the oldest comic
24:19
strip in the world is about no this is
24:22
what's established recently is the
24:23
oldest of western comic book
24:26
and by comic book it's like something
24:27
that's mass produced and has speech
24:29
bubbles and released every week every
24:31
couple of weeks it's called looking
24:33
glass and it ran for three editions and
24:36
it was the adventures of a coat
24:38
being worn by different people
24:40
is it about that there's a gogo story
24:42
about the coats isn't there it the
24:44
overclock
24:50
1825. wow maybe go gold based his story
24:53
on the comic on the history of a coat i
24:56
just can't imagine two people had the
24:58
same idea about doing a story about an
25:00
overcoat you're right well we don't know
25:02
this one was an overcoat it might have
25:03
been an undercoat it was just a coat
25:06
what is an undercoat i don't know it's
25:07
just something i made up that would be
25:09
the opposite of an overcoat
25:10
anyway it was it had characters like
25:12
billy the bully and ranting dan and this
25:15
was you know 200 years ago
25:17
dan you're getting an absolute pasting
25:19
[Laughter]
25:24
okay it is time for fact number three
25:26
and that is anna my fact this week is
25:29
that in 1943 german troops who were
25:32
rescuing mussolini had to seize control
25:35
of a tourist funicular railway so they
25:37
could ride a cable car to the top of the
25:39
hill and pick him up
25:41
so cool what an awkward journey in that
25:43
funicular railway cable car it must have
25:45
been with the two elderly tourists and
25:47
the 20 nazi goons who refused to budge
25:50
and get out of it
25:51
no we paid for our ride and we will damn
25:53
well take it
25:55
so what was what was he doing at the top
25:56
of the hill
25:58
that's a good question he was just
25:59
hanging out there so i didn't know this
26:01
had happened but when mussolini was
26:03
deposed by his own people because they
26:05
finally realized that he was [ __ ] in
26:07
every way in 1943
26:10
um he was arrested by his own council
26:13
and they sort of took him prisoner and
26:15
they moved him around to a lot of
26:16
different places and then eventually
26:17
they plopped him at the top of the grand
26:20
sasso d'italia which has a lot of very
26:22
high mountains in the upper nines and
26:25
it's only reachable by cable car and
26:27
hitler is a fan of mussolini heard about
26:30
this sussed out where he was and ordered
26:33
this rescue operation and so in order to
26:35
rescue the plan was send some troops
26:38
there and pick him up and so yeah they
26:40
had to seize this cable car and it just
26:43
because they go quite slowly cable cars
26:45
at the best of times and i reckon in
26:46
1943 very slowly
26:49
imagine the rush of the frenzy yeah
26:51
which is
26:52
so it's a funicular um cable car which
26:54
is where they have the two counter
26:56
balances so they'll have two cable cars
26:58
won't they one on one side and one on
26:59
the other but it was a crazy operation
27:02
this mussolini rescue it was part cable
27:04
car based and mostly glider based and so
27:08
the plan was for these ten tiny little
27:10
glider planes to land on the top of this
27:12
mountain which they'd sort of done some
27:15
reconnaissance on and thought they'd
27:16
seen a big meadow they could land on
27:18
which turned out to be a massive rocky
27:20
field so they all crash-landed some of
27:23
them were quite badly injured
27:24
uh ran in to pick up mussolini and one
27:27
of the ss commandos apparently vomited
27:29
inside his glider which made it very
27:31
unpleasant to travel in for the rest of
27:33
them um they were so flimsy these tiny
27:36
little gliders and the pilots were so
27:37
nervous about it uh because of that that
27:40
one of the pilots in one he couldn't see
27:41
out the window because it was really
27:42
blurry so he got a knife out and he just
27:45
jammed a hole in the fuselage so he
27:48
could look out and then pushed a bit the
27:50
fuselage out so he could look out of the
27:51
plane wow
27:53
and then they picked him up they sort of
27:54
then they sort of gave him up quite uh
27:57
sort of okay take him that's fine like
27:59
no bullets were fired it was uh and
28:01
mussolini requested that as well he said
28:03
please no one no one shoots and
28:06
yeah it was quite a peaceful operation
28:07
and they didn't get him out by the
28:09
funicular did they he he no they were pl
28:12
there was an idea to get him out by
28:13
funicular so they were planning to land
28:15
a plane at the bottom of the funicular
28:17
that he could just board but the plane
28:19
crash-landed and lost a wheel or landing
28:21
so instead they got him out by a small
28:23
light aircraft from the top of the
28:25
mountain didn't they got it okay which
28:27
also sounds crazy and your wife's a
28:29
pilot so maybe she could say how
28:31
unstable this is but they were terrified
28:33
about leaving because it was a really
28:35
light aircraft and it was overcrowded to
28:37
the extent that mussolini who was six
28:39
foot four massive guy sat in the
28:40
passenger seat and then the guy who's in
28:42
charge of the operation captain scores
28:44
any was wedged in the luggage
28:45
compartment behind and underneath the
28:47
seat
28:48
and it was way too heavy so it like
28:51
careered down this hill bumped down this
28:53
hill which wasn't the kind of surface
28:55
they wanted and then did a nosedive off
28:58
the edge of a precipice and they only
29:00
survived because the pilot realized that
29:02
he'd have to leave it in free fall for a
29:04
while so they in order to get up the
29:06
requisite speed
29:07
you can then pull the plane up and start
29:09
flying it away mussolini was um
29:13
a bad dude i think we can all agree he
29:15
was also a british spy for some time
29:18
yeah he was hired by the british in 1917
29:20
and he was given a wage by mi5 to help
29:23
keep italy fighting in the war because
29:25
in the first world war they were on the
29:27
same side as the british and that was
29:29
about six thousand pounds a week so
29:30
you know he owes a lot of his early
29:32
success to mi5 that's a huge amount of
29:34
money yeah is it modern day that much or
29:37
was that that much at the time modern
29:38
day that
29:40
weekly wage at the time which is about
29:42
six thousand pounds now okay they'll
29:44
have to buy a
29:45
second-hand car
29:47
or well you know what six thousand
29:49
pounds is you don't need it well you can
29:51
buy the first edition of the bino for
29:52
that back in 1999
29:55
terrible news italy has dropped out of
29:57
the war but i did secure this
30:00
check out my whopping guys
30:05
i think we've briefly mentioned before
30:07
that his son romano was a jazz musician
30:10
yes and a famous jazz musician more or
30:11
less in his own right i just wanted to
30:13
add on i found a memorial article about
30:16
him in the atlantic and the headline was
30:18
he made the refrains run on time
30:20
ah nice
30:22
i'm finiculous yeah yeah
30:24
are great i made a list of all the
30:26
funiculars i've been on as part of my
30:28
research how many and i've been ons i've
30:30
only six is not enough
30:33
but one of them was closed when i
30:34
visited it so it would have been seven
30:35
so can you can you just quickly
30:37
re-explain for maybe some of the
30:38
audience listening to the show who might
30:40
not understand what a funicular is what
30:43
it is
30:44
sorry to sorry to do that we obviously
30:46
all know
30:47
so it's a little
30:48
it's a little railway uh which is it's
30:52
normally they're designed to go up and
30:54
down very very steep hills so if you've
30:56
got you know a very steep mountain side
30:59
it's a great way of getting up and down
31:01
there with not too much um you know
31:04
without going around around the houses
31:05
so it's a direct line uh and usually one
31:09
car is ascending while the other is
31:10
descending so there are two and
31:12
sometimes there's just one line
31:14
and the cars are going towards each
31:16
other and they're about to hit each
31:17
other and then just at the very middle
31:18
of the line the line branches off into
31:20
two and they go around each other and
31:21
then use the same one again that's a
31:23
very efficient way of doing it and the
31:24
reason they're really useful is because
31:26
you're using the weight of one of your
31:29
trains to pull the other one up so as
31:31
one is descending it's pulling the other
31:33
one up so you need a lot less energy um
31:36
that's the good that's the crucial thing
31:37
about them is the counterbalancing and
31:39
they still use a little motor so they
31:40
still need to be able to pull themselves
31:42
up the hill but it's so much
31:43
counter-balanced yeah so you're using
31:45
basically the potential energy of one to
31:47
pull up the other one um but like anna
31:49
says you do need some
31:51
it's not a completely perfect um system
31:54
of uh but not
31:55
motion so you do need as close as we've
31:57
got yeah you need a little leg up
31:59
apparently sometimes uh you can make the
32:02
move just by having enough people in the
32:03
cabin if you crush enough slightly
32:06
overweight people in it can just weigh
32:08
its way down so that's an insulting
32:09
moment when you step into a funicular
32:12
and finally they're like thank god we've
32:14
got them okay
32:16
it's like i was once in uh television
32:18
studios in london and um there was a lot
32:20
of people in the lift
32:22
uh and i needed to get in the lift as
32:24
well and i got in and as soon as i
32:26
walked in it started beeping and said
32:28
sorry um too much weight in this lift so
32:30
i had to walk out and get the stairs
32:33
while everyone else got the lift
32:35
yeah that's awkward that's very unfair
32:37
but it's just because you were the last
32:38
one in it's only really insulting if you
32:40
get in and the guy who's running the
32:42
left has all right well you six people
32:44
are going to have to be afraid
32:46
i was once on an airplane i don't know
32:48
if i've said this before but i got an
32:49
airplane in i think it was in hawaii or
32:52
somewhere it was somewhere where it's a
32:54
small airplane and um they made me move
32:57
to counterbalance the weight of the
32:59
plane
33:01
excuse me sir can you um can you sit
33:03
over the wings i'm not a particularly
33:05
overweight man you know it's like not at
33:08
all andy i want to know the last time
33:09
you went into a lift that there was a
33:11
man running it
33:13
all the little i only go into a lift
33:14
which has an operative
33:18
um yeah it would have been longer ago
33:20
than the last time i was in a funicular
33:22
which was in hastings last year you know
33:23
when you said you've been in six
33:24
funiculars does that include going up
33:26
and going down as separate ones oh okay
33:29
if we're doing that i've been in 12
33:30
funiculars
33:36
but they are i mean
33:37
i find them kind of weirdly lovely again
33:39
i'm a bit of a funicular obsessive not
33:41
that much one because i've only been in
33:42
12 uh
33:43
six but vernicular and moss they're your
33:46
two loves aren't they andy pretty sad
33:48
isn't it if you imagine a funicular
33:50
overgrown with moss and that would be my
33:52
dream
33:56
but i just they are very cool um
33:58
and
33:59
i find them quite weird because
34:00
obviously they're only usual in very
34:03
hilly or mountainous places and so you
34:05
get loads of them in seaside resorts
34:06
like scarborough has five really well
34:09
yeah uh or it has had five at various
34:11
different points hastings has two um do
34:14
you guys know the song about funiculars
34:16
they're really really famous one
34:18
funiculi follicular
34:20
um from the 1880s um do you know
34:24
like no
34:26
you would you would know it if you heard
34:28
it you would know it for sure um it's
34:30
like a really famous
34:32
italian song
34:34
[Laughter]
34:37
[Music]
34:45
so it's really really famous in the
34:47
1880s yeah and um richard strauss was on
34:50
holiday in italy and he heard this song
34:53
and he thought because it's such an
34:55
absolute banger of a tune isn't it
34:57
this must be like a really old like
34:59
classical italian song and so he put it
35:02
in one of his compositions and then the
35:05
guy who actually wrote it who was living
35:07
in italy heard this and he was like
35:09
that's my song
35:10
what's going on and so he sued richard
35:14
strauss
35:15
for the money for his song and he won as
35:17
well so
35:19
as far as i can see he's like one of the
35:20
oldest examples of someone suing for
35:23
someone stealing their songs wow cool
35:26
isn't that cool it's amazing
35:29
ireland has one cable car
35:32
just one yeah it's just got one one
35:34
cable car
35:35
it takes people from cork to dirty
35:38
island which is just off the coast of
35:40
cork and it's the only way of getting to
35:43
the island and there was outcry a few
35:46
years ago when it was announced that no
35:48
longer was the cable car allowed to be
35:50
used to transport cows
35:53
this is actually a serious problem
35:55
because a lot of the dirty island
35:56
industry which admittedly is quite small
35:58
i think it only now has two permanent
36:00
residents a lot of the industry is quite
36:02
cow-based quite castle-based and the
36:05
cable car is tiny it can fit one cow
36:07
so when they were moving cow's over
36:10
the
36:12
moving the cows across the farmers would
36:15
have to put them one at a time in this
36:17
one cable car there are great pictures
36:19
of them disembarking and then would they
36:21
have to like sometimes put the cow
36:23
across but then send some corn back and
36:26
then put a chicken back in and send that
36:28
back is that what yeah
36:30
there were so many awkward trial runs
36:32
where the chicken was dead the cow was
36:34
dead and they could only block that
36:35
that's so amazing just watering surely
36:38
you could squeeze it you could go and
36:39
lie on top of the cow
36:41
man it's pretty small you could maybe
36:43
squeeze in an italian fascist but
36:48
i've got a new favorite cable car as a
36:50
result of researching this fact um it's
36:52
a cable car i want to know what your old
36:54
favorite cable car was but
36:56
my old favorite one was the one i got in
36:58
hong kong which took you across mountain
37:00
ranges to go to ocean park which we used
37:02
to get uh most of my childhood
37:04
astonishing cable car um but it's been
37:07
superseded by uh a mountain cable car in
37:10
south germany which takes you to the top
37:11
of a mountain called the wank
37:14
and i've been there i've been you've
37:15
been to the wank i mean of course
37:17
[Laughter]
37:19
so you've been on the wank barn i have
37:21
been i have watched ski jumping at the
37:23
wank uh mountain and i've watched
37:26
andreas vank the ski jumper jumping at
37:29
the black white mountain
37:32
i think it's right it's next to garvish
37:33
patent i think yes that's correct so
37:36
yeah so to get to the top of it if you
37:38
want to take the quick way uh you um get
37:40
the wank barn and the wank barn leads
37:42
you to the top and there's a wank house
37:44
at the top as well can i just say that
37:47
the wank barn sounds like the disgusting
37:49
sequel to the song love shaq
37:55
it's a little known place where you can
37:57
get together with yourself
38:03
yeah so yeah and also if you go
38:05
regularly you can get a wank pass which
38:06
gets you um a sort of year-round permit
38:09
to get the cable car
38:11
oh wow uh it's a pretty rough place to
38:13
clean isn't it that was poor cleaning
38:15
stuff
38:18
i'm banned from all six of the
38:19
funiculars i've been on
38:23
but not the other six
38:28
oh god
38:29
[Applause]
38:31
okay it's time for our final fact of the
38:33
show and that is andy my fact is that in
38:36
medieval germany bad musicians were tied
38:38
to an instrument called the flute of
38:40
shame
38:43
that doesn't sound like much of a
38:45
i mean was it a massive flute oh it was
38:48
it was a flute
38:50
i think everyone knew it was the flute
38:51
of shame and that's as always that's
38:53
where the shame comes from um so it's
38:55
called the chant flood
38:56
uh or chant florida and
38:59
so this is a it's it was a metal device
39:01
with a collar at the neck so it was
39:03
clamped onto you and um your fingers
39:05
would supposedly be clamped to the keys
39:08
not really a flute more of a clarinet
39:10
um i've written i've written flaronette
39:12
in my notes which i like um but that's
39:15
just a mistake um so there are a couple
39:17
of these things only in existence um
39:20
one of them is in the medieval crime
39:21
museum in rothenberg and another is in
39:23
the amsterdam torture museum and so
39:26
there's a i couldn't quite work out if
39:28
these things you know were real
39:30
or if they were
39:32
victorian reproductions but i did find a
39:35
paper in uh the journal torture
39:38
uh which is all about other
39:42
it's about other shaming instruments and
39:44
there were definitely things like uh the
39:46
neck violin
39:48
which uh it could be attached to you and
39:50
you might be put in the in a pillory you
39:52
know you might be tied up somewhere with
39:55
uh this wooden violin again attached to
39:58
your neck by a kind of iron band i saw a
40:00
picture of that it doesn't to me it
40:01
didn't look like a violin at all
40:04
i think they just called it that because
40:05
it yes on your neck didn't they exactly
40:08
there are some things there are some
40:10
which definitely look like violence okay
40:12
oh okay because the flute one does look
40:14
like a flute that's why it confuses me
40:16
small clarinet you know
40:18
yeah
40:19
you know it's one of those do you have
40:21
to play it while you're in it i mean
40:23
accounts vary some people say you'd be
40:25
sort of put on and walked around a bit
40:27
and you'd have to you know go yeah i am
40:29
a crap musician but it is the perfect
40:31
instrument for feeling sorry for
40:32
yourself as well the violin so that's
40:37
um i asked greg jenner about this
40:38
whether he thought this was a real thing
40:40
or not and he asked um dr eleanor janega
40:43
who is at going medieval on um
40:46
on twitter who's a medieval historian
40:48
and she isn't sure she thinks that it
40:50
might be one of those inventions that
40:52
were as she puts it retrofitted as in
40:55
it's like a victoria and more of a
40:56
victorian idea
40:58
uh on the german wikipedia it says
41:00
in recent times the shunned flood is
41:03
often presented as a punishment for bad
41:04
musicians but like the neck violin which
41:07
also resembles a musical instrument it
41:09
served to punish various minor
41:11
violations of the legal system so not
41:13
for musicians but just a more general
41:16
kind of punishment like the stocks kind
41:17
of thing so i guess we just don't really
41:19
know do we it's kind of yeah
41:22
so the the violin definitely seems to be
41:24
a thing
41:25
but not necessarily for musicians
41:28
perhaps no no no it seems to make more
41:29
sense that they'd be used to punish an
41:31
actual crime but they did used to make
41:33
punishments fitting with the crime so
41:35
maybe if you've stolen a violin or
41:36
beaten up a violinist
41:40
it's waiting for a long time if you make
41:42
a massive metal flute for someone to
41:44
steal a flute isn't it it's like surely
41:46
it'll happen eventually what did they
41:48
steal oh they stole some bread okay if
41:50
we got a massive bit of metal
41:54
still waiting on the flute not only did
41:56
they have the uh the neck violin um but
41:58
i saw as well that in one of these
42:00
museums the crime museum in rotterdam
42:02
that they've got a double neck violin
42:05
and the idea of the double neck violin
42:06
was um according to the little caption
42:08
that goes with the with the item is that
42:10
it was for arguing couples and they
42:12
would have to walk around with them on
42:14
sometimes with bells attached uh ringing
42:17
the idea was that they would walk in
42:18
shame until they resolved their argument
42:20
so it was just a quick way of making
42:22
them actually talk to each other uh and
42:24
shaming themselves into an understanding
42:26
of their points and why is there a
42:28
violin hanging between them it just
42:30
seems like they're totally irrelevant
42:32
part of that setup
42:33
that's romantic
42:35
oh so when they make up they can do a
42:36
little serenade yeah exactly it's like
42:38
when someone comes to your table uh
42:40
while you're having dinner and plays a
42:41
song for you
42:42
fair enough um so just on flutes is it
42:46
flutist or flautist artist
42:49
okay one one vote for flotist
42:51
it seems to be that in america it's
42:52
flutist although one of the greatest
42:54
ever players julius baker he has said it
42:57
should be flutician
42:59
hmm
43:00
like a beauty sounds like someone who is
43:02
a flute
43:04
uh i've always said plottist i thought
43:06
that was the
43:07
i think it is the standard in the uk
43:09
definitely yeah me too i think that's
43:10
because we're british dan
43:12
yeah i'm not a good one to ask i only
43:14
just found out through james i've been
43:16
saying penised wrong this whole time
43:18
that it's a pianist
43:20
okay
43:22
but flutes are four times as old as
43:23
farming
43:25
hey yeah people were just eating flutes
43:27
for the first 30 000 years
43:32
they found these um bones with holes in
43:33
didn't they and the holes are the
43:35
correct distance apart to make you think
43:38
that they must be a flute um
43:41
i'm a little bit unconvinced by it i
43:43
must say but that is like yeah that's it
43:46
so there's one way which i think they
43:47
are more convinced by which is for 35
43:51
000 years old and there's one which is a
43:52
bit of a borderline case and that's the
43:53
one i'm basing this on which is 43 000
43:55
years old um it could be
43:58
unbelievably good luck that there are
44:00
these holes in it or it could be there
44:01
are a lot of there are a lot of bones
44:03
some of them must have holes in at the
44:04
right spaces
44:06
um and it's the but the 43 000 year old
44:08
one is the leg bone of a cave bear which
44:10
is an incredibly epic wow thing to make
44:13
i know imagine the combination of skills
44:15
that you need to be a flute player in 43
44:18
000 years ago you need to be able to
44:19
kill a bear but also to have the finesse
44:22
yeah display
44:24
that is incredible i think we can safely
44:26
say that the coolest guy in an orchestra
44:27
or girl um which is not a difficult
44:30
thing to be i know but it's definitely
44:32
the person who's playing the bear's limb
44:37
in 1969 there was an australian park
44:40
ranger and he heard the sound of a flute
44:42
playing in the park and it turned out
44:45
that it was a bird called the liar bird
44:47
and the liar bird can copy people's uh
44:50
noises and you know you sometimes see
44:52
them on like uh nature documentaries
44:55
where they're making the sound of drills
44:57
or something like that or mobile phones
44:58
because they've copied them so he heard
45:01
this bird that was singing a tune that
45:03
sounded just like a flute and he did
45:06
some research and he found that 30 years
45:08
earlier there was a flute player who'd
45:10
lived near the park with a pet lyre bird
45:13
and he used to play the flute to this
45:14
bird and then he let the bird go free
45:16
into the forest and what he surmises is
45:19
that that bird then taught the song to
45:22
all the other liar birds and so what
45:23
we're hearing now in the for in 1969 in
45:27
the forest was like a recording of a
45:30
1930s song that that guy had played on
45:32
his flute
45:34
and it was that song about the um dennis
45:36
the menace from venice
45:39
we should make full orchestras out of
45:41
birds to save us having to carve all
45:42
these instruments out of bear limbs we
45:44
could just train up liabilities to play
45:47
everything or like beyonce should
45:48
release her next album purely on birds
45:50
[Laughter]
45:54
okay just one thing going back to
45:56
medieval punishment very quickly in
45:58
medieval ireland um the punishment for
46:02
masturbation was penance of 120 days
46:06
so you had to do your hail mary's and
46:08
our fathers and stuff for 120 days and
46:10
for a priest it was a penance of a full
46:12
year
46:13
every time you masturbated you had to do
46:15
that
46:16
and that is according to the penitential
46:18
of coming the anus
46:21
which is
46:22
pardon stop the penitential of coming
46:25
the anus
46:26
there was a guy called comedy anus and
46:29
he wrote
46:30
these rules about wow
46:32
so i'm getting i'm getting a bit of
46:34
interference what was he called james
46:35
sorry
46:36
he was called
46:39
he was also sometimes called just come
46:41
in if you didn't if you just call me
46:43
fred guys just call me fred
46:47
he um
46:48
if you wanted to latinize his name it
46:50
was comedy anus
46:51
wow i bet he didn't want to laughingise
46:53
his name very much
46:58

[Applause]
00:14
hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from four
00:20
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
00:23
is dan schreiber i'm sitting here
00:25
with andrew hunter murray james harkin
00:27
and anna tajinski
00:28
and once again we have gathered around
00:30
the microphones with our four
00:31
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order
00:35
here we go starting with you
00:38
andy my fact is that paris's first
00:41
public transport system failed because
00:43
wealthy passengers bought all the seats
00:45
for themselves
00:46
and then persuaded the government to ban
00:48
poor people
00:49
wow incredible but
00:52
if they were selling all the tickets
00:54
surely that's not a failure
00:56
well then the rich apparently just lost
00:58
interest and then stopped using it and
01:00
then no one was using it
01:01
so it was a complete disaster this uh is
01:04
from an article on uh lapham's quarterly
01:06
which is an amazing website
01:07
it's really brilliant it's got so many
01:09
fascinating things on it and
01:10
it's partly based on this brilliant
01:12
sounding book about buses
01:14
uh which is called engine of modernity
01:16
by masha balenki so
01:18
andy have you um have you already moved
01:19
on from funicular railways then
01:24
i'm afraid so this was called these were
01:27
called the karos
01:29
and um it was set up uh
01:32
by blaise pascal so we briefly actually
01:35
mentioned before that blaze pascal set
01:36
up the first public transport system in
01:38
paris but i didn't know what happened to
01:39
it
01:40
and it was basically a carriage with
01:42
eight passengers and two stuff
01:43
and there were sorry when was it did you
01:45
say oh i'm sorry it was in 1662.
01:49
and who was playing pascal again he was
01:51
a
01:52
thinker mathematician probability dude
01:55
and what's paris again
01:56
[Laughter]
01:58
i'm sorry who are you anyway the point
02:02
is
02:03
wealthy writers uh didn't like sharing
02:05
with poor people
02:06
i think they weren't even i think um
02:09
really poor people were not even allowed
02:10
on in the first place so i think wealthy
02:11
people didn't like even sharing with the
02:13
middle classes
02:14
uh and so they would buy up all the
02:16
seats in the carriage for themselves
02:18
and um it lasted i think a few weeks it
02:21
was this really weird
02:23
attempt to set up public transport which
02:25
didn't work because social hierarchy
02:27
just got in
02:27
i think it lasted a bit longer than that
02:29
because they yeah they had quite a few
02:31
different routes by the end so they
02:32
started off
02:33
it was blaze pascal he put the money in
02:36
along with a few other people including
02:37
the duke of roenae
02:39
uh and the first route went from
02:42
pascal's house to the duke of royne's
02:44
house just by coincidence
02:47
and it went through the centre of paris
02:49
but it did pick people up on the way
02:51
and then they i think they had three or
02:52
four other lines and then they even had
02:54
a circle line that connected all of them
02:57
uh and it was it carried on going even
02:59
after pascal died but once he died it
03:01
kind of went it went off
03:03
wow um and they banned the government
03:05
banned um
03:06
soldiers and pages and other kind of
03:10
livery to people in uniform kind of
03:11
people and when they banned those
03:13
everyone rioted against it and that's
03:15
kind of when it all fell out of favor so
03:18
this is what i did
03:18
because i read that and i didn't quite
03:20
understand why
03:22
people wanted men in uniform banned well
03:25
they were the middle class
03:26
basically and then in uniform would be
03:29
not the working class but not the
03:31
not the poshos they'd be the in-between
03:32
people that you didn't really want to
03:34
want to mix with so they had they had a
03:37
fashion ban
03:38
on the bus then right did they have
03:40
people
03:42
was it the conductor's job or the bus
03:44
driver's job to go i'm sorry
03:46
you don't look good enough with my bus
03:48
or did you have to provide more concrete
03:49
evidence because you can be quite a
03:51
good-looking tailor
03:52
surely you have to provide your cv or
03:54
maybe some references
03:55
from former employers or something in
03:57
order to get on the bus i don't really
03:59
know how they managed to police it to be
04:00
honest
04:01
i said it was pretty scanty yeah i
04:03
suppose that the other the other posh
04:05
people on the bus would go
04:06
that man is a livered man
04:10
and they were yeah livery is pretty easy
04:11
to spot yeah you know what livery is
04:14
when you see it there was
04:15
actually i do know one thing about how
04:16
it was police which is that you could be
04:17
whipped
04:18
if you interfered with the operations of
04:20
the bus wow
04:21
oh yeah quite right too i mean you can
04:23
still be arrested i think if you try to
04:25
interfere with the operations of a
04:27
public bus today
04:28
if you climb onto the driver's lap and
04:30
take control at the wheel
04:32
you are in trouble and there probably is
04:34
still some sort of fashion laws
04:36
with modern-day london buses like if i
04:38
went on nude
04:39
that might be seen as worthy of not
04:42
allowing me on
04:43
true yeah we're still oppressed we just
04:45
don't know it
04:47
and this it really did sort of fall by
04:49
the wayside the idea of public transport
04:51
for a long time didn't it
04:52
so obviously you could get coaches and
04:54
you could you could hire lots if you
04:55
could hire a private coach or get on a
04:57
post chase or whatever but the idea that
05:00
a bus would have a specific route and
05:01
you knew when it was going to be where
05:03
and you could wait there and pick it up
05:05
then didn't come back until 1828 i think
05:07
in europe
05:09
and in nantes that is a long gap between
05:12
buses isn't it
05:14
if you just missed the last one in the
05:16
1690s and you're like okay i'll wait for
05:18
the next one
05:20
it's there on the schedule what
05:25
1828 it's only 1747 now that's fine
05:28
no it's not the clock 1828 two suddenly
05:31
came at once
05:32
it was a classic um but he he didn't
05:35
even want it to be a public transport
05:37
system really
05:38
did he this was a guy called stanislas
05:39
baudry and
05:41
he had a bath house and he basically
05:43
just wanted to get people to his bath
05:45
house
05:45
and so he put on a public bus in order
05:48
to transport them there and he realized
05:49
people were getting on it but they're
05:50
not getting in the bath at the end
05:52
that would be quite useful for your nude
05:54
bus drives dan
05:57
and how to get changed when you get to
05:58
the bathhouse
06:01
it would be amazing if you could get a
06:03
bus which was going to the
06:05
swimming pool and the bus just ended up
06:07
in the swimming pool and you could just
06:08
swim out
06:09
oh yes it just goes in and then the bus
06:13
goes
06:14
out of the ramp oh swimmers who finish
06:16
get off
06:17
like in the um italian job is it where
06:19
there's a bus kind of gets to the edge
06:21
of the cliff at the end
06:22
and you could kind of jump off the bus
06:24
and dive into the water that'd be quite
06:26
cool
06:26
yeah yeah you need to have people have
06:28
you seen that movie james
06:35
you should write a book about films
06:37
because you are knowledgeable
06:39
but yeah you've seen none of them it's
06:42
great
06:42
the 19th century buses when they came
06:44
back um
06:46
they were the first ones that had an
06:47
upper deck which was really cool
06:49
so the upper deck you could go there for
06:51
half price
06:52
but only if you were a man they wouldn't
06:54
let women go up there
06:56
uh and the reason was because it was
06:58
deemed unbecoming
06:59
uh for a woman to go up there in the big
07:01
skirts that they were wearing and even
07:02
actually impossible because it was like
07:04
a ladder to get to the top deck
07:06
and also because it was completely in
07:07
the open so most of the time you just
07:09
get drenched by rain or wind or whatever
07:11
so it was seen
07:12
unbecoming for women to get drenched is
07:14
that because if someone's following you
07:16
up the stairs they see up your dress
07:17
to your panties well there might have
07:20
been some of that
07:20
in there because actually when they
07:22
brought the public transport into france
07:25
and the the second time it kind of
07:27
became a thing where
07:29
it was giving women more chance to move
07:31
around
07:32
and it was associated with like
07:34
transgression
07:35
uh in women like a lot of whenever any
07:37
kind of freedom got given to women in
07:39
history
07:40
like people thought oh this must be a
07:41
terrible thing yeah
07:43
but as james was saying as well um
07:45
there's a suggestion which i think is a
07:46
very
07:47
it's a more jokey suggestion that the
07:49
skirts the frames of those giant hoop
07:51
skirts
07:52
would be so large they physically
07:54
couldn't fit them they would get stuck
07:56
on the way up
07:57
um but yeah but as a result um it became
07:59
quite a social place the bus and there
08:01
was
08:02
sort of known bus perverts who would
08:04
sort of just hang out
08:05
just so that they could be around all
08:07
these women i'm so worried dan that
08:08
you've elided immediately
08:10
the it became quite a social place and
08:12
there were these bus
08:14
perverts and so that's the definition of
08:16
a social place is if you've got a good
08:17
pervert there holding court
08:23
it led to bust pervertism where
08:26
you would have yeah like guys would just
08:29
spend the whole day on the bus and
08:30
you know if another lady came on they
08:32
would sit next to her and
08:33
or be squashed up next to someone it was
08:36
it was the perfect way for the pervert
08:38
to suddenly have access to
08:40
to a bunch of women which was a big
08:42
problem not saying it's a good thing
08:44
guys
08:44
but um buses are quite sociable now
08:47
aren't they the wenger bus for instance
08:49
yeah uh the bus the buses spice well the
08:52
movie they all had a perfect
08:54
acquaintance with bosses
08:55
it's from film even though you don't
08:56
watch films
08:59
i just think like it is a social thing a
09:02
bus isn't it
09:02
it's true have you seen spiceworld the
09:04
movie no i obviously haven't seized by
09:06
the body
09:08
i haven't either but it's got richard e
09:09
granted isn't it he's the bus driver
09:11
don't know he's the manager yeah oh yeah
09:13
but does he also drive the bus
09:15
i think at one point he does drive the
09:16
bus yeah yeah okay so does victoria
09:18
beckham but i don't call her the bus
09:20
driver in the movie
09:22
um summer holiday with cliff richard
09:24
that had a bus in it
09:25
yep yes i think this bicycle one is
09:28
technically a coach
09:29
by the definitions we're running by it's
09:30
not like anyone could board it's not the
09:32
spice girls paid their 180
09:34
fare didn't the spice girls buy out all
09:38
the seats in that bus so no one else
09:40
could get on it
09:41
yeah that's right imagine how long it
09:43
would take to tour the country of all
09:45
the buses taking the bands around
09:46
were public buses
09:50
we've got three hours to get there but
09:51
we've got 40 stops along the way
09:55
can i tell you guys a personal something
09:57
personal
09:58
yes oh boy so i was recently reading an
10:02
old copy of the pic quick papers
10:04
that i found i think in my parents house
10:05
ages ago well no i think i inherited it
10:07
from my grandma
10:09
anyway i i opened it to one page and
10:12
there was a bus ticket in there or a
10:13
tram ticket sorry
10:15
it's just a scrap of tran tram ticket is
10:17
from london united
10:18
tramways so i looked that up and that
10:20
ran from 1894 to 1933
10:22
and it's punched for a journey in the
10:24
sort of um wimbledon kingston
10:26
area and it says it cost two pennies it
10:28
was 2d
10:29
and isn't that cool and i don't know who
10:31
owned it and i looked it up and like
10:33
looking up
10:33
the um when the ticket was from when
10:36
those stops existed and also the advert
10:38
on the other side so on the other side
10:40
there's an advert
10:40
for um holloway's magic ointment or
10:43
holloway's all-rounder ointment
10:45
okay i think it's from 1900. wow what
10:48
what does excitement do that's what i'm
10:50
getting from this story
10:51
it cures absolutely everything james
10:53
it's an all-round remedy it literally
10:54
said
10:55
backache heart attacks brain disease
10:58
vomiting wow
10:59
it's all there it actually then i got i
11:01
went on a stupid rabbit hole it was made
11:03
by a guy called thomas holloway and it
11:04
made him super rich
11:06
and so he bought this mansion called
11:08
tittenhurst park
11:10
and that dan you do recognize it
11:13
why do you recognize it the beatles yeah
11:16
apparently john lennon lived there 100
11:18
years after him
11:19
yeah wow so that was a convoluted
11:22
way that i got to john lennon via this
11:24
fact but anyway
11:26
isn't that cool that i've got a bus
11:27
ticket from 120 years ago
11:29
that is very very cool do you know can i
11:31
give a quick personal story
11:33
sure um when i went to zanzibar on
11:35
honeymoon
11:36
suddenly coming coming up next wait a
11:39
minute did you find the bus ticket that
11:40
used to belong to freddie mercury or
11:42
something
11:46
next to me is is uh anna's grandmother
11:48
driving a bus i just couldn't believe it
11:52
next to me is a bus that i used to get
11:55
not the
11:55
obviously the exact bus but a bus that i
11:57
used to get in hong kong
11:59
as a kid and i suddenly looked around
12:01
and all the buses in zanzibar
12:03
with the old buses from hong kong from
12:05
my childhood
12:06
and i think when buses are put out of
12:09
you know when new buses come in to say
12:11
london or whatever they shift out all
12:12
these buses to all these different
12:13
countries
12:14
yeah and they're in zanzibar that is
12:16
awesome all the old london buses went to
12:18
macau i think
12:19
so if you they might not be there
12:20
anymore but about 10 years ago if you
12:22
went on a bus in macau they were all
12:23
old london buses wow and the ben the
12:26
bendy buses
12:26
i think we've said before they went
12:28
somewhere super inappropriate
12:30
i don't mean like they went to a sex
12:32
club i mean they went to
12:34
so they went to a
12:40
[Laughter]
12:45
um can i quickly tell you the most
12:47
desperate ever
12:48
press release i found about buses oh
12:52
okay this was a this was at the time the
12:54
james bond film spectre was coming out
12:56
but the press releases by national
12:58
express the bus company
13:00
suave and sophisticated james bond is
13:02
unquestionably one of the most glamorous
13:03
characters of all time
13:04
but was the world's most famous buy
13:06
named after a humble
13:07
bus it's a question national express
13:10
hopes to answer once and for all
13:12
wait a minute we know where he got his
13:14
name james fun i know
13:16
i know but the double 07 bit i mean oh
13:19
right okay
13:20
sorry yeah the national express double
13:22
07 coach service which was formerly a
13:23
bus route when it was taken over in 1973
13:26
operates nine times daily between deal
13:28
and victoria it is rumored bond author
13:30
fleming
13:31
was inspired by the destination blind of
13:33
his local bus to adopt the
13:34
number and they they go on and on and on
13:38
about it and they even got a national
13:39
express driver to say
13:41
well james bond is more likely to be
13:42
seen behind the wheel of a bentley it's
13:44
a massive honor to drive the double 07
13:46
and it certainly attracts a lot of
13:47
attention
13:48
it's always a talking point you see
13:50
heads turning by as you go by
13:52
and people pointing there are definitely
13:54
more passengers recently perhaps because
13:56
of the new film
13:57
i would have thought that's definitely
13:58
the case it turns out that the national
14:00
numbering scheme wasn't actually
14:01
introduced
14:02
until the mid-1970s
14:06
jesus christ
14:11
[Applause]
14:12
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:14
that is
14:15
anna my fact this week is that aladdin
14:19
is chinese what
14:24
are you doing your own hype for the
14:25
facts now anna i am yeah
14:28
i feel like that hadn't got enough of a
14:29
reaction to provide it
14:31
what whoa
14:35
thank you i know right so
14:39
i decided i wanted to read aladdin so i
14:41
read about this new translation
14:43
so i bought it recently opened it and
14:46
the very first line
14:47
of the story no bus tickets in there
14:50
one way to take it on a magic carpet
14:53
it was a bus ticket from shanghai which
14:55
is how i knew
14:57
um the first line is in one of china's
14:59
vast and wealthy kingdoms
15:02
i thought this is a translation
15:03
they've got this country wrong first
15:05
sentence
15:06
but turns out it's bang on and he was
15:09
from china and so
15:11
the whole story behind aladdin and the
15:13
1001 arabian nights which is what it's a
15:16
part of
15:16
is kind of an amazing story of tales
15:19
being passed from one country to the
15:21
next
15:22
so basically it was written down for the
15:23
first time by a
15:25
french guy called antoine gallon and
15:28
this is in the very early 1700s
15:30
and he'd been told it by a sirian who
15:33
he'd met a guy from aleppo
15:35
and the serena told her as him being a
15:36
chinese person so it was told in arabia
15:39
but aladdin was chinese and it was just
15:42
this thing where whenever something is
15:43
kind of exotic or foreign
15:45
we go east we seem to just go east when
15:47
we're telling a story something exotical
15:48
foreign so if you were in persia
15:51
then and you wanted to convey that
15:52
something was like exotic or a bit
15:53
strange
15:54
you put it in china said it in china and
15:56
i don't know what you do in china you
15:57
said it in
15:58
japan um yeah japan um alaska
16:02
is is uh is his name aladdin then
16:04
because that's not a very chinese
16:05
name no this is the weird thing about it
16:08
the details are
16:09
quite arabic so they didn't really know
16:11
much about actual china
16:14
um but they were just setting it in
16:15
china so throughout the story you'll
16:17
read you know he was in one of these
16:18
classic chinese palaces
16:19
and then they'll describe the palace and
16:21
it'll be a combination of an arabian
16:23
palace with some french influence
16:24
because it was written down by a french
16:26
guy
16:26
was there a theory that gallon had
16:28
invented it himself as well
16:30
because it took a long time to track
16:31
down the syrian who
16:33
sort of told him the story yeah this is
16:36
also amazing yeah no but i i love that
16:39
this was
16:40
this mystery was solved sort of hundreds
16:41
of years later so yeah galon said that
16:43
he'd
16:44
he wrote down a thousand one nights the
16:46
arabic stories
16:47
and then people were clamoring for more
16:50
and so he wrote down some more stories
16:52
that weren't in the original arabic
16:53
versions he was translating and he said
16:55
that he'd been told them by this syrian
16:56
guy
16:57
but everyone sort of assumed he just
16:59
made them up and then given them this
17:00
origin story
17:02
uh from syria and then they found the
17:04
autobiography of the syrian guy who's
17:07
called hannah diab
17:08
and they found the autobahn in 1993.
17:10
isn't that which is how incredible is
17:12
that
17:13
280 years later does he say in his
17:16
autobiography
17:16
met a french guy today and told him this
17:18
brilliant story about a chinese guy in
17:20
the lab he does
17:21
he does he mentions it he mentions it in
17:24
his memoirs
17:25
and there is a theory now on new theory
17:27
which is that
17:28
the story of aladdin might be an
17:30
autobiography of this guy called diab
17:32
and he's talking about when he arrived
17:34
in paris because
17:35
he arrived in versailles and they had
17:37
all these wonderful things and aladdin
17:39
is obviously the story of a young boy
17:41
who kind of
17:42
gets lots of riches and stuff and so it
17:44
might have been him kind of turning
17:46
his experiences into an arabic story
17:49
yeah wow well definitely influenced by
17:51
his time in france anyway because yeah
17:53
when aladdin's magic says palace out of
17:54
nothing
17:55
it's very much versaille-influenced it's
17:57
pretty amazing that this was
17:59
this was a very famous text for its time
18:01
right the the arabian nights
18:03
and then this guy comes along he adds
18:06
not only
18:07
probably the most famous story which is
18:09
aladdin but he also adds the story of
18:11
alibaba and the 40 thieves he adds the
18:14
seven voyages of sinbad the sailor the
18:16
three most famous stories probably
18:18
had nothing to do with the original it's
18:20
it's fan fiction
18:22
being added to a book which has suddenly
18:25
overtaken the book
18:26
he was it wasn't that famous when he was
18:28
translating it was it i don't think
18:30
and he was kind of the one who made it
18:32
famous and the problem was
18:33
like europe yeah yeah sorry in europe
18:36
for sure
18:37
but like hannah said people wanted more
18:40
and so his publishers just started going
18:41
oh we'll just write some more then and
18:43
put them in your name
18:44
so they started taking other stories
18:46
from turkey and from other parts of
18:48
eastern europe and then putting them in
18:50
as part of the 1001 nights
18:52
and he's like no no wait no don't put
18:54
those ones in i'll give you some
18:56
more i'll give you some more and that's
18:57
where
18:58
like these new ones like sinbad and
18:59
aladdin came from that's a good way to
19:01
threaten an author
19:02
to threaten to write the sequel really
19:04
badly that's true they should do that
19:06
with um george r.r martin shouldn't they
19:08
they should say we're just gonna write
19:10
the last game of thrones we're just
19:12
gonna get um
19:13
el james to write it he's like
19:15
[Laughter]
19:17
he also had his windows in paris pelted
19:20
with kind of rotten fruit and hard
19:21
objects by people who wanted more
19:22
stories
19:23
the reading public was much more
19:25
demanding in those days
19:27
imagine if i'd done that to hillary
19:28
mantel for the last five years
19:30
just kind of attacking her with various
19:32
missiles
19:34
and it wouldn't induce you to want to
19:35
satisfy your public by writing something
19:37
but it did
19:38
and he did but um the story um that we
19:40
all know
19:41
i would say is as a result of the the
19:44
brilliant
19:45
animated 1992 movie i think we've all
19:47
seen that haven't we
19:49
have we all seen that yeah
19:55
um but um yeah so classic hollywood
19:58
distorted
19:58
the the facts of the story uh bent them
20:02
to be a different story altogether so
20:03
in it aladdin's not an orphan in the
20:05
original story
20:06
uh which he's portrayed as in the movie
20:08
he he lives with his mum and
20:10
in the original story it's not just one
20:12
genie granting wishes it's two genies
20:14
um there's a genie of the lamp and
20:16
there's a genie of the ring um and then
20:18
it's not three wishes
20:20
like he gets as many wishes he just
20:21
keeps wishing away he
20:23
sent me a wishing pod did he do that did
20:24
he do that trick that everyone says
20:26
they're gonna do when they're a kid
20:27
where their first wishes for infinite
20:29
wishes is that how he does
20:32
it's not allowed the genie specifically
20:33
bans that in the disney film which you
20:35
wouldn't know
20:36
if you had watched it james i really
20:38
thought that wasn't
20:40
that's so good that it's infinite though
20:41
i always thought it was a million
20:43
how stupid would i have looked with you
20:45
guys as i got to my millionth
20:46
of
20:52
[Laughter]
20:56
although you could have asked for a
20:57
thousand and one in arabic
20:59
because the reason it's a thousand and
21:00
one nights is actually because that was
21:02
like an arabic word for
21:03
infinite infinite stories yeah because
21:06
if they called it 270 nights roughly
21:09
it's not as impressive or sexy is it
21:11
it's not
21:12
but also no wonder the publishers wanted
21:14
more stories like this is nowhere near
21:16
the number you've promised
21:19
um hey the most striking thing about the
21:21
story which as i say i have just read
21:22
and it is great
21:23
is aladdin is a complete
21:26
like not a likable character at all so
21:29
the reason his dad dies at the start is
21:31
because aladdin is so
21:32
lazy and greasy and dissipated and cruel
21:34
that his dad's just devastated that he
21:36
won't follow him
21:37
in his career path and basically he just
21:40
gets really lucky he gets sort of
21:42
kidnapped by this bloke who reveals all
21:44
these riches to him
21:45
and then he manages to escape the bloke
21:48
the wizard
21:49
and then just uses all the riches to
21:51
seduce the princess
21:52
he falls in love with the princess
21:54
because he
21:55
hears that she's going to be going to
21:56
the bath i don't know what number bus
22:00
at the time but here she's going to be
22:02
going to the bars and so he sneaks
22:04
in to spy on her because he's never seen
22:06
a woman unveiled before
22:08
sees her face really from like behind
22:10
the door really fancies her and she's
22:12
gonna marry this guy who seems like a
22:13
really
22:14
decent bloke the vizier's son and
22:16
aladdin just on their wedding night
22:19
on the viziers and her wedding night
22:21
magic uses the lamp to magic
22:23
their marriage bed into his own home and
22:26
then he gets of his
22:26
son out he sends him out to spend the
22:28
whole night in a freezing cold toilet
22:30
outside
22:31
and then lies with the princess well
22:32
that's just how he is that's why he's
22:34
called aladdin isn't it because he's an
22:35
absolute lad
22:38
the full name is an absolute laden yeah
22:40
an absolute lad get in there
22:42
yeah so anna you haven't been reading
22:46
the
22:46
richard burton one right no this is a
22:49
new translation which
22:50
i would recommend because it's by this
22:51
woman called yasmine seal who is french
22:53
syrian which i just love because
22:55
obviously it was an
22:55
amalgamation of french and syrian when
22:58
it was first written
22:59
but no not not that one why richard
23:02
burton
23:02
was the richard burton the victorian
23:05
explorer and
23:06
linguist he did all these amazing
23:07
adventures he visited mecca in disguise
23:10
once when he would have been killed if
23:11
he'd been discovered you know he was an
23:12
amazing adventurer
23:13
but burton wrote a really uh erotic
23:18
translation of the thousand and one
23:19
knights because he also translated the
23:21
karma sutra
23:22
and he was um very much perfect
23:26
this is the best pervert of his day he
23:28
was
23:30
but in his version of aladdin aladdin's
23:32
father is impotent and so he takes an
23:34
opium based medicine to thicken his
23:36
semen
23:38
that's just a detail of the story cool
23:41
i think that's the holloway's ointment
23:43
of its day isn't it
23:46
yeah it had to be his version had to be
23:48
privately printed didn't it it was
23:50
yeah i think because of the sexual
23:51
content yeah you had to
23:53
you couldn't buy it uh it was through
23:55
subscription that you had to get it
23:56
wow yeah and i haven't seen the disney
23:58
film for a while but i'm pretty sure
23:59
they didn't leave that element
24:01
did they it's strongly implied
24:06
yeah he was a pretty crazy character
24:08
richard burton i'm never sure how i feel
24:10
about him
24:11
but he he did like to sex things up i
24:13
suppose he didn't need to sex up the
24:14
karma suture too much
24:17
he wrote his own i think most of what we
24:18
know about him is from his own
24:19
autobiography and also the biography of
24:20
his adoring wife
24:22
and he claimed that he learned latin
24:24
fluently at the age of three and greek
24:26
fluently at the age of four
24:28
and he could play chess blindfolded and
24:31
he but he was amazing he just sort of
24:33
traveled everywhere he ended up speaking
24:34
40 languages
24:36
got in loads of trouble i think he got
24:38
he was a soldier in india
24:40
and he got kicked out of india and his
24:42
life as a soldier failed when
24:44
his governor basically asked him to
24:46
investigate some rumors that they'd
24:47
heard about brothels in the city
24:49
and because he had an eye for detail
24:51
especially lascivious detail
24:53
he just investigated them way too hard
24:56
so he spent lots and lots of time in
24:58
brothels just taking
24:59
meticulous notes about exactly what was
25:02
going on
25:02
and the authorities were like this
25:04
is rank richard oh
25:06
go home you are sick and that
25:09
killed his career did you know that the
25:11
queen has played aladdin
25:13
it was when she was it was during the
25:14
war during the war queen elizabeth
25:16
played
25:17
aladdin in the royal family's pantomime
25:20
to raise money for soldiers
25:22
um i think they invited a small audience
25:24
of aristocrats
25:25
and she would have been in her early
25:26
teens i guess at the time
25:28
yeah pre queen her pre queens they call
25:31
them in the royal family
25:35
and was it with the others in it was
25:36
like margaret the parrot or
25:38
margot margaret was in her but i don't
25:40
think
25:43
it's like when you're at like when i was
25:45
at school um
25:47
in the nativity play when i was in the
25:49
top
25:50
year i played uh joseph which was very
25:53
nice
25:53
the main part main role yeah i don't
25:56
know if you know i don't know if you
25:57
know that the temperature starting
26:00
he's a pretty big deal it's a pretty big
26:01
one my brother in the same play
26:03
played a blade of grass
26:10
wow they couldn't find a single bigger
26:14
role for him than a
26:15
single blade of grass not even a few
26:17
blades of grass no there was
26:18
one there was a few different i don't
26:20
think he was like um a head blade of
26:22
grass
26:23
and they all cut he didn't have a
26:24
speaking role
26:28
there's no um sentient grass in the um
26:31
the story
26:32
but basically you had a load of the kids
26:35
would kind of stand there and kind of
26:37
wave in the breeze as if they were a
26:38
blade of grass i don't remember any
26:40
grass being mentioned in any version of
26:42
the nativity i've ever heard
26:44
what did the donkey eat i get i guess
26:47
straw
26:48
what straw if it's not dry grass yeah
26:51
fair enough so was his role to be eaten
26:53
by the donkey at some point
26:58
oh my goodness
27:01
okay it is time for fact number three
27:03
and that is my fact
27:05
my fact this week is that
27:06
merry-go-rounds were invented in
27:08
medieval times
27:09
for nights to ride on so
27:13
this is uh carousels for any americans
27:16
listening the merry-go-round
27:17
has a very long history um the it sort
27:19
of originates back in the 12th century
27:21
there was a game
27:22
that was played uh on horseback where
27:25
a sort of scented ball used to be tossed
27:28
around
27:29
uh to people and if you dropped it or if
27:32
it smashed on you it would release a
27:33
kind of perfume
27:34
and that perfume would stink you up uh
27:36
for the rest of the match
27:38
and that word uh was carousello
27:41
which meant little war carousello is the
27:43
sort of bastardization of the by the
27:45
italians who took it on
27:47
um and then they realized how useful
27:50
this was
27:50
in combat training purposes and um
27:53
so little war carousello slowly morphed
27:57
into
27:58
knights sitting on what were effectively
28:01
saddles and they would go around a pole
28:04
on chains
28:05
and they would have to try and lance
28:07
with their lancers
28:08
uh a little ring and that was the very
28:11
beginnings
28:11
of that what eventually turned into what
28:14
we now have as the modern day carousel
28:16
so yeah it was originally for night
28:18
training so
28:19
this game well you throw balls at people
28:22
and if you drop them they make you smell
28:25
like perfume
28:27
what's the point of that i think i think
28:30
it's
28:30
really weird because basically
28:34
if you smell like perfume you smell
28:36
quite nice and
28:37
the other people will smell like they've
28:38
been riding around on a horse all
28:39
afternoon and they'll be sweaty and
28:41
disgusting and supposedly this
28:43
perfume people are the losers i say
28:44
they've won i agree i just
28:46
because i read about this as well and
28:48
that was the one thing that stuck with
28:49
me this seems like a pretty stupid
28:51
bit like quidditch being a stupid game
28:53
this is kind of a stupid game where it's
28:55
not really obvious
28:56
what the point of winning or losing is i
28:59
i just didn't like it at
29:00
all you wouldn't say that james about
29:02
quidditch to the people who play
29:03
quidditch in the park near my house
29:06
and they're not even flying are they a
29:08
scary looking bunch
29:10
they've all got sticks that's true
29:12
although the sticks do have to be
29:13
clamped between their legs
29:15
uh otherwise it's cheating i think it's
29:18
the shame of it right so andy could sit
29:20
at
29:20
stinking of perfume in the dining hall
29:22
afterwards shrieking i've won in most
29:25
senses of the word he likes but in the
29:28
end
29:28
everyone knows that you've lost that's
29:30
true i suppose if you
29:31
play an actual sport and then you go to
29:33
the pub afterwards you don't really know
29:35
who's lost
29:36
it's not obvious to everyone else in the
29:38
pub who's lost but then ever
29:40
yeah as anna points out it is obvious
29:42
because any time i finish playing sport
29:44
i'm the one who's lost
29:49
um so early carousels though they were
29:51
powered by animals walking in a circle
29:53
which i had no idea
29:54
about so instead of what as well as
29:55
having a fake horse that you'd be riding
29:57
on there would be a real horse
29:58
why don't you just get up why don't you
30:00
just get the real house like if you're
30:02
if the whole point is to train how to
30:04
ride horses and you've got an actual
30:06
horse there
30:07
why are you sitting on the fake one yeah
30:10
it's true very weird
30:11
those horses i mean that is so demeaning
30:13
for those horses
30:15
imagine your job being to pull around a
30:17
fake much less developed version of
30:20
yourself
30:22
well that's basically taking your child
30:23
for a walk in the park isn't it
30:27
yeah because they used to put knights on
30:29
loose horses and sort of push them
30:31
around
30:31
they would have squires pulling the
30:33
horses so that they could practice their
30:35
jousting
30:36
um what do you mean you mean fake horses
30:38
like wooden horses yeah wooden horses
30:39
exactly
30:41
they would uh try and hit a target
30:43
called a quintane wouldn't they
30:44
which we've mentioned on cuya quintane
30:46
but i don't think we've mentioned here
30:48
and it basically is a um it's a wooden
30:51
post with a target on
30:53
and the target is on a bit of a lever
30:54
and so when you hit it it flips around
30:57
and that was the way that you would test
30:59
how to do jousting
31:00
it was um crucial for jousting training
31:03
but
31:04
jousting wasn't the most crucial thing
31:05
that knights did in competitions right i
31:07
think we've mentioned this on qi but for
31:09
most of the middle ages
31:10
if you went to a tournament as a knight
31:12
they did the malay
31:14
which was like a very chaotic it's like
31:16
the royal rumble wasn't it
31:18
melee what's the royal rumble
31:21
well it began in medieval times
31:26
don't explain what the royal rumble is
31:28
nana's tell us if this is the same as a
31:30
melee
31:30
royal rumble is a wwf now wwe event
31:34
where you have about 30 wrestlers who
31:36
will
31:37
all attack each other at the same time
31:39
in the ring they're staggered in so you
31:40
would have someone
31:41
two people started off and then let's
31:43
say every two minutes a new person
31:45
enters the ring
31:46
to win the match you have to flip
31:48
someone over the top rope and they have
31:50
to make contact with the floor so it's
31:51
not exactly the same
31:53
so it's the same way that there's loads
31:55
there's loads of them involved all
31:56
fighting each other right
31:57
yes exactly but also like in the royal
32:00
rumble in the melee
32:01
you could kind of sneak in the corner
32:03
and hide under some
32:04
coats or something and let everyone else
32:06
beat each other in the fight and then
32:08
you could jump out at the last minute
32:10
and fight classic classic sean michael's
32:12
tactic
32:12
of wwe absolutely well he actually got
32:16
it from the medieval english
32:17
are there coats in the corner during a
32:19
wrestling match
32:21
it feels like as you come in he just oh
32:23
leave your coat on the bed
32:26
english used to be famous for this
32:28
strategy where if there were lots of
32:29
different uh
32:30
groups around the english would say they
32:31
weren't going to play they're not
32:33
interested in the malay
32:34
at all so that all the other teams would
32:36
play and really really tire each other
32:37
out
32:38
this was around the time of henry ii and
32:40
once all the other
32:41
teams are really really tired out
32:42
they've been knocked off their horses
32:44
they've run out of steam
32:45
the english suddenly would gallop in so
32:47
we've changed our minds we're playing
32:48
we're playing
32:49
and then they completely vanquish
32:50
everyone else on the pitch
32:52
wow that was what we were known for but
32:53
then probably they wouldn't invite us
32:55
back to the next melee
32:56
would they we were they're still doing
32:58
them in france so we just never we
33:00
haven't been asked for 800 years
33:02
um but the reason jousting became
33:04
popular do you know why it was switched
33:05
to jousting from malay
33:07
no this is that knights were so violent
33:10
they were massive thugs and it was a
33:11
serious problem so the first ever mass
33:14
peace movement the peace and truth of
33:15
god movement was basically to stop
33:17
knights from killing each other
33:18
and everyone else and they so they used
33:21
to do things like a knights tournament
33:22
wouldn't just be in one
33:24
area until the quite near the end of the
33:26
middle ages a night's tournament would
33:27
be across the countryside
33:29
so you have 20 nights and they're just
33:31
fighting each other they gallop across
33:33
the countryside they used to do things
33:34
like
33:34
they bash down the doors of peasants
33:36
homes and be like you've got to give me
33:37
shelter let me hide in your cupboard
33:39
and then if another night came then
33:40
they'd burn down the peasant's house to
33:42
burn the night
33:43
out to get rid of him there's nothing
33:44
you can do as a peasant you're obliged
33:46
to give knights bed and board if they
33:48
ask for it
33:48
and they used to ruin people's crops you
33:51
know they burned down
33:52
fences and hedges it was just chaos and
33:54
so
33:55
that's amazing it sounds super fun
33:57
incredibly fun
33:59
and i think mainly the clergy said this
34:01
is getting out of control
34:03
let's make it one-on-one shall we so if
34:05
you had a house
34:06
and the night came along and they said
34:08
we want to stay in your
34:09
house you had to let them stay it was
34:12
actually if it was your
34:13
lord but yeah it would usually be that
34:15
guy and you had to feed them for as long
34:17
as they wanted feeding and give them
34:18
somewhere to sleep which was pretty
34:20
harsh because they obviously had enough
34:21
to eat and by and large you didn't yeah
34:23
they must have come over and said can i
34:25
stay with you and you said how many
34:26
nights and they said well there's 600 of
34:28
us
34:28
[Laughter]
34:31
on innovations of how it slowly evolved
34:34
into the
34:35
modern day carousel merry-go-round that
34:37
we have i was trying to find at what
34:39
points it sort of turned more and more
34:41
into what we have
34:42
and i discovered now i'm still on the
34:45
case with this investigation i must say
34:47
so this might be wrong but i think that
34:50
the person
34:51
who invented the device that allowed the
34:53
horse to go
34:54
up and down the pole as it's going round
34:57
you so you know what i'm talking about
34:58
how yeah he's a string fellow yeah
35:04
was a man called merlin which is a nice
35:08
no yeah i believe that it was a man
35:11
called john joseph merlin
35:13
now he's been mentioned on the podcast
35:15
before because he was the man who
35:16
invented roller skates and
35:18
first displayed them when he played a
35:20
violin at a party and ended up crashing
35:22
into a giant mirror
35:24
you remember him this is that very same
35:25
man and
35:27
he was an amazing inventor uh during
35:30
um his lifetime of living in london
35:32
particularly he was from belgium
35:34
to begin with and he invented all sorts
35:36
of things like a self-propelled
35:38
wheelchair
35:39
um he had a pedal operated revolving tea
35:42
table he had mechanical chariots that
35:45
used to go around london
35:46
and he had his own museum which was
35:49
called the merlin's mechanical museum
35:50
and in it
35:51
is the description of this carousel
35:55
with horses that go up and down and
35:57
noble people and and rich people of the
35:59
time
36:00
used to come and hire it out
36:02
specifically just to have rides on it at
36:03
this place so this is
36:05
he died at the beginning of 1800 1803
36:08
um so we're talking late 1700s here it's
36:10
the first description that i can find of
36:12
that innovation of the horse going up
36:14
and down
36:14
invented by merlin so is your theory
36:16
that merlin
36:18
first existed in the 1800s invented that
36:20
and then went back in time to king
36:21
arthur and co
36:22
and brought with him his training device
36:24
for the night well you've taken the
36:26
theory further but i'm on board
36:27
i absolutely will fold that into the
36:30
idea and
36:31
merlin i believe in the disney sword in
36:33
the stone which is very close to the
36:35
original story
36:36
um it's not merlin at the end enters on
36:39
roller skates
36:40
is he so this is all coming together
36:43
fairly certain wow it's just a shame no
36:46
one will hear it once james has edited
36:48
it
36:51
oh i have a fact about um airplane rides
36:54
okay at a fun fair yeah
36:55
okay so the flight simulating aeroplane
36:58
ride at a fun fair where you sit in a
37:00
little plane
37:00
and it you know moves up and left and
37:02
right and rolls around a bit that was
37:03
invented to train pilots
37:05
[Music]
37:06
that is terrific genuinely this was
37:10
built
37:10
in the um this was built in the
37:13
early 30s i think maybe late 20s by an
37:15
event called lee irely
37:17
he built a small plane called the
37:18
orientator and it would tilt
37:20
left and right it was in this huge uh
37:22
y-shaped fork so the plane was stuck in
37:24
the
37:25
y of the fork as it were and it would
37:27
turn and roll and twist
37:29
and he thought this would be useful for
37:31
training pilots and he only sold
37:33
five of them all of them to the cuban
37:35
government
37:37
and that's what it was used for and then
37:40
a friend of his saw it and said
37:41
have you suggested turning out into a
37:43
carnival ride because that looks really
37:45
fun
37:46
and that's what he did and he spent the
37:48
rest of his life inventing the lupo
37:50
plane and the rolo plane and the rocco
37:52
plane and all that's right it's amazing
37:54
i mean like you've got the carousel
37:56
which was for training knights and
37:58
you've got this for training
37:59
you know that big boat that kind of goes
38:01
up and down in a rocking motion
38:03
is that to train vikings or something
38:06
yeah yeah
38:06
that's where admiral nelson
38:14
okay it is time for our final fact of
38:16
the show and that
38:17
is james okay my fact this week is that
38:20
in some parts of japan
38:22
earwigs are known as chinpo kiri
38:25
literally penis cutters
38:29
hmm are they much more powerful in japan
38:34
i don't think they're literally cutting
38:36
penises i think it might be
38:39
well okay so let me tell you where i
38:41
found this it basically came up on my
38:42
rss feed last week but i went to look
38:45
for evidence
38:46
i found the paper from 2013 from a
38:48
japanese entomologist called kenta
38:50
takada
38:51
called vulgar dialects names of earwigs
38:54
used in the kansai region of japan
38:57
okay so i went on to google translate
39:00
uh because this paper was in japanese
39:02
and it seems like the reason
39:04
that they're called this is one they
39:06
have pincers in the back here
39:08
um earwigs don't they on their bums they
39:10
have like these little pincers
39:11
and also in japan in this particular
39:14
area
39:14
kansai area which is around osaka and um
39:17
wherever
39:18
they were found in toilets uh they were
39:20
found around toilets so it might be that
39:22
if you
39:23
see something with pincers on it around
39:25
the toilets you might
39:26
call it a penis cutter because it's like
39:28
there might be a folklore that that
39:30
would happen
39:31
yeah makes sense so we don't think they
39:33
actually cut penises
39:35
um but it's just that it so happens that
39:37
in this particular part of
39:39
japan give it a give that a rude name um
39:42
i'm sure you guys have researched earwig
39:45
penises oh yeah
39:46
because this is another japanese
39:49
connection if you
39:50
search japan earwig penis it brings up a
39:53
study
39:53
done by yoshitaka kamimura of the tokyo
39:56
metropolitan university
39:58
who deliberately broke earwig penises
40:00
off
40:02
while they were mid sex that's not very
40:05
nice
40:05
just out of this so
40:08
they've there is a species lots of
40:10
species have two penises
40:12
um the males do anyway um and
40:15
there was a lot of theorizing about
40:17
whether they were useless or not
40:18
and uh so yoshitaka kamimura
40:22
he decided to test it and his colleagues
40:25
and
40:26
they would interrupt mating earwigs by
40:28
pinching the mail and lifting him off
40:29
and because they're very very very long
40:31
penises relative to the
40:32
the same length again they're quite
40:34
easily broken
40:35
and they're quite sensitive so they the
40:38
the penises all broke off
40:39
but within two days they found that
40:42
these males
40:43
who'd had a penis broken off could
40:44
inseminate new females they were
40:46
introduced to
40:47
and they collected 663 of these earwigs
40:51
from around japan
40:52
just to test whether they had been
40:53
undergoing similar problems without the
40:55
scientists interfering and snapping
40:57
their penises off
40:58
and they found that only a few had
41:00
sexual accidents like this but a few had
41:02
so three males had lost a penis and two
41:04
females had a
41:06
seven penis inside them from an earlier
41:10
so that's only one penis unaccounted for
41:12
from those which is good
41:13
keep your eyes peeled
41:16
the other thing is the second penis is
41:18
the wrong way around right so they must
41:19
have to learn a whole new sexual
41:21
position
41:22
uh in that two-day period i assumed it
41:25
just
41:25
moved into the position vacated by the
41:27
first one but you might well be right
41:29
oh okay i don't know well well they
41:31
think they have two because they used to
41:33
um
41:34
they used to use both at the same time
41:36
well some species only have one
41:38
some species of the ones who have two
41:41
they thought
41:41
that they think that some females might
41:43
have had a double vagina
41:45
i think they found double vagina females
41:47
right but they've never
41:48
witnessed the double penises interacting
41:51
with the double vaginas but it does seem
41:52
like the obvious thing doesn't it
41:55
if you've ever seen a glove and a hand
41:57
[Laughter]
41:59
you do automatically see one's going in
42:01
[Laughter]
42:04
but then you do find like men with only
42:06
one hand and they're women with an extra
42:08
hand found in their glove don't you
42:10
[Laughter]
42:13
i was just wondering if maybe um the
42:16
japanese name
42:17
penis cutters might be because they cut
42:20
their own penis off sometimes when
42:21
they're
42:22
when it falls off accidentally so maybe
42:25
it's not you're worried about your own
42:27
penis you're kind of worried about the
42:29
it no i don't think that's true is it i
42:31
do
42:32
i'm so i really really don't like
42:33
earwigs and i very rarely come across
42:35
them in my day-to-day life but i
42:37
remember as a child
42:38
thinking they're really scary because
42:39
they can really nip you can they can
42:41
they
42:42
yeah when they get their little pincers
42:43
together they can really be strong i
42:45
don't know if i've ever seen one
42:46
yeah i've never seen one lately you've
42:48
never seen them lately
42:49
they're a bit like any movie from before
42:51
1993
42:54
uh but i don't recall ever seeing that
42:56
do you get you get them in the uk i
42:57
suppose you must do but i don't remember
42:58
yeah
42:59
i cannot believe this is literally like
43:00
you've never seen an ant i've never seen
43:02
one
43:02
you just have never looked at the floor
43:04
i just think maybe i've seen them and
43:06
just thought it was a beetle
43:07
or something yeah they look like little
43:09
scorpions really don't they
43:11
um because of the pincers and the
43:13
pincers are
43:14
they're very strange because it's quite
43:15
weird having this defensive device on
43:17
your backside
43:18
and it has a few purposes but one is
43:21
for males to spa with each other and
43:24
you know to show who's dominant or
43:25
whatever but i was watching a video of
43:27
two male earwigs sparring with their
43:29
pincers and it's so awkward because
43:31
imagine kind of having to spar with
43:33
someone with your
43:34
butt cheeks so they they have to crane
43:36
round with their necks to try and
43:38
control
43:39
their pinces that they're jabbing at
43:41
each other it just is
43:42
it's so that is the royal rumble i want
43:44
to see
43:45
[Laughter]
43:47
you're only allowed to use your butt
43:49
yeah leave your coat on the bed and
43:51
leave your trousers
43:56
but also they don't um it's not uh it's
43:59
not a fight to the death
44:00
it's just a fight to when someone's like
44:02
okay i've had enough and
44:04
and they declare a winner and they go
44:06
off and they borrow themselves in a sort
44:08
of shameful
44:09
hiding don't they yeah yeah they they
44:12
get it's sort of like once you've lost
44:14
they they
44:14
jump away and then they dig themselves a
44:17
hole and stay in there and the victor
44:18
sort of like yeah i don't know why wow
44:21
so they can cry in peace i think
44:23
yeah once andy had had that scented ball
44:25
explode all over his face he spent some
44:27
time alone in a bathroom cubicle didn't
44:29
it
44:32
that's amazing it's amazing that earwigs
44:34
have uh shame and honor codes
44:36
like the rest of us i'm just surprised
44:39
and they've got very strong family
44:40
values
44:41
so the siblings stay together much
44:42
longer than they need to a mother earwig
44:44
raises her young and she's very attached
44:47
and she's very sweet so she sits on her
44:49
eggs and then on her nymphs on her baby
44:51
ear wigs she'll sit on top of them
44:52
all to nurture them and lick all the
44:54
mold and fungi off them
44:56
and then uh the earwigs are ready to
44:58
leave the nest very early on but they
45:00
all stay together anyway
45:01
and they think it might have something
45:03
to do with the fact that they all eat
45:04
each other's faeces
45:06
so if when times get too it was so nice
45:08
until then it was reminding me of how
45:10
during lockdown i'm seeing a lot of my
45:12
family on zoom quizzes and stuff
45:15
i'm like oh we're a bit like earwigs but
45:17
we don't eat each other's
45:18
well it's one of the main problems with
45:19
zoom isn't it and they're trying to
45:21
overcome this problem with the
45:22
technology
45:23
um because these guys are eating each
45:25
other's poo and it's only when they
45:26
don't have much food left
45:30
yeah you're not if you have a pizza in
45:31
the freezer you're not going to go
45:32
straight for the poo
45:33
are you that's pretty much their
45:36
attitude
45:37
yeah but it does seem to help them stay
45:39
alive for an extra few days in times of
45:41
warning
45:41
the mum though you say that she's very
45:43
caring and absolutely that's
45:45
right but that she does do an
45:46
interesting survival of the fittest
45:49
thing whereby the mothers have the
45:50
ability to smell out
45:52
who the healthier of their of their
45:54
offspring are
45:56
it's a chemical smell that comes off the
45:58
offspring that they can smell and so
45:59
once they've identified because they
46:00
have such a big
46:02
collection of babies uh it's something
46:04
like up to
46:05
60 i think i read um 30 to 60 at a time
46:08
so they need to make sure that the
46:10
healthy ones are the ones that survive
46:11
so they smell them out
46:13
and once they know which ones they are
46:14
they'll give them you know more to
46:16
eat
46:16
uh just to make them healthier and
46:18
they'll pay less attention to the
46:20
to the less healthy ones wow yeah yeah
46:23
ouch
46:24
so yeah survival of the fittest good
46:26
mums but also very very disciplined
46:29
[Music]
46:30
um this fight was about the names of
46:33
earwicks and what people
46:34
call them um in different countries they
46:36
have really weird
46:38
um synonyms i don't know if synonyms the
46:40
right words so like the manx word
46:42
in the isle of man their word for earwig
46:44
is the same as their word for a dung
46:46
fork
46:46
a dung a dung you know like a
46:48
pitchfork that you use to pick up dung
46:50
and then move it from one part of the
46:51
farm to the other part of the farm oh
46:53
yeah yeah
46:54
so just a dung fork is that what the
46:56
earwigs use to eat their siblings feces
46:58
as well
47:00
um in scotch gaelic the word for earwig
47:03
is the same as the word for having your
47:05
mouth so
47:05
full that your cheeks puff out
47:10
i don't know it's so weird the greek
47:12
word for earwig is the same as the word
47:13
for alligator and pruning scissors
47:16
the hungarian word for earwig is the
47:18
same for a catchy song
47:21
like uh oh like an earworm
47:24
in german in german it's an it's an
47:25
urverm i think in earwig as well so that
47:27
must be a link between those two yeah
47:29
okay it makes me think that it must have
47:31
been very confusing in greece if you
47:32
said to somebody could you please go and
47:34
fetch my pruning scissors they're in the
47:35
second draw down in my bedroom
47:43
uh in spanish the word for earwig is the
47:45
same as for an overhead kick in football
47:47
oh cool wow that's so weird yeah yeah
47:50
oh wait i have a theory about why that
47:52
one might be so oh
47:54
it's a pretty tenuous theory but when
47:56
earwigs are mating
47:57
um they have a really complicated sort
47:59
of dance they do getting to know each
48:01
other and i think that's
48:03
they smell each other and they the male
48:05
might do a little bit of flexing to show
48:06
off
48:07
and the female nibbles his forceps and
48:10
after about 10 minutes and she will
48:12
raise up her abdomen at the back
48:14
right and then the male has to twist his
48:16
abdomen
48:17
180 degrees left to right so his bum is
48:20
upside down basically and that means
48:22
that it's facing upwards and that means
48:24
that he can
48:24
couple with her so and then they spend
48:27
several hours having sex
48:28
um but that flexibility of the abdomen
48:31
might be why the bicycle kick has the
48:34
same name as the earwig
48:37
so can you tell me why the ukrainian
48:39
word for earwig is the same as their
48:41
word for pimp
48:43
well again it's to do with turning your
48:46
bomb 190 degrees
48:54

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another working from home
00:17
episode of no such thing as a fish
00:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
00:22
undisclosed locations in the uk
00:24
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:26
here with james harkin
00:28
with andrew hunter murray and anna
00:29
tajinski and once again we have gathered
00:32
around the microphones with our four
00:33
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:35
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with fact number one
00:39
and that's my fact this week
00:41
my fact is two days after receiving his
00:43
latest book
00:44
the author of annals of gullibility why
00:47
we get duped and how to avoid it
00:49
lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in
00:51
a ponzi scheme
00:53
how embarrassing yeah he did admit that
00:56
it was embarrassing he kind of thinks
00:58
it's funny now
00:59
you know with the distance of time to
01:01
look back at it but um
01:03
this is a guy called stephen greenspan
01:05
and he'd written this book
01:06
and um and it was meant to sort of help
01:09
you to understand how not to be duped by
01:11
exactly the thing
01:12
that caught him off guard so he got
01:14
caught off guard by the greatest ponzi
01:16
scheme of them all which was the bernie
01:18
madoff
01:18
um which set so many people around the
01:22
world
01:22
uh losing thousands and millions in some
01:25
cases
01:26
it's the biggest of its kind and yeah it
01:27
was recommendation via his sister
01:30
and um two days after receiving his
01:31
latest book he lost four hundred
01:33
thousand wow
01:34
in his advice as to how to avoid it did
01:37
it include things like you know
01:38
don't take advice from ill-informed
01:41
siblings and
01:42
don't invest with people who have
01:44
surnames that sound suspiciously like
01:45
the phrase
01:46
made off i think a revised edition was
01:49
uh hastily issued
01:51
with all this in there can i just check
01:53
is the pot is a ponzi scheme
01:55
basically a pyramid scheme
01:58
what it is is you get in early investors
02:00
and you get their money and when you
02:02
bring in new investors
02:03
you give the money of the new investors
02:05
a bit of it to the early investors so it
02:07
seems as if they're getting return on
02:09
their money
02:09
and then you kind of oh i thought that
02:11
was a pyramid scheme a pyramid scheme is
02:13
where
02:13
you uh bring in new investors and they
02:16
have to bring in new investors and that
02:18
money comes up to the
02:19
people higher up in the pyramid it's
02:21
slightly different
02:23
so the ponzi scream is more flat it's
02:25
more like a
02:26
a large plane on the deserts of egypt
02:30
compared to the pyramid a ponzi scheme
02:32
is the thing that we
02:34
used to do as kids which i found so
02:36
thrilling do you remember where you'd
02:37
get a letter
02:38
that had a chocolate bar in it and you
02:40
said and it said um
02:42
send this on with no wait how would it
02:45
work
02:46
no you're right you're doing it right
02:48
someone sends you a letter saying
02:50
send me a chocolate bar but then you
02:52
send the letter to six people
02:53
and then ask you ask each of them to
02:55
send you a chocolate bar and then you
02:56
get six chocolate bars
02:57
it was amazing that's a pyramid scheme
03:00
that's a pyramid scheme not a ponzi
03:01
scheme
03:02
but anna
03:09
there's quite a distinctive difference
03:11
so in a ponzi scheme
03:12
you would get a load of mars bars from
03:15
loads of different people
03:16
and then you would cut some of the mars
03:18
bars up and then give the mars bar back
03:20
with another half of a mars bar
03:22
to someone who said you won mars bar and
03:24
so they think they're getting one and a
03:25
half back
03:26
but actually what you're doing is you're
03:28
using other people's mars bars to do it
03:29
and eventually you're going to run out
03:30
of mars bars
03:32
do you have to re-wrap the mars bars
03:33
once you've cut them up i feel i feel
03:35
like it's more different with mars bars
03:37
than it is with money
03:40
it is when you get a monkey half a mars
03:42
bar through the bus
03:43
it's a bit different than getting a nice
03:45
crisp 50-pound note we're rich
03:48
you know what's weird just in order to
03:49
get ready for this fact i looked up what
03:50
a ponzi scheme was so i knew what it was
03:52
i now have no idea what it is off the
03:54
back of all these
03:56
it's literally learned all it is is the
03:59
pyramid scheme has one person at the top
04:01
10 people next 100 people next a
04:03
thousand people next whereas a ponzi
04:04
scheme has one person at the top and
04:06
then everyone else is flat
04:07
basically you actually did explain it
04:08
completely correctly dan we just started
04:10
throwing mars bars around
04:13
the first ponzi scheme was basically
04:15
invented by accident wasn't it by
04:17
charles ponzi
04:18
he didn't quite mean to do it he sort of
04:20
meant it to be legit
04:21
so it was in the 1920s and he was
04:24
he had the scheme where he was buying
04:26
stamps or actually these things
04:28
called reply coupons and that was when
04:30
if you wrote to a friend internationally
04:31
you included a reply coupon which i
04:34
think essentially meant
04:34
it was like doing a reverse charge call
04:36
but on a letter and it meant that they
04:38
could write back to you for free
04:39
anyway he bought them overseas for much
04:42
cheaper because they were cheaper
04:42
overseas and then sold them for more in
04:44
the us
04:45
and he said to people i've got this
04:47
amazing scheme where i can make a
04:48
massive profit on these reply coupons
04:50
and he got people to invest and they did
04:53
and he hadn't factored in the fact that
04:54
he'd have to pay for
04:56
all the ridiculous international travel
04:57
to these places to go and buy these
04:59
stamps in the first place so he realized
05:01
the scheme couldn't make any money at
05:02
all but these people were investing
05:04
loads of money
05:05
and you can see the reasoning where he
05:07
started to think
05:08
oh i still am receiving all this money
05:11
should i just keep keep going with this
05:13
and not mention that it doesn't work
05:14
it's kind of working well for a short
05:16
period of time isn't it i guess it is
05:18
until he um i think someone did the math
05:20
and worked out that
05:22
he was claiming to be buying and selling
05:24
a hundred and sixty million reply
05:26
coupons and only twenty seven thousand
05:28
existed in the world
05:30
yeah boston posted an article in 1920
05:33
didn't they
05:33
demonstrating that was completely
05:34
impossible uh and when they did an audit
05:37
afterwards
05:38
they found only 61 worth of these stamps
05:41
even though he'd said that he'd bought
05:42
millions and millions of dollars worth
05:44
wow so he did try he got a few he got a
05:47
few
05:48
uh but when the boston post came up with
05:50
this um
05:51
expose everyone thought oh my god i've
05:54
given him all
05:55
my money i need my money back and so
05:56
they did a run on him to try and get all
05:58
of their money back
06:00
and he just completely fronted it out
06:02
and he just said
06:03
yeah no worries uh you guys just queue
06:05
up uh and i'll give you your money back
06:07
and they stood in the queue and he
06:08
bought them sandwiches and coffee
06:10
and people weren't sure whether he was
06:12
real or not still at that stage
06:14
and so half the time they were cheering
06:16
him and half the time they were booing
06:17
him no one really knew what was
06:18
happening
06:19
and then eventually the government got
06:21
involved and looked at his accounts and
06:23
found he was three million dollars
06:25
in the red and they later revised it to
06:27
seven million dollars in the red and
06:28
he got arrested and when he got arrested
06:30
everyone lost their money oh wow
06:32
what was his long-term plan with that
06:34
queue outside his house
06:36
i just think sometimes it's like maybe
06:38
tomorrow it'll be fine
06:40
yeah if you're calm enough with the
06:42
beginning of the queue then the end will
06:43
probably get bored and go away but
06:44
that's what happened
06:45
like because loads of people started
06:47
running on it but some people still
06:48
trusted him
06:49
so they became a secondary speculation
06:51
market where people would
06:53
buy the ponzi coupons on a cheaper price
06:57
so the people in the queue would at
06:58
least get something back and the people
07:00
who bought it thought well this is
07:01
actually
07:02
real it's for real so i'm gonna get the
07:03
full amount back so it became
07:05
speculation on the speculation
07:07
that's clever um while we're on scammers
07:10
have you guys heard of
07:11
victor lustig i don't think we've ever
07:13
mentioned was he the guy who sold the
07:14
eiffel tower oh he's the guy who sold it
07:17
twice oh wow so he knew that paris was
07:21
broke he's
07:22
um he was living in paris and he thought
07:24
maybe the city would want to sell the
07:25
eiffel tower off because it's been up
07:27
for 30 years it's a bit rusty
07:28
and so he decided to
07:31
forge some government stationery and he
07:34
wrote to a load of scrap metal dealers
07:35
and invited them all to an expensive
07:36
suite at a hotel
07:38
and he said hello i am the deputy
07:40
minister of posts
07:41
and he said well we're looking for
07:43
buyers but um we've got to keep it quiet
07:45
from public opinion because there might
07:46
be you know controversy
07:47
and then one of the guys was tempted an
07:50
especially stupid dealer called andre
07:52
poisson
07:53
andrew fish and he said i'd really like
07:55
to buy the elf double scrap and he paid
07:57
a massive bribe to secure the ownership
08:00
and um unsurprisingly the effort was not
08:02
for sale but he got away with it
08:04
he was so successful victor lewis was he
08:06
never was he never busted
08:07
he was busted later on right for his
08:10
romanian box
08:13
it's um it was a box which would
08:16
duplicate any banknote that you put in
08:18
it
08:20
i know i know really obviously it
08:21
wouldn't okay well james nano i'm not
08:23
going to try and sell you one but dan
08:25
you're looking interested
08:28
he had he'd concealed genuine notes
08:29
within the device and then as long as
08:31
you only put in a selective bridge and i
08:33
had all these buttons and levers that
08:34
you press and pull and you know
08:35
then another banknote would come out and
08:37
they'd think oh my god this is amazing
08:38
was he inside making the noises
08:43
he just made a complicated looking box
08:45
basically and he sold the box for a lot
08:47
of money to various different people
08:49
and then once there was a sheriff in
08:51
texas who
08:52
realized that the scam called up with
08:55
him
08:55
in another state and then lustig said oh
08:58
you're just not using it right don't
08:59
worry it's okay completely persuaded him
09:01
it was fine and then said look let me
09:02
give you all this cash to compensate you
09:04
which was counterfeit money so you
09:06
managed to pay his way out of it yeah
09:08
wow he was very cool like you were
09:09
saying about how he
09:10
said oh i'm not really supposed to talk
09:12
about this and so people trusted him uh
09:14
ponzi did that as well
09:15
so when they said to him how are you
09:18
making this work because it doesn't seem
09:19
like at work all these stamps he said oh
09:21
yeah i've got a system
09:23
um which i don't want to tell you
09:24
because then the government will shut it
09:26
down
09:26
and then when everyone did the run on
09:28
him and started queuing up for money he
09:30
said
09:30
oh guys guess what i've come up with a
09:32
new system it's completely different
09:33
it's not to do with stamps at all
09:35
it's just really really awesome and so
09:37
this one will get you even more money so
09:38
why don't you give me more money
09:40
but he kept saying i can't tell anyone
09:42
what it is because if i tell you
09:43
then everyone will be doing it and
09:45
that's what kind of suckers people in
09:46
yes gotta be adaptable do you know how
09:48
you find out if someone is gullible
09:50
uh no oh well let me tell you about my
09:53
magic box
09:55
uh i don't know um is it like a
09:58
questionnaire or something it's exactly
10:00
that there's a question there but
10:01
basically it is just asking are you
10:02
gullible
10:03
it's amazing it's a 12 question question
10:05
some australian authors came up with it
10:06
and it measures persuadability and
10:08
insensitivity to untrustworthiness
10:11
and but the questions are really they're
10:12
all things like my friends think i'm
10:14
easily fooled do you disagree agree
10:17
strongly agree and basically if you
10:19
answer yes to those questions or that
10:21
you agree with them
10:22
you're gullible oh really which is weird
10:24
because i would have thought gullible
10:25
people wouldn't automatically know it
10:27
no because as soon as you know that
10:28
you're gullible surely you can start
10:29
correcting your gullibility
10:31
no apparently not no i'm gullible and i
10:33
can't stop it
10:36
if you guys decide to tell me some
10:37
[ __ ] on this show i will believe it
10:39
until
10:40
i see you the smile on your face hey
10:42
that what do you listen what do you
10:43
think about this
10:44
we are in the midst of a high frequency
10:46
blossoming of
10:47
interconnectedness that will give us
10:49
access to the quantum soup
10:51
itself what do you think of that
10:52
sentence i don't fully
10:54
what's the quantum soup is that like
10:56
primordial suit well maybe you're not
10:58
that gullible because apparently people
11:00
who
11:00
take that kind of [ __ ] aphorism and
11:03
think that it's quite deep
11:05
are people who rape more highly on this
11:06
gullibility scale
11:08
oh okay okay so i'm still gullible i'd
11:11
be like the leader of the gullibles i'd
11:12
be going whoa whoa whoa
11:14
whoa i know how that sounds guys but i
11:17
don't think that's right
11:19
i've not had that soup you know that do
11:22
you remember that old joke at school
11:23
which was
11:24
um the you know the world gulliver
11:26
wasn't in the dictionary yeah yeah did
11:27
you know that the oed
11:29
published a special edition where they
11:30
took it out oh
11:32
no no they didn't they didn't wait
11:38
think of the labour involved in printing
11:40
an entire new edition of the dictionary
11:42
just for one joke
11:43
it doesn't stack up i just want to point
11:45
out that dan
11:47
was the first one who spotted that and
11:49
so i think well done you're not as
11:51
global as we all think that's possible
11:52
actually apparently humans aren't too
11:54
gullible we all have this conception
11:56
that we're really gullible and we're
11:57
always falling for stuff
11:58
but studies seem to show that we're
11:59
actually too skeptical
12:01
and so um there's there's been a bunch
12:03
of things that so fake news is often
12:05
used as an example of how we're too
12:07
gullible we believe this stuff
12:08
we change our voting habits but all the
12:11
studies that have really been done on
12:12
fake news over the last few years
12:14
have shown that it didn't impact
12:16
elections at all because
12:18
people only ever consumed the sort of
12:19
fake news that already accorded with
12:21
what they believed so it wasn't like
12:23
they were reading stuff and going
12:24
oh my god hillary clinton really is a
12:26
lizard it was like
12:28
they already thought she was probably a
12:29
lizard and so
12:31
it's just confirmed it um but actually
12:33
we're too
12:34
skeptical so there's a very famous
12:36
psychologist called julian
12:37
rotter who died quite recently but
12:40
he said that the more trustful you are
12:43
the more successful you are in life and
12:44
the better you are at determining if
12:46
someone is trustworthy
12:48
or if something's worth supporting
12:49
because you've practiced it so people
12:51
who are more trusting generally they
12:52
practice it through life
12:54
and then you learn who to trust and who
12:56
not to trust whereas the cynics who just
12:58
think oh god everyone's a liar
12:59
everyone's trying to jute me
13:01
they actually have no idea and they lose
13:03
out because of that so anna are you
13:05
saying that me and nandy are really
13:06
great because we fell for your
13:07
dictionary prank
13:08
sounds like it really smart and let me
13:11
talk to you afterwards about a scheme
13:13
i've got
13:13
up and running but dan is the cynic and
13:16
he's just
13:17
like living in his barrel yeah
13:24
it always comes back to diogenes doesn't
13:26
it um
13:27
there was a dictionary scam back in the
13:30
day where
13:32
huxters would go around uh pubs getting
13:34
into
13:35
uh getting money off people with a
13:36
dictionary based bet okay so the idea is
13:39
three of you go into the pub you all
13:40
pretend you don't know each other you
13:41
just
13:42
you know sit at different places it's
13:43
quite easy yeah
13:46
three of us i've gone home um and then
13:49
one of one of you guys will start
13:51
repeatedly
13:52
using the word unfortunate okay let's
13:54
say dan
13:55
keep saying i was really unfortunate
13:57
about this and then james or anna will
13:59
lean over and say
14:00
excuse me i think it's unfortunate bingo
14:04
exactly
14:04
and then dan will say uh it's pretty
14:06
unfortunate that you're such an idiot
14:08
or whatever and you get into this one
14:09
big argument i can only apologize james
14:12
i must have
14:12
been quite drunk when i said that
14:16
you get this huge route and obviously
14:18
you get everyone else involved and you
14:19
start putting money on it
14:21
and then dan pulls out his dictionary
14:23
which does have the word unfortunate in
14:25
it because it's an old version of the
14:27
word
14:27
and then you get the money wait a minute
14:29
where does that come into this story
14:30
shall we she's the one with the
14:31
dictionary
14:33
i've been at the bar this whole time i
14:34
got really bored very early on in this
14:36
chat
14:37
and i want to talk to some people at the
14:38
bar it must be the case that she happens
14:40
to be a dictionary salesman who has a
14:42
dick story
14:50
unless the third person is just for
14:51
audience purposes to cheer people on
14:53
it's sort of to get more people involved
14:55
in the bet hey come and look at the
14:56
argument these guys are having
15:01
that's very clever and did it and is
15:03
there a whole history of that like was
15:04
that a
15:05
gang that went round the dictionary gang
15:07
do we yeah is this a one-off this is a
15:09
one-off
15:09
incident no i think some people have
15:12
used it repeatedly but i don't think
15:14
it was a massive because if it's a the
15:16
trend only lasts until everyone has
15:17
heard of it because there are hundreds
15:19
of gangs going around the pubs
15:21
doing the unfortunate play
15:24
oh man that's it during gang wars i
15:26
wouldn't want to be in that gang
15:28
have you not watched gags of london
15:30
recently no there's one episode where
15:32
the dictionary gun comes along
15:36
it's the least violent of all the
15:38
episodes i have to say hey you could get
15:40
some pretty big dictionaries you could
15:41
do some serious damage with the full
15:43
addition of the oed
15:44
yeah kill someone yeah sticks and stones
15:47
maybe
15:48
yeah um i found um
15:52
a gullible person who fell for
15:55
a scam have you guys heard of this guy
15:57
in new york who a few years ago sued a
15:59
psychic for fraud
16:00
no it's i mean it is sad but in 2015 he
16:04
sued this psychic because over the years
16:06
he'd given her
16:06
over seven hundred thousand dollars
16:09
because he wanted her
16:10
to make the woman that he fancied fall
16:14
in love with him
16:15
it's an old classic shakespearean tale
16:16
you should have just given me 700 000 to
16:18
the girl
16:23
actually james women can't be bought i
16:25
agree but it's worth a try rather than
16:27
giving it to a sidekick
16:29
that should have been his first at least
16:31
the person you like has got a lot of
16:32
dash
16:33
yeah he was actually he's walking down
16:34
the streets of new york thinking this is
16:35
really sad i've told this woman i really
16:37
love her and she said she has no
16:38
interest in me whatsoever and he passed
16:39
a sign
16:40
saying psychic with a flashing arrow and
16:42
so you already know he's a bit gullible
16:43
he walked in
16:44
and this psychic just managed to
16:46
convince him for instance to fork out um
16:48
forty thousand dollars so she could do
16:50
him a fake funeral
16:52
to convince the bad spirits that he had
16:54
died so that they stopped plaguing him
16:56
and let someone fall in love with him
16:58
why invite the woman he fancied to the
16:59
fake funeral and see if she was sad that
17:01
he died and then he burst out of the
17:03
coffin
17:04
and then that is the woman i don't think
17:06
i've got another
17:07
that is never gonna work is it in a
17:09
romance that's how my wife and i got
17:10
together
17:11
true story yeah
17:14
i think you might risk the woman
17:16
thinking you're a weirdo which this but
17:17
i definitely
17:18
wasn't to be clear um he also paid 80
17:21
000
17:21
for an 80 mile long bridge made of gold
17:24
to lure the spirits into the other
17:26
realms
17:27
and then that sounds like quite a good
17:29
deal for a bridge made of gold it's an
17:31
incredible bargain
17:32
that's so cheap it is i think the thing
17:35
is the bridge made of gold didn't really
17:36
exist in this realm so you can never get
17:38
the evidence that it has been built oh
17:40
different bridge yeah much different
17:42
bridge
17:44
much less did the guy did he not see the
17:48
psychic
17:49
increasingly turning up in fur coats in
17:52
maseratis and all of this stuff and
17:54
she's like i bought them in the other
17:55
realm it's much cheaper over there
18:00
eventually after you [ __ ] up another
18:01
90 grand for a longer bridge because the
18:03
spirits weren't going over this one
18:05
um halfway through this the woman he was
18:07
in love with very sadly died
18:10
and the psychic thought quickly on her
18:12
feet and said uh well
18:14
don't worry we'll just have to pay a bit
18:15
extra for my reincarnation machine to be
18:17
built
18:18
and so no this is a terrible story
18:22
it is awful and it was only when she
18:24
said she built this reincarnation
18:26
machine and
18:26
michelle this woman you're in love with
18:28
is now inside this new woman you've just
18:30
met
18:31
and he said i met the new woman and i
18:33
thought she doesn't seem like michelle
18:35
at all and that was when i started to
18:37
think that psychic wasn't who she was
18:39
purporting to be
18:40
god how did this guy have access to
18:42
seven hundred thousand dollars in the
18:43
first that man
18:44
is now the president of the united
18:46
states
18:50
okay it is time for fact number two and
18:53
that is anna
18:54
my fact this week is that in 2011 former
18:57
paralympian josh
18:58
sundquist who's missing his left leg
19:01
announced that he'd found
19:02
his soulmate i.e someone missing a right
19:06
leg
19:07
with whom you can split pairs of shoes
19:10
i don't know how i sort of came across
19:12
this but i was watching his youtube
19:13
channel so
19:14
uh josh is a he was a paralympian skier
19:17
and he's now an author and a comedian a
19:18
public speaker
19:20
and he sort of posted a video saying
19:22
he's got these piles of shoes he's been
19:24
saving up for years because obviously
19:25
you can't buy one shoe but he only needs
19:28
one so
19:29
he's got loads of right shoes and he'd
19:30
been looking for someone who could wear
19:32
them
19:32
and then he found living in the same
19:33
city as him a chap called steven
19:36
missing her right leg same shoe size and
19:39
crucially
19:40
same tasting shoes so they had a lovely
19:43
meet-up where they did some swapsies
19:45
that's great that's great it's a
19:47
beautiful story although it was quite i
19:48
mean i think he might have been conned
19:50
to be fair because
19:51
he'd obviously been saving up his right
19:53
shoes over the years
19:54
josh and so he came with this giant
19:57
mountain whereas stephen
19:58
wasn't expecting the soulmate reunion so
20:00
he'd presumably chucked away all his
20:02
left shoes
20:03
so he only gave joshua one shoe
20:06
so it was sort of a one shoe in exchange
20:08
for about 50 shoes
20:09
there are charities out there where you
20:11
can so if you have lost a leg
20:13
or lost a foot but also if you have a
20:16
pair of
20:16
feet that are different sizes like we
20:18
all do but some people much bigger than
20:20
others
20:21
um there are some places where you can
20:23
you can match up with people
20:25
with um the opposite size feature yeah
20:28
in america there's something called the
20:30
national odd shoe
20:31
exchange which is nose n-o-s-e
20:34
and they put people together with
20:36
mismatched feet and in the uk there's
20:38
something called joe's odd shoes
20:40
um which is on facebook where all you
20:42
have to do is pay postage and packaging
20:44
and they'll send you a single shoe very
20:47
that's so cool
20:48
it's a bit weird isn't it usually when
20:49
you do those acronyms it usually works
20:51
out as something like a foot
20:53
it's a bit odd to go for nose
20:56
you're absolutely right they should well
20:59
maybe they had this conversation
21:01
footwear odd one out trading and it's
21:04
foot
21:05
except foot is also the beginning of
21:06
footwear so it's a cheat
21:08
apart from odd one out has got three o's
21:11
in a row
21:16
um so that's that's josh great guy but i
21:19
was i'm sort of looking into
21:20
prosthetics and there's some really cool
21:23
prosthetics out there that you can get
21:25
so have you guys heard of this woman
21:27
called sophie de oliveira berata
21:30
no um she's got this thing called the
21:32
alternative limb project and she's
21:34
basically an artist
21:35
it's in north london and she makes these
21:37
bespoke limbs and
21:38
she was she was inspired to do it she
21:40
had this client who was a little girl
21:41
who had one leg
21:43
and every year she'd come for an
21:44
upgraded leg because she was growing
21:46
and she started asking for she asked at
21:48
first for peppa pigs at the top of her
21:50
leg pictures of peppa pig eating ice
21:52
cream
21:53
and so sophie was like yeah sure
21:54
whatever and then she came back the next
21:56
year and asked for
21:57
a christmas scene at the top which i
21:59
think is very short-term this and she's
22:01
going to regret that in february but
22:02
whatever
22:03
um and this one was sophie thought this
22:06
is great what a good idea and so she was
22:07
inspired by inspector gadget because you
22:09
know he makes
22:10
yeah but he makes gadgets yeah um
22:13
legs doesn't he sometimes exactly
22:16
uh so she makes long arms and legs and
22:19
special arms and legs
22:20
and so for one guy she made a hyper
22:22
realistic foot that looked really like
22:24
his own foot and she got hairs off the
22:26
back of his neck
22:27
and put them on the toes not many people
22:29
in history have ever looked at their
22:31
toes and gone that isn't hairy enough
22:33
can we put more hairs on that place
22:37
so the the i guess one of the next
22:39
frontiers in prosthetic limb development
22:41
is is how to incorporate uh feeling and
22:44
how to incorporate automatic responses
22:46
so there's one recent development uh
22:48
researchers at newcastle university came
22:50
up with this
22:51
it's got an ai camera inside it it's a
22:54
hand or an arm fitting and
22:57
it can recognize hundreds of objects
22:59
using
23:00
the camera and when you move to grab
23:02
something with your prosthetic arm
23:04
it automatically moves into the right
23:06
position to grasp it so if you're
23:08
reaching for a pair of tweezers it'll
23:09
move into a pinch position
23:10
or if you're reaching for a volleyball
23:12
it'll move into a sort of spread hand
23:14
position so you can pick it up like that
23:15
it sounds
23:15
unbelievable and it could be trained to
23:18
you know develop more and more
23:19
positions can you can you sort of code
23:21
it so that if it's reaching for
23:22
your tenth toffee crisp of the night it
23:25
will refuse to clap down on it or
23:27
something
23:28
and we don't have time for your toffee
23:30
chris yeah problem maybe
23:31
if you hadn't sent that letter to so
23:33
many people you wouldn't have so many to
23:34
get through
23:38
a toffee christmas who no one mentions
23:41
toffee crisps they're the best
23:42
chocolates i agree they're the best are
23:44
they
23:45
i'm not sure i've ever had one what oh
23:47
my god that's like me not watching e.t
23:50
jesus christ we we definitely don't have
23:53
time for the fact that you've never
23:54
eaten tomatoes
23:54
amazing they are one of the one of the
23:57
very best
23:58
i reckon even richard osman would agree
24:00
with that
24:01
i was reading up about aaron ralston do
24:03
you guys remember aaron ralston
24:04
127 hours oh yeah i remember that oh
24:07
yeah
24:08
yeah so he was the um the mountaineer
24:10
slash adventurer who
24:12
fell down a little uh gap between some
24:14
boulders boulders
24:16
boulder collapsed on his arm and he had
24:18
to cut himself free
24:19
and so he now uh when you see pictures
24:21
of him if he goes mountaineering he has
24:23
um a prosthetic that has a little pick
24:25
on the end
24:26
wow they went back and they actually
24:28
recovered his arm
24:29
so it was stuck under this boulder they
24:31
managed to winch it out
24:32
uh winch the boulder up and get his arm
24:34
back and they cremated it there on the
24:36
spot and he
24:37
scattered the ashes um symbolically all
24:39
over the area
24:40
so that's really nice but the little
24:42
fact that i really like that i've
24:43
discovered about him
24:44
is his current place of residence he
24:46
lives in a place called boulder colorado
24:48
no way that's amazing
24:51
uh i have one last thing on prosthetics
24:53
i was i was amazed to learn about
24:55
there's a big comedian back in the early
24:57
days of american comedy
24:58
during the silent era called harold
25:00
lloyd and harold lloyd
25:02
was at the time more famous than buster
25:05
keaton and charlie chaplin he was he was
25:07
the one who was pulling in most money at
25:08
the box office
25:09
and what i didn't know is that he lost
25:12
two of his fingers he lost his thumb and
25:14
his index finger
25:15
um when he was doing publicity for a
25:17
film of his called haunted spooks
25:19
he stood in the photo with a prop bomb
25:22
in his hand
25:23
which turned out to be a real bomb no
25:26
yeah so the fuselage wait a minute
25:28
what kind of what kind of prop
25:29
department that has two boxes
25:31
one with prop bumps and one with real
25:33
bumps and accidentally takes out the
25:34
wrong one
25:35
how do you how do you end up in that
25:37
situation now what we've done is we've
25:39
labeled the prop bombs with the p and
25:41
we've labelled the
25:43
real bombs with a lowercase b don't
25:46
put them upside down next to each other
25:51
was that someone simultaneously in the
25:53
middle of a battle somewhere
25:54
throwing the prop what's going on
25:58
[Laughter]
26:00
yeah so it it went down his hand yeah it
26:03
took off his thumb it took off his index
26:05
finger it temporarily blinded him he
26:06
took eight months to recover
26:08
and then they built a glove for him
26:09
which had the thumb and the finger
26:12
and um the most famous surviving
26:15
sequence or even image that we'll know
26:18
of harold lloyd is him hanging off a
26:19
clock
26:21
face he did that with a prosthetic thumb
26:24
and
26:24
and finger well it was after that that's
26:27
true that's probably saying i've
26:28
never heard that yeah
26:33
okay it is time for fact number three
26:35
and that is
26:36
andy my fact is that you can now
26:38
diagnose a urinary tract infection
26:40
using a fidget spinner
26:44
finally i can get all my old fidget
26:46
spinners out well yeah
26:47
that is worth saying customized right
26:49
customize fidget spinner don't go
26:51
pissing on your children's
26:52
spinners oh what what do you mean
26:55
children
26:57
um as well weren't they don't piss on
27:00
any fidget spinners whether they're the
27:01
children's edition or the special adult
27:03
fidget spinners
27:04
that james owns the erotic fidget
27:07
spinners
27:10
i saw sorry to interrupt um when you
27:12
haven't even told us a fact yet
27:14
but um because i didn't write this down
27:16
because i didn't think it would come up
27:17
but did you see that there was a
27:19
you know um like are they called pasties
27:21
or pasties that um
27:22
erotic dancers put on their nipples and
27:25
spin their pasties
27:26
yeah cornish pasties it happens mostly
27:30
in cornwall
27:31
yeah the strippers do this but they made
27:33
one
27:34
uh with fidget spinners didn't they
27:35
which like fidget spinned around when
27:37
they twirled their breasts
27:39
of course they did gosh so you can get
27:42
adult fidget spinners is what you're
27:44
saying yeah they're not the ones i have
27:45
though
27:46
uh andy what is the how does this work
27:50
well this is a new scientific
27:52
development basically
27:54
it's it's a it's a pain uh diagnosing
27:56
urinary tract infections it can take
27:59
sometimes days to get the results back
28:01
and scientists are always looking for
28:02
ways
28:03
to improve the process so this is
28:06
a way of detecting pathogens in
28:08
someone's urine which might reveal if
28:09
they've got an infection
28:10
um so and what you need is detectors
28:13
that are cheap and simple and accurate
28:15
and that's what this new one is they
28:16
custom made this team
28:18
a fidget spinner um where you you pee in
28:22
the spinner
28:24
effectively okay peter jug
28:27
yeah unless your aim is phenomenal you
28:29
pee in a jug uh
28:31
and then the jug is a bit of it's poured
28:33
into the fidget spinner
28:34
and it it spins uh it spins around
28:37
obviously
28:38
and the the centrifugal force pushes
28:41
the urine sample outwards and it pushes
28:43
it through a little internal membrane
28:45
inside the spinner
28:46
and the membrane is is fine enough to
28:50
stop
28:50
bacteria which can tell you whether
28:52
you've got one of these infections
28:54
and then all you need to do is add a
28:55
little bit of a dye which turns the
28:56
bacteria orange you look at the membrane
28:58
a little bit later
28:59
if there's orange on the membrane you
29:01
have these bacteria and you know that
29:02
you've got the infection
29:03
i would have that they'd have dye which
29:04
is a color that's less similar to the
29:07
color of urine
29:08
yeah how orange is people's urine these
29:11
days
29:12
but it is purple james i know you're a
29:14
sunny d fanatic
29:16
but look it's for adults as well as
29:19
children
29:22
um no but do you know what i mean yeah
29:23
that would make sense i do i
29:25
i imagine that other other dyes are also
29:27
available but the
29:28
the good news is that it cuts the test
29:31
times to under an hour and it does also
29:33
mean that people don't get diagnosed
29:35
antibiotics unnecessarily
29:37
maybe in the interim while they're
29:38
waiting for the results so doctors might
29:40
say oh we'll just take some of these
29:41
anyway
29:42
which is a bad thing because it leads to
29:43
antibiotic resistance so yeah this is a
29:45
good
29:46
finally we have found a use for the
29:47
fidget spinner three years later
29:50
is it commercially available can we all
29:51
buy one no no
29:53
no you can't it's just been invented and
29:55
also dan i think you'd probably want a
29:57
medical professional to do your uh
29:59
diagnosis
30:00
of utis rather than just missing on your
30:02
own fidget spinner
30:04
oh yeah i just isn't the idea that you
30:06
could get it like a pregnancy test you
30:08
know and you'd be able to buy one and
30:09
then piss on it and then
30:10
maybe you could play with it yeah i
30:13
guess you could
30:14
i guess so yeah or just they're issued
30:15
to doctors who know how to
30:17
administer the tests but either way i
30:19
think everyone should be their own
30:21
doctor oh god it sounds really simple
30:24
give it a spin pull the dye in
30:26
what am i missing wow you've already got
30:28
the slogan yeah
30:29
one thing that they think it might work
30:31
for in the future is also viral
30:32
infections
30:33
so hopefully this technology in the
30:35
future you'll be able to use
30:37
with saliva instead of urine and you'll
30:39
be able to detect viruses if you get
30:41
your mesh fine enough
30:43
um your membrane fine enough then it
30:44
will be able to find viruses so
30:47
it might be that if there's a viral
30:48
infection going around then you'll be
30:50
able to use something like this to tell
30:52
whether you have it that's that's great
30:54
because fidget spinners have had a bad
30:56
rep in a lot of corners over the years
30:57
haven't they yes they've been
30:59
sort of banned quite a lot of places
31:02
quite a lot of schools in america went
31:03
through a phase of banning them for
31:04
being really distracting for kids
31:06
there were lots of warnings that some of
31:08
them were dangerous do you remember
31:09
there were various fidget spinners came
31:11
out that were a bit like um
31:13
ninja stars uh that had sort of pointed
31:16
ends really
31:16
and there was actually this woman who
31:19
was employed to
31:20
test them a test a blades expert
31:23
apparently called sarah haynesworth
31:25
who bbc watchdog made her test these
31:27
things to see if they could penetrate
31:29
skin or eyeballs and her job and only
31:32
expert should attempt this
31:33
was to get a fidget spinner and stab a
31:35
tomato with it which apparently
31:36
represents an eyeball
31:38
and then stab some pork skin with it
31:39
that represents human skin
31:41
so interesting because i have some
31:43
fidget spinners in my house
31:44
and i've also been trained how to throw
31:46
ninja stars
31:48
so i could actually try and i have some
31:49
tomatoes you're qualified
31:51
do you say that anyone can do this anna
31:53
uh well again i think everyone should be
31:54
their own blades tester as well as their
31:56
own doctor so yes
31:57
you should start stabbing tomatoes
31:59
awesome wow the trick is in the flick of
32:01
the wrist at the end just in case you
32:03
hold it like
32:04
between your thumb and your first finger
32:06
and then you throw it and then you flick
32:08
your wrist at the last second
32:09
and then it helps it to spin and hence
32:11
it stick into things that's like
32:12
throwing a knife that's why harold lloyd
32:15
could never have become a ninja
32:16
after his terrible publicity accident
32:18
yes
32:19
he did have two hands good point
32:23
that's why harold lloyd would have had
32:24
to be ambidextrous if he was to realize
32:26
his ambition of becoming a ninja
32:29
it's ironic that the one famous thing
32:31
about him is he's on a clock which does
32:33
have two hands
32:34
wow that is such a slap in the face
32:36
isn't it
32:38
um we we wrote about fidget spinners at
32:40
the height of their um
32:42
of their craze back in 2017 in our first
32:45
book of the year and james you found out
32:46
this thing which is that of all the top
32:48
25 toys on amazon.com uk
32:51
all of them were fidget spinners yeah
32:54
and
32:54
i i went to check up amazon today just
32:57
to see
32:57
where they sit uh in the top 100 and not
33:00
a single fidget spinner has
33:02
stayed in the top 100. really but yeah
33:05
um and the top uh
33:06
toy at the moment is a black balloon
33:08
that's in the shape of a zero i think
33:10
you can get it multi-colored but that's
33:12
the image that you're met with
33:13
that's quite a nihilist thing to give to
33:15
a child really is
33:16
yeah zero happy birthday
33:20
jesus but it did last longer than
33:22
everyone thought
33:23
so that was 2017 where it was at its
33:25
peak but in 2019 fidget spinners still
33:28
accounted for a fifth of
33:29
all toy sales what wow really it's
33:32
amazing i was looking at um other toys
33:34
that can be used for medical uses
33:37
and i found the paper called a novel
33:39
method for the removal of
33:41
ear ceremony so that's ear wax can you
33:44
think of what time might be used to
33:45
remove eel
33:46
okay yes yes yes a yo-yo but a very
33:49
small yoyo that you just sort of dip
33:51
in the air it's a good first
33:54
guess um but okay right now um
33:58
so something something absorbent or
34:00
something with a little scraping edge
34:02
yeah you need a scraping like a lego
34:03
man's hand
34:04
you know you could go in with that
34:06
pincer grip it's got a pincer grip on it
34:08
doesn't it that's good yeah
34:09
oh silly putty just put in so much silly
34:12
putty that the earwax is forced out
34:14
so have you guys never had any issues
34:16
with earwax i think you haven't because
34:18
you don't seem to know what they
34:19
actually use in real life
34:22
you suck it out i'm trying to think of
34:23
something that you suck
34:25
that's a toy a straw one of those really
34:27
fun straws
34:28
they don't suck it out ear doctors all
34:31
have massive
34:32
mouths and they just put their entire
34:34
mouth around your ear
34:35
and it's a head rehoover and they just
34:37
stick it to your head
34:38
and they have to stop before the brain
34:40
comes out um i don't know what it's
34:41
going to be it's going to be a it's
34:42
going to be a fake doctor's syringe
34:44
maybe exactly they syringe it out
34:47
normally
34:48
yeah and what it is is a super soaker
34:51
max d5000
34:52
wow and this is a guy who um he was
34:56
living on an island and the child had
34:58
real problems with earwax
34:59
and he couldn't get to the doctors to
35:02
get a syringe quickly enough
35:04
so he said the owner of a super soaker
35:07
max d5000 was sought out
35:09
after hearing an explanation of its
35:10
intended application he granted
35:12
permission for its use
35:14
verbal consent was obtained from the
35:16
patient
35:17
he then changed into swimming shots
35:19
located himself on an ideal location on
35:21
the deck and held a tupperware container
35:24
product number one six one one slash one
35:26
six to the side of his neck
35:29
the super soaker max d5000 was filled
35:31
with body temperature water and then
35:33
mildly pressurized using the blue hand
35:35
pump
35:36
the trigger was depressed releasing a
35:37
gentle narrow jet of water
35:39
which was aimed along the posterior wall
35:41
of the ear canal
35:42
and then after 15 seconds bits of work
35:44
started coming out and it worked
35:45
i might do that that's great i think
35:48
don't do that
35:49
this was a medically trained
35:50
professional and
35:52
this is a thing that happened and it
35:53
isn't a medical paper but i think if you
35:55
do have earwax problems maybe you should
35:58
consult
35:59
a professional you guys are so boring
36:01
don't piss in my fidget spinners don't
36:03
throw super suckers in my head
36:06
um do you know what the best-selling
36:08
doll of 1976 was you'll be surprised
36:10
1976.
36:12
1976 was it a richard nixon doll
36:16
that was very i was about to say very
36:19
close
36:19
it's not very close was it a um
36:22
when was star wars 77 so maybe it wasn't
36:25
yeah it wasn't
36:26
skywalker oh i know oh oh the exorcist
36:29
did not come out in 70
36:31
oh nice okay well you're all kind of
36:33
getting closer it is it is a pop culture
36:35
thing
36:35
it was cher ah was it really yeah
36:39
there were sunny and share dolls and um
36:41
the share one was very customizable had
36:43
different outfits and things and it was
36:45
hugely popular really best-selling doll
36:47
of the entire year was sure
36:49
that makes sense yeah i am surprised
36:53
andy i just don't have that
36:54
i don't have any references that i can
36:56
make jokes about cher no
36:57
i'm just trying to be trying to think of
36:59
a single share song shoot shoot song is
37:01
the only one i could think of
37:02
the famous one with sonny bono what was
37:04
that the duet i got you babe
37:06
i got you babe yeah yeah i was just
37:08
imagining being a parent and having two
37:10
kids and i earned one share doll and
37:12
convincing them it was called cher
37:13
because they had to share it
37:15
i'm sorry i switched off and went there
37:22
okay it's time for our final fact of the
37:24
show and that
37:25
is james okay my fact this week
37:28
is that al capone ran a soup kitchen
37:31
during the great depression
37:33
he served beef on thanksgiving in 1930
37:36
because there had just been a theft of 1
37:38
000 turkeys
37:39
nearby and he didn't want the
37:41
authorities to think it was him
37:42
[Laughter]
37:45
makes sense yeah and he had to do
37:48
something with the 50 cows eat nick
37:49
didn't he
37:52
that's probably more like it um so yeah
37:55
um
37:56
al capone chicago gangster public enemy
37:58
number one
37:59
um bad guy killed lots of his enemies
38:03
especially in the saint valentine's day
38:05
massacre in 1929
38:07
but like a lot of these people who were
38:09
bad guys he had this kind of robin hood
38:12
reputation where he would give to
38:14
charity in the local area
38:16
and the idea i think sometimes is that
38:18
he's less likely to get ratted out if
38:20
people like him
38:21
although it has to be said that this
38:22
soup kitchen although it definitely
38:24
existed
38:24
he might have not paid any money for it
38:26
because he could have like
38:28
leaned on some local businesses to
38:30
donate their um
38:32
beef and whatever uh because obviously
38:35
that extortion was a lot of his
38:37
a lot of his shtick so he might have
38:39
said to you guys
38:41
you better give me some stuff for my
38:42
charity or else
38:44
so that's the negative portrayal of al
38:46
capone but
38:47
on the other hand it was a soup kitchen
38:49
it was a soup kitchen yeah and
38:51
they gave breakfast lunch and dinner to
38:53
um over 2000 people in chicago every
38:55
single day
38:56
uh and the newspapers kind of were
39:00
not sure about it because on one hand
39:01
they thought obviously this is a good
39:03
thing that people are being fed
39:04
but on the bad hand they could see him
39:06
becoming like the mayor of chicago if
39:08
people liked him too much
39:10
and they thought if a gangster becomes
39:11
the mayor of our city then we could be
39:13
in real trouble
39:14
he was sort of de facto mayor for quite
39:16
a while wasn't he in that he ran the
39:18
city
39:18
well yeah he didn't really need to
39:20
become there because he had um
39:22
a guy called william h thompson who is
39:24
known as big
39:25
bill and basically al capone funded him
39:27
and made sure that he stayed in place
39:30
and big bill was um sometimes known as
39:32
kaiser bill because he was very
39:34
pro-german during world war one
39:36
and in the 1920s he threatened to punch
39:38
the british king
39:40
in the snoot
39:43
it's not the worst war in which to be
39:45
pro-german to be fair to him
39:47
no there have been worse ones since yeah
39:49
i just i find our capone so
39:52
amazing how it's like he conforms to all
39:55
the gangster cliches and the fact that
39:56
he could just
39:57
commit multiple murders and everyone
40:00
know
40:00
and no one be able to do anything about
40:02
it i mean he he shot
40:03
people in you know open public that was
40:06
one of his rivals he just went down into
40:08
a bar and shot him in the head
40:10
and everyone saw everyone knew he'd done
40:13
it
40:13
but no one's going to say anything they
40:15
were all distracted by an argument about
40:16
a dictionary going on in the other car
40:20
newspapers reported it as an unfortunate
40:22
occurrence
40:24
um anna i i wonder though if you've got
40:27
that right you're probably right but i
40:28
wonder if you've got that wrong in when
40:29
you say
40:29
he conformed to the cliches i wonder if
40:31
al capone invented the cliches
40:34
yeah you're right all the movies born
40:36
off the back of his life and
40:37
of all the gangsters of that time or
40:39
what inform us about the mafia
40:41
um so he kind of invented cliche yeah i
40:44
didn't know that he was
40:45
called scarface i mean i'm sure anyone
40:47
who you know has
40:48
read a bit about it didn't know that but
40:50
yeah i didn't know that he had the big
40:51
scars and the first film called scarface
40:53
was
40:53
about him no i didn't know that either
40:55
he hated them also yeah
40:57
yes he did yeah and he got he got the
40:59
scars on his face from insulting a lady
41:01
the the brother of a lady was uh
41:03
taken aback and slashed his face um but
41:05
he used to claim that he got it
41:07
as a result of some service time in the
41:09
army uh because he didn't want to just
41:11
admit that he was
41:12
oh you know lost a battle um in the
41:15
fight
41:15
where he got scarred um al capone his
41:18
brother james capone kind of got in
41:21
involved in it and pushed the guy who
41:23
who scarred him through a
41:24
glass window because obviously he just
41:27
cut his brother
41:29
and he was so worried that this guy was
41:31
going to come back and get him
41:32
that he fled the city and joined the
41:34
circus
41:35
and then he served in world war one and
41:38
then after the war he changed his name
41:40
after his favorite cowboy and became a
41:43
prohibition agent
41:45
and basically spent his whole time
41:47
stopping people from moving
41:48
alcohol around which is where al capone
41:50
got most of his money
41:51
but he didn't realize that that had
41:53
happened because at that time el capone
41:54
wasn't really famous for that kind of
41:56
thing
41:57
and so he only later found out that his
41:59
brother who he'd left
42:01
after that fight when he was 16 years
42:02
old had become the greatest mobster and
42:05
he had become one of the big
42:06
prohibition agents there needs to be a
42:08
film that imagines the meeting between
42:11
them where he knows he's arresting this
42:12
huge
42:13
prohibition breaker and suddenly they
42:16
meet face to face
42:18
he was called vincenzo capone wasn't he
42:20
this guy
42:21
originally and then he uh he became
42:23
richard hart
42:24
but there were so many capones there
42:25
were i think uh eight or nine capone
42:28
siblings in all
42:29
and the last member of the family alive
42:30
or she was live in 2012 and no she is
42:33
still alive because she's on twitter
42:34
uh is deirdre capone wow the most
42:37
harmless name
42:38
deirdre i know she defends
42:41
al capone's reputation which i think is
42:43
an uphill battle um she's written a book
42:45
saying
42:46
he was a mobster not a monster um and
42:49
she's written a book all about him which
42:50
includes recipes like meatballs ala
42:52
capone
42:53
wow but and these days she's just
42:55
retweeting
42:56
you know like dogs and meditation
42:59
she has a twitter account it's so weird
43:01
that a capone family member should be
43:03
judged by your
43:04
by your grandparents should you really
43:06
oh or your twitter account i'd just like
43:08
to make very clear
43:10
he was quite a family man though again
43:13
as the cliches then played out
43:15
uh he had that typical i've got a wife
43:17
who theoretically doesn't know
43:19
anything that's going on but maybe she
43:20
knows everything he was he really loved
43:23
his son
43:24
so his son had hearing damage probably
43:27
because it was congenital syphilis
43:28
contracted from al
43:29
capone which he famously had um and he
43:32
spent a hundred thousand dollars
43:33
fixing his son's hearing in 1925 when he
43:35
didn't he didn't even really have
43:37
a huge amount of space he was a family
43:39
guy but his syphilis was a much bigger
43:40
part of his life than his
43:42
gang time wasn't it i ca can we say that
43:45
for sure what
43:47
time wise to old time okay am i sorry
43:50
it was a longer part of his life you're
43:52
right okay so biographers aren't always
43:55
complaining why do they always focus on
43:56
the gangster years it's more about
43:58
his rancid penis i think of myself as a
44:02
syphilis patient
44:03
who happens to be in the body
44:08
well i think by the end he basically
44:10
couldn't think of himself as anything
44:11
he was it was so awful i didn't sort of
44:14
realize the symptoms of untreated
44:16
syphilis but by the time he went to
44:18
prison in 1930
44:20
um he was starting to really suffer from
44:22
it there's a theory that one of the
44:23
reasons he was moved from atlanta prison
44:25
to alcatraz where he was famously sent
44:27
is actually that he was being bullied in
44:29
the atlanta prison because he was very
44:31
weak
44:31
and he was starting to lose his
44:33
faculties because of their syphilis and
44:35
his cellmate had to protect him
44:37
because you know everyone else was
44:38
bullying him and so he was accused of
44:39
special treatment because this summer
44:40
was protecting him
44:41
so he was shifted but yeah by by the
44:44
time he got to alcatraz
44:46
he was having problems he was one of the
44:47
first people ever to be treated with
44:48
penicillin in 1942
44:50
for it yeah have you heard of his lawyer
44:53
um or one of his lawyers i'm sure he
44:55
doesn't know what time if it's charlie
44:57
chaplin yes
45:00
he was called hiram mendo no no okay
45:04
um so he defended him in a trial i think
45:06
in 1930 which was when they first nabbed
45:09
him
45:09
you know they eventually got him for tax
45:10
evasion but they first got him for uh
45:13
unlicensed ownership of a gun or
45:14
something um anyway this is the earlier
45:17
trial that was in about 1930
45:19
guess when hiro mendo retired okay so he
45:22
must have been
45:23
at least 30 then and he retired when
45:26
he's 65 so he retired in 1965.
45:30
he retired in 1994
45:34
yes he he died in 2001 aged 107
45:39
but he kept practicing law until he was
45:41
a hundred years old oh my god
45:44
i know is he donald trump's lawyer he
45:46
just feels like the kind of guy who
45:47
definitely must have been donald trump's
45:49
lawyer at some point
45:51
he wasn't he was just amazing his
45:52
working life he started working when he
45:54
was six
45:55
at the age in 1900 and he kept working
45:57
for 94 years
45:59
he wasn't working as a lawyer when he
46:00
was sick
46:02
[Laughter]
46:04
who would you rather have the
46:05
six-year-old liar rather 100 year old
46:10
it was he had another lawyer who was
46:11
called edward o'hare who
46:13
testified against him in court not a
46:15
good lawyer
46:16
oh wow that's not the kind of law you
46:18
want and um he's slightly a notable
46:20
character not just for his connection to
46:22
capone but his son
46:23
is called edward butch o'hare jr off
46:26
which
46:27
uh o'hare airport in chicago is named
46:29
after he was a
46:31
yeah he was a medal of honor uh fighter
46:34
pilot who single-handedly shot down
46:36
eight japanese bombers um so he was a
46:38
hero for chicago
46:40
why did his lawyer testify against him
46:42
though that does seem like a bit of a
46:43
rookie mistake
46:43
i'm sure he wasn't representing him
46:45
anymore at that point
46:47
oh i call to the stand me
46:55
al capone the only time he got shot um
46:57
was when he shot himself
46:59
wasn't it he shot himself by accident
47:02
1928
47:03
he had a golf game so james golf
47:05
dangerous game
47:06
you've got to be careful i'm playing on
47:08
saturday well try not to put your gun
47:10
too near golf clubs in the bag
47:12
because that's how he did it he is the
47:15
details are slightly unclear but we
47:17
think that after a round of golf he got
47:19
into
47:19
his car and he opened his golf bag and
47:21
fiddled around and he was keeping his
47:23
gun in there as well
47:24
and he shot himself and he shot himself
47:25
sort of multiple times i think through
47:27
the groin and through the
47:28
upper why did he keep shooting after the
47:33
first
47:34
that doesn't stack up it really doesn't
47:36
i
47:38
think he had multiple wounds maybe the
47:40
bullet went in and out and in and out
47:41
kind of like a sewing needle
47:43
um or if you press your finger on a
47:45
trigger accidentally can it deploy
47:46
multiple bullets
47:48
it's a machine gun it can yeah it
47:50
doesn't keep a machine gun in the golf
47:51
bag if afterwards someone said did you
47:53
get a hole in one and he said a hole in
47:54
one of my testicles
47:56
[Laughter]
47:59
yeah he wasn't he wasn't a funny guy
48:03
he i read in one capone biography this
48:06
thing that gang's habit that gangsters
48:07
had in the 20s that brooklyn gangsters
48:09
had which apparently
48:10
they devoted huge amounts of time to um
48:14
so and this is also in a book about
48:16
brooklyn gangs but i couldn't find
48:17
first-hand
48:18
evidence apparently gangs has devoted
48:20
huge amounts of time to the look
48:23
and the look is a threatening stare
48:26
that you give someone it was a deadly
48:27
gaze designed to strike mortal fear into
48:29
the heart of an enemy
48:31
and it was more frightening than any
48:32
kind of violence or anything like that
48:35
and so they they practice it apparently
48:37
al capone is very good at it it's the
48:39
source of all
48:40
yeah so andy's doing it sort of trying
48:42
to do it now
48:43
um you know you can't shake your fist
48:45
james that is cheating
48:49
habits was to stand in front of the
48:50
mirror for hours on end each day
48:51
practicing
48:53
that's so funny yeah capone used to
48:55
think that he was very
48:56
a well-dressed guy as well they had to
48:58
look in the other way didn't he
49:00
he had the nickname snarky which he much
49:02
preferred to um
49:04
to scarface so he's quite embarrassed by
49:06
scarface and like if there were cameras
49:08
on he would try and move the scars to
49:09
the
49:10
so they couldn't see them on the camera
49:12
um
49:13
he wouldn't move the scars obviously
49:14
that's very difficult to do
49:17
he would move the scars but only because
49:18
they were attached to his head and he
49:19
was moving his head
49:22
but yeah he liked to be called snarky
49:23
which um in those days meant someone who
49:25
was well dressed
49:26
he looks a bit snarky snarky it sounds
49:29
like a cartoon dog
49:30
he's much less threatening al snarky
49:32
capone yeah
49:34
i read anything in gentleman's gazette
49:36
recently which was about al capone it
49:38
said
49:39
al capone was known as much for his
49:41
sense of style as he was for his
49:43
psychopathic tendencies
49:44
which i would dispute i think you're
49:46
right i think it's number one
49:48
syphilis number two psychopathic
49:50
tendencies number three
49:51
style yeah i think that's iraqi
50:00
okay that's it that is all of our facts
50:02

[Applause]
50:57
can i quickly say at deidre capone
51:01
just because we mentioned her on twitter
51:03
and i don't know if it's funny or not
51:04
she's actually did read marie capp
51:06
what i don't know why she put in marie
51:07
had left out capone but there we go
51:09
because cap is a slang word for putting
51:10
a cap in it for shooting someone
51:12
that comes from that comes from capone
51:14
put a cap on your ass
51:15
come on we've just done a gullible
51:17
podcast
51:18
[Laughter]
51:21
i held down i deliberately held back
51:24
damn it
51:25
was still recording
51:37
you

=326.5 CWC
00:00
hi everyone welcome to this week's bonus
00:03
compilation episode of no such thing as
00:06
a fish some of the best
00:08
bits that i couldn't quite fit in the
00:09
edit of all the shows that we've done
00:11
over the last three or four months yes
00:14
this is an extra special treat
00:16
for all of you because you've listened
00:17
so loyally for so long
00:19
you're getting this episode and you're
00:20
getting it with no
00:22
adverts we're not going to ask you to
00:24
order home delivered
00:25
meals or delicious international beer
00:28
or clothes perfectly sculpted to your
00:31
figure
00:32
hannah this is now another stickler it's
00:34
oh god i've turned it to an outfit i
00:35
can't help it
00:36
well there is one thing we are actually
00:38
going to ask people to do because this
00:40
bonus episode comes with one little tiny
00:42
string attached to it and that's that
00:44
it is for charity this is raising money
00:47
this episode for a charity called the
00:49
care workers charity
00:50
we'll be telling you a bit more about
00:51
them in a bit but it's a fantastic and
00:53
very worthy cause
00:54
and so your listening is being co-opted
00:55
in the name of that cause
00:57
that's right this episode is absolutely
00:59
free it is completely free you don't
01:01
have to donate if you don't want to
01:03
but if you do have a few quid to spare
01:04
we would really really appreciate it
01:06
just to stress how
01:07
really important it is that we're all
01:09
giving money to charity at the moment
01:10
it's obviously a time when a lot of
01:13
charities need huge amounts of money
01:15
uh because of kovid and it's coinciding
01:17
with a time where people are not giving
01:19
money to charities so the charity sector
01:20
has lost billions and billions of pounds
01:23
over the last few months because of
01:24
covert because people are just really
01:26
struggling
01:26
and so there's no more vital time to be
01:28
able to donate any money that you can
01:30
spare
01:31
all you have to do is go to qi.com
01:33
donate or
01:35
justgiving.com nstaaf
01:38
and either one will take you to the
01:40
place you need okay
01:42
i'm with the podcast
01:54
[Music]
01:57
um sorry just um on ancient
02:01
sausages i was looking at who invented
02:05
the hot dog
02:06
which is quite hard to find um but i was
02:08
i found where the first sausages were
02:10
supposedly invented
02:11
and this is an article from bbc history
02:13
and they said that
02:14
the emperor nero had a called gaius
02:17
and
02:18
um in roman times you would starve your
02:20
pigs for one week before you slaughtered
02:22
them
02:22
but gaius was watching over his kitchen
02:24
and realized that one of his pigs had
02:26
not been properly cleaned
02:27
so he stuck a knife into the belly of
02:29
the pig to see if the roast was edible
02:31
and out popped an intestine okay because
02:34
the pig had been starved it had puffed
02:37
up because of the heat
02:38
and gaius explained i have discovered
02:41
something of great importance
02:43
and it was the sausage well cool it's a
02:46
great story
02:47
you totally don't believe that story
02:49
well no it's it's history
02:51
bbc history bbc history mate
02:54
whatever it's an account well who made
02:56
up the account
03:00
uh i think it's i don't know who wrote
03:02
it who wrote about nero de ocasio or
03:04
something like that
03:05
oh yeah maybe probably um wow yeah so
03:08
that was
03:08
because they had they did have sausages
03:10
didn't they they did have sausages and
03:11
romans yeah yeah who's to think it
03:13
hasn't come from this
03:14
great discovery of great importance and
03:16
when you do discover something like that
03:18
you're going to write about it it seems
03:19
weird to us these days why would you
03:20
write about the first sausage
03:21
back then that's like the ipod coming
03:23
out
03:23
[Laughter]
03:25
nero's on stage at the forum turtleneck
03:27
the ice sausage
03:30
one
03:32
um one group who are interested in
03:34
earthworms is the erg
03:37
the european research group the brexitee
03:41
jay cabris muggy group no it's the
03:43
earthworm research group
03:47
who work in britain they're one of the
03:48
main groups of earthworm researchers
03:51
in the country and ironically
03:52
considering they have the same name as
03:54
the erg brexiters
03:56
they mostly deal with overseas projects
03:58
with people like finland france ireland
04:00
italy poland and spain wow so for them
04:03
brexit is really bad
04:04
this erg yeah wow
04:08
so it's like an erg vs erg debate right
04:11
now i want to see that fight
04:12
yeah between jacob rees-mogg and this
04:14
head of the earthworm research group
04:17
i'd back anyone who's on the other end
04:18
against jacoby's mob although he does
04:20
have that cane a lot of the time
04:22
um because he's a pimp
04:29
okay so i don't think he carries a cane
04:30
does he he's carrying he's not a
04:32
victorian
04:33
head master i think i'm accidentally
04:35
thinking of the caricature of a
04:36
victorian gentleman because that's how
04:38
people portray him
04:39
aren't i or you're thinking of where's
04:40
wally who he does have a similar look to
04:43
barring the clothes yeah does his
04:45
glasses okay those glasses yeah he has a
04:47
cane he walks around with a king yeah he
04:48
does it's a walking stick
04:49
yeah that's a cane is it why does
04:53
where's wally ever came he's walking a
04:54
lot
04:55
yeah because he has to get to all the
04:56
different parts of the page yeah it's a
04:58
walking stick like someone up a mountain
05:00
not someone who oh okay
05:03
uh an old person for example no no okay
05:06
because he's middle aged
05:07
or where's wally young to middle age i
05:09
think young
05:10
i mean i am quite old so it's a young
05:12
man's game
05:13
[Laughter]
05:16
there was a place i read about which was
05:18
called loudoun county
05:20
i think i'm pronouncing that right in
05:21
america and um supposedly
05:24
so it's in virginia supposedly 70
05:26
percent
05:27
of the world's online traffic passes
05:29
through this one county
05:31
what yeah so they have all the storage
05:33
units there and so on yeah this was um
05:35
this was a an article that i was reading
05:37
um so it's the largest concentration
05:39
this article says
05:40
of computing power um and according to
05:43
greenpeace
05:44
uh in 2017 one percent of the
05:46
electricity company
05:48
that runs all of the electricity in this
05:50
one place um only one percent of it
05:52
is renewable sources so it's the it's
05:55
incredibly unhealthy so if we're talking
05:56
about online carbon footprint if i go to
05:58
this town can i find everyone's emails
06:00
is that what you're saying to me but
06:02
they're wishing through so fast you need
06:04
a net
06:04
oh you need
06:08
have you heard of eel houses no that's
06:10
cool there are two of these things in
06:12
the uk
06:12
two only and it's where you build a
06:14
house over a river
06:16
and you have sluice gates which are
06:17
designed to trap eels so they're built
06:19
in the middle ages
06:21
and you can and you just you know trap
06:22
all the eels as they head down the river
06:24
once they feel the call they're quite
06:26
good at getting past obstacles aren't
06:27
they
06:28
so you know you've got to build a good
06:29
gate so they're really good at
06:31
slithering along the ground
06:32
and they can climb up dams and climb
06:35
over them and stuff like that
06:36
and i think people when when eels get
06:38
obstructed by slightly too big dams if
06:40
you like a hoover situation
06:42
then people have built little eel
06:43
ladders so you can
06:45
knit together reeds and stuff and they
06:47
can climb up those that's
06:48
very like snakes and ladders isn't it
06:52
yeah the snakes are climbing the ladders
06:54
oh my god the game has changed
06:55
[Laughter]
06:58
i was watching the cartoon cars the
07:00
other day you know the pixar
07:02
so they're nascar cars in cars and one
07:05
of the things is that he goes into the
07:06
wild and he gets lost at night because
07:08
he doesn't have headlights
07:09
and i thought okay that's interesting
07:11
and i was reading into this so nascars
07:13
don't have headlights for their cars but
07:15
when you look at them they do right
07:17
they're stickers the headlights that you
07:20
see on a nascar are stickers
07:22
that are just put on there to look like
07:23
they have real headlights how do they
07:25
light up
07:26
i don't think they well there's new
07:27
technology where they do actually just
07:29
have little beams that come out but they
07:30
don't need i mean
07:32
that's a headlight no but still the
07:33
sticker so it's still yeah
07:35
it's not a functioning headlight why why
07:37
do they because presumably the races are
07:39
at daytime or they're floodlit if
07:40
they're later on in the day so they
07:41
don't need headlights to function in the
07:43
race exactly yeah
07:44
so why do they do it it's all to do with
07:46
the manufacturers in getting it past
07:48
they need the shape of the body to have
07:50
the headlights spot
07:51
um so apparently it's to do with stock
07:53
but then they're not functional so they
07:54
just put stickers over the top because
07:56
otherwise it wouldn't be identified as a
07:57
car or something exactly
07:59
yeah can i just check in the film cars
08:01
when the car goes into the wild
08:02
presumably he goes into the wild
08:04
to the extent that there are well tarmac
08:06
surfaces in the wild
08:08
yes okay fine so he just stays on roads
08:10
does he stays on roads
08:12
he goes into the wild west of america he
08:14
goes off track he goes
08:16
yeah but not literally off track he goes
08:18
literally off track in the sense of he
08:19
goes on races in the sort of the dirty
08:21
outback
08:22
okay but there's always a track there no
08:24
yeah sometimes when he goes off the
08:25
track
08:26
the dirty outback is a horrible phrase
08:29
can we just
08:30
log that which probably is of you
08:32
referring to
08:34
um the world record for cycling
08:37
backwards
08:38
uh is 333 kilometers
08:42
in a day uh and this is done by an
08:45
australian guy
08:46
called helinga and he sits on top of his
08:49
handlebars
08:50
and faces backwards and then cycles
08:53
for forward sidecast the bike is going
08:56
forward but he's facing backwards yes
08:58
and he's sitting on his handlebars whoa
09:00
yeah that makes sense
09:01
yeah he said i first started riding
09:03
backwards when i was a teenager to
09:05
impress the girls
09:13
that's so impressive i mean where was he
09:16
doing this
09:17
was it on roads uh it was in ro on roads
09:20
yep
09:21
was it on the island of rhodes
09:24
it was in australia odd roads oh okay
09:26
because they've got a lot of
09:27
i guess quite quiet roads yeah yeah a
09:29
lot of them yeah a lot of long roads
09:31
yeah dirty back passages
09:36
um do you know you can make pie out of
09:39
hot dogs and
09:40
do you want to know the recipe do you
09:41
just do you make the pastry and then put
09:42
the whole hot dog in do you put the
09:44
bread in the
09:45
pastry no this is i'm going to tell you
09:47
the recipe and tell me when you know
09:49
what joke i'm making um so the recipe is
09:52
you drop frozen hot dogs onto a grid
09:56
where the lines are further apart in
09:57
length than the length of the hot dog
09:59
so that you know none of the lines are
10:01
closer together than the length of the
10:02
hot dog
10:02
i've got it he's got it it's james arkan
10:05
for the win
10:06
what am i doing you're working out the
10:08
mathematical number pi
10:10
it's the mathematical number pi if you
10:13
don't want to do it the normal way which
10:14
is remembering that it's 3.14 like we
10:16
all know
10:17
you can you do this so the it's really
10:20
cool so you
10:21
basically toss a bunch of hot dogs let's
10:22
say 100 hot dogs um onto this
10:24
grid and then you multiply the dog
10:27
length by the number of dogs tossed
10:29
and then you times that by two so that's
10:31
on the top of the equation
10:33
and then you divide that by the distance
10:35
between the lines
10:37
and the number of dogs that have crossed
10:39
over the lines
10:40
and then you will get the answer to what
10:43
pi
10:43
is that's how it was originally worked
10:45
out as well wasn't it yeah yeah
10:47
yeah it was aristocenes wasn't it
10:51
he had a load of hot dogs yeah yeah he
10:53
did he had cholesterol issues but he was
10:54
a great mathematician
10:56
and people do know why i don't uh
10:59
because i had limited time
11:00
but i still think that's really cool
11:02
yeah i found something out this weekend
11:04
that was spooky you know andy murray the
11:06
tennis player yeah the objectively much
11:07
more famous andy murray
11:09
i found out so i found out that he and i
11:12
as children both owned hamsters called
11:14
whiskey ah
11:16
really yeah really that's an amazing
11:19
fact that is weird isn't it
11:20
that was incredible were you playing
11:22
tennis before you knew he played tennis
11:24
um well yeah at school yeah but not like
11:27
not as a weekend kind of you had
11:29
training and stuff no no no no okay
11:31
i'm just that would have been a
11:32
connection as well you can't discount
11:34
tennis i do play tennis
11:37
that's a slam the fact that you won six
11:39
one does not mean i do not play tennis
11:41
it just
11:41
means i just think it's playing pretty
11:43
fast and loose with the word play
11:46
do you think there was just a hamster
11:48
salesman going around
11:52
not very good imagination for names
11:56
well you don't you name your own hamster
11:58
you don't have the pets opponent name
11:59
your hamster for you when they sell it
12:01
we don't know that though we don't know
12:02
that he
12:02
wasn't subtly brilliant you didn't name
12:04
which i went to big larry's hamster
12:06
emporium in glasgow and uh
12:08
in dublin
12:12
you were told here's whiskey the hamster
12:14
siblings whiskey
12:15
why did you call it whiskey because at
12:17
that age you probably weren't drinking
12:18
whiskey
12:19
uh well funny thing uh no it was because
12:21
of the color
12:22
ah yeah it was whiskey colored okay yeah
12:25
and it's not my password for anything
12:26
online guys so nice try
12:29
and the word alcatraz means ganet in
12:31
spanish
12:32
but when the island was named in 1775 it
12:34
actually meant pelicans
12:37
and but the spanish word for pelicans
12:39
alcatraz actually came from the arab
12:41
arabic word for sea eagle oh my god
12:45
i'm so confused but basically the
12:47
birdman of alcatraz is
12:48
correct not really because there weren't
12:49
any birds there he was the birdman of
12:51
another prison who just gave him that
12:52
name they kept the first bit of his name
12:54
when he got there i thought he kept
12:55
birds in alcatraz no he kept birds in
12:57
the previous prison they didn't have
12:58
birds for him on alcatraz
13:00
what it sounds like there are a lot of
13:01
birds on our contracts
13:03
so sorry i'm coming back to this the
13:05
spanish changed
13:06
the meaning of their word for pelican to
13:08
mean gannet yeah when was this
13:10
law passed sometimes it wasn't a law
13:13
but it was some time between i i'm
13:15
saying it's not a law
13:16
wow for all i know it was a lot but it
13:18
was sometime between 1775 and then
13:21
the morning you woke up tomorrow and
13:23
someone was like you know eagle
13:24
that now refers to a magpie
13:26
[Laughter]
13:30
there are seaweed bladders so some so
13:32
there are three bits of a seaweed plant
13:34
there's the hold fast which is basically
13:35
the root
13:36
and then there's the stipe which is the
13:38
stem and then there are the blades so
13:39
it's very all analogous to a
13:41
land plant but some of them have these
13:43
air filled bladders and the purpose is
13:45
to hold them
13:45
upright so they get more sunlight which
13:48
i didn't know but
13:49
the really big ones they can get up to
13:50
six inches wide these bladders
13:52
which i looked it up is as wide as a
13:55
human bladder
13:56
is it yeah and are they looking into
13:58
potential transplants
14:00
that's a human bladder of full stretch
14:03
your bladder doesn't get much bigger
14:04
than that
14:05
wow glasses don't get bigger than this
14:07
[Laughter]
14:09
when they had the first cars they were
14:12
all hand painted
14:14
and the paint wasn't very good and so
14:16
after every year all the paint will
14:18
flake off your car
14:19
and so you had to take it back and get
14:21
it repainted every single year
14:24
yeah and it would take about 40 days to
14:26
complete painting the whole car
14:28
40 days no that is a garage ripping you
14:31
off
14:33
it was because you had to paint it by
14:35
hand but then you had to let it dry and
14:36
do another
14:38
coat and it took ages for the cars to
14:39
dry wow
14:41
that's so fun isn't that amazing yeah
14:43
was this because this they had
14:44
electricity at this point you could get
14:46
a hair dryer or something couldn't you
14:48
yeah i see what you could yeah no you
14:51
probably could well you know when you go
14:52
through a car wash they dry it at the
14:53
end don't they
14:54
yeah but you'd wash off the paint in the
14:56
process of getting to the dryer oh
14:58
god that would be awful you'd have to do
15:00
all of them
15:02
that's why it took 40 days on the 39th
15:04
they're like hang on there guys
15:05
[Laughter]
15:08
um you don't get a lot of flummery of
15:09
these days
15:13
jelly so again in the olden days there
15:15
was just a greater variety of jelly they
15:17
were like apples it was before you know
15:18
we went mass market i always thought it
15:20
was like blemonge flummery is it
15:22
it is it's bubble and munges blemishes
15:24
jelly really isn't it
15:25
um and so flummery was extremely popular
15:28
17th 19th century
15:30
so it's made by apparently steeping
15:31
oatmeal in water overnight and then
15:33
boiling the strain thing you've got in
15:35
the morning and you add sugar
15:36
and it eventually turns into a kind of
15:38
wobbly thing and
15:40
if you're wealthy you had to have a huge
15:42
array of flummery molds
15:43
because they'd present flummery in
15:45
different shapes on their tables and so
15:47
and it was really popular to have
15:48
flummery disguised as proper food so
15:50
flummery eggs and bacon
15:52
was quite a common thing so there are
15:54
lots of you know molds
15:56
where you'd look like you were about to
15:57
eat eggs and bacon it's classic and then
15:59
you put it into
15:59
it and it's flummery it's the best
16:03
word it's a great word
16:06
and i wonder if that's where flammary
16:08
comes from you know when you'd say
16:09
something's
16:10
like flummery it sort of falls
16:11
flattering i think so it must be but i
16:13
wonder if that it comes from the fact
16:14
that it's false because
16:16
flummery often disguised itself yes
16:18
these different delicious foods
16:20
um have you guys heard of frozen dead
16:22
guy days
16:23
no no no doesn't sound like a thing it's
16:25
a real thing this is an annual
16:26
celebration that's held in the town
16:28
of nederland colorado and it's basically
16:31
in
16:31
in 1989 this is where the story begins a
16:34
man passed away he was norwegian
16:36
and his grandson brought him over to
16:38
america to have him frozen
16:40
and so they had him on ice they brought
16:41
him over and after a few years they
16:43
moved to netherland
16:44
and they built along with his mother
16:47
this
16:47
big in their house basically a shed that
16:50
could just keep him going
16:51
and keep him frozen um and then
16:54
the sun got deported the grandson got
16:56
deported so the mom had to look after it
16:58
and the authorities saw what was going
17:00
on in the house and she didn't have a
17:01
few things like electricity and so on
17:03
and it was a bit illegal and they
17:04
discovered
17:05
how she keeping the chamber going
17:08
she had one bit of electricity for that
17:09
bit but not for the rest of the house
17:11
anyway
17:12
i'm just going to turn the tv on no
17:17
okay you can turn the tv on for a bit
17:18
but once his ankles are thawed out we
17:20
have to put it back
17:21
on but basically the house was in
17:23
violation of local laws of what you need
17:25
a house to be done so
17:27
she was gonna be kicked out and then
17:29
they discovered that she was keeping her
17:31
father
17:31
frozen in the back and they said hang on
17:33
this is very illegal
17:35
um so they wanted to get him out and as
17:37
a result it had a lot of hoo-ha from the
17:39
community saying no we can't have him
17:40
thawed out he'll die this is
17:42
they want to keep him going so it worked
17:44
out in their favor and this man is still
17:45
there
17:46
he's been moved to a different bit of
17:47
the town but as a result they celebrate
17:50
every year frozen dead guy day and it's
17:52
it's a thing the last one was in 2019
17:54
that they had it
17:55
they have um lookalike contests they
17:57
have
17:58
um they have they're getting less and
18:00
less flattering presumably
18:05
they have coffin races and this is a
18:07
thing where they build a fake coffin
18:08
there's an obstacle course
18:09
and they carry it's teams of seven and
18:11
one of the seven is in the coffin
18:13
and they have to race around um they
18:15
have frozen t-shirt competitions
18:17
there's a very cold area of this place
18:19
um they have ice cream that's made
18:20
specifically for it which has crushed
18:22
oreos and sour gummy worms inside
18:24
it's been wow bit yummy yeah and it's
18:27
been going on for all these years so the
18:28
last one was held march 8th to 10th
18:30
2019 and it looks as if they're going to
18:32
keep going
18:34
soon when you're listening to this
18:35
podcast you might have just missed it
18:36
yeah
18:37
exactly wow i mean do you think there's
18:39
any moment where she's gonna think is
18:41
this slightly tasteless what i've done
18:42
now
18:43
if and obviously it's the biggest if
18:45
ever if he wakes up
18:46
at some point he will be a local hero
18:49
yeah
18:49
imagine that day that's so exciting yeah
18:52
yeah but he's gonna wake up having
18:54
passed away in norway oh he's going to
18:56
wake up in colorado with a language he
18:58
probably doesn't speak
19:00
with all these guys serving him ice
19:02
creams
19:03
it's going to be weird um do you want to
19:06
know some acne
19:07
language okay i'll teach you something
19:10
um
19:11
boys old boys means unbelievable
19:14
boys or boys boys oh boys b-e-u-y-s
19:18
so i think it's boys okay um to dilda
19:23
means to walk around aimlessly and
19:26
slowly
19:27
oh yeah i think is a nice word that we
19:29
can all take yeah
19:30
buildering around and my favorite one
19:34
is beer the word beer means to complain
19:37
or moan
19:38
which means it also means to whine so
19:41
the word beer means wine
19:44
extremely confusing in the plethora of
19:46
pubs i'm sure they have
19:50
so uh grizzly bears um can do one thing
19:53
that i can't do
19:54
uh and that is use a comb um they have
19:57
been found using the comb using a comb
19:59
the only other species other than
20:01
humans to do so cool what uh this is
20:04
making their combs
20:05
well they have their peddlers going
20:07
around their dents
20:10
this was in the glacier bay national
20:12
park in alaska
20:13
and they um there was someone called
20:16
volca decker
20:17
from the university of saint andrews and
20:20
volker found this um grizzly bear
20:23
picking up a rock from the water
20:25
looking at it sort of turning it over
20:28
putting it back
20:28
picking another one up looking at that
20:30
one and then with that
20:32
sort of combing his fur with it around
20:34
his muzzle
20:35
and then he would put it down and he
20:37
would pick it up and do it again
20:38
and then volker went to have a look at
20:40
these rocks and found that they had
20:41
barnacles on them
20:42
and worked out that what the bear was
20:44
doing was looking for the right one
20:46
and the fact that he picked up the first
20:48
one and then threw it away again
20:50
means that he can discriminate between
20:52
what's a good comb and what's a bad comb
20:53
which basically
20:54
shows that he understands the fact that
20:56
it's a tool wow
20:58
that's so cool isn't that amazing i
20:59
don't think of any rocks as being a good
21:01
comb
21:02
do they have do they have sort of prongs
21:04
on them is these rocks well they have
21:06
barnacles on them
21:07
yeah okay no that that does yeah it'll
21:10
sort of
21:10
do the job you're a bear you don't care
21:14
what you've got it is legal to eat a dog
21:19
yeah yes it's not in all countries true
21:21
but in this country in the uk
21:22
and in the usa in 44 states of the usa
21:25
and here you probably can't sell dog
21:26
meat can you
21:27
you can't sell it but if it's your dog
21:28
and you kill it humanely
21:30
you can do it yeah people often
21:33
associate
21:34
south korea don't they with eating dogs
21:36
and it is
21:37
there are no legal consequences for
21:38
selling dog meat in south korea
21:41
um although it's officially classified
21:42
as detestable
21:44
[Music]
21:46
a lot of my behavior is not illegal but
21:49
it is
21:50
clearly detestable there was a survey of
21:54
worldwide spur banks
21:55
to see how common various different
21:58
traits are
21:59
and so statistically if you get sperm
22:02
from a sperm bank your donor is most
22:04
likely to be a christian accountant with
22:06
brown hair
22:06
brown eyes and white skin and it's least
22:09
likely to be
22:10
a dark-skinned gingerbreader
22:14
it's not likely to be a 19-foot tall
22:16
dwarf
22:18
so it's least likely to be a
22:19
dark-skinned ginger buddhist with black
22:21
eyes
22:22
[Laughter]
22:30
yeah because they have translucent skin
22:32
so you can see their
22:34
genitals through their skin wow oh
22:36
that's great what like just
22:37
aerial view you can see right through to
22:39
the yeah that's so great it's amazing
22:41
but they do and the skin this is so
22:43
weird so they're blind
22:44
which is or they're nearly blind nearly
22:46
black which makes sense because they
22:48
live in very very dark caves most of the
22:50
time
22:50
but for the first four months they do
22:52
have eyes and for the first four months
22:54
of their life their eyes are out on the
22:55
outside and then gradually skin grows
22:58
over their eyes
23:00
meaning that they find it quite
23:01
difficult to see but
23:03
thankfully they can detect light with
23:04
their skin so it's kind of a happy story
23:06
yeah yeah it's weird though isn't it to
23:08
have functioning eyes
23:10
that just get then overgrown yeah
23:12
overgrown by the thing that can also see
23:14
yeah it's weird it's not what's the
23:16
point yeah
23:18
hard to say well there is no point james
23:22
well let's not look at this from the
23:24
religious perspective
23:28
stop the podcast stop the podcast hi
23:31
everyone we'd like to let you know that
23:32
we are not sponsored by
23:34
anyone but we are asking you to donate
23:36
to the care workers charity
23:38
yes so the care workers charity is a
23:40
charity that exists to support care
23:42
workers who are having a
23:44
hell of a time right now as you can
23:46
imagine
23:47
so a they're very low paid anyway over
23:49
43 of care workers are paid below
23:51
the real living wage and at the moment
23:53
with covert a lot of them having to take
23:55
a lot of time off work and losing even
23:57
that wage
23:58
and so the care workers charity is
23:59
setting up a fund where they're giving
24:01
grants to people who are really
24:02
suffering
24:03
yes lots of care workers have lost their
24:05
income as a result of the crisis
24:07
there are so many care workers in the uk
24:09
two million of them
24:10
and many of those guys are on a low
24:12
income so anything that can be done
24:14
to alleviate that pressure at this time
24:17
is greatly appreciated
24:18
that's right the care workers they're at
24:20
the absolute front of the coronavirus
24:22
crisis at the moment
24:23
they're looking after the most
24:24
vulnerable and most susceptible people
24:26

and another thing that you could get
24:56
dotstar was hp sauce
24:59
that was um originally only sold
25:01
door-to-door no
25:02
if you wanted hp sauce in 1905 the only
25:05
way you could get it was from a dollar
25:06
still salesman
25:08
it was invented by edwin sansom moore
25:10
who had a door-to-door vinegar and
25:12
pickle company
25:13
so you just have to wait just that's
25:15
away if the daughter's old guy came
25:16
around yesterday and you suddenly needed
25:18
it it's like he won't be back for
25:19
another three months if you make a bacon
25:20
sandwich you better make it at the right
25:21
time
25:22
did he i just that sounds terrifying the
25:25
hp sauce man coming down the street with
25:27
his feet did he have like a backpack
25:28
full of hp sauce you just squirt it into
25:31
your home
25:33
what do you mean like a milkman does
25:35
today
25:37
why is that where your brain went with
25:38
that i don't understand i'm just
25:40
picturing him in a the costume
25:42
which is the a bottle of hp sauce and
25:45
then he sort of leans his head forward
25:47
and squeezes his
25:48
sides and it squirts disgusting
25:53
it's disgusting no he didn't do that no
25:55
you've had your peddling license revoked
26:00
you know how you're saying that 11 can
26:01
mean like a bad car
26:03
um you know the lemon rally yes
26:07
have you heard of the lemon no
26:10
so this is a real thing it's in america
26:13
and
26:14
the rules are that you have to drive a
26:16
car that is valued at less than five
26:17
hundred dollars
26:19
so you have to drive a really terrible
26:21
car
26:22
and um they before you turn up they look
26:24
at all the cars and they put you into
26:26
three categories either
26:28
car really car or probably not
26:30
gonna finish the race car
26:32
and the prizes are better for the worse
26:34
cars so
26:35
you get more dollars if you're driving a
26:37
really really car
26:38
uh and the way that they work it out
26:41
that you can't cheat
26:43
is because at the end of the race
26:45
according to the rules
26:46
they're allowed to purchase any vehicle
26:48
for 500
26:50
so if you turn up with a bugatti or
26:52
something right then they by law have to
26:54
be able to buy it off you for five
26:56
hundred dollars that's twice in their
26:57
history
26:58
they've um looked at it and gone you
27:00
know what that's worth more than five
27:01
hundred dollars i want to buy it off you
27:04
that's so funny isn't that cool that's
27:06
great is that in america in america yeah
27:08
and um
27:09
there's a load of i mean it's a bit
27:10
silly but there's a load of rules so
27:12
if you kind of break some laws you might
27:15
have to get out of your car and run
27:17
around the track singing i'm a little
27:18
teapot
27:20
it's a bit of a silly thing but it's
27:22
kind of cool do you have to do the
27:23
gestures as well
27:24
i think you do yeah so you would have to
27:26
that's part of the song yeah yeah
27:27
you're right does anyone have any more
27:28
on the manchester specifically um well
27:31
what i can say
27:31
is so the manchester belongs to a genus
27:35
called euphorbia uh and there's a more
27:37
famous
27:38
plant that comes from that genus and
27:40
that is the poinsettia
27:42
so it's basically the same thing and the
27:43
christmas thing there's like red
27:44
christmas plants
27:46
and they're also a little bit kind of
27:48
poisonous there's a myth that they kill
27:50
dogs isn't there and stuff like that i
27:52
think but they're not quite that
27:53
poisonous but they are quite poisonous
27:55
um and the reason i find this really
27:57
interesting the reason we have
27:58
poinsettias at christmas
28:00
is because there was a family called the
28:03
eek family
28:04
ecke i don't know if that's how you
28:06
pronounce it
28:08
and they found a way to make the
28:09
poinsettia um bloom
28:11
in the winter because it's actually a
28:13
summer plant
28:14
and when they did that they wanted to
28:17
sell it
28:17
but they didn't know how to do this and
28:19
so they sent it to loads of tv studios
28:22
around christmas time in the hope that
28:24
the tv studios who just wanted to put
28:25
something in the background will put
28:26
this poinsettia in the background
28:28
and it just so happened that this was
28:30
just when color television had started
28:32
and so all the producers were like wow
28:34
look at this red plant this is going to
28:35
show up
28:36
really well on the new color tv and so
28:38
all of the tv shows around that time
28:40
started putting poinsettias in their
28:41
christmas shows
28:43
and then that's why today you'll might
28:45
have these in your house at christmas
28:46
that's really cool
28:47
isn't mistletoe a bit poisonous as well
28:49
um yeah
28:50
so we're just surrounding ourselves in
28:53
poisons during the christmas period
28:54
yeah it's exciting just don't eat it
28:56
don't eat mistletoe
28:58
yeah and don't eat holly as well that's
28:59
going to sting on the way down
29:04
don't eat the plants don't eat my pot
29:05
okay get it i get it i'm sorry
29:07
i'm sorry i won't do it again see the
29:08
food i actually did this once
29:10
so sorry which which i think the
29:12
miniaturization thing
29:14
i'll explain better um at the end of
29:16
university sometimes they
29:18
take a photo of all of you you know in
29:19
your graduation on your graduation day
29:21
and your gowns and things
29:23
yeah and they to get you to buy the
29:24
photo of your whole year
29:26
at university they send you a tiny like
29:29
uh
29:29
a two inch by three inch photo of your
29:31
whole year at university
29:33
um and you can't really see you can't
29:35
see who anyone is no but it's just to
29:37
encourage you to splash out on the main
29:38
thing
29:38
i just kept the miniature one and framed
29:40
that amazing
29:42
i've got a tiny photo of my whole year
29:45
at university
29:46
i can't tell where i am wow
29:49
do you have a memory of where you were
29:50
on the day no
29:52
i don't not anymore no it's been too
29:53
long so i'm in there i'm in there though
29:56
that's the main thing
29:57
are you sure are you this is what
29:59
actually happened you didn't graduate
30:01
and you said to your parents oh look i'm
30:03
in this picture that's
30:04
that's me the little blob in the car
30:07
i'm wearing the same clothes you really
30:08
can't tell that's you're that's kind of
30:10
like a caricature of some sort of
30:12
dickensian parsimonious you know stingy
30:15
bastard
30:16
well if you see that on the wall i saved
30:19
about 25 pounds by doing that thank you
30:21
very much and
30:22
ten years later when i can't see myself
30:23
from my own graduation
30:25
it's worth it i can't rig up now and say
30:27
have you got that photo
30:29
but i've decided i'm willing to buy it
30:31
i've made a decision
30:35
uh do you know that before they had
30:36
bumper stickers so bumper stickers were
30:38
invented by this guy called forrest gill
30:40
um and it was in the 50s i think late
30:43
50s
30:43
and but before that drivers would have
30:46
handmade placards that they tied to
30:47
their cards with pieces of twine
30:50
so if you wanted to say who you're going
30:52
to vote for in the election you would
30:53
just get a placard and tie it to your
30:55
car
30:55
it's not cool you just tie a bit of card
30:57
to your car really cool i'm trying to
30:58
figure out where you'd tie it maybe onto
31:00
those
31:00
roof rack bars if you've got those i
31:02
think where your bumper is maybe
31:05
you would just have a small placard
31:07
wouldn't you the size of a sticker
31:08
almost
31:10
how did what do you tie it around uh the
31:12
bumper
31:14
i'm gonna have to see it i forgot my car
31:16
looks like
31:19
i saw this amazing tweet by this guy
31:21
called frank paul um who's like a
31:22
quizzer in the uk
31:24
and he found this wikipedia article
31:27
about a movie called
31:28
ok connery have you heard about this so
31:31
this was
31:32
like a spoof of james bond made in italy
31:35
and the way it started is neil connery
31:38
who is sean connery's brother
31:40
was working as a plasterer in scotland
31:43
and he was sacked for losing his tools
31:46
okay and then this got into the tab like
31:48
newspaper this is all real oh i thought
31:50
you meant they'd made all this up
31:52
no no no so this neil connery is real he
31:54
was working as a plasterer he lost his
31:56
tools and he got fired
31:58
and so it was in all the newspapers that
32:00
sean connery's brother's just been fired
32:01
for losing his tools
32:03
and when um this guy who was making a
32:05
movie
32:06
i mean it must have been a slow news day
32:10
and then this these people in italy kind
32:12
of heard about this and they saw him in
32:14
interviews on the
32:15
on the local news and he sounded just
32:17
like sean connery
32:18
and so they thought why don't we make a
32:20
movie with
32:22
neil connery where he's pretending to be
32:23
james bond and they made this movie
32:26
called
32:26
ok coloring which is apparently terrible
32:30
which is yeah why does it sound
32:31
incredible
32:33
and apparently also um it was filmed
32:36
without any live sound
32:37
neil connery had appendicitis when they
32:39
were filming it and
32:41
he was really sick and he couldn't
32:42
really speak properly so they got shown
32:44
in to dub it
32:47
well we added all the voices in later in
32:49
the film so everyone's lip syncing and
32:51
they added all the voices later on
32:52
and apparently it's one of the worst
32:53
films ever that does sound amazing
32:56
that's incredible um i was
33:00
looking on reddit uh and there is a bit
33:02
on reddit called
33:03
t-i-f-u which means today i up
33:07
and someone posted t-i-f-u today i
33:10
up by putting i voted stickers on
33:13
my nipples for the sake of getting in my
33:14
husband's pants
33:16
it was painful to remove do not do this
33:19
no matter how sexy
33:22
just goes into a load of details about
33:24
how they got stuck on her nipples and
33:26
she couldn't remove them no matter what
33:27
she did
33:28
but it's so sexy
33:32
no no matter how sexy it is anna you
33:34
mustn't do it
33:36
don't worry that she said when i when i
33:38
pulled on it my nipple is stretched
33:40
sideways almost bringing me to tears
33:42
oh gosh wow i said weirdly um
33:45
the thing i remember from a while ago
33:46
reddit they've never done really any
33:48
advertising
33:49
properly except for one thing which is
33:52
they spent five hundred dollars and i
33:53
think this is in the whole history of
33:54
reddit
33:55
they spent five hundred dollars on
33:56
promotional stickers okay it's the only
33:59
advertising they've ever done
34:00
yeah and put them sort of around yeah i
34:02
guess as well just on people's nipples
34:04
yeah and they're still there to this day
34:06
so it's very well spent advertising
34:08
money actually
34:09
if you want to get sperm from a bee it's
34:10
really difficult right
34:12
because they're quite small they don't
34:14
make much sperm
34:16
and presumably if you are trying to
34:17
force them out would be it will try to
34:18
sting you
34:19
probably will yeah so um what you do is
34:21
you pick up your little drone b
34:23
and then you um squeeze its abdominal
34:25
muscles to mimic a natural mating
34:28
event uh and then the pressure exposes
34:31
the um bee's penis
34:36
venus and the little speck of semen
34:38
comes out
34:39
and you have to do it loads of times
34:40
because obviously you need lots
34:42
lots of lots of semen right if you're
34:45
gonna use it
34:46
you don't just want one little speck you
34:48
need lots of specs but the problem is
34:50
that just
34:51
like in real life if a drone has sex it
34:54
immediately dies
34:56
and this is what happens to these bees
34:57
as well they get they
34:59
they basically go to the sperm donors
35:01
bank and
35:02
never come back oh wow
35:05
that's a very that's a that's an even
35:07
worse environment than the normal human
35:09
donation places if you have to go into a
35:10
room full of corpses of previous donors
35:14
i'm sorry so is this not what you're
35:15
into
35:19
so i i've read a whole thing about sort
35:22
of toy logistics these days and it's a
35:24
nightmare for toy shop owners
35:26
who as soon as a craze comes in they
35:28
have to basically buy quick and sell
35:30
quick and then they don't know what the
35:32
next thing is going to be so you can't
35:33
stock up you can't really pre-plan it
35:36
so it's um it's it's it's a real pain
35:38
yeah they have like a toy fair every
35:40
year don't they or they have a few of
35:42
them where
35:42
everyone says this is going to be the
35:44
next big thing this is going to be the
35:45
next big thing
35:46
but who knows what it's going to be it's
35:48
yeah it's quite exciting really
35:50
yeah but it's it's the opposite of what
35:52
the beanie baby people did
35:53
oh yeah where do you remember they
35:55
deliberately restricted supply
35:57
um did that yeah yeah cause that was
35:59
that was our fidget spinner really
36:00
wasn't it the beanie baby that was our
36:01
greatest
36:02
i was too old for that oh no you were
36:04
the spinning top obviously but um
36:07
i was the i was the wheel of the stick
36:11
i used to run down those streets in
36:13
lancashire rolling my
36:15
wheel um
36:18
so they basically had loads of beanie
36:19
babies but they said we're only going to
36:21
sell
36:22
this many of them so that they work
36:25
this toy shop owner she said that um
36:27
normally
36:28
toy sales reps come into your store and
36:30
they try and sell you as
36:31
they say please buy as many units as you
36:33
can the beanie babies reps would come in
36:35
and you'd say please i need a beanie
36:36
baby elephant to sell to my clients and
36:38
they'd say
36:39
no and it was really nice it was their
36:42
way of
36:42
it was basically like the diamond cartel
36:44
they were just driving up demand as much
36:46
as they could and it really worked
36:47
that's that's ballsy isn't it yeah yeah
36:50
yeah yeah
36:51
so clever it was the other days of kind
36:53
of using technology to spy on these
36:54
shopkeepers basically because the beanie
36:56
baby makers
36:57
would keep exact records of precisely
36:59
what beanie babies they'd been selling
37:01
and
37:01
how well they'd been doing it and they
37:03
would confiscate various beanie babies
37:05
from them if they weren't doing it very
37:06
well
37:07
and they wouldn't let big shops like
37:08
toys r us or walmart stock them because
37:10
they didn't want to invalidate the brand
37:13
and it sounded bizarre and the only way
37:15
you could get them
37:16
was to call a sales rep and then have a
37:18
conversation with the sales rep and sort
37:20
of reveal
37:20
secrets about what the kids in your shop
37:22
were saying about what beanie babies
37:24
they liked and stuff
37:25
so they could get the inside scoop wow
37:28
it's no wonder you millennials are so
37:30
up
37:34
there was a 1904 carousel up for auction
37:38
very beautiful uh there was a park in
37:40
klee thorpes uh
37:42
selling it pleasure island it was called
37:44
and um
37:45
there were no bids and the reserve price
37:47
was 180 000 pounds because obviously
37:48
it's a huge
37:49
you know complicated beautiful bit of
37:51
machinery and then just before
37:53
bidding clothes there was one bid um for
37:56
180 000 pounds
37:58
and it was sold and the the owners must
38:01
have thought oh thank goodness we've
38:02
managed to sell this uh carousel
38:04
and it turns out it was from a
38:06
lincolnshire man who had been trying to
38:08
close the window
38:09
and accidentally pressed bid
38:15
and he had legally
38:18
with fees for 245 000 pounds
38:22
is there no safety net i think for that
38:25
well
38:26
i still point fingers as they pointed
38:28
out the bid button is in the middle of
38:29
the screen not the top
38:31
corner where like they hadn't put bid
38:33
next to the x or anything like that
38:35
um eventually they let him off the hook
38:38
and they did not
38:39
force him to spend his entire life
38:40
savings
38:42
on the carousel thank god that's fair
38:44
enough given that i get you know if i'm
38:46
on the most irrelevant website and
38:47
trying to
38:47
leave it it'll say are you sure you want
38:49
to leave this site
38:50
i think at the very least they should
38:52
have that box pop up yeah are you sure
38:54
you want to spend a quarter of a million
38:55
pounds on another carousel
38:58
actually no so funny i was trying to
39:00
find out how you fit that many clowns in
39:02
a car
39:03
it turns out it's very simple you just
39:05
get a car and you remove
39:06
everything literally everything from it
39:09
um
39:10
you know seats and um what else is in a
39:13
car
39:14
ashtray the steering wheel ashtray i
39:16
think you keep the steering wheel you
39:17
keep one or two things but then
39:19
at the record oh and you have to fortify
39:21
the springs as well because it's
39:23
normally a reasonably small car
39:24
for comedy purposes um and the record
39:28
for the number of clowns in the car is
39:29
31 in a citroen
39:31
2cv which is quite a small car yeah that
39:34
is
39:35
not socially distancing no
39:38
it's the opposite were they children
39:41
or were they no they're nice they were i
39:44
believe
39:44
human adult clowns it feels like that's
39:47
too many
39:48
um as in if i had to guess how many
39:50
clowns you could get in a citroen
39:52
i would have gone way under like way way
39:54
way but that's
39:55
well i think that's why it's a world
39:56
record i think um no i do see that
39:59
but it's i would have thought that the
40:01
world record would be just a little bit
40:03
more than i could possibly imagine but
40:04
this is a lot harder
40:06
to possibly imagine very thin clowns
40:09
yeah
40:10
have you guys heard of the great corn
40:12
cob fire
40:13
no of 1958. oh the 1915 no no yeah of
40:17
course
40:18
yeah okay this was in memphis tennessee
40:21
and um
40:22
the quakers quakers quaker oats the firm
40:25
they used corn cobs at the time to get a
40:27
particular chemical
40:28
um and they had a stockpile at their
40:31
plant of 70
40:33
000 tons of corn cobs okay wow imagine
40:36
the size of that it was six stories high
40:38
um and people noticed in 1958 oh the
40:41
the pile of corn cobs is really
40:43
smoldering a lot
40:44
and it burst into flames it's
40:46
spontaneously combusted because the heat
40:48
had been generated inside it
40:49
and even so this huge massive corn cob
40:52
fire
40:53
and even worse as it burned it formed a
40:55
kind of
40:56
shell over its surface it kind of
40:58
crusted over
40:59
with this chemical which could not which
41:02
reflected the water back onto the
41:03
firefighters basically
41:04
they had to use bulldozers to crash into
41:08
this massive part of it just to inject
41:10
the water through this weird surface
41:12
that have formed
41:12
syringe it through basically yeah i know
41:15
i want to see the
41:16
tv you know the tv show chernobyl very
41:19
good
41:20
show i want to see the sequel which is
41:21
about this
41:23
because it seems like it's almost as
41:24
exciting right noble
41:26
[Laughter]
41:28
corn cobble gobble there you go it's
41:34
good that you showed us you're working
41:35
for that joke yeah
41:36
thanks i have a historical use of luffas
41:40
which may have changed the course of the
41:41
second world war wow so
41:44
a loofah was used in the second world
41:45
war to convince churchill of a point
41:48
okay so he was in a boat
41:51
uh in 1943 he was sailing to
41:54
america to discuss war strategy with
41:56
president roosevelt right
41:57
and this was in the planning of d-day
42:00
and there was one thing they used in
42:02
d-day which were called these mulberry
42:03
harbors
42:04
and they basically were large floating
42:05
platforms that were slightly out at sea
42:08
and if you had those out at sea then ins
42:10
you know
42:11
it closer to shore the waters would be
42:13
calm so that was incredibly useful for
42:14
landing troops because it means you
42:15
don't have to have choppy waters while
42:17
you're trying to get troops on shore
42:18
so churchill was in the bath on this
42:21
ship in the atlantic
42:22
and his scientific advisor professor
42:24
john bernal was trying to teach him
42:26
about these mulberry harbors and he used
42:28
a loofah
42:29
as an example he put some paper boats in
42:31
churchill's bath with churchill in it
42:34
and then he stirred the water around and
42:35
he used the loofah to say look this is
42:37
if we had a giant loofah this is how we
42:39
protect our ships
42:40
and that was how the luffa helped to win
42:42
the war basically
42:44
wow and that's why at d-day they also
42:46
had those massive rubber ducks on either
42:48
side of it as well
42:49
[Laughter]
42:53
but i would i would hope as prime
42:55
minister of the united kingdom you could
42:56
have a birth in peace
42:58
that people no church hill churchill was
43:00
famous
43:01
for it wasn't he yeah yeah it's
43:03
interesting because now i think it would
43:05
be
43:06
like now it's a charming eccentricity to
43:08
look back on churchill having a bath and
43:09
having scientific
43:10
advice in the bath but if we heard that
43:12
boris johnson or donald trump are having
43:14
meetings in the bar we would be
43:15
completely unsurprised
43:18
um you know uh drafts yes
43:22
yeah draft it turns out has been solved
43:26
okay there is now there is now there is
43:28
now no point in playing drafts because
43:29
there is a correct way
43:31
to play it and this was worked out by a
43:34
computer games expert called jonathan
43:36
schaefer at the university of alberta
43:38
uh he set computers he set a number of
43:42
computers playing it
43:43
at the peak of his work there were 200
43:45
desktop computers which he had playing
43:47
drafts full time
43:49
to work out the combinations and how to
43:51
play
43:52
wow imagine how annoying that would be
43:55
if you were trying to get a computer at
43:56
the university of alberta
43:58
and all of jonathan's 200 machines were
44:01
playing trump
44:04
and it's not like he's saving lives is
44:06
it you know when he explains to you why
44:07
you can't
44:08
use it which one is soul shaft
44:12
um but it turns out that there are
44:15
10 to the 20 sorry there are 10 to the
44:17
power of 20
44:18
different positions for the game okay
44:21
and even if there are fewer than 10
44:23
pieces on the board at the end there are
44:24
still
44:24
39 trillion end game positions which are
44:27
possible
44:28
so there's quite a lot of numbers to
44:30
crush yeah exactly so you say that it's
44:32
solved andy but
44:33
unless you and i are playing and we both
44:35
have 50 computers
44:37
telling us what to do each time and
44:39
we're willing to wait for about six
44:40
hours between each move then presumably
44:44
that's how i play all my games it's a
44:46
game of attrition
44:49
earwigs do have this really unfortunate
44:51
uh
44:52
not predator parasite really that i was
44:55
reading about
44:56
and it's the i found this out because
44:58
there's a guy called ryan herbison who's
45:00
a researcher who collected 1300 earwigs
45:03
to investigate it which i
45:04
think it must be so weird he was just
45:06
wandering along a beach collecting
45:07
earwigs
45:08
and he's looking out for these things
45:09
called myrmethids and they're just one
45:11
of those parasites that takes over your
45:12
brain we've talked about this kind of
45:14
thing before but i always find them
45:15
incredible
45:16
so this is so he collected all these
45:18
earwigs opened up their brains
45:20
and found mermathids inside lots of them
45:22
and what they do is they make them
45:24
hydrotaxic as in they make them want to
45:26
go to water they won't want to go to
45:28
get wet or they make them act really
45:30
erratically so they hop around until
45:32
they see a pond and then jump in it
45:34
and they can't swim so they immediately
45:36
drown and then
45:38
that's perfect because this parasites
45:40
little babies are aquatic
45:41
and so then they can swim they turn them
45:44
into water lovers
45:46
i just i find it amazing that these
45:47
things exist that control the minds of
45:49
so many animals
45:50
yeah yeah that's wicked they also do
45:53
this really cool thing where
45:54
they uh can stop predators um from
45:57
getting a taste for
45:58
them and their family by once when
46:01
they're being eaten let's say by
46:03
a lizard they vomit inside them
46:06
as they're being eaten so they vomit
46:08
inside the lizard into the lizard's
46:10
mouth and they
46:10
release a smell which is like rotting
46:13
flesh
46:14
which the lizard hates because i i
46:16
usually when i think of animals i just
46:18
think they don't
46:19
they don't care about the taste of
46:20
things right they just it's it's about
46:22
food
46:23
it's all yucky like they don't have
46:26
taste buds uh
46:28
but apparently they must have a whole
46:30
series of weird revelations there about
46:32
your
46:32
preconceptions but sure i just think a
46:35
lizard will just eat
46:36
whatever right but this will actively
46:38
once they release this
46:39
um this vile smelling toxic uh
46:43
into the mouth of the lizard the lizard
46:44
will not only spit them out
46:46
but it will spend time afterwards going
46:48
and trying to wipe away
46:50
this thing from their mouth and the idea
46:52
is that i'm not sure
46:53
if the earwig will survive the one
46:56
that's been chewed
46:57
or if that's i think it's more about
46:59
passing on the distaste
47:01
to never want to eat an earwig again for
47:03
the future lizards
47:04
uh or that one lizard so sacrificing
47:07
yourself for the sake of the clan like
47:09
bruce willis and armageddon
47:10
exactly yeah it's a lot oh anna stop
47:13
spoiling films for james
47:15
i'm sorry don't listen james i wasn't i
47:18
wasn't
47:20
um that's wow that is amazing do you you
47:23
know
47:23
dan you um live with a dog at the moment
47:25
no um anymore
47:27
oh really because i was gonna say when
47:28
you give it dog food do you just think
47:30
it it'll eat any old
47:32
doesn't have any taste buds i was
47:34
thinking more like lizards
47:35
rather than i don't think like when i
47:37
feed my son i think he's young it
47:39
he hasn't got
47:40
taste buds yeah it's more he's got more
47:42
yeah dan he's got three times as many as
47:44
you
47:45
ah yeah i'll stop feeding him dog food
47:48
okay just what we're talking about spain
47:50
spain obviously has that big christmas
47:52
lottery which is el gordo
47:54
uh the fat one and it's the big big
47:56
prize
47:57
did you guys read that in 2011 it was
48:00
one
48:00
um and it's you know people win it um
48:03
but this one town
48:04
in spain called sadetto every single
48:08
resident there the 70 households won
48:10
this lottery
48:12
um and the thing is is that the way they
48:14
do it is sometimes these towns club
48:16
together and they buy this big
48:17
they buy the one lottery ticket and then
48:19
they go around to each house and they
48:21
say do you want to be
48:22
a participant in this so you get a
48:23
participation ticket so
48:25
this entire town did it of 70 households
48:28
which was over 200 people
48:29
they all won the lottery except one guy
48:33
because they forgot to knock on his door
48:35
oh wow surely they shared it with him
48:38
they didn't no they didn't and he um he
48:41
had moved to the town
48:42
because he was in love with this girl it
48:43
didn't work so he decided to stay
48:46
so he was renovating in this new place
48:48
and
48:49
the people who went around selling the
48:50
tickets just didn't think to
48:52
go and sell him a ticket so he remembers
48:54
waking up on the day and he's a
48:56
cinematographer he
48:57
he does a lot of filming and everyone
48:59
was on the streets running around i have
49:01
no idea why they were in their
49:02
socks running out of cafes because
49:04
they'd all just heard the news and he
49:05
filmed it all he filmed the joy
49:07
but behind that camera is the one man
49:10
who didn't get any of the benefits from
49:12
that is so um
49:13
and they want a huge amount like if you
49:15
if you paid in lower amounts
49:17
the the least that was earned by someone
49:20
who got some money was around
49:22
a hundred thousand american dollars that
49:24
was like the lowest
49:25
on it um so as a result one once the
49:28
news came out
49:29
all of these business people descended
49:32
on the town trying to sell them b and w
49:34
cars business managers came in and the
49:37
whole town now
49:37
there's people on the way home having to
49:39
hide as they leave the cafe because they
49:41
can see that really persistent bank
49:43
manager sitting in his car
49:44
looking for more residents to sign up so
49:47
it's kind of turned into a hell hole for
49:48
a lot of them so really the one guy who
49:50
didn't win
49:51
is laughing in everyone else's faces
49:52
because he can just say to those
49:54
hasslers mate i'm the one that didn't
49:55
win it
49:56
i've got nothing for you um
49:59
just one more thing on hangovers i found
50:01
a survey
50:02
uh by i think it was a rehab website
50:05
about of it was a survey of a thousand
50:07
drinkers about what they would do
50:08
to avoid a hangover like what sacrifices
50:10
they would make to never have a hangover
50:12
again
50:13
okay so i just want to run these past
50:15
you and see if you'd agree
50:16
um so a third of people said they would
50:18
pay more for their drinks if it meant
50:19
they would never have a hangover
50:21
yeah okay yeah okay depends how much
50:23
more but yeah if you can afford it
50:26
um about a third said they would give up
50:28
watching sports
50:29
forever oh gosh no
50:33
i'm finding the last few weeks quite
50:35
hard so um
50:36
probably wouldn't do that okay it was it
50:39
was way more women than men so they
50:41
would give up watching sports
50:43
forever um they so two percent of women
50:46
said they would give up sex for the rest
50:48
of their lives
50:49
um zero percent of men said they would
50:52
give up sex forever to avoid hanging out
50:54
yeah
50:54
um standard some of them get a bit dark
50:57
so
50:57
um sacrificing a stranger's life um
51:01
nine percent of men said yes nine
51:03
percent
51:06
giving up a fingertip six percent of men
51:08
three percent of women
51:09
allegedly six percent of men and one
51:12
percent of women
51:13
would kill their pets to avoid hangovers
51:16
if you've got pet
51:16
crickets or something then that actually
51:19
isn't
51:20
yeah i wouldn't give up cricket but i
51:23
would give up crickets
51:24
hey do you guys know the first reference
51:28
to her of the dog
51:29
i was really surprised by this oh no um
51:31
the bible
51:32
it's actually from even pre-bible it's
51:34
400 b.c
51:36
it's in a um recommendation by a guy
51:40
called antiphonys
51:41
who was recommending basically
51:43
homeopathic treatments which is sort of
51:44
what hair of the dog is it's sort of
51:46
like a little bit of the thing that
51:47
makes you ill
51:49
and he says take the head so this is
51:51
translated from the greek
51:52
and made nice and poetic but take the
51:54
hair it is well written
51:56
of the dog by which you're bitten work
51:59
off one wine with his brother work off
52:01
one label with another
52:03
it works to an extent actually hair of
52:05
the dog first of all it obviously makes
52:06
you feel better because you're getting a
52:07
bit drunk again
52:08
so we all know that kind of works but
52:10
they think now it works because of
52:12
something we've discussed before
52:14
dan remember that fact you had where
52:15
they cured that guy of alcohol poisoning
52:17
by feeding him beer
52:18
yes it's because of the methanol so all
52:22
alcoholic drinks contain tiny amounts of
52:23
methanol and they think that might be
52:25
a large part of what's making you feel
52:27
bad with a hangover and if you drink
52:29
more alcohol then the ethanol in that
52:31
actually uh is is digested before the
52:34
methanol
52:34
so the methanol stops making you feel
52:36
bad so keep it up
52:39
okay is that what we're saying is that
52:42
our official advice
52:45
yeah please don't sue me uh when you get
52:48
liver failure
52:49
uh i was looking up to some other
52:51
museums in croatia
52:53
um we've spoken before i think about the
52:56
museum of broken relationships that's
52:58
quite a famous one
53:00
but i've never seen this one it's called
53:02
froggy land and it's in split
53:04
and this is a collection of 507 stuffed
53:07
frogs
53:08
that were made by a very very skilled
53:11
taxidermist from croatia called ference
53:13
mere
53:15
and he used a very clever system where
53:17
he
53:18
goes through the animal's mouth rather
53:20
than cutting it open so you don't end up
53:23
with any scars
53:24
on the taxidermied animal
53:27
and then he got the frogs and he put
53:29
them in sort of like
53:30
settings so um there's one in a
53:32
blacksmith shop
53:34
there's one in a carpenter's shop
53:35
there's one in a school
53:37
there's some in the circus like lots of
53:39
different
53:40
modes of life just recreated with
53:43
stuffed frogs
53:44
so cool wow it's funny because it feels
53:46
like he might also be a candidate for
53:48
the museum of broken relationships
53:53
but yeah froggy land it's um it gets 4.5
53:57
stars on trip advisor
53:59
lots of reviews lots of good reviews i
54:01
only read the bad ones of course
54:04
the frogs were very small and not very
54:06
appealing
54:09
another person this place is an
54:11
abomination for frog lovers
54:13
don't go here if you love frogs like me
54:16
i love frogs
54:18
you should have seen that coming surely
54:19
if you're a frog lover going to a place
54:21
full of dead frogs
54:25
and another person said okay okay
54:28
this guy gave a lot of time and effort
54:30
to make these frogs but still
54:32
it is weird and creepy yeah
54:35
but then the people who made the museum
54:37
replied with anna's exact point
54:39
we don't understand why someone who has
54:41
that kind of opinion would even decide
54:43
to come in here
54:45
it's like you're doing it deliberately
54:46
so you can complain guys we don't like
54:48
dead frogs
54:49
don't go to the dead frogs museum
54:52
anyway it's in split
54:57
do you think someone tested the
54:58
temperature of cleopatra's milk bath by
55:00
dipping their elbow into it
55:03
[Music]
55:04
now that is a joke about how you test
55:06
the temperature of a baby's
55:08
yeah milk isn't it oh no it's how you
55:11
test a baby's bath water sorry yeah how
55:13
do you test the milk though
55:15
um it's hard to get your elbow into the
55:17
bottle isn't it yeah right
55:18
do you have it yourself you i think you
55:21
drip little bits from the bottle on the
55:23
back of your hand don't you
55:24
like this i think you just presumably
55:26
you just trust that the milk you're
55:27
producing from your breasts
55:28
is not either boiling hot
55:35
that's yeah i mean some mothers are like
55:37
yellowstone national park
55:39
firing out 120 degrees
55:43
can be very damaging
55:46
they had the sacred blades which and
55:50
this is a slight
55:51
content warning here sacred obsidian
55:53
blades
55:54
which their kings would use to cut their
55:56
penises with
55:57
oh yeah okay yeah is that so they could
55:59
bleed them
56:00
yeah what were they doing which bet they
56:02
could they're not quitting the whole
56:03
thing
56:04
were they not they weren't cutting the
56:06
whole thing off great news but they were
56:07
cutting
56:08
i mean it's all certain decisions it's
56:09
all sensitive no they were just sort of
56:11
well they did a bit on on their
56:12
foreskins yeah but a bit on other parts
56:14
you know the victorians had special like
56:17
mini swords that they used to cut
56:19
karnoff corn on the cubs it just
56:22
i don't know what made you think of that
56:27
i think it was bleeding wasn't it that
56:29
as in they used to sacrifice their blood
56:31
so that this is a ritual thing that they
56:33
had to do is they would have to cut
56:35
their tongues and ears and genitals and
56:36
stuff
56:37
and then pull lots of blood out of them
56:39
to give to the gods i think
56:40
then you would leave the blade somewhere
56:42
and so researchers have found a load of
56:44
uh these obsidian blades and it's very
56:47
hard to tell which of the blades there
56:48
were sacrificial
56:50
because as they put it the degree of
56:52
wear imposed on a blade used only on one
56:54
occasion to slice open a penis is very
56:56
little indeed the
56:58
the knife is much less damaged yeah so
57:01
the researchers
57:02
again had to have a go at this and they
57:05
studied multiple blades
57:07
well they didn't know the scientists
57:08
didn't get their own cuts
57:11
they they they tried it on some chicken
57:13
instead they tried other people's
57:15
hey um and and they studied multiple
57:18
blades and they think that is giving
57:19
them
57:19
a sign of which blades were used that's
57:21
really interesting because
57:23
like exactly what you're saying the way
57:25
you work out how a blade was used is by
57:27
looking at the
57:28
dents in it don't you like there was a
57:30
recent study about some bronze age
57:32
swords about whether they were
57:33
purely decorative or whether they're
57:35
used in fighting and they can tell by
57:36
how they hit
57:37
each other and how they dent but if
57:39
you're only using it for
57:41
for one of the slicing of a penis then
57:43
yeah you're not going to get that
57:44
information
57:45
yeah the wear and tear on the penis is
57:47
definitely
57:48
more isn't it yes
57:52
than than a knife um
57:55
just to go back to their gods some other
57:57
fun gods
57:58
oh yeah they they were quite into
58:00
flatulence and smelling well so sorry
58:02
anna just um
58:03
this is a terrible joke that i'm just
58:05
about to make
58:07
and see if we can put it in but you say
58:10
that the the the the damage on the penis
58:14
is
58:14
worse but then of course the penis
58:17
mightier than the sword
58:19
oh wow jesus oh wow
58:24
i'm so glad i'm so glad that it's real
58:27
i'm glad you got that out definitely
58:29
worth it
58:30
it's going in isn't it it's coming in i
58:32
can't wait to hear it
58:37
[Laughter]
58:45
okay that's it that's all of our facts
58:47
um thank you so much for listening uh
58:49
what does dan usually say here oh it
58:51
doesn't matter because it's not a
58:52
normal show all we want to do is remind
58:54
you that to give some money to the care
58:57
workers charity they would really really
58:59
appreciate it
59:00
if you could spare anything and so would
59:02
we and to donate go to
59:04
qi.com donate or
59:07
justgiving.com n s
59:10
t a a f off with the show
59:13
i've always wanted to say that i've
59:14
never had a chance before it feels like
59:16
i can now dance away wow if that doesn't
59:18
make you want to donate to this charity
59:20
i don't know what will

[Music]

[Applause]
00:10
[Music]
00:14
hello and welcome to another working
00:16
from home episode of no such thing as a
00:18
fish a weekly podcast coming to you from
00:21
four
00:21
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
00:24
is dan schreiber i am sitting here with
00:26
james harkin
00:27
andrew hunter murray anna tyzinski and
00:30
once again we have gathered around the
00:31
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:33
from the last seven days
00:34
and in a particular order here we go
00:38
starting with you andy my fact is that
00:41
spies can tell what people are saying by
00:43
looking at the lights
00:44
in the room they're in so this is a new
00:47
spying technique which has been
00:50
discovered
00:51
or i don't know what you do with spying
00:53
techniques but it's been found out
00:54
by researchers from uh the ben gurion
00:58
university of the negev and the weizmann
01:00
institute of science
01:01
and they've what they've found is that
01:02
there are lots of different ways of
01:04
eavesdropping on people and this one is
01:07
called
01:07
lam phone and what it means is if we're
01:10
all talking in our rooms
01:11
if there's a light bulb and has to be a
01:13
hanging light bulb so you know a classic
01:15
bulb
01:16
um your conversation will make tiny tiny
01:18
vibrations
01:19
on the surface and that will slightly
01:21
affect the light inside the bulb
01:23
and you can get very cheap equipment
01:25
like costs a couple of hundred dollars
01:27
and you just observe the light bulb from
01:28
outside the room and you can pick up
01:30
what people are talking about
01:32
uh you can decode new beaches yeah so
01:35
you can
01:35
is it it's not like morse it's not
01:37
translating into more so you can pick up
01:39
the actual
01:40
sound well i think it has to be
01:42
translated from
01:43
light bulb language into sound but
01:47
it is like so it is light bulb language
01:49
yeah but they can they can even you can
01:50
shazam the song that someone is playing
01:52
in a room that's how
01:54
yeah it's amazing isn't it and they they
01:56
reckon that um
01:57
they took a snippet of a speech by
02:00
donald trump
02:01
and they could understand what he was
02:02
saying which is quite impressive because
02:03
most people can't understand like
02:08
we do a like light bulb episode of fish
02:10
that we just release in light bulb
02:11
language and
02:12
people can decode down the line yeah
02:14
good idea yeah that won't present any
02:16
technical problem it's hard enough doing
02:17
it on zoom then
02:20
is this do they use lasers for this to
02:22
uh reflect because you can't just pin
02:24
your ear to the window and listen to the
02:25
vibrations coming off the light bulb or
02:27
anything presumably
02:28
do they bounce as it lays as they bounce
02:30
off it yeah it's some invisible lasers
02:32
so you won't notice a kind of sniper dot
02:34
on your light bulb so you won't be able
02:35
to tell you're being spied on what it is
02:36
actually
02:37
i believe not a laser i think i think
02:40
it's just a telescope
02:42
so you get the light and an electro
02:44
optical sensor
02:45
now that might have a laser in it for
02:46
all i know but i
02:48
think what it is it takes the light in
02:50
and it can
02:51
sense the very very slight changes in
02:53
light can i just say why i flubbed that
02:55
it's because there's a separate thing
02:56
called a laser microphone
02:58
okay this was used this is where you
03:02
spike you fire a laser at the windows of
03:04
a room
03:05
and you can eavesdrop that way and this
03:08
was used in 2013 in a place called a
03:10
bottle bed and it was used to
03:12
find out that there was an extra person
03:14
inside a building in a bottom bed
03:16
and that extra person who never left the
03:18
building turned out to be osama bin
03:19
laden
03:20
wow so that's how they found out there
03:22
was an extra person inside that building
03:24
who never went outside
03:25
do you know who invented this this laser
03:28
no
03:29
it was leon theremin the inventor of the
03:32
theremin
03:34
that instrument do the noise again
03:37
[Music]
03:39
you should explain what the theremin is
03:41
as well as doing that excellent
03:42
impersonation i think we have mentioned
03:44
it before
03:44
yeah so theremins are you will have seen
03:46
them possibly um
03:48
as an instrument that i don't i actually
03:50
don't know how they work technically
03:51
they give off electromagnetic
03:53
waves don't they and your um hand can
03:56
disrupt them and they make a noise
03:57
yeah so people use their hand if you see
03:59
them sort of pushing forward and
04:01
backwards their hand it will sort of
04:03
make that yeah it's basically a ghost
04:05
impression is what it sounds like
04:08
so leon theremin invented what basically
04:10
was the precursor to the modern laser
04:12
microphone that we have today and it was
04:14
used by
04:15
uh the soviet union um and he was given
04:18
a stalin prize for inventing this
04:20
what was advanced espionage technology
04:22
so
04:23
so theremin found osama bin laden
04:27
wow that's amazing that's sort of spooky
04:30
[Laughter]
04:33
the other thing that theremin did really
04:35
interestingly was
04:36
he had invented basically like the
04:39
technology you have on contactless
04:41
credit cards
04:42
he put one of those in a giant wooden
04:45
seal
04:46
and when i say seal i don't mean the
04:47
animal i mean like
04:49
kind of a symbol of the united states
04:51
and then gave it to the u.s
04:53
embassy somewhere i think and they had
04:55
it up in their room but what they didn't
04:57
realize
04:58
is there was a tiny chip in there and
05:00
that they could hear what was happening
05:01
by
05:02
um using this contactless technology i
05:04
think yep yeah you're completely right
05:06
they didn't have to go up to the seal
05:08
the soviets didn't have to go up to the
05:09
seal and then sort of tap
05:10
on it and get the sound files out but
05:12
they sort of fired
05:14
uh electromagnetic beams at it didn't
05:16
they and that
05:17
activated it just like your oyster card
05:19
is activated by the ticket stand
05:20
it was called the thing the thing that's
05:23
what it's called
05:24
yeah what's called the thing um soviet
05:26
school children gave it to the us
05:27
embassy
05:28
in or the u.s ambassador in 1945 and
05:30
they managed to get seven years of
05:32
espionage recording out of it wow
05:34
that's so cool how did they make sure
05:35
the u.s ambassador put it in the right
05:38
room it was so big i think that i had to
05:40
go on the wall somewhere
05:41
i don't think they could guarantee the
05:43
room but also it was completely made of
05:45
wood so they
05:45
they thought this is definitely safe
05:47
there's no way this is a spying tool
05:48
and the really clever thing about those
05:50
kind of chips that you have in your
05:51
credit card and in your ice card is
05:53
they don't need any power do they that
05:56
all the power comes from the thing
05:58
that's scanning them
05:59
um you know edward snowden yeah yeah
06:02
he has a secret device to stop himself
06:05
being spied on
06:06
which is a blanket over his head is that
06:09
what inspires you because you do that
06:10
sometimes when we record and i thought
06:12
it was just to embellish the ghost
06:14
impression that you've been honing
06:15
no it's just that's just social anxiety
06:17
but edward snowden
06:18
has um he calls it his magic mantle of
06:22
power
06:22
and basically it's to stop targeted
06:26
video surveillance because obviously if
06:27
you're edward snowden you know leaking
06:29
secrets there's a chance someone will be
06:30
trying to spawn you
06:31
so he just puts a blanket over his head
06:33
when he types his password in i remember
06:35
reading an article about was it glenn
06:37
greenwald who
06:37
who interviewed him yeah someone like
06:39
that and they said that whenever they
06:41
went into his hotel room or his house or
06:43
whatever they always
06:44
made you put your phone in the microwave
06:47
as soon as you walked in that was what
06:49
you always had to do
06:50
i think snowden makes people put it in
06:52
the refrigerator i'll just say
06:54
it's his yeah how does it work andy
06:55
though if he's put it over his head
06:57
yeah he's not gonna be able to see what
06:59
he's typing a but also it's just his
07:01
eyeballs and they're not seeing i reckon
07:03
edward snowden could touch type
07:04
[Laughter]
07:06
but still what what are they recording
07:08
his brain all of him
07:09
is under the blanket oh he's in a pool
07:11
case he's oh
07:13
you know well yeah he's got a blanket
07:15
over his head and his hands
07:16
basically it's in case there's someone
07:18
the camera in the room that would film
07:19
what he's typing
07:20
yeah yeah yeah and you've you've got to
07:22
assume that he's done the very basic
07:23
putting masking tape over the camera on
07:25
his laptop because if he's missed that
07:26
trick he's
07:27
absolutely love it actually you know
07:30
what they can tell
07:31
what you're typing by just listening to
07:33
the sound of your typing on your
07:34
keyboard
07:35
so um there are some researchers at
07:39
the university of california berkeley
07:42
uh actually it's doug tiger and his team
07:45
and they've worked out every time you
07:47
click a button it makes a very very
07:48
slightly different sound to the other
07:50
ones
07:50
but you can't really tell which one is
07:52
which but what you can do is you can
07:54
take all the clicks
07:55
and then work out the one that comes
07:57
most often is probably e
07:59
and if there are two letters together um
08:02
these researchers
08:03
they realize that it could be th or it
08:04
could be er
08:06
and it could definitely not be b f
08:08
because there are no words with b
08:10
f next to each other what the hell there
08:12
are what do i feel like
08:13
me and my bf are both hardcore exactly
08:16
if you if you are edward snowden here's
08:18
a little tip for him and these are this
08:20
little thought
08:21
and you want to trick the fbi just keep
08:23
writing about your bff
08:26
he's been a major sort of revealer of a
08:29
lot of these secrets that we've been
08:30
researching hasn't he
08:31
so um he a lot of stuff came out on the
08:34
back of his
08:34
revelations so i think for instance when
08:36
the guardian was doing their
08:37
investigation and they got hold of a lot
08:39
of the documents
08:40
they were told that they weren't allowed
08:41
to keep any of the edward snowden files
08:43
in their offices because the government
08:44
thought that they could be spied on by
08:46
laser microphones
08:47
just bouncing off their glasses of water
08:49
and stuff like that so it's not just the
08:51
windows
08:52
it's if you've got a mug of tea or
08:53
anything similar to that they could do
08:55
that
08:56
um and yeah he's in the wake of his
08:59
revelations a lot of countries took
09:01
action to make sure that the u.s or nsa
09:03
couldn't spy on them too much anymore so
09:06
germany for instance invested in a whole
09:08
bunch of typewriters
09:09
which i don't know if this would have
09:11
solved the typing
09:13
issue but the idea is that if you're
09:15
writing on a typewriter
09:16
there's no digital memory of it anywhere
09:19
you've just got it on a bit of paper in
09:20
that weird old-school
09:21
font and then i guess you just post it
09:24
to somebody but it is quite annoying if
09:26
you need to share a document with
09:28
20 other people i don't know what you do
09:31
but yeah and russia i think spent 10
09:33
grand on antique typewriters
09:35
after that really do any of you guys
09:38
have a typewriter i have one
09:39
and they're a pain to use compared with
09:42
a computer
09:43
yeah that's so annoying like they just
09:46
always get
09:46
stuck and whenever you make a mistake
09:48
you can't press delete
09:50
james why are you writing on a
09:51
typewriter that's a big question for me
09:54
well you know i'm married to a russian
09:56
[Laughter]
10:00
no i got i got one as a gift and i
10:02
really liked it and i thought i might
10:03
try typing on it but it's really a
10:05
[ __ ] night it seemed like a pain yeah
10:07
yeah
10:08
um it must be so annoying for all these
10:10
people who work in
10:11
spy centers coming up with new ways of
10:13
spying on people
10:14
that some dorky scientists are just
10:16
publishing these papers going oh we
10:18
found out that they must be reading
10:20
light bulbs like damn it that took me
10:22
years
10:24
i created the technology to read light
10:26
bulbs and now we're going to look for
10:28
something else what next
10:29
yeah because some people do that people
10:31
i think there's a company uh data
10:32
analysis company called polante
10:34
in the which is used by the us secret
10:36
service so they must know what they're
10:37
doing
10:38
and they have designed their windows to
10:40
have these things they call acoustic
10:42
transducers on them which basically if
10:45
you try to use the window vibrations it
10:47
just sends out white noise
10:48
or something maybe it sends out some
10:50
kind of haha prank to you
10:52
uh message to anyone brilliant
10:55
if you could hack your window to send
10:57
other messages
10:59
but i think isn't that why uh
11:01
governments would use neck curtains i
11:02
think that's why because that supposedly
11:04
dampened the um
11:05
vibrations so the other governments
11:08
which use neck curtains
11:09
because i associate them with suburbia
11:11
in the 1950s and you have to have an old
11:13
lady
11:14
peering around them and see what the
11:15
neighbors are doing um
11:17
you know these sopranos the the great tv
11:20
series the mobster
11:21
tv series so um it was so realistic
11:24
it was so on point for what would happen
11:28
in the real life of a mobster that
11:30
mobsters started thinking there must be
11:32
someone on the inside who is leaking
11:34
information um to the writers and
11:36
producers of the show
11:38
and we know that they had those
11:39
conversations because
11:41
the fbi were actually wiretapping the
11:43
mobsters who had that conversation and
11:45
fed that back to the writers and
11:47
producers
11:48
of the sopranos but they used to listen
11:50
into conversations of mobsters going
11:52
did you see the sopranos on sunday how
11:53
did they know that we do that kind of
11:55
thing come on dad you could have done a
11:57
better italian american accent than that
11:59
come on come on guys
12:05
what's happening no he couldn't turns
12:07
out
12:09
dan you sounded like a kiwi you sounded
12:11
new zealandish
12:12
yeah it was the opposite of being that's
12:15
a new jersey you're trying to get you
12:16
did new zealand
12:17
do you think new zealand is the opposite
12:19
of being in the sopranos because that
12:20
probably is quite close
12:22
a harmless pretty much is yeah yeah yeah
12:24
you're right
12:25
um john you know what you were saying
12:26
about um what is annoying that all these
12:28
secrets come out must be irritating if
12:30
you're in the secret service
12:31
so i have a suspicion that everything we
12:34
found out
12:34
is all just fake news that's subtly put
12:37
out by the cia or mi5 to throw us off
12:40
the scene
12:40
because it all it's just so much they
12:42
release like there's this
12:43
anna yeah sorry right by big lamp shade
12:47
could be them that could be a good point
12:50
the love shade company's trying to make
12:51
us buy lump shades
12:53
you're absolutely bang on or candle
12:55
james your 1950s house
12:58
you've got your neck curtains you've got
12:59
your big fringe lampshade
13:01
the typewriter's out
13:05
i am from murder she wrote jessica
13:08
fletcher whatever she's called
13:10
i'm sorry anna right um so big lampshade
13:13
or whoever it is has put out this fake
13:15
news
13:16
because this stuff that comes out is
13:18
amazing so there's a book called
13:19
spycraft
13:20
which came out in 2009 and it was
13:21
written by the head of the office of
13:23
technical service
13:25
which is the cia department that's
13:27
responsible for all of their gadgets
13:29
so it's written by this former head of
13:31
that and he just revealed this amazing
13:33
stuff but
13:34
it sounds so implausible so he said that
13:36
they used to when they met business
13:37
people
13:38
or politicians or diplomats they'd hand
13:40
out gifts
13:41
and they all the gifts would have like
13:43
devices placed in them so a bit like
13:45
this uh these school children but so
13:47
they'd hand out books or lighters or
13:49
flower pots
13:50
apparently so but you just think if
13:52
you're wait a minute
13:53
if you're gonna give a gift right don't
13:55
give a flower pot which they might put
13:57
outside
13:58
so you need to give them something that
13:59
will oh here's a milk bottle
14:01
as a gift you've got to give them
14:04
something that they'll definitely keep
14:05
in there
14:06
so right the only noise you get from
14:07
that is wind and then squirrels and
14:08
foxes
14:09
desperately digging through earth
14:12
i saw i saw an amazing video online just
14:14
while we're on the cia so the cia has a
14:16
chief of disguise
14:18
which i didn't know and the former chief
14:20
of disguise does this video she's called
14:23
johnna mendez and um it's amazing this
14:25
video is her sitting talking about
14:27
how you can slip into a disguise very
14:30
quickly or
14:31
the elaborate ways that they do it and
14:32
during the video she slowly goes into
14:34
different disguises so suddenly she's an
14:36
old man
14:37
and it's really incredible and she was
14:39
talking about a lot of the mythology of
14:41
cia disguise and what they do
14:42
particularly the mission impossible
14:44
movies with
14:45
wearing the sort of fake head and that's
14:48
not far from the truth of what they did
14:49
and there's this fantastic set of photos
14:51
when she went to meet george bush senior
14:53
to tell him about what they were up to
14:55
that she sat doing the whole meeting and
14:57
then near the end
14:58
rips off her mask and has a different
15:01
her real head
15:02
underneath and bush didn't notice the
15:04
entire time you can see these photos
15:06
highly recommend
15:07
but she didn't notice her ripping off
15:08
her own face no he saw that bit he
15:11
didn't just carry
15:12
on with the meeting i thought this was
15:14
late in the presidency where he wasn't
15:15
really paying attention anymore
15:17
no he didn't notice said she had a fake
15:19
head-on during the meeting i did not
15:20
found her suspicious that mrs doubtfire
15:22
wanted to have a meeting with him in the
15:23
first place
15:28
okay it is time for fact number two and
15:30
that is
15:31
james okay my fact this week is that
15:33
london bridge
15:34
was destroyed by a tornado in 1091.
15:39
what what like i can't believe i didn't
15:42
know this already
15:43
i thought why are they not teaching it
15:45
in schools why is it not a great movie
15:48
yeah this is this is incredible this
15:51
fact
15:51
this was one of the first london bridges
15:54
in fact probably the first one we 100
15:56
definitely know about
15:57
uh there will have been some before but
15:59
we're not quite sure what happened to
16:00
them
16:01
but it was william the conqueror he came
16:03
into london in 1066
16:05
and one of his first things that he did
16:06
when his army came in was they built a
16:08
new bridge over the river thames
16:10
and it was just 25 years later that was
16:12
completely demolished by a tornado
16:15
and we don't know much about it because
16:16
obviously people didn't write much down
16:18
in those days
16:19
but 12th century historian william of
16:21
malmsbury um says that it was completely
16:23
wrecked there were also
16:24
churches that were wrecked and there
16:26
were more than 600 houses that were
16:28
completely flattened
16:29
and we now think that it was what's
16:31
called an f4 tornado which is the second
16:34
strongest tornado you can get with
16:36
winter
16:36
200 miles an hour amazing is it how
16:40
did he call it a tornado at the time
16:42
i've just really i mean
16:43
did he call it a mighty wind or uh or
16:46
something else like that because
16:47
presumably they didn't have the word
16:48
then did they
16:49
it's such a good question they won't
16:51
have had the word
16:52
so that's yeah you answered your own
16:54
question
16:56
actually quite a bad question you knew
16:58
the answer you were wasting everyone's
16:59
time
17:00
i didn't know and only two people were
17:02
killed
17:03
apparently in this tornado that's good
17:05
that's so weird was no one in any of the
17:07
600 or whatever houses that were falling
17:09
down
17:10
it's so everyone's out at work it sounds
17:13
extraordinarily powerful so
17:14
the church of mary lebeau had 26 foot
17:18
high
17:19
rafters and apparently they were driven
17:21
so far into the earth by this tornado
17:24
that only four feet of them remained
17:25
above ground which i was thinking
17:28
because mary labo is a very famous
17:30
church in london for those people who
17:32
aren't londoners
17:33
because that's if you're born within the
17:35
sound of the bells of mary lebeau then
17:37
you are officially a cockney
17:38
and i'm guessing the bells weren't
17:41
functioning once it was driven into the
17:42
ground
17:43
so anyone born in that period couldn't
17:45
be a cockney that's incredible
17:46
how does that work that it shoved it
17:48
into the ground that's like a giant
17:50
screwdriver
17:52
yeah yeah i mean i'm just putting myself
17:54
in their place you know we don't know
17:55
what this thing was there was a giant
17:56
spinny screwdriver in the sky and
17:58
it's drilled some of our our big panels
18:01
into the ground
18:02
well that's that's when they change
18:03
traditional church architecture away
18:05
from the screwdriver design
18:06
um to less easy to drive into the ground
18:10
shape that just seems but that's a lot
18:12
that's 20 feet
18:13
to go into the ground london ground's
18:15
very swampy it's a lot
18:16
look they didn't have such good tarmac
18:18
then but the other thing
18:19
that's interesting is that i think the
18:21
london bridge that
18:23
would have been destroyed by this
18:23
tornado would have been way bigger than
18:26
modern london bridge
18:27
because the river was so much wider at
18:28
the time that's a good one
18:30
used to be about four or five times as
18:32
wide as it is today a lot of it's been
18:33
reclaimed so it would have been
18:34
absolutely enormous
18:36
yeah i did read about a potential um
18:38
precursor to this london bridge
18:40
which is is much debated but a lot of
18:44
serious journals do think it that sides
18:46
on the fact that it did exist
18:48
and it's off the back of something that
18:50
we know from nordic law
18:52
which was there was a period in 1014
18:55
when
18:56
um ethel the unready had been trying to
18:58
reclaim england
18:59
is ethel the already related to ethel
19:01
read the unready
19:03
it was his mum
19:06
yeah it was ethelrad sorry i said his
19:09
name wrong yeah
19:10
annoyingly this fact has so much english
19:12
history that i have to get to before i
19:14
can explain the basic thing
19:15
the basic thing is the danes were in
19:17
charge of london at that point
19:18
and london bridge was very much a spot
19:21
where they could arm
19:22
the whole thing with um people bows and
19:24
arrows for anyone who was coming down
19:25
the thames
19:26
and so there was a viking called olaf
19:29
who tied uh ropes underneath the bridge
19:33
and went underneath with the tide and
19:35
pulled london bridge down
19:37
forcing all the soldiers to die and
19:39
perish in the water as over 200 soldiers
19:42
um and helped for reclaiming england for
19:44
the british as opposed to the danes
19:47
and a poet called ottawa starved us did
19:50
a um
19:51
poem which was london bridges broken
19:53
down gold is one and bright
19:55
brionne there's more to it but that line
19:57
london bridge is broken down is thought
19:59
to have inspired london bridges falling
20:00
down
20:01
what's really interesting is about the
20:02
london bridges falling down thing which
20:04
is
20:05
a lot of people think that it might be
20:06
to do with that story but then on the
20:08
other hand
20:09
before that there were other songs
20:11
throughout the whole of europe
20:13
so you would have um dai magdeburger
20:16
brook
20:17
the magdeburg bridge in germany and it
20:19
was basically
20:20
exactly the same idea of a bridge that
20:22
would fall down
20:24
and a lot of nursery rhyme historians
20:27
think that what happened was this was
20:29
quite a common
20:30
kind of european song and then when it
20:32
came over to britain they just gave it
20:34
the name of the capital city's most
20:35
famous bridge
20:36
my uh my favorite version of the london
20:39
bridge was the one
20:40
that was there during shakespearean
20:42
times it just sounds like the most
20:44
fascinating
20:46
thing to have ever walked across it was
20:48
packed with houses
20:50
uh that were up to four stories high it
20:52
had restaurants on it
20:54
restaurants that when you went to them
20:56
the way you would order your food is you
20:58
would get
20:58
fish as a sandwich right and they would
21:00
open a trap door and they would put down
21:02
a fishing rod they would catch the fish
21:04
live
21:05
reel it up and then slap it raw in
21:08
between bread and give them
21:09
that no i mean what all right so many
21:12
questions like first worst restaurant
21:13
ever did you just get a raw food
21:16
it's sushi can i say second how are you
21:19
gonna guarantee if it's the thames
21:21
in the 16th century that you're not
21:22
gonna reel in a turd
21:24
bingo well that was that was the uh
21:27
exciting
21:27
element of your dining dynamics that's
21:30
the way the phrase comes from i'd rather
21:31
eat a [ __ ] sandwich
21:32
then what was it this restaurant and
21:35
third as we know the sandwich in this
21:37
country hadn't really been invented yet
21:38
so it doesn't make any sense they would
21:39
have reeled the fish up and had two bits
21:41
of bread and gone god we don't know how
21:42
to put these together
21:45
so why where have you read this stamp
21:47
this is amazing i read this
21:49
i read this in a book by dr matthew
21:50
green um a book
21:52
called london a travel guide through
21:54
time and this was a book that was
21:56
published by my wife
21:57
and it's the most fascinating chapter
21:59
because he
22:00
takes you back to the time so he has
22:01
someone walking across the bridge in
22:03
shakespearean times
22:04
uh it would take you two hours to to
22:06
walk the length of the entire bridge it
22:08
was so congested
22:09
and there's always a bit apparently
22:11
during the day where it came to a
22:12
standstill because you know how there
22:14
was a polar bear
22:15
tower um yeah at the um sorry what's it
22:18
called
22:19
at the tower of london that it was
22:21
during the hour when he would be taken
22:22
out to the thames to be fed that people
22:24
would stand
22:25
and just watch it would come to a
22:27
standstill because it was such a mad
22:28
thing that a polar bear would be fishing
22:30
for food
22:30
he'd be he'd be stealing sandwiches out
22:33
of the bounds of hungry clientele at the
22:34
restaurant as well
22:36
he's run off with my oh what's it called
22:38
the um that
22:40
polar bear wasn't there in shakespearean
22:42
times was he i thought he was like
22:44
13th century the latest i thought i
22:46
thought so but this is
22:48
this is the same bridge that i'm talking
22:50
about this is this is because it spanned
22:52
a long time in the 14th century
22:54
we know how many people were actually
22:55
living on it because we know
22:57
the number of rent that was collected
22:59
from properties so there were 198
23:01
buildings that were all providing
23:02
rental revenue from that period and this
23:05
and this was the
23:06
bridge if you talk about all the london
23:07
bridges of which there have been dozens
23:08
of iterations this was the one that
23:10
lasted what 600 years or whatever or
23:12
maybe maybe longer even
23:13
um but it was because of this that they
23:15
eventually dismantled that in the 1820s
23:17
because it was so congested
23:19
but it's also because it was the only
23:20
bridge it was it was literally the only
23:23
bridge across
23:23
central london until 1739 so it feels
23:27
weird for them to dismantle and build
23:28
another one where they could have just
23:29
built more bridges yeah true i was
23:32
reading account of the
23:34
dismantling and then they rebuilt it as
23:36
a wider more
23:37
useful bridge and the lane you know when
23:39
they lay the first stone of a building
23:40
or a bridge and there was his account in
23:42
the british newspaper archive it was
23:43
1925
23:45
and the lord mayor was invited to lay
23:47
the foundation stone
23:48
and i didn't understand the ritual at
23:49
all so basically he had a gold
23:51
trowel um with which he sort of
23:54
dug it up i guess and then he dropped
23:57
coins
23:58
into a box so there's a wooden box he
24:00
drops coins into a box which contains
24:02
four little glass pillars seven inches
24:04
high
24:05
a lid to put on the box and then the box
24:07
is covered in cement
24:09
and installed into a hole in the
24:11
foundation stone
24:13
and then that's dropped so if you went
24:15
to the bottom of london bridge now with
24:16
your
24:17
scuba gear and then you cut away into
24:19
some of the stones in one of them
24:21
there's this little box full of glass
24:23
pillars
24:24
and these coins isn't that weird cool
24:26
that's really cool
24:28
um i know what happened to the previous
24:29
foundation stone from the previous
24:31
bridge yeah so was that the anna was
24:33
that the 1831
24:34
yes version of london bridge that you
24:36
thought was okay so the previous one got
24:37
lots of it got sold off of souvenirs
24:40
um so there are bits of various british
24:42
country houses which are made of
24:43
old london bridge but the stone got
24:46
turned into a chair
24:47
the foundation stone in the base of a
24:49
chair where is the chair
24:50
yeah it's in fish hall which
24:54
is kind of the fishing guild the
24:56
fisherman's guild
24:57
and it's right by modern london bridge
24:59
now and it's
25:00
it's just a fancy chair basically that's
25:02
so sad for that stone so it's spent its
25:04
entire existence watching live fish
25:06
swimming happily around and now it's
25:08
condemned to this place full of dead
25:10
slaughtered fish
25:13
fisherman's bottom on him every now and
25:15
then
25:15
[Laughter]
25:17
we can't leave london bridge alone
25:18
without talking about what happened to
25:20
that new 1831 version which is now in
25:23
america
25:24
so the idea was that it was sold to an
25:26
american and he got [ __ ] right
25:28
that's oh well people claim that but he
25:30
insists he didn't and i suspect he
25:32
didn't but yeah basically it's
25:34
so lon that london bridge is now in
25:35
havasu which is in arizona because
25:37
uh this this crazy millionaire in it was
25:40
in 1968 wasn't it that it was put up for
25:43
sale
25:43
this millionaire in america bought it
25:45
and there's always been a rumor that he
25:46
meant to buy tower bridge
25:48
and got the wrong one but i think he
25:51
likes that because it drummed up even
25:52
more publicity
25:54
for the fact that he was moving london
25:56
bridge to the desert which everyone
25:58
thought was
25:58
insane it's amazing because they they
26:00
installed it in a dry bed of the desert
26:02
and then they redirected the nearby
26:03
stream to go under it so there is water
26:05
going under it now but the bridge was
26:07
put there before the water was
26:09
yeah it is quite weird to have to build
26:10
a river in order to satisfy a bridge
26:13
[Laughter]
26:16
but the the weird thing is that london
26:18
put the bridge on sale in 1968 it wasn't
26:21
like
26:21
some mad yosemite sam millionaire turns
26:24
up and says i want to buy that bridge it
26:26
was that london was trying to flog it
26:27
off
26:28
yeah but who do they think was going to
26:29
buy it probably someone with a river
26:31
so they were probably quite surprised
26:33
but this guy got it
26:36
they probably when he came over they
26:37
were like oh nice yeah what uh what
26:39
river are you gonna pull it over
26:42
no river forever all right okay um
26:46
it is worth saying um if this guy did
26:48
make the mistake of tower bridge
26:50
and london bridge that possibly a lot of
26:52
international listeners
26:53
uh listening to this episode right now
26:55
are making the very same mistake
26:56
the the almost iconic bridge that you've
26:59
pictured in your head
27:01
that's tower bridge that's one where
27:03
where it opens up in the middle
27:05
and it's got the huge two giant um i
27:08
don't know what you call them arches or
27:09
whatever
27:10
um that bridge the one you're thinking
27:11
of london bridge very dull
27:13
[Music]
27:15
it's terrible it's horrible um so you
27:18
can understand
27:19
it's just a road bridge isn't it it's
27:21
just just a
27:22
straight old bridge that an
27:24
unimaginative child might draw
27:28
exactly exactly um i did read an amazing
27:31
thing which was in 1952 this is a fact
27:34
about
27:34
tower bridge the the one that does open
27:36
up in the middle um
27:38
if you've ever seen the movie speed
27:40
where they have to jump the gap
27:42
of a bridge that happened on tower
27:44
bridge with a bus driver
27:45
in 1952 his name was albert gunter
27:49
and he was during december he was
27:51
driving the number 78 bus which goes
27:53
from shoreditch to dullich
27:55
and the person who would usually ring
27:57
the bell to say that the bridge was
27:59
going up forgot to ring it
28:01
and he noticed that the bridge was
28:04
bending upwards as he was driving
28:05
towards it and he didn't have enough
28:06
time to slam on the brakes because that
28:08
would have been disaster
28:09
so he hit the accelerator and he jumped
28:12
he jumped across now only his side had
28:15
lifted up and he jumped a six-foot drop
28:18
basically onto the northern side of the
28:20
bridge it's still a lot on a
28:22
massive bus exactly on a massive bus but
28:24
he yeah
28:25
someone jumped the gap of the bridge did
28:28
they remember
28:29
do they remember to put the sign over
28:30
the tunnel saying this bus is on
28:32
diversion
28:32
because that's not part of the planned
28:34
route
28:35
yeah he he so he was okay in the end he
28:37
broke his leg um
28:39
which was the only major problems and
28:42
12 of the 20 passengers had minor
28:44
injuries but so 21 people in total
28:46
all survived this big bridge jump and as
28:49
a reward he was given 10 pounds
28:51
which is about 290 pounds in today's
28:53
money and
28:54
uh a day off for his bravery right ah
28:57
that's enough time for a broken leg to
28:58
fully heal
29:02
okay so some stuff on tornadoes yeah
29:05
it's really
29:06
difficult to know when you read articles
29:08
about tornadoes what's real and what
29:10
isn't real
29:11
because they happen in the middle of the
29:12
countryside the only people who
29:15
see it are the people who are there at
29:16
the time and they often seem to come up
29:18
with
29:18
some stories that i don't know if
29:20
they're real or not
29:22
like so there's a story
29:25
um from the start of the 20th century i
29:27
think it was in kansas where there was a
29:29
man with a baby in his arms and the
29:30
tornado came and lifted the baby up and
29:32
deposited it in a tree
29:34
oh no which doesn't sound very true
29:38
but this apparently in 1976
29:41
um this one seems like it might have
29:43
been true it was in michigan there was a
29:45
tornado
29:46
and there was a house which was blown by
29:48
the tornado
29:49
so it went on to its side so people had
29:52
to use a ladder to get into the front
29:54
door
29:54
[Laughter]
29:58
well apart from the side thing it's
29:59
looking pretty good in here
30:04
but then there are some there are some
30:05
that are definitely not true like for
30:07
instance um
30:08
in this 1915 one in kansas there was a
30:11
story that an iron jug was blown inside
30:13
out
30:17
pretty sure that one isn't true
30:20
i read one as well years ago which was
30:22
there was a mystery of a scuba diver
30:25
found in a tree and he was fully he was
30:28
fully clothed no dan
30:29
no i know what you're doing what
30:32
are you doing the famous um mental brain
30:35
teaser
30:36
where they've been picked up by uh
30:37
they've been scuba diving and they've
30:39
been picked up by a helicopter that's
30:40
trying to put out a fire
30:41
was that a mental brain teaser yeah it
30:43
wasn't a real story
30:45
and thinks he's just come across an
30:47
amazing fact website
30:50
look at all these anecdotes
30:54
okay but the room was locked from the
30:56
inside there were no windows it was just
30:58
a puddle of water
31:00
the fish were called romeo and juliet
31:02
but the doctor
31:04
is his mother
31:10
okay it is time for fact number three
31:12
and that is my fact
31:13
my fact this week is that this year's
31:15
dutch national headwind championships
31:17
was cancelled during the race because it
31:19
was too windy
31:22
so this is a cycling championship that's
31:25
been going for the last six years and
31:26
the idea
31:27
is that they don't know when it's going
31:28
to happen they look out for storms
31:30
and as soon as i hear a massive storm is
31:32
on the way they give everyone three days
31:34
warning to say we're going to be doing
31:35
this race
31:36
and they have to go down this one strip
31:38
of 8.5 kilometers
31:40
and you just have to ride against the
31:42
wind and actually
31:43
it wasn't the cyclists who pulled out of
31:45
it was the fact that it was the trucks
31:47
carrying the bikes were being toppled
31:48
over
31:49
wow so they couldn't physically get the
31:50
bikes to them so my friend
31:52
tom scott who's a youtuber was there yes
31:54
and he did a video about this
31:56
and he said that they didn't topple over
31:58
i think
31:59
they just it was too dangerous for high
32:01
sided vehicles to go across
32:03
right so i don't think any trucks
32:05
actually went over but they were just
32:07
banned from going over
32:08
and what happens is everyone has kind of
32:10
the same bike
32:11
that these kind of single speed upright
32:13
bikes and you cycle across and then this
32:15
big lorry
32:16
picks up the bikes and takes them all
32:18
back to the start again so the next lot
32:19
of people can go down
32:20
and the lorry couldn't come across the
32:22
bridge because it was banned
32:24
and instead it would have to go on like
32:25
a 20-mile route
32:27
right rather than going that way so they
32:29
just canceled it halfway through
32:31
yeah there is another way of moving
32:33
bikes
32:34
without a truck and especially as coming
32:40
back
32:42
this year they were going to they'd gone
32:44
all out to make it even nicer than the
32:46
previous events and they had
32:47
storm-resistant seating for the
32:48
spectators
32:49
and a special designated vomit zone
32:53
it's really funny you can see it's these
32:55
three big bin bags
32:56
that are sort of hung up and it has a
32:58
big placard that says vomit zone
33:01
and there's little bike handles for you
33:02
to hold as you're vomiting into the
33:04
rubbish bin
33:05
you don't want to be stood down wind of
33:06
that as well
33:08
why do they need a vomit zone quite
33:10
larry the endurance of doing this race
33:13
so they say it's it's kind of like if
33:15
you were going cycling up a hill that
33:17
was a sort of ten
33:18
percent incline um it feels and you've
33:21
got no
33:22
on a terrible bike and the whole thing
33:25
is you know this
33:26
there are winners but everyone is just
33:28
wanting to finish it it's an endurance
33:29
thing
33:29
and they push themselves to the limit
33:31
and it forces them to vomit enough so
33:33
that they've set up the vomit station
33:34
they should have vomit zones surely at
33:35
the end of all marathons and all races
33:38
and every they do it's called the side
33:40
of the road
33:43
uh wasn't it stopped also in 2017
33:45
because it wasn't stormy enough
33:47
yeah i think it was it was an absolute
33:49
because they need a certain level of
33:50
wind don't they so if it doesn't come
33:53
it doesn't count and also the wind needs
33:54
to be in exactly the right direction so
33:56
that's why they
33:56
can only do it three days in advance
33:58
they need to know that the wind is
34:00
not just going to be there but it's
34:01
going to be coming directly over the
34:02
bridge
34:03
yes and this bridge is amazing bridge
34:05
right this is the uh ulster sheltering
34:07
and it's a bridge that is basically a
34:09
storm barrier bridge
34:11
and they're very proud of it there um
34:13
they have a little inscription on a
34:15
stone
34:15
which says here the tide is ruled by the
34:17
wind the moon
34:19
and us it's sort of they're so proud of
34:21
how strong it is which i saw on a video
34:23
by your buddy tom scott
34:24
um really worth watching if you're
34:26
listening to us right now talk about
34:27
this um
34:28
he's on the side of the road the wind is
34:29
blowing in his head and he's seeing
34:31
people
34:32
ride past him it's fantastic isn't that
34:34
sort of the beginning of a
34:35
ancient greek story about hubris where
34:37
you end up getting swept away by the
34:39
tide because you've tried to control
34:40
what only god can control
34:42
yeah it's um king kanute isn't it it's
34:44
commute well i think the dutch are
34:45
winning at the moment
34:47
they're nailing it you're right doing
34:48
really well those dutch bikes are really
34:49
hard to cycle fast on
34:51
the ones which don't have a a bar at the
34:53
top
34:54
from the front to the to the back they
34:57
force you to cycle in a really sedate
34:58
way
34:59
another good race is the red bull time
35:01
lapse uh
35:02
and they call that the longest one-day
35:05
road cycling events do you know how many
35:06
hours it's for
35:08
24. no
35:11
25 uh because they do it when the clocks
35:14
go
35:15
back is that right where the clocks go
35:16
back yes it's quite cool isn't it
35:18
yeah and it's just a 6.2 kilometer
35:20
course and they see how many laps they
35:22
can do in 25 hours
35:23
nice you could do the shortest one day
35:25
cycling event where you just cross
35:27
the international date line yeah yeah
35:30
and
35:30
you know it's just like oh i've been
35:32
cycling for a day yeah
35:33
and actually it's just one second yeah
35:35
that's great apart from you're probably
35:36
in the middle of the ocean
35:38
you're dead but you're a smog there's a
35:42
bunch of
35:42
cycling things that you can do where
35:44
it's underwater so underwater cycling
35:46
um and it's quite nice the way that they
35:48
get the bike to stay at the bottom
35:50
which is they take all the air out of
35:51
the bike wheels and they fill it with
35:52
water okay and so when you plunge in you
35:54
just sink to the bottom with it
35:56
and it becomes easier how do they deal
35:57
with the fact that humans are quite
35:59
buoyant
36:00
um they replace all the air in their
36:02
lungs with water
36:04
yeah eventually that's probably what
36:05
happens
36:08
do you have to have weights oh yeah
36:09
weights yeah weight belts and things
36:10
like that oh yeah i didn't see that in
36:13
the photo that i saw
36:14
because some of them go quite deep don't
36:15
know the underwater ones there's one the
36:17
underwater bike race in north carolina
36:18
which seems to be the home of underwater
36:20
bike racing
36:21
uh where it's 60 feet underwater and the
36:24
race is across this shipwreck of a
36:26
german u-boat called the intro
36:28
and you ride 100 foot doesn't that
36:30
that's the kind of thing you're going to
36:31
book a holiday to go and do
36:32
i don't really like cycling or swimming
36:34
but i like the sound of that
36:37
sounds amazing i don't like chess or
36:39
boxing
36:42
um i was looking at the slip streams
36:44
this is sort of air movement
36:46
and cycling absolutely and so slipstream
36:49
of course is when
36:50
you're so you can get in a slipstream
36:52
for instance if you're on a bicycle and
36:53
you're behind a big
36:54
vehicle i do not recommend you do this
36:56
uh but the vehicle sort of pushes the
36:58
air out of the way in front of it
36:59
so it creates this sort of negative
37:01
pressure around you
37:02
but the record for how far someone
37:05
cycled in a slipstream is held by women
37:07
who's denise miller koranek and she went
37:09
at 184 miles an hour
37:12
in 2018 behind a race car isn't that
37:14
incredible that's
37:15
incredible so she's pedaling right yeah
37:18
yeah yeah you've got to be peddling
37:19
so you can't she's in such a high gear
37:21
that you couldn't possibly start so they
37:23
have to get pulled along by the car at
37:24
first
37:26
until they're going 100 miles an hour
37:27
and then released and then you pedal
37:29
along behind the car
37:30
wow should we move on to you can i just
37:32
talk about one
37:33
can i just talk about one other
37:35
slipstream guy who i love
37:37
who's the guy this guy called charles
37:39
minthorn
37:40
mile a minute murphy miley minute was
37:42
added later he was the first person to
37:44
ride a bicycle
37:45
a mile in under a minute he was in 18
37:48
this is in 1899 and he persuaded
37:50
a train engineer because trains were the
37:51
only things that could go fast enough at
37:52
the time
37:53
to build some extra track for him that
37:54
he could cycle along and then so two
37:56
miles of track
37:57
and then he would get dragged behind it
37:59
in the slipstream and so he spent he
38:01
spent 12 years planning this dreaming
38:03
about it
38:04
fantasizing about it and uh at first it
38:06
didn't work because the train couldn't
38:08
go fast enough
38:09
so he was there capable of cycling the
38:11
train can go fast enough
38:12
eventually they got a bigger better
38:14
faster train and he
38:15
ended up going so fast burning rubber
38:17
was flying up in his face because the
38:19
track was warping and stuff
38:20
but uh lots of people were watching and
38:22
um he it got to the end of the track so
38:25
he's going
38:25
faster than the train at one point
38:27
because he got he fell behind a bit
38:28
because he lifted his hand up to sort of
38:30
wave at one of his trainers and i was
38:31
like oh [ __ ] i've just lost 50 feet
38:33
so he caught up with the train going
38:35
faster than the train the bloody guy
38:37
driving the steam train
38:38
just cut the steam as soon as he got to
38:40
the end and so
38:41
charles went slow oh
38:44
my god flew off his bike at 60 miles an
38:48
hour
38:49
and somehow got caught there were two
38:50
people standing in the train
38:52
one caught one arm the other called the
38:53
other one he dragged him in
38:57
and they saved him that's amazing
39:02
okay it is time for our final fact of
39:04
the show and that is
39:05
anna my fact is that every week
39:08
planes drop 15 million flies
39:11
on the border between colombia and
39:13
panama
39:16
okay so we're expected to believe that
39:17
but a scuba diver in a tree
39:21
is perfect maybe the scuba diver's
39:24
hurling them out of the plane and he
39:26
fell out too
39:27
i don't know um this is this incredible
39:31
not story true true fact and i read it
39:34
in an article in the atlantic by sarah
39:35
zhang it's a brilliant article
39:37
but it's about how it's 14.7 million
39:40
screw worm
39:40
adults so the flies of the screw worm
39:43
are
39:44
dropped over this border and it's in
39:45
order to keep down screw worm
39:47
populations
39:48
weirdly and it's been happening for over
39:50
50 years
39:52
and it's because they're a terrible pest
39:54
so they were this awful blight in the
39:55
u.s because they
39:56
they destroy livestock for reasons that
39:58
i have no doubt will go into
40:00
in disgusting detail so they started
40:02
looking into how to get rid of them it
40:04
was that in the 1950s the us department
40:06
of agriculture started
40:07
looking into eradicating them and
40:10
decided to
40:11
sterilize a bunch of screw worms
40:14
drop them all over the continent and
40:16
then those guys would shout as male
40:18
screw worms they drop
40:19
those guys would shag the females who
40:21
only shag once in their life
40:23
so if you shag a sterilized male that's
40:25
it you're not having kids
40:27
and thusly the screw um blight is ended
40:30
so the screw worm was screwed by
40:32
screwing
40:32
you could say very nice i could say that
40:36
should be their logo and we should say i
40:38
don't know if you said this anna but um
40:40
the reason why it's in panama between
40:42
colombia and panama
40:43
is they eradicated these flies from the
40:46
whole of north america
40:47
but they still exist in south america
40:49
and the bit where panama is obviously
40:51
very very
40:52
thin bit of land so if they can make
40:54
sure that nothing gets
40:55
past that little bit of land then it
40:57
means that nothing will come
40:59
into north america so that's why they
41:00
flood panama and colombia with it
41:03
just to kind of create a barrier and
41:04
also to make a big buffer zone i think
41:07
because
41:07
at first they did try to make it a
41:09
barrier with mexico um but because
41:11
that's just a bit too
41:12
close mexico's right there they were
41:13
like we've got to make this big buffer
41:15
zone
41:15
it's like the eastern bloc in the cold
41:17
war can we talk about the worms and how
41:19
horrific they are
41:20
they lay their eggs in open wounds
41:23
that's what their jam is and sometimes
41:25
they go for mucous membranes if they
41:26
can't find an open
41:27
wound but that's why they're so painful
41:29
and horrible so you're living in a
41:31
mucous membrane are you yes yeah but um
41:33
we're saving up and we hope to find an
41:35
open booth soon
41:38
yeah and then they they sort of chew
41:40
their way they chew their way really
41:41
deep as well like they can get two
41:43
inches down and they're just
41:44
they're just awful they're awful there's
41:46
a british taurus called rochelle harris
41:48
in 2013 who had a screw fly
41:51
uh who went into her ear uh and there
41:54
was like this weird buzzing and
41:55
scratching and stuff and she didn't
41:57
really know what it was and eventually
41:59
they found out that she had these
42:00
flesh-eating worms living inside her
42:02
head
42:03
and then they interviewed her afterwards
42:05
i think this is mine in the daily mail
42:06
they interviewed her afterwards and she
42:08
said
42:08
i'm no longer as squeamish as i once was
42:10
about bugs
42:11
how can you be after they've been inside
42:13
your head oh
42:15
i just think i thought that would make
42:16
me more squishy
42:18
i agree way less likely to lie down in
42:20
the garden if i've had a load of
42:21
screw worms in her brain it sounds like
42:24
one stayed in there and is running the
42:25
show now
42:29
that's such a good idea yeah their name
42:32
it literally means flesh eating which i
42:34
love uh
42:35
so their their scientific name is the
42:37
cochlear hominid vorax and hominin is
42:40
man and vorax like voracious is eating
42:43
so man
42:44
devouring gosh which is fitting yeah
42:47
the actual discovery of the idea of
42:50
sterilizing
42:50
all of these um screwworms and dropping
42:53
them over um had been called in the new
42:55
york times
42:56
in 1970 the single most original thought
42:59
in the 20th century that was according
43:01
to a lot of scientists at the time
43:02
because it was down to a guy called
43:04
edward f kittening
43:06
uh sorry edward f knippling nippling
43:09
nippling it's nippling it's usually a
43:11
silent case isn't it
43:12
yeah i think it's knippling either way
43:14
we can agree he does not make
43:16
exceedingly good case
43:21
well let's go let's say nippling and he
43:24
used to as a child he used to watch
43:26
adult screw worms mate and he obsessed
43:29
over it
43:30
um not in a sexy way he was he was
43:32
watching a lot of
43:33
his animals on a farm uh be devoured by
43:36
these horrible
43:37
um flesh-eating species and so yeah
43:40
apparently that was just such an
43:41
original thought
43:42
that some scientists claim it's the
43:43
single most original thought yeah that
43:45
was
43:45
actually it was before the internet was
43:47
invented wasn't it so
43:50
he was really amazing this edward
43:52
nippling um he died relatively recently
43:54
i think and
43:55
i saw a few obituaries of him apparently
43:57
he named all of his pets after insects
44:01
did but his pets were not insects no he
44:03
had siamese cats okay
44:05
okay and anthony that were named after a
44:09
type of cotton bowl weevil
44:10
and a type of mosquito do you know how
44:12
you
44:13
get a screw worm out of someone um
44:18
i do you lure it out somehow you do you
44:22
use a treatment called bacon therapy
44:24
um which sounds like such a much more
44:26
enjoyable thing than it actually is
44:27
[Music]
44:27
[Laughter]
44:29
it just involves jamming raw pork into
44:32
the breathing holes that the worm has
44:34
and it either suffocates and pushes its
44:36
way out or
44:37
it finds it yummy and sort of goes
44:39
towards the bacon oh
44:40
it is like fishing though isn't it i
44:42
think i couldn't tell it's so weird when
44:44
they say that you use it to
44:45
block up their air holes because they're
44:47
really small i mean that is a tiny
44:48
ratchet of bacon
44:50
so i think they yeah they're attracting
44:51
them to them and once you've got sort of
44:53
10 or 11 on your bacon you reel it in i
44:55
suppose don't you
44:56
if you think it's like fishing i'm not
44:58
coming to your restaurant in the middle
44:59
of london bridge
45:02
the maggot sandwich flies off the
45:04
shelves they're a kind of blowfly
45:06
and i was wondering why we called
45:08
blowfish blowflies
45:09
and i think it's because they so the
45:12
first reference to flies being
45:13
associated with the word blows
45:15
comes from shakespeare and around that
45:16
time and it was people would refer to
45:19
flies blowing
45:20
you so cleopatra says uh lay me stark
45:23
naked and let flies blow me
45:25
and that she wants that to happen
45:29
rather than being taken prisoner it's
45:32
not as pleasant as you might think
45:33
it's more about something was referred
45:35
to being fly blown
45:37
when flies had laid their eggs all over
45:39
it basically
45:40
i mean if you go and see a prostitute
45:43
and ask her to blow you
45:44
then make sure she doesn't come along
45:46
with a load of maggots
45:49
tip and pile of maggots on your knees
45:52
you've got to be very careful
45:53
it's possible is all i'm saying if she
45:55
happens to be an entomologist in her
45:57
spare
45:59
of crossover time the two
46:00
[Laughter]
46:02
um so they do actually blow bubbles blow
46:05
flies even though it's not where they're
46:06
called blowflies
46:08
they're forever blowing bubbles and it's
46:09
to keep them cool this was discovered
46:11
quite recently and it's blow flies in
46:13
brazil
46:14
it's actually latrine blowflies so they
46:16
hang around in toilets
46:17
and they do this really clever thing
46:19
where when they get hot they blow
46:21
brown bubbles out of their mouth which i
46:23
imagine are brown because they're
46:24
latrine blowflies
46:26
and the brown bubbles when they're blown
46:29
they lose lots of heat because heat
46:30
evaporates off them
46:32
and then they pop and they suck them
46:33
back in and then that
46:35
spits a bit cooler it cools and pulls
46:37
the head right down
46:38
it's really clever that isn't it yeah
46:40
it's like having bubble gum
46:42
and then blowing it and then it gets
46:44
cold on the outside and then you suck it
46:45
back into your body and get the coolness
46:47
exactly if your bubble gum was made of
46:49
other people's feces
46:53
which is not a hubba bubba flavor
46:58
i've just got one more thing um i
47:00
started looking into insect factories
47:02
off the back of this because there's a
47:03
factory which grows these screwworms
47:05
there's a firm called entocycle which is
47:08
currently hoping to breed millions
47:10
and millions of soldier flies and then
47:12
turn them
47:13
into protein powder so you breed
47:16
millions of flies
47:17
which are eating rubbish they're eating
47:18
old coffee grounds
47:20
and then and then did they give it to
47:22
like cattle and stuff
47:24
exactly that's the hope and then the
47:25
hope is that you don't need so much
47:27
um sawyer to be grown and that you know
47:30
which
47:31
needs that takes up land that's used to
47:33
be the amazon rainforest
47:35
so yeah it's a genius idea and this firm
47:37
endocycle is based
47:38
in london bridge
47:47
okay that's it that is all of our facts
47:49

[Applause]
02:15
[Music]
02:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:22
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
02:24
coming to you from four
02:25
undisclosed locations in the uk
02:29
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
02:31
here with anna tajinski
02:32
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
02:34
and once again we have gathered around
02:36
the microphones with our four favorite
02:38
facts from the last seven days
02:39
and in no particular order here we go
02:42
starting with fact number one and that
02:44
is my fact
02:45
my fact this week is that the london
02:47
underground used to have a church
02:48
interval
02:49
on sundays wow people inspected the
02:53
church it would
02:54
it would stop services during church
02:56
times stop services
02:58
so that you could have a service very
03:00
nice and we're off
03:05
it's a it's a bumpy start but at least
03:07
we're moving
03:09
um did the if you were halfway between
03:11
stations would it just stop underground
03:13
and you're trapped there having to
03:14
worship god from the subterranean that's
03:17
such a good point i don't know i did
03:19
find a thing called the london
03:20
underground church and i thought oh
03:21
great there's going to be a church down
03:23
there but apparently it was a political
03:24
movement it was a sort of like
03:25
underground in the sense that it wasn't
03:27
allowed to be known
03:28
so okay yeah so it was a couple of hours
03:30
on a sunday so people could go to church
03:33
yeah it was 11am to 1pm roughly and this
03:36
is a thing that has existed for
03:37
a very long time so the the london
03:39
underground very very old uh the first
03:41
line opened in 1863
03:43
uh just to put in context nine days
03:45
before that
03:46
abraham lincoln signed the emancipation
03:48
proclamation in america
03:50
uh wow to do it just to put it in
03:52
context of how
03:53
old this is interestingly though dan i
03:56
know how old the
03:57
london underground is better than i know
03:59
when the proclamation was signed
04:01
so it didn't really help me that much i
04:03
think that was more for american
04:04
listeners got it
04:06
yeah yeah and it's
04:09
um so uh there was a big thing where you
04:11
had to respect a lot of the church
04:13
during those times and one of the things
04:14
was transport also had to do that and
04:16
that extended to the london underground
04:18
and that extended all the way till
04:20
1900 when i think it was the central
04:22
line was the first line
04:23
that didn't uh abide by the church
04:26
interval
04:27
um and interestingly a famous celebrity
04:30
on the first
04:30
central line ride oh wait what did you
04:33
say what year it was uh 1900
04:35
oh who was famous in 1900 who we would
04:37
have heard of today um
04:39
gladstone it was uh this is this is
04:41
again for the american listeners it was
04:43
an american visiting
04:44
oh charlie chaplin uh who is british but
04:46
that's cool yep got it cool
04:49
what about uh edison no not edison i
04:52
mean it's it's gonna be too hard to get
04:54
henry ford no not henry ford no
04:56
alexander graham bell who i appreciate
04:58
was scottish but he spent a lot of his
04:59
career in america
05:01
uh aladis morissette who is canadian but
05:04
a lot of people think she's american
05:06
she's north american
05:10
uh is it freddie mercury who was born in
05:12
zanzibar
05:14
ah very nice
05:17
so we need someone who is alive in 1900
05:19
let's start with you're still you're
05:20
still making us guess you're not just
05:22
gonna
05:26
jfk it was an author hemingway an
05:29
american author
05:30
yeah again 1900 anna yeah he would be
05:34
very young
05:35
he would have been very young yeah but
05:37
he got up for free
05:39
they just carried him over the barriers
05:41
it was fine i think he
05:43
could have been a little two-year-old on
05:44
holiday in britain at the time
05:46
that's true um we wouldn't uh dan put us
05:49
out
05:50
twice misery it was mark twain yes yes
05:54
yes wow do we nobody thought of it um
05:58
i i didn't actually no i didn't actually
06:00
find but we do know what the daily mail
06:01
reported about us it said
06:02
voracious curiosity astonished
06:05
satisfaction
06:06
and solid merit if this kind of thing
06:08
goes on london will come
06:09
to be quite a nice place to travel in
06:11
the conductor was
06:12
all a quiver of joy and pride but there
06:15
was no indecorous
06:16
exhibition of emotion every man was
06:18
solidly british
06:20
these early breaks though or these
06:22
rather these kind of sunday trading
06:24
rules a lot of it i think um because
06:27
there used to be trains
06:28
every day they used to be christmas day
06:30
expresses and then a lot of the trains
06:32
had to be
06:33
axed on sundays partly because of
06:35
religion but that was a bit of an excuse
06:37
really
06:37
because a lot of it was down to
06:39
economics and the fact was there was
06:40
this thing called the railway mania
06:42
which sounds like an amazing time in
06:43
britain's history
06:44
where every person in the country was
06:47
invested in or actively building a
06:49
railway and they got all the you know
06:50
thousands of railways across the country
06:52
and most of them didn't make any money
06:55
because they didn't have any passengers
06:56
and this was an easy thing to ask was
06:58
sunday trains yeah and companies were
07:00
needing to save money in the 1860s and
07:02
these were likely used trains they were
07:03
an obvious target yeah
07:05
it's a bit like do you remember when
07:06
they um opened up directory inquiries
07:09
and you had all those different 118
07:11
numbers
07:11
like 118118 or 11888 or 118118
07:16
whatever it's like they open this thing
07:18
up for anyone with a little bit of money
07:20
to think i can make something big there
07:22
and everyone came in and then of course
07:24
most of them just died out
07:25
but what what were the things that you
07:27
could ring and ask like what is andy's
07:29
phone number
07:30
i i hope no one would tell you that i
07:32
hope the only people who could tell you
07:33
that would be me with my phone number
07:35
you have to know it already well it's
07:37
interesting you should say that andy
07:38
because in the olden days which you
07:39
won't remember there used to be phone
07:41
books that had everyone's phone numbers
07:42
in there yeah
07:43
i'd be x directory it's they they let
07:45
you take yourself off though they let
07:47
you take yourself off yeah and if i
07:48
rang up and said what's andy's phone
07:50
number this is back in the day
07:52
and you take it and you're taking
07:53
yourself off they say oh he's taking
07:54
himself off
07:55
my boss definitely still does 118 or she
07:57
certainly was it a couple of years ago
07:59
she would ring up for someone's number
08:01
and you don't want to be x directory
08:02
because they were always pricks if you
08:03
remember
08:04
you know it was always either either
08:06
your parents were a doctor
08:07
which for some reason was okay or you're
08:09
a bit of a
08:12
um on sunday sunday trading and sunday
08:14
hours and things like that
08:15
the history of sunday trading in britain
08:18
is very
08:18
funny when you look into it and did
08:20
explain to me why still
08:22
if i ever go out to buy something on a
08:23
sunday my mum will say
08:25
well i mean the shops won't be open what
08:26
are you doing uh because
08:28
so the sunday shops act happened in 1950
08:31
which basically said no shops except
08:33
essentials
08:34
can open on a sunday because of church
08:36
uh and it was repealed in 1994
08:38
but i was reading all these
08:39
parliamentary debates in the interim
08:42
which showed how very controversial it
08:43
was because the rules were so convoluted
08:46
so
08:46
for instance you could buy essentials
08:48
people acknowledged that perishables
08:50
couldn't wait another day
08:52
so you could sell vegetables so there
08:54
were all these people for instance who
08:56
would have furniture shops there was a
08:57
case in 1972 walla versus hardy
08:59
where a furniture shop was selling
09:01
carrots for 250 pounds
09:03
each but you got a free item of
09:05
furniture with your carrot
09:07
as a free gift to get away with it
09:10
there was this bizarre rule where fish
09:12
and chip shops were specifically banned
09:14
from selling fish and chips on a sunday
09:17
but anyone else could sell fish and
09:18
chips so a chinese takeaway could sell
09:20
fish and chips
09:21
but a fish and chip shrub couldn't but a
09:22
fish and chip shop could sell a chinese
09:24
takeaway on a sunday
09:26
it was wild there was a thing where you
09:29
could buy
09:29
um you're not allowed to buy dog food
09:33
but if you said to the guy the shop i
09:34
have a pony who only eats dog food
09:37
you're allowed to buy it because you're
09:38
allowed to buy pony food
09:40
and it didn't say because dogs are very
09:42
religious but i think horses aren't
09:43
that's right
09:44
yeah that's insane yeah i found out
09:47
about um
09:48
a sex shop in cheshire yeah uh called
09:50
the private shop
09:52
and in 2014 they were applying to be
09:54
allowed to trade on a sunday right
09:56
um and they were they were not allowed
09:58
to do so but they were granted
10:00
permission to leave the door slightly
10:01
open
10:02
right but the thing is i bought a carrot
10:06
from there for 5.99 and they gave me a
10:08
free dildo
10:08
[Laughter]
10:12
well that's two dildos for the price of
10:13
one that's great yeah
10:19
[Laughter]
10:22
um in 1816 in massachusetts there was a
10:25
guy who was
10:26
called george pierce who was arrested
10:29
for riding on a sunday
10:30
because in america you weren't allowed
10:32
to ride your horse on a sunday he was
10:34
arrested
10:34
as acting against the peace and dignity
10:37
of the commonwealth of massachusetts and
10:38
he was put in prison
10:39
and then he was only let out on a monday
10:42
but then he sued the officer for false
10:44
arrest because he said yeah you're not
10:46
allowed to do anything on sundays
10:47
including arresting me
10:49
and he won he won his cart case and he
10:52
got five hundred dollars of damages from
10:55
the police officer for arresting him
10:56
wow brilliant move that's great i
11:00
read a bizarre thing that in uh this is
11:01
just things that were banned in the uk
11:03
on sundays
11:04
um it was in for about 28 years roughly
11:07
in the 16th century it was it was made
11:09
illegal
11:10
to not wear a woolen cap on a sunday
11:14
and this was this was not for all parts
11:16
of society but it was predominantly for
11:18
the people who couldn't afford to pay
11:20
uh the fight so queen elizabeth
11:23
basically put a law in place
11:25
where she said that um maids ladies
11:27
gentlemen noble personages and every
11:29
lord knight and gentleman of 20 mark's
11:31
land
11:32
um were exempt from having to wear this
11:34
hat but everyone else
11:36
had to wear a woolen hat on a sunday in
11:38
the uk and if you
11:39
if you were caught not wearing it you'd
11:41
be fined so much that you probably
11:43
couldn't afford it and then would have
11:44
to do jail time so there was a huge
11:46
risk to it and the reason was to help
11:48
the woolen industry right
11:50
yeah exactly yeah what are you what are
11:52
you in for
11:54
well i think you can see
12:00
that's very hot in summer yeah
12:03
yes did were there were there
12:05
regulations about the size of the world
12:07
and cap could you basically wear a very
12:08
small
12:08
sort of button-sized woolen cap i think
12:10
it was just on your head i think it was
12:12
a very specific design it was a sort of
12:14
a uniform style bobble hat that you
12:17
would have to wear
12:18
yeah that's been quite a common way of
12:21
policing these kind of sunday laws is to
12:23
find people for not doing it
12:24
in 1581 it was the law that you had to
12:27
go to church
12:28
every sunday everyone in the country had
12:30
to go to church and if you decided you
12:32
didn't want to you had to pay a fine of
12:34
20 pounds per month
12:36
and that was 20 times the average
12:38
monthly wage
12:39
so it would take you it would take you
12:41
almost two years to earn that fine
12:43
if you didn't do it oh my gosh yeah
12:47
um just while you mentioned church
12:49
ceremonies i found out about the longest
12:51
church service because this fact is
12:52
about church intervals okay
12:54
um have you heard of the sigwee
12:57
sick we don't think so you're trying to
12:59
do this no it's
13:01
i am trying to do a segue into a fact
13:03
about the sigwee but that is just a
13:04
coincidence
13:05
um this is a mask festival held by the
13:07
dogon people of mali
13:09
and it's the last one
13:12
lasted for six years come on
13:15
so it's a long service i'm not sure you
13:18
have to spend all your time at it it's
13:20
not like a sermon that lasts for six
13:21
years
13:22
but you have to carve a great mask and
13:24
it's several meters long these masks
13:25
sometimes
13:26
and then you have to perform what the
13:28
guinness book of records calls
13:30
a time-consuming procession of dances
13:32
from village to village
13:33
wow and uh yeah they're not doing
13:35
another one until 2037.
13:36
i was wondering if southern rail have
13:38
been on a church interval for the
13:40
dogon people of mali for the last seven
13:42
years
13:46
stop the podcast stop the podcast hi
13:49
everyone we'd like to let you know this
13:50
week that we are sponsored by
13:51
stitch fix yes stitch fix is the online
13:55
personal styling service for men and
13:56
women where
13:57
expert stylists pick the actual clothes
13:59
for you based on your taste your size
14:01
and your price preferences
14:02
they send them to your door and then if
14:04
you don't like them you send them back
14:06
it's amazing it is pretty amazing so
14:08
what you do is you go online
14:10
and you fill in a questionnaire which is
14:12
like
14:13
you know those old buzzfeed
14:15
questionnaires where it's like which
14:16
member of friends are you
14:18
oh yeah yeah or whatever you put in all
14:20
your information what kind of clothes
14:22
you like
14:23
you know where in new york you live yeah
14:25
that kind of thing
14:26
what your coffee order is at central
14:28
park i'm pretending like i've watched
14:30
friends i really don't know which
14:31
happens
14:32
but you fill in all your information and
14:34
they work out exactly the kind of
14:36
clothes that you will like
14:38
and like dan says they send five items
14:40
to you and if you don't like any of them
14:42
you could just send them back
14:43
and there's a charge of 10 pounds which
14:45
is only for the stylist time
14:46
and actually that's redeemable against
14:48
anything you decide to keep

15:27
okay
15:27
on with the show i'm with the podcast
15:32
okay it is time for fact number two and
15:34
that is
15:35
james okay my fact this week is that the
15:37
first ice cream on a stick
15:40
was called the good humor bar it was a
15:42
modified version of a lollipop called
15:44
the jolly boy sucker
15:47
you said that like the jolly boy sucker
15:50
well i would say it was the jolly boy
15:52
sucker there's no punctuation so i don't
15:55
really know
15:56
i don't know how to say it's in the eye
15:57
of the beholder isn't it
15:59
so um this is the weather outside at the
16:02
moment as we record is absolutely
16:04
sweltering
16:05
um so i thought we could do a fact of
16:06
our ice creams
16:08
uh and this is about ice creams on a
16:10
stick so things like i don't know
16:12
magnums or mini milks or whatever you
16:14
would have
16:15
and they were invented in around 1923
16:18
so a few years earlier um harry burt who
16:21
is a guy from ohio he put a lollipop on
16:23
a stick
16:24
uh which he called the jolly boy sucker
16:26
and his son suggested adding
16:28
ice cream on the outside of it and maybe
16:30
a chocolate covering
16:31
and it became really popular and he
16:34
called it good humor because he thought
16:35
that
16:36
your mood was related to your sense of
16:38
taste so if you tasted something really
16:40
good you'd always be in a good mood and
16:41
if you tasted something bad you would
16:42
always be in a bad mood
16:44
hang on is that like the medieval theory
16:46
of the four humors
16:47
where if you're too choleric who you
16:49
have too much bile
16:50
i don't think when he called it good
16:52
humor he thought it has
16:54
half a bit of cholera half a bit of bile
16:56
half a bit of blood
16:57
i don't think he thought that uh but
16:59
actually good humor okay i didn't know
17:01
this um because i haven't spent much
17:02
time in america but it's quite a big
17:03
brand in america it's owned by unilever
17:05
i think
17:06
yeah i don't know it by name but i
17:08
recognize the logo
17:09
as almost a childhood ice cream
17:11
bizarrely it's so sorry was there a
17:13
lolly
17:13
was it like he kept the lolly inside did
17:16
you say so you break
17:17
the chocolate then the ice cream then
17:19
you chow down on a rock-hard piece of
17:21
candy oh
17:22
yeah that's amazing that's good isn't it
17:23
do you remember those like those um what
17:25
were they called you used to get ice
17:27
creams where you had some bubble gum at
17:28
the bottom it's a bit like that
17:30
oh cool you guys are all too young to
17:32
remember these things but
17:33
uh well anna's mum will take 118 118.
17:36
this whole fact is gonna be me
17:38
reminiscing about the ice creams of my
17:40
youth
17:40
and you guys going oh we only have
17:42
carnetos
17:45
um these good humor bars they were kind
17:47
of they were
17:48
seen as very um proper and sort of
17:51
very the the firmer scene was very moral
17:53
one so there was a book about ice cream
17:55
which i looked at a bit of called sweet
17:57
spot
17:57
and um it's it has this to say about the
17:59
good humor trucks because he kind of
18:01
invented the ice cream truck in a way as
18:02
well
18:03
um it said the white shirt and the cap
18:05
the driver's supported helped create a
18:07
mythology around the good humor brand
18:09
of trustworthiness and dependability
18:11
that lasted until the mid-1970s when the
18:14
brooklyn district attorney's office
18:16
filed a 244 count indictment of good
18:19
humor
18:19
charging the company with falsifying
18:21
records to hide excessive amounts of
18:23
bacteria
18:24
really wow that was a long time ago
18:28
though we should say
18:29
yes very long time but the origins of as
18:31
you say like the ice cream truck and
18:33
uh they they really cared about the
18:35
presentation of how they were going
18:37
through the community so anyone who
18:38
became a good human man
18:40
which became quite a culturally
18:42
significant role there was movies made
18:45
using that title the good humor man
18:46
later on uh they all had to go and do
18:49
courses to learn
18:50
how to be the best version of that role
18:52
so there was a two to three day course
18:54
that you would go on
18:56
um they were taught to always tip their
18:58
hat towards a lady if they came towards
19:00
them and if they didn't do that they
19:01
would be fired
19:02
and they had to say ice cream good humor
19:05
if they said good humor ice cream that
19:06
was the improper way of saying it and
19:08
that could lead to them being fired as
19:09
well so it was quite good
19:11
yeah there was a handbook called making
19:12
good at good humor that they all had to
19:14
study in order to become
19:15
this representative of representative of
19:18
the company don't forget that they also
19:19
had to
19:20
falsify records to hide excessive
19:21
amounts of bacteria in the product
19:24
do you know people's favorite ice lolly
19:25
is today i was quite surprised by this
19:27
oh so lolly or ice cream ice cream or
19:29
lolly on a stick anything
19:31
cold on a stick curl dollar stick magnum
19:34
yeah
19:34
oh you straight away went for magnum um
19:36
okay it's magnum it's bang on magnum
19:40
28 of the country think they're the best
19:43
and the runner-up is on like eight
19:44
percent
19:44
i think it's because it's not very easy
19:46
to remember any others
19:48
yeah do you think you're right yeah yeah
19:51
i would go feast absolutely yeah yeah
19:52
any day of the week yeah but it's not a
19:56
market leader in the way
19:57
it's like saying what's your favorite
19:59
flavor of cola
20:00
you're only going to get people to say
20:02
pepsi or coca-cola aren't you
20:04
like
20:07
well anyway it might be so popular
20:09
because they invented a new kind of
20:11
chocolate
20:11
for the magnum oh right which was a
20:14
really exciting move
20:15
uh they've only been around since the
20:17
very late 80s uh i think and
20:20
basically the problem was that um
20:22
chocolate cracks
20:23
at a certain low temperature so it was
20:24
actually very hard to get good quality
20:26
chocolate around ice cream
20:27
and they created this new kind of
20:29
chocolate that didn't break at minus 40
20:31
degrees
20:32
and this weird um blog by a business
20:35
analyst
20:36
which was saying that magnum is the
20:37
epitome of good business because of its
20:39
simplicity
20:40
and then when they brought along the new
20:42
flavors like cherry guevara
20:44
john lemon woodchuck and jamie hendrix
20:48
none of which i knew existed he
20:50
described them as the four horsemen of
20:52
the apocalypse
20:54
i don't think we've ever mentioned this
20:55
before there is a quite a widely known
20:58
claim that roger moore james bond
21:00
invented the magnum yes
21:02
okay and it's because he was being
21:04
interviewed in the 1960s and he was set
21:06
he was asked if you could ask one person
21:08
any question what would it be
21:09
and he said i would like to meet mr
21:11
walls of walls ice cream and say why
21:12
don't you do a chalk ice with vanilla on
21:14
a stick
21:16
and he also said i i didn't realize that
21:18
other people at the time said they
21:19
wanted to meet gandhi or jesus
21:23
anyway walls sent him a a cake which had
21:26
plain chocolate on the outside and
21:28
vanilla ice cream on the inside and this
21:30
later got parlayed into
21:31
he invented the concept of the magnum
21:33
anyway the magnum was eventually made 23
21:36
years later
21:37
give or take okay well he was ahead of
21:39
his home yeah
21:40
a spokeswoman for unilever um told the
21:44
sun
21:44
who asked them about it sadly we've
21:46
never heard this brilliant story but we
21:48
are thrilled to hear the late great sir
21:49
roger moore was a fan of magnum
21:51
very carefully saying there's no truth
21:53
in this matter at all
21:55
i believe it because it often takes a
21:57
long time between the prototype like
21:59
alexander fleming discovered penicillin
22:01
it was a long time before he was able to
22:03
market it
22:04
so probably in the same way that first
22:06
magnum cake
22:07
you know there was of course there was a
22:09
gap before they could make it
22:13
spend three years trying to get his good
22:16
humor bar
22:16
patented as well and no one was granting
22:19
the patent and i think he eventually
22:21
went down to the patent office with the
22:22
ice cream
22:23
and gave out samples and then according
22:25
to the story of good humor's uh official
22:28
website
22:28
that's when they were granted the patent
22:30
yeah he apparently had a five-gallon
22:33
bucket
22:33
of these ice creams and just handed them
22:35
out to absolutely everyone who could
22:37
make a decision um we were just talking
22:39
about walls
22:40
which is kind of the uk version of good
22:42
humor because they're both owned by
22:43
unilever
22:44
um they started around the start of the
22:48
19th century
22:48
in 1812 um george the prince of wales
22:51
granted richard wall
22:53
a royal warrant as the purveyor of pork
22:56
to the king
22:57
and that's where they started he was the
22:58
official the official royal purveyor of
23:01
park
23:02
and it was because he had a shop on
23:04
german street
23:05
in london where he could make sausages
23:08
and no one really else could make as
23:10
good sausages as him because he had this
23:12
machine and it was a donkey that would
23:14
walk around the machine
23:15
and it would like create a cutting
23:17
motion that would turn the
23:19
meat into mincemeat which he could then
23:21
turn into sausages
23:22
which he could then purvey pork like to
23:25
the king
23:26
that's amazing because these days like a
23:28
technical edge is having
23:29
a better factory that makes
23:30
microprocessors more effectively and in
23:32
those days the commercial edge was just
23:34
your donkey's
23:35
donkey on the street yeah and then
23:38
in 1913 um they came up the idea because
23:42
what would happen is
23:43
in the summer no one wanted pork anymore
23:45
because it was too hot for park
23:47
and they were like have to lay people
23:48
off and so they came up with the idea of
23:51
making ice creams because they had
23:52
refrigeration so they came with the idea
23:54
of making ice creams to avoid layoffs
23:56
and that's when they became this big
23:58
probably the biggest ice cream company
24:00
in the uk
24:01
i thought you were going to say that
24:02
they sold frozen pork for people to suck
24:06
and that was how they parlayed it that's
24:08
right the magnum used to be a flat
24:10
sausage on a stick
24:11
[Laughter]
24:14
and the thing was he also sent people
24:16
around in kind of an early ice cream van
24:19
way um they had um tricycles with the
24:22
ice creams in and they have the slogan
24:24
stop me and buy one which still exists
24:26
today
24:26
but he would let them go on a sunday
24:29
when most people wouldn't let people
24:30
work on a sunday he would let his ice
24:32
cream sellers go on a sunday
24:34
but he said that they would only let
24:35
them do it if they went to church in the
24:37
morning
24:38
and it was under his supervision so they
24:40
had to go to church with him in the
24:42
morning and if they did then they could
24:43
sell the ice creams in the afternoon wow
24:46
and just a little ice cream news story i
24:49
found
24:50
in the process of this uh in 2018 a man
24:53
called mr tickle was arrested for
24:54
threatening an ice cream van owner with
24:56
a samurai sword while high on cocaine
25:00
oh that started off so reasonable with
25:02
mr tickle and then it went dark really
25:04
quickly
25:05
it's actually an awful story uh there
25:06
were children present that was
25:08
incredibly upsetting for them he later
25:09
went on hit by some bins before being
25:10
arrested
25:11
unfortunately they saw his really long
25:13
arms poking out from the bed instantly
25:17
he put up his hands to the cups
25:20
knocked down some aeroplanes
25:23
anyway it's probably too inappropriate
25:25
because yeah he did threaten the vandal
25:27
with it
25:27
he was called jamie tickle okay all
25:30
right all right
25:30
okay no one died he gets out of prison
25:32
quite soon and i just don't want him to
25:34
find me it's all right he'll get stopped
25:37
by the log after the last
25:39
[Laughter]
25:41
um i've got a 2008 press release that i
25:44
can tell you about um
25:46
you guys are too young to remember this
25:48
but until 1988
25:49
all lollipop sticks had jokes on them oh
25:52
yeah
25:52
so whenever you wet your magnum when you
25:54
got to the end of it you could read the
25:56
little joke on the sticks
25:57
and they were phased out in 1988 because
26:00
they thought that people who were eating
26:01
ice cream were becoming a bit more
26:02
sophisticated
26:04
they didn't think that the jokes were
26:06
appropriate wait
26:07
this is so weird james i thought i
26:09
remembered that but i was not in a
26:10
position to read lollystick jokes in
26:12
1988. it's possible your parents had a
26:14
lot of out-of-date
26:16
ice creams that they were giving you i
26:18
think that must be it
26:19
no no my parents said it's likely they
26:21
faced them out in 1988 so i suppose
26:23
there might have been a few
26:24
stragglers a bit later but uh maybe like
26:26
the kids ones like minnie milks might
26:27
have kept them on
26:28
um but in 2008 uh walls approached james
26:31
corden
26:32
to um start a new career writing jokes
26:35
for ice cream sticks because they wanted
26:36
to bring them back
26:38
um they said that um he would be ideal
26:41
because james is an up-and-coming
26:42
comedian who is cutting edge
26:44
yeah sure that's a missed career
26:46
opportunity for james i know we don't
26:48
know if he said no yet anna we don't
26:49
know he said no
26:50
well you're right i think he did say
26:52
though
26:53
but where is he now where is he now yeah
26:57
something else they faced out in the 80s
26:59
which only james will remember
27:00
is the double double popsicle
27:03
actually i think this was in america but
27:05
i didn't know these were such things i
27:06
remember though it's like a is that an
27:08
ice lolly with two sticks
27:10
it's a lollipop with two sticks oh right
27:12
no i don't remember that
27:13
um these were actually a ploy in the
27:14
great depression to uh
27:16
sell more people lollipops so it was
27:18
invented so that they could sell two for
27:20
the price of one so the idea a public
27:22
health nightmare you'll agree
27:23
is that you would share a lollipop so
27:25
you'd buy one lolly but
27:26
you have two sticks so two people can
27:28
share it but they hold it
27:30
you're each holding a stick and eating
27:32
it yeah your mouths are right next to
27:34
it's like a lady in the trap moment just
27:35
a lot longer
27:36
that's a that's a much longer scene yeah
27:39
that was it they both lick either side
27:42
of this lollipop until eventually they
27:44
both get to this final sliver of lolly
27:46
where they lick the final bet and then
27:48
eventually romantically they're licking
27:50
each other's tongues
27:55
this is how romance happens
27:58
but over the years i think people forgot
28:00
that it was meant for two
28:02
people and so it just became a lolly
28:04
with two sticks you know
28:05
sorry you know with lady of the
28:07
yeah he basically pretends that he
28:09
doesn't know what's happening right he's
28:11
just eating this spaghetti yeah
28:12
and he pretends he doesn't know what's
28:14
happening he turns around and he's like
28:15
oh now i'm gonna kiss the
28:16
other dog i don't think you could pull
28:18
that off if you're licking it
28:20
because you'd see that there's no
28:22
there's no flex and give no like there
28:24
is in the spaghetti
28:25
you're looking dead into the other
28:26
person's eyes for several minutes while
28:27
you're licking
28:28
literally the very start everyone knows
28:30
what they're getting themselves into
28:34
well actually scientists have worked out
28:35
precisely how many licks it takes to
28:37
lick a lollipop
28:38
uh to the end scientists which
28:40
scientists are these anna
28:42
i just i want to defend the scientists
28:44
they did a very important experiment and
28:45
then they thought how are we going to
28:46
get the press to pick up on this
28:48
well we can use this experiment to also
28:51
work out how many licks to
28:52
lick a lolly so they cooked up this hard
28:55
candy and they had water currents flow
28:57
over it and then they calculated that it
28:58
would take 2
28:59
500 licks to lick a lolli it's a
29:02
thousand licks per centimeter
29:04
okay which i think is extraordinary and
29:06
flawed because
29:07
we have saliva right whereas they were
29:09
using water currents
29:11
so our saliva is much more abrasive yeah
29:14
okay you'd think so a lot of licks
29:16
though is what we're saying just to take
29:17
us back to the lady of the trampoline i
29:19
think that means that you're licking for
29:21
40 minutes
29:22
before you eventually look at each
29:23
other's tongues
29:33
okay it is time for fact number three
29:36
and that is
29:37
anna my fact this week is that kublai
29:40
khan's
29:40
summer palace could be dismantled and
29:42
folded away
29:43
at the end of every summer oh it was
29:47
clever
29:47
like a camping trip exactly yeah every
29:50
summer he went on a big long camping
29:51
trip it's sort of everyone's nightmare
29:53
except kublai can't do they
29:54
liked it did they have that same problem
29:56
of once they dismantled it fitting it
29:57
into the bag
29:58
that it just seemed too big to get into
30:00
it he could never do it he was always to
30:03
be heard
30:03
roll it don't scrunch it
30:06
it was a nightmare so this was in it was
30:09
kublai khan who was the grandson of
30:11
genghis and extended his empire so we're
30:13
talking the second half of the 13th
30:15
century
30:16
and he had a summer capital in shangdu
30:20
or made famous as xanadu uh of course by
30:22
coleridge in
30:23
in his poem but it was called shangdu
30:26
and
30:26
in his summer capital he had this big
30:28
palace and it was apparently you know
30:30
really ornate amazing pan is huge
30:33
and it was based on the mongolian kind
30:35
of yurt or
30:36
ger design so they all had girls who
30:39
were very nomadic people
30:40
and so it was held up by 200 silk chords
30:43
and at the end of the season you release
30:45
the chords and the whole thing
30:46
folds up although i don't know how
30:48
because it was made of proper materials
30:49
was it made of canvas
30:51
it was made of like cane and it had
30:53
these huge pillars and stone
30:54
dragons on top of it yeah there's a lot
30:58
of
30:58
solid stuff to go in that bag yeah so
31:01
kubler come
31:02
we should say that we largely we largely
31:04
know this from
31:06
um marco polo's account uh and then
31:08
supported by chinese historians who for
31:11
instance list there were
31:12
five great halls which might have all
31:14
been removable because essentially the
31:15
mongols were nomadic this was the
31:17
fundamental thing about them
31:18
and so they just wanted new land to
31:22
graze all their conquering was just
31:23
about having new grazing land
31:25
and so yeah they took all their
31:26
buildings down and buggered off the end
31:28
of every season wow
31:29
and they went somewhere where they could
31:31
graze more easily is that right is that
31:33
what you say
31:34
no this was this the buggering off here
31:36
was just you know summer is over so he
31:37
went back to the winter capital
31:39
but in all of their conquests and stuff
31:41
right one of so obviously they conquered
31:43
the biggest contiguous land empire ever
31:45
known to man
31:46
and they didn't care about like settling
31:49
cities and founding big cities so they
31:50
just flattened cities and then would
31:52
leave them and go home again
31:53
and i think people think the reason they
31:54
didn't take over the whole of europe is
31:56
because once they got to hungary in
31:58
poland it wasn't such good grazing land
32:00
so it was kind of pointless so kublai
32:03
khan
32:03
was the f it was he the first
32:07
non-chinese
32:08
emperor of china as it were yes he
32:10
founded the is it the yuan dynasty
32:13
yeah it's really interesting um one of
32:15
the things that marco polo says about
32:16
him is the introduction
32:18
in amongst his group of uh paper money
32:21
um so marco polo writes about that
32:23
brings that back
32:24
and um just a very tiny thing is the
32:27
rihann
32:28
dynasty or ren um in chinese another
32:31
way if you put a different tone on that
32:33
means money um
32:35
and i do wonder if there's a connection
32:37
to those two
32:38
um because that was such a dominating
32:39
thing uh
32:41
for his court yeah he used to be scented
32:43
some of it apparently
32:44
some chinese paper money was scented i
32:46
think around about this time
32:48
well they were very big on
32:49
counterfeiting right away weren't they
32:51
they tried to
32:52
they tried to stop everything yeah if
32:54
you went to a bar in
32:56
mongolian times they didn't take a
32:57
20-pound note sniff it and go this isn't
33:00
real did they i don't think
33:02
i'm not sure that was a counter pity
33:03
there maybe it was i don't know
33:05
maybe it was but it was all uh mulberry
33:07
bark or it was it
33:09
sounds really cool but actually it was a
33:10
sheet of paper-like substance derived
33:13
from the bark of mulberry trees
33:14
and it had to be signed by multiple
33:16
officials and uh
33:18
it had pictures of the old money on it
33:19
as well which i think might have been a
33:21
way of explaining
33:22
what this is to people who weren't
33:23
accustomed to paper-like money
33:25
because the old money was just ropes
33:26
with coins hanging off them
33:28
so just had a picture of this hey this
33:31
is what this was
33:32
and now this is what it is and also cool
33:34
that's like
33:35
that's a bit like when you have um you
33:37
know when we all got mobile phones and
33:39
you'd have a picture of an
33:40
old shaped phone on your mobile phone so
33:42
you knew that was what you pressed to
33:43
call
33:44
something exactly like that that's so
33:45
cool i love scuba morphism it's called
33:47
isn't it
33:48
yeah or a picture of a floppy disk being
33:50
designed to save something yeah yeah
33:52
or a picture of a carrot to sell dildos
33:56
yeah yeah sure um because he had such a
33:59
big empire
34:00
kublai khan it meant that people could
34:02
travel from all the way from europe all
34:04
the way to the other side of
34:06
asia and that's obviously why marco polo
34:08
managed to
34:09
get across there because before that it
34:10
was really difficult to
34:12
to traverse those areas so what's what's
34:15
the deal with
34:16
marco polo in that i the last that i'd
34:19
read
34:20
or was told about him is that you know
34:22
he might have been a fraud or that these
34:23
weren't trustworthy but
34:25
all the places that he described like we
34:28
know where zanudu was we
34:30
we've found the dragon statues we found
34:33
he got the perimeter sizes wrong but
34:35
they were
34:35
not too far wrong well he was
34:37
blindfolded a lot of the time marco polo
34:39
so that's why he wasn't able to
34:41
there are theories but they're still
34:42
pretty unusual that he genuinely didn't
34:44
get there i find it totally implausible
34:46
because he wrote about it in so much
34:47
detail
34:48
and it was possible to access and other
34:50
people went there as well from the west
34:52
william brew brick was another one um
34:54
but people use things like he didn't
34:55
mention the great wall of china
34:57
but actually the great wall of china
34:58
wasn't really that great at that time
35:00
so not really worth mentioning there's
35:01
people in china who still don't know
35:03
what the great wall of china is
35:04
genuinely because it's because they've
35:07
not been up in space have they
35:08
so they've not been able to see it
35:09
exactly uh i think the argument
35:12
is and i don't subscribe to it either
35:14
that he got the stories from other
35:15
people and he wrote them down
35:17
rather than him actually going and
35:18
experiencing it that's the argument
35:20
i think okay um another guy who did go
35:23
and experience the mongols was this guy
35:25
called william rubrick who was a bit of
35:27
a marco polo he was a franciscan we
35:29
talked about franciscans recently he was
35:30
a
35:31
missionary and he revealed to us a
35:33
serious problem with the khan dynasties
35:35
with the mongol dynasties which was
35:37
alcoholism
35:38
so a lot of them had a real issue with
35:40
this he talked about this amazing thing
35:42
called the silver tree of karakoram
35:44
in the mongol capital and it sounds
35:46
extraordinary so
35:48
it was a huge tall silver tree in the
35:50
center and it had a
35:52
angel sort of angel type fairy figure
35:54
with a trumpet on top of it
35:56
and then it had lions all around it and
35:58
the lions would spout a different drink
35:59
from their mouth so there were four
36:01
lions
36:01
and the lions produced grape wine
36:04
fermented mares milk
36:05
rice wine and honey mead depending on
36:07
which you fancied
36:09
and uh the way it worked well the way it
36:11
was supposed to work
36:12
was that the angel on top of the
36:13
fountain was an automaton and he blew
36:15
some bellows at the bottom it played a
36:17
trumpet servants rushed out and filled
36:18
it
36:19
but the angel automaton never worked and
36:21
so what they had to be was a man
36:23
inside the trunk of the tree at all
36:25
times with a trumpet
36:26
who as soon as the emperor decided he
36:28
wanted a drink had to blow the trumpet
36:30
so it looked like the angel was blowing
36:31
it
36:32
and then everyone flocked in to refill
36:33
it but then how amazing is that he'd
36:35
have a party and there'd be
36:36
a lion fountain spouting every drink of
36:38
his choice that's so good
36:40
pretty good it's amazing i probably
36:42
would have replaced the mas milk with
36:44
like maybe sangria but that's just me
36:47
that's what i like
36:48
yeah maybe maybe the later dynasties
36:50
went there
36:52
it's like those magical machines that
36:53
you get in nando's which have five
36:54
different kinds of soft drink in them
36:56
basically
36:59
it is based on that they actually have a
37:01
very small man inside them
37:04
and a pair of pillows um i do actually
37:06
have another nando's related
37:08
kublai khan fact did you mean another
37:10
that last one wasn't related to that
37:11
nose
37:12
you just shoehorned it in
37:16
so true okay whenever he had his raw
37:19
horse meat he used to put a little flag
37:20
in it didn't he to say
37:22
how spicy he wanted it
37:26
well if you thought that link was
37:27
tenuous james you waited a year this one
37:31
one of andy's famous soo guards or
37:33
whatever
37:36
i think that kublai khan basically
37:38
invented the nando's black card
37:40
which is a card where you get free
37:42
nando's
37:43
forever if you have this right yeah
37:45
that's what the nando's black card is
37:47
so kubla khan had a bit of a
37:48
correspondence with the then
37:50
pope and uh obviously this is incredibly
37:54
difficult to do because you're thousands
37:55
of miles away
37:56
and transporting glasses to nightmare
37:58
but he sent khan this is
38:00
sent an ambassador with a paisa
38:03
which is a golden tablet which is three
38:05
inches wide
38:06
and one foot long and what the paiser
38:08
does is it authorizes the holder to free
38:11
food and lodging anywhere throughout
38:14
kublai khan's dominion
38:16
so it's effectively a nando's black card
38:18
for a whole country
38:20
yes no i i'm going to give you that
38:22
indeed that's yeah
38:24
well marco polo had one of those as well
38:26
you're saying it was yeah marco polo
38:27
when he left to come back
38:29
uh to italy he was given one of these
38:32
golden tablets and it worked brilliantly
38:34
until he sort of reached the stronghold
38:37
of his influence and it sort of got
38:38
weaker and weaker
38:39
and at that point the gold tablet meant
38:41
nothing and they started getting beat up
38:42
and they started
38:43
losing the clothes and it's what led to
38:45
basically him arriving back as a ruffian
38:47
supposedly
38:48
and being jailed really yeah it's like
38:51
it's like when he tried to pay with
38:52
scottish money for something
38:55
this is legit i promise you
38:58
so the person who made it for the whole
39:00
dynasty was genghis
39:02
right and he's he started off really
39:04
poverty stricken so he started off being
39:06
a hunter-gatherer because he was
39:07
basically exiled
39:09
but he was born this is this weird thing
39:10
he was born with a clot of blood
39:12
in his hand apparently which meant that
39:15
you were going to be
39:16
a great ruler i mean obviously wasn't if
39:18
we don't believe in the mythology of
39:20
these times but
39:21
if you're a mongol clot of blood in his
39:23
hand and it was a sign he was going to
39:25
be
39:25
ruthless and he was so once he massacred
39:28
as well as massacring an entire city he
39:30
massacred all the pets
39:32
all the cats and dogs and cows and
39:34
camels in a city as well
39:36
what an awful person he was he was a bad
39:39
guy
39:40
but he really liked loyalty he was a
39:42
good guy to his mates he was one of
39:43
those like if you're friends with him
39:44
he's really good to you
39:46
um he was in he was in one battle and
39:48
someone almost killed him
39:49
shooting his horse out from underneath
39:51
him and he sort of stopped the battle
39:53
took a bunch of them prisoner and was
39:54
like who was it who almost shot that
39:56
horse out from under me
39:57
and the guy put his hand up for some
39:59
reason and genghis said okay you that
40:00
was a great shot come on my side
40:02
and this guy ended up being one of his
40:04
most important generals helped him
40:05
conquer the world
40:06
wow you just had to go on his good side
40:09
when he went through
40:10
um the middle east trying to siege all
40:12
these cities
40:13
the reason that they were so good is
40:15
they had these massive catapults
40:17
and their catapults were amazing and
40:19
they would fire the stones at the
40:21
city walls and then eventually they
40:23
would have to give up
40:24
and they were so important that if you
40:28
know how they killed all their dogs and
40:29
cats and stuff like that
40:31
well they wouldn't kill the engineers of
40:33
the city they'd give them a chance to
40:35
kind of come over to the mongol side
40:37
because they knew how important the
40:38
engineers were
40:39
and if they agreed then they would come
40:41
over and they'd become part of the
40:42
mongol army
40:43
and there was one city um in china
40:46
somewhere
40:47
i can't remember what it's called and
40:49
they heard about this that this was
40:50
happening they heard the mongols were
40:52
coming and they decided to get rid of
40:54
all the stones from the area so for a
40:56
couple of days
40:57
they literally within about a mile
40:59
circle they grabbed
41:00
every single stone they could find and
41:02
brought it into the city
41:04
um but then what the mongols did instead
41:06
was they got some mulberry trees chopped
41:08
them down put them in water left them
41:09
out to dry and they became rock hard
41:11
and they could use those instead of
41:13
stones to fire another city oh wow
41:16
now there's some arguments yeah there's
41:17
some argument that they weren't good
41:19
enough
41:19
and in the end they had to bring in some
41:21
stones from somewhere else because they
41:22
had like a
41:23
like a postal service for stones that
41:25
they used sometimes
41:28
they get like storage of stones like an
41:30
amazon storage site of um parcels but
41:32
they would keep stones in all these
41:34
different places
41:35
and really yeah they would be like one
41:37
day's right away and they'd bring the
41:38
stones to each place
41:39
so there's an argument they might have
41:40
done that or it might have been these
41:42
small trees
41:43
that's so funny so expensive if you're
41:45
shipping stones internationally
41:47
it's hard enough to ship a hardback book
41:48
but imagine like 100
41:50
or something and you're asking for next
41:52
day delivery on a lot of these stuff
41:56
presumably though you could catapult it
41:57
to the area you want to get it
42:01
that's such a good idea just catapult on
42:03
to the next catapult
42:05
i don't think they even thought of that
42:06
dan only been in charge
42:10
they used to also tie trees to their
42:11
horses if they didn't need the trees to
42:13
be
42:14
replacement rocks so they had all these
42:16
clever tactics for scaring the enemy
42:18
and one of them was tying trees to the
42:19
horses that didn't have riders so it
42:21
sounded like they had a much bigger army
42:22
than they did sorry
42:23
the horses would sound much heavier is
42:24
the horse dragging along a tree
42:26
okay sorry tying trees to the horses
42:28
makes it just sound like you're
42:30
tying your horse to a tree but you're
42:32
getting it wrong
42:34
there's a very big difference between
42:35
tying your tree to a house and trying to
42:37
get your hearts to a tree
42:39
it's a completely different thing the
42:41
one guy who's just standing there going
42:43
i don't understand
42:44
this tactic
42:51
oh embarrassing yeah sorry they uprooted
42:54
the trees
42:55
branches and they did things like they
42:57
banged metal pots together and they
42:58
rattled bells
43:00
uh when they galloped into battle so
43:02
that the um opposing army couldn't hear
43:04
each other shout instructions they
43:06
wanted into battle when they were going
43:07
into battle they would bang metal pots
43:09
and pans together and they'd run lots of
43:11
bells and stuff and that meant that the
43:13
opposition couldn't hear
43:14
each other shout out that's really
43:16
interesting
43:17
you won't be able to hear yourself thing
43:20
but that's what happens in um that's
43:22
what happens in american football
43:24
like when the other team's on offense
43:25
and they need to make all their signals
43:27
you get your fans to make as much noise
43:29
as possible so that they can't get the
43:31
signals across
43:32
and that means that they can't do it so
43:33
that is a really common thing in
43:34
american football
43:35
wow and then you slaughter the entire
43:37
opponent yes
43:41
hang on just to go back to this time
43:42
your tree to a horse thing
43:44
yeah doesn't that and so what the idea
43:47
is the enemy thinks you've got a much
43:48
bigger army because it sounds bigger
43:50
it's rumbling it's bigger isn't it well
43:52
the rumble is bigger but it's this only
43:53
works
43:54
in a place where the enemy can hear you
43:56
but not see you
43:57
for one thing well no if you're if
43:59
you're running with an army that
44:01
presumably
44:01
a lot of this is going to be on dirt
44:03
there's going to be a lot of dust
44:04
raising
44:05
you'll you're going to create it's it's
44:07
all uh it's all theatrics
44:10
you really should have been in charge
44:11
you're so right the mongolian desert
44:13
there's sound everywhere
44:14
you can't see a thing but the reason dan
44:16
didn't go there is because of the death
44:17
worms they have in mongolia
44:19
[Laughter]
44:21
be killed by lightning bolts from the
44:23
anus
44:24
no thank you this uh kubla khan samuel
44:27
taylor coleridge sort of
44:29
um immortalized xanadu in that great
44:32
poem of his
44:33
and uh this is such a basic thing that i
44:36
didn't know so i'm saying it for the
44:37
other people out there
44:38
who did not know this uh even though 90
44:40
of you will
44:42
he never finished the poem because
44:43
someone knocked at his door a person
44:45
from porlock
44:46
and he lost his creative thread and
44:48
didn't know how to finish it and i
44:50
didn't realize that that's become a term
44:51
that you use for when creativity
44:53
is disrupted when your inspiration
44:55
suddenly goes because of some
44:57
exterior thing a person from porlock has
45:00
come
45:01
is the term to say i've lost my thread
45:03
of i think it's far down that that is
45:05
not an extremely common phrase that
45:07
people use all the time
45:09
yeah yeah yeah it's not i wouldn't say
45:11
90 of the people listening to this
45:12
if you're listening to this you're not
45:14
in a 10 of people who didn't know
45:17
because you just say it's not that
45:18
common it's a way to make all of our
45:21
listeners feel very stupid
45:22
well i was in the category but then
45:24
that's even more insulting i guess
45:27
yeah so um so he wrote it in this opium
45:30
haze he was inspired after reading about
45:32
the description of xanadu in marco
45:34
polo's accounts
45:36
and it never got now i haven't actually
45:38
read it myself so
45:39
does it just cut off or yeah but does he
45:43
write about a person from porlock at the
45:44
end he doesn't
45:57
uh no it does stop halfway through and
45:59
actually a lot of people think that uh
46:01
there was no person from parlock and it
46:03
was just an excuse
46:04
a lot of people think that it might be
46:05
just because he was off his face on
46:07
opium that he maybe didn't finish it
46:10
[Music]
46:12
okay it is time for our final fact of
46:14
the show and that
46:15
is andy my fact is that according to the
46:18
people who have drunk it
46:19
billion year old water tastes
46:22
terrible i
46:26
i know wait this this doesn't make any
46:30
sense
46:31
because i've got some water right here
46:33
yep and i've been drinking it and
46:35
this water here i would say is more than
46:36
a billion years old really
46:38
i reckon this water is like four billion
46:40
years old or something 12 billion years
46:41
old
46:42
and it tastes fine to me all water
46:44
surely surely it's been cleaned it's
46:46
been
46:46
no so you don't make water do you like
46:49
the earth doesn't make water the water
46:50
that we have now is the same water as
46:52
was when the dinosaurs were around so
46:54
i'm receiving a lot of early challenges
46:56
on this fact and i'll go into it a bit
46:58
more um
46:59
so you're absolutely right that um that
47:01
pretty much all the water on the planet
47:03
is
47:03
unbelievably old and may well be much
47:06
older than
47:07
a billion years this is a a
47:10
body a pocket of water which was found
47:13
by a team of canadian scientists led by
47:15
barbara sherwood lolla
47:17
who is an earth sciences professor and
47:19
she and her team found
47:21
a bit of water about a mile down in
47:23
canada
47:24
uh beneath a mine and this pocket has
47:26
been isolated from the rest of the world
47:29
for over a billion years so much of
47:31
pretty much all the water on the planet
47:33
is part of the water cycle where it will
47:35
cycle into the oceans it'll cycle into
47:37
clouds that'll maybe go into underground
47:39
aquifers
47:39
but this stuff that she found and her
47:41
team has been isolated for up to
47:43
two and a half billion years it's really
47:46
really really
47:47
you know it's been kept separate it's
47:48
not been in circulation
47:50
and um she she was interviewed about it
47:52
a few years ago and she says she tastes
47:54
it from time to time and it always
47:56
tastes terrible
47:57
um and she doesn't let her students do
47:59
it because obviously there isn't a huge
48:01
amount of this stuff to go around
48:02
and so so this is a common thing
48:04
apparently right geologists just go
48:06
around licking and tasting the stuff
48:08
that they're investigating
48:09
she was saying to find because
48:10
apparently you can get an immediate read
48:13
if you get that kind of thing of the
48:14
kinds of minerals and stuff or the
48:16
extent of the minerals
48:17
and she did say that if you're a
48:18
geologist who works with rocks
48:20
you've licked a lot of rocks yeah which
48:23
is quite weird
48:24
the point is that she's looking for the
48:25
oldest water in the world that's like
48:27
what their
48:27
job is that's what they're looking for
48:29
and the older it is the saltier it gets
48:32
because it means
48:33
all the bits from the rocks are leached
48:34
into it so as you're going you're kind
48:36
of licking little bits of water to get
48:38
saltier and saltier and saltier and
48:40
the most salty one you get is probably
48:42
the oldest right
48:43
yeah so that's why she does that if that
48:45
was her job she did a
48:46
bloody good job of it because the
48:48
previous record holder was only tens of
48:50
millions of years old
48:51
so she's not only found one that's older
48:53
but by almost
48:54
two and a half billion years which is
48:57
pretty good going
48:58
the reason that they realize that this
48:59
one is so much older than any they've
49:01
found before is they've
49:02
got a new technique of checking how old
49:04
things are
49:05
and by using this new technique which
49:06
was i think um
49:08
discovered by the university of
49:09
manchester in england um
49:11
they kind of looked at the isotopes of
49:13
various gases which are found in this
49:15
water
49:16
and by doing that i won't explain
49:18
exactly how you do that because it's
49:20
pretty obvious for everyone but
49:21
basically
49:22
you work out how many of certain
49:23
isotopes of these noble gases are in
49:25
your water and that will tell you when
49:27
when it kind of landed there in your
49:30
aquifer
49:31
yeah but to go back to anna's original
49:33
complaint about this fact
49:35
it is bizarre that water is
49:38
there's a lot of water which is older
49:40
than the sun
49:42
most water is older than the sun four
49:44
billion years old four and a half
49:45
billion years old is that bizarre
49:47
i you don't find it bizarre that the
49:49
water on the planet is older than the
49:51
rock
49:51
i find it bizarre but i know that we
49:53
have a lot of alien water
49:54
so it's yeah that's the thing i'm saying
49:57
is bizarre that there's a lot of alien
49:59
water which predates the planet forming
50:01
uh i think that's i think that's mad it
50:03
is mad he's right
50:04
uh so most of the water that we have on
50:08
earth we think
50:08
actually it's interesting because no one
50:10
really knows where all the water comes
50:11
from but we think most of it comes from
50:13
asteroids because you can look at the
50:16
chemical compositions of your water and
50:18
notice that it's quite similar to what
50:19
you find in asteroids
50:21
but some of it has come from the actual
50:23
formation of the sun itself
50:25
so when the sun forms all this all these
50:28
bits come together to make this massive
50:30
body in space but some of it
50:31
becomes what's called the solar nebula
50:33
which is like a gaseous part of the sun
50:35
which doesn't become the sun itself
50:37
and apparently a lot of that stuff has
50:39
come down to earth
50:40
and becomes some of the water so it
50:42
didn't all come from asteroids some of
50:43
it came from the
50:44
formation of the sun and apparently um
50:47
for every 100 molecules of water
50:50
one or two come from the solar nebula so
50:52
anna's big jug of water that she's
50:54
drinking from at the moment
50:56
will have millions and millions well way
50:58
more than millions of
50:59
uh molecules that came from the
51:01
formation of the sun but most of it will
51:03
have probably come from asteroids
51:04
but and that but that could be why water
51:07
evaporates
51:08
if um you believe in a fringe theory
51:10
because the sun
51:11
causes water to evaporate because it
51:13
wants its water back
51:16
so it's trying to suck it back up i mean
51:18
wow
51:19
yeah it's just a new theory but why it
51:21
would put itself out
51:22
it sounds like a brand new theory oh my
51:25
god there is so much going wrong with
51:26
these last few things that people have
51:28
said
51:29
we should move on just leave that as
51:31
accepted back move on
51:33
um just to go into slightly more kind of
51:36
human time scales of water
51:39
do you know why water tastes weird when
51:40
you've left it overnight
51:43
it's gone funky because um flies have
51:46
gone in there and yeah glasses of water
51:49
always full of
51:50
flies floating no they've flown off
51:52
again they kind of go in for a little
51:54
bath in the evening when i'm not around
51:57
james you have to sort out your fly
51:58
situation um no that's that's not it
52:00
it's that carbon dioxide from the air
52:03
has dissolved in the water
52:05
and it's formed carbonic acid so you
52:08
basically according to one article i
52:09
wrote about it you're basically drinking
52:10
very very mild acid rain the next
52:13
morning wow
52:15
it was really interesting this is a bit
52:16
of a personal story but um
52:18
i had i'm in sussex at the moment and
52:21
had visitors come recently from
52:22
oxfordshire when it was after the time
52:24
when you were allowed to have visitors
52:26
um and they came from oxfordshire and
52:27
one of them had a bottle of water they
52:29
brought from oxford
52:30
and we taste it and then they tasted the
52:32
water here and said oh sussex water is
52:34
so delicious isn't it so much nicer
52:36
i was like what are you talking about
52:37
and we all could tell immediately by
52:39
just the smell of the water we did blind
52:41
taste testing
52:42
which came from where you can 100 tell
52:44
the difference from
52:46
certain places like from the difference
52:47
between bolton and london
52:49
is it might as well be a different
52:51
liquid it just just tastes
52:53
nothing like it it's baltimore sometimes
52:55
it's because of the
52:56
rocks this is because of the chemicals
52:57
that are added in oxfordshire oh really
52:59
more chemicals with us is because we
53:00
have soft water in bolton but we have
53:02
hard water in london which is just like
53:05
it might as well be orange juice and
53:06
lemon juice it's completely different
53:08
wonder if there's anyone who can tell
53:09
every single county by the taste of the
53:11
water well
53:11
the world scale in 2016 they did a taste
53:14
test of all the different waters in the
53:16
uk
53:17
uh with a with a group of judges that
53:19
included michelin star chef tom aikens
53:22
okay so these were experts on water and
53:24
they tasted them all and they said that
53:26
the best tasting tap water
53:28
uh was the west midlands it was found in
53:30
the west midlands
53:31
and the worst was um served by wessex
53:34
water which included bath
53:36
and bristol but that was because the
53:39
water was polluted by a statue of a
53:40
slave trader so um
53:43
but now apparently according to but then
53:45
you see these every kind of
53:47
few every couple of years they come up
53:49
with a new survey and someone else is
53:51
the best and someone else is the worst
53:52
yeah but though that's very embarrassing
53:55
for bath
53:56
i know it's been trading on its water
53:58
percentage i suppose they're quite
53:59
sulfurous are they
54:00
in bath is that the whole point of bath
54:02
the actual springs are yeah that you can
54:04
bite you to
54:04
cost 50p for a glass of the actual
54:07
springs water and it's so
54:08
eggy it's really gross people used to
54:11
order it by delivery though so back when
54:13
bath became a thing
54:15
it became there was the resurgence of
54:16
bath so bath is a big deal in roman
54:18
times because of the spa and then the
54:20
18th and 19th centuries
54:21
people like jane austen and coast
54:22
co-side holidaying there to take the
54:24
waters
54:25
which were thought to be very curative
54:27
um and you'd visit to cure your sickness
54:29
and sometimes it worked because water
54:31
was very polluted let's say in london
54:33
but to visit to cue your sickness but
54:34
sometimes people didn't have weeks to
54:36
spare to go holidaying in bath
54:38
and that's where the bottled water
54:39
industry started so they'd write to bath
54:42
and say oh can i just have water
54:44
delivered and you'd get subscriptions of
54:45
spa
54:46
water delivered to you once a month wow
54:48
you're
54:50
that's they also invented the
54:53
subscription
54:54
meal service did they he did
54:57
podcast in the 19th century with
54:58
advertisers
55:01
uh do you know we talk about the oldest
55:04
water the oldest rock the oldest
55:06
earth rock do you know where they found
55:07
that is it in space
55:10
yes oh on the moon on the moon yeah
55:14
the oldest rock that they think belongs
55:16
to the earth
55:17
and that was formed on the earth was
55:18
found on the moon
55:20
uh by the apollo 14 crew in 1971
55:23
they brought down the load of samples
55:25
and this particular one has got all the
55:27
right isotopes or whatever to think that
55:28
they did come from the earth
55:30
wow and they reckon that what happened
55:32
was an asteroid hit the earth
55:34
really really early on in its
55:35
development and it
55:37
flew a load of um stuff into space and
55:39
then this kind of went around went
55:41
around went around and eventually landed
55:43
on the moon when the moon formed the
55:44
moon was a lot closer to the earth in
55:45
those days
55:46
and then was found by these astronauts
55:49
in 1971.
55:50
you would be furious if you were nasa if
55:51
you were nasa and you said right guys
55:53
can you bring back some moon rocks you
55:54
don't mind like literally any bloody
55:56
rock you can find
55:57
it's all moon rock isn't it thank god
56:00
the apollo 11 astronauts didn't bring it
56:02
back that would not have helped the
56:03
conspiracy theories
56:12
okay that's it that is all of our facts
56:14

[Applause]
[Music]
hello and welcome to another working
from home episode of no such thing as a
fish a weekly podcast coming to you from
four
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
is dan schreiber i am sitting here with
andrew hunter murray
james harkin and anna tajinski and once
again we have gathered round the
microphones with our four favorite facts
from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with fact number one that's my
fact my fact this week is
before hermit crabs were called hermit
crabs there was a hermit
called crab this is a uh
there's a man called roger crabb who uh
his his dates were 1621 to 1680
and he was an english soldier he was a
haberdasher he was a herbal doctor an
author and a hermit
and he predates the naming of herbert
crabs so did he
did he live in a kind of shell which he
would periodically exchange for a very
slightly larger shell
hermit crabs named after him well hermit
crabs i believe
are named after hermits generally but i
don't think he was
such a famous hermit that he sort of
defined the whole species
he was semi-famous right isn't there a
thought that he um
so he was a hatter and there's a thought
that louis carroll's mad hatter was
maybe based on him
because he was also quite mad yeah i
couldn't find anything that sort of
truly links that other than people
saying it was thought did you get
anywhere with that
like people were writing about him a lot
in the 19th century when lewis carroll
was also writing
you know people would reflect back on
his life quite a lot of sources so maybe
he was your famous
mad hatter but he wasn't was he when was
he alive
he was in the 1600s oh okay cool they
just talked about him a lot
hermit crabs were named in the 1700s so
he
he predates them only just but he gets
there it's sad isn't it in a way
that you know he never knew that those
animals
if he was a really famous hermit like
you guys are saying then
hermit crabs might have been based on
him you know yeah it's possible yeah
and he had sort of a sad life even
though i guess he claimed to like it
didn't he by the end of his life he was
all about um denying himself sort of all
pleasures
yes and he didn't he limit himself to
potatoes and carrots and then he sort of
quit that and just lived off bran
and turnip leaves and then he quit that
and by the end of his life apparently he
was living off dock leaves and grass
yeah he was just eating grass at the end
i don't know directly mouth to ground or
if he turned it into a sort of picked it
and put it in a bowl
anna you wrote something last week which
i read which says that you can't eat
grass
yeah it's interesting isn't it so i'm
not quite sure how he was surviving
maybe he had a cow's stomach
implanted into his own costume because
what you need is
like cows have the right bacteria in
their stomachs which means that they can
break down the cellulose and get to the
good stuff inside the grass
but we don't have it in our stomachs so
unless he's licked a few cows to get the
bacteria i don't know how he's i mean
maybe he died almost immediately after
that's the thing deciding to eat only
grass
it is the last thing on his menu of diet
changes so i think we can assume it
might have played a part in that no he
was
yeah and he um he was he was accused of
witchcraft in his lifetime as well
because he used to make prophecies i
couldn't actually find any of his
prophecies but um
i bet i'll die really soon after
adopting this brand new diet
but yeah um so good to know he existed
i'd never heard of roger crabb before
he seems like a proper hermit too he
seems like a an in it for life
hermit because we briefly mentioned
before that you used to be able to
kind of hire a hermit for your garden if
you're a landowner yes
which is well they're more in it for the
money there's a guy who's written
gordon campbell is his name he's written
a book which has got one of the best
book titles ever it's called the hermit
in the garden
from imperial rome to ornamental gnome
and
um he had tracked down a load of
newspaper adverts which were
kind of hiring hermits or advertising
for hermes
so some said you'll get 50 pounds a year
uh
for life as long as you live underground
for the rest of your life and no one
sees you
okay um that's one offer and i think
that
you could ring a bell and a servant
would bring you stuff but you weren't
allowed to chat to anyone and you had to
grow your hair and your fingernails
so it's really unclear what the
landowner gets out of this but someone
took that for four years
and stuck it out for that long but there
were so many shops underground
it's hard to work out what you'd spend
your 50 pounds i think amazon would
deliver
to your underground place good point
um there was one guy called charles
hamilton who offered a job on his surrey
estate which was 700 pounds in exchange
for seven years of hermiting so it's
like a fixed term contract um and the
successful applicant took the job and
then was found in a local pub three
weeks into the
hermit shop wow yeah he lasted longer
than i would
[Laughter]
there was i think he was also in that
book that he talked about peter the
great's hermitage
which was very much more on the side of
not a proper a hermitage
i've been to the hermitage in uh saint
petersburg and it's
if a hermit lived there he was living at
large yeah
so actually that was an even bigger
upgrade
to compared to peter the great's
original one but um he originally
decided to build a hermitage in his
garden which was sort of a retreat from
matters of state and this was in the
1700s when it was quite popular
the hermit lifestyle and this was
described as being a hermitage and it
had no servants
so you were really living like a like a
feral human and it was two floors and
the dining room was on the upper floor
and the kitchen was on the lower floor
and the there were no stairs going from
the lower floor to the upper floor so
the guests when they arrived uh had to
be hoisted on chair lift so on their
individual chairs hoisted up onto the
upper floor to eat
and then when the table was loaded with
food it would be descended
through the floor onto the ground floor
loaded up with food
and then hoisted up onto the upper floor
again sounds so cool
who's doing the hoisting if there are no
servants yeah i thought i'd read that
there were just no servants on the first
floor
like obviously there will be loads of
servants doing all the pulling and the
cooking and
yeah that's not really living an acetic
life is it if um
you know you only have servants on one
of your floors
come on he's making an effort fair
enough
uh there are more modern um hermits
aren't there
um there was a guy in america called
billy barr who lived in the rocky
mountains
and he's really cool because he got
bored quite soon into being a hermit
or living on his own let's say and so he
decided to kind of make a diary
and he started measuring the snow levels
and all the animal tracks and
when the first bird song would be every
year and he did it for 44 years and now
his
notes can be used to measure climate
change which i think is really cool
they're actually using his diary to say
oh wait a minute in
1970 something the birds sang on this
date and now they're singing on this
date
wow is there any awkward entries in the
diary which he hasn't which they have to
just skip over
like where he well in 1976 he started
masturbating in june
but in 1978 he started masturbating in
may
what does this tell us about the
temperature of the rocky mountains
i found a pro hermit in the uk
who seems to be operating in the uk uh
or definitely he's done stints here
so he's an indian artist called ansuman
biswas and
he was recruited in 2002 by
staffordshire council to live for a
weekend
a weekend of being a hermit um in a
place
that's so ridiculous well we've all been
in our house for three months
so that was 2002 he was he was paid 600
quid to live in a grotto for a weekend
not bad
um then in 2009 there's a news report of
manchester museum hiring a hermit
guess who it is it's indian artist and
suman biswas again
um and then he's he's done another one
all recently this year he was going to
do the hornyman museum in south london
and lived there
he was going to be locked in their clock
tower but unfortunately due to everyone
staying at home he was not allowed to
become a hermit
that's so amazing so when lockdown
finishes he gets to go and lock down
again
exactly yeah i wonder if hermits have
generally been furloughed across the
board
apparently i was reading a victorian
source reflecting back on hermits
throughout time and it was it was it's
such a religious thing and all religions
seem to have this tradition about
self-denying
and this source was saying that
basically the women did it properly and
the men
didn't really do it so it said that
basically there's a division between
hermits proper and recluses and hermits
proper
tend to see quite a lot of people have
guests go out into the world
and then recluses are the ones that
don't see anyone and it said it was
basically done down gender line so the
recluses would be
women and they would see nobody but then
actually i think because ancaresses were
the recluses
essentially and they were meant to be
hermit again julian of norwich
a very very famous example and they
essentially were agony ants
i think which so they would deliberately
have their heritages built in the middle
of quite a busy thoroughfare
like in the trafford center or something
yeah and then you would just go and sit
next to her and say
oh i'm feeling a bit sad today i've been
doing some sins and then she'd help you
yeah she'd say well at least you don't
live in a box in the trafford center
with anyone allowed to come up to you
anytime my friend jenny lived in a box
in the trafford center for a little
while
did she well then yeah jenny ryan
actually yeah no way
yeah she did i don't know if that's on
record i suppose it must be
what do you mean she i don't fully know
what this box is
is is it just a cardboard box do you
remember david blaine
yeah in a box for a while yeah well i
think this was pre-blaine
she was in a competition where she had
to go and sit in a box for as long as
possible in the trafford center wow
cool this is right it might be the
andeal center but the basics
and basics of the story are true wow so
you don't did you visit her
in the box and tell her your problems it
was a long time ago i don't think so
i think i was at university you can't
remember if you visited your friend
in a box in a mall
the fact that i can't remember it's yes
i didn't but i'd also suggest i'm a
terrible friend
so i don't know which way to go um there
was also
so the more sort of social hermits we
mentioned a long time ago on the podcast
the uh style lights which i find so
interesting
um the the idea this was um during the
byzantine empire you would have
uh so we're talking sort of the year 432
um they would be just you know you guys
look at the entire empire
so you know around 432
oh a magnificent but very short-lived
it's like a weekend hermitage that
empire
uh so the uh the idea of this was it was
gigantic poles in the center
city centers and people would climb up
them
and they would become hermits up there
and just stay there for their lifetime
and
they would like the pulley systems they
would send up food to them and they
would stand and preach so
they were hermits but they were also
giving out sort of religious advice
uh the whole time it would be their
their soapbox as it were
it feels about have you heard of mary of
egypt no
she was a very early uh hermit and she
isolated herself to atone for her
insatiable carnal appetites
okay which just seemed to be she liked
having sex with people and did she also
sit on top of a massive pole
um but all the stories about her say she
wasn't even charging money to have sex
with people as if that was
the worst element of the story right
yeah anyway she was but she ended up
still naked didn't she at the end
didn't someone stumble upon her in the
desert and she was unclothed and i'm so
i'm not saying she wasn't sticking to
her vows
but it's very hot in the desert it was
hot
um a couple of things on hermit crabs
yeah yeah so
hermit crabs are really great uh there
we go that's all i got no um
do you know how old the oldest pet
hermit crab known is god i'm gonna say
about
35. that's good um dan
15 days 15 days okay
i'm under egging it this time i'm gonna
i'll go middle uh so
uh 13 years old james is closest
it's 42. it was 42 last year
and it's he lives at a retirement home
which is very nice
yeah because his owner also lives at a
retirement home and it's called the
shell point retirement community
he's helping to move into a bigger
retirement home next year isn't it
um but they do they upgrade their homes
don't they it's the most incredible
thing about them and the way that they
do it
is like it makes our property ladder
look very simple
so a hermit crab will have its shell on
its back his house on its arse
and then it starts it starts getting
bigger and its house becomes too small
for it and so it will find another shell
that's a bit bigger
but often this shell will be too big you
know it's like a mansion
and so then they'll have to wait for
another hermit crab to come along that's
sort of a different size
and then enough hermit crabs have to
come along in
all different sizes that they can line
up from smallest to largest
and then the largest one can move into
the vacant
hugest shell and everyone else can move
up one
shelter that's amazing it's insane how
are they organizing it it doesn't make
any sense
it's brilliant it's so cool and there
are videos of it right
online people have to google hermit
crab's moving house
and look at the videos because they're
absolutely amazing
but sometimes two chains kind of get to
the same shell at the same time
and then the two biggest hermit crabs
have to have a fight with each other to
see who's gonna get the
big shell and everyone in your queue is
gonna get
a new house if you win the fight do you
know what i mean yeah
and so all the little guys are watching
these two big guys fighting thinking i
hope my guy wins
but then sometimes they swap queues
and see that one of the other guys is
doing a bit better in the fight and kind
of sneak over and join his team
that is amazing incredible that is
amazing
they um they also there's cases of um
gangs of hermit crabs coming to steal a
single hermit crabs shell
so they they nick it for their mate um
and
i read that that's the reason that they
have extremely long penises
because if you're having sex as a hermit
crab and you leave your shell to go have
sex because of your smaller penis
um then you're you're leaving your home
open for
for burglary uh so by having a very long
penis you can you can stay
indoors at home but send your penis out
for sex look it through the letterbox
yeah exactly
so if you're a shy hermit crab you have
more sperm than if you're a brave
hermit crab it was found out by
scientists
who startled hermit crabs
so they would take a crab from his tank
kind of scare it and then put it back
and then the crab would go into its
shell because it was scared
and then they would measure how long it
would take before he came back out again
to see if everything was okay
and they compared that with the amount
of sperm
in their spermatophores which is what
they used to make they have little
bundles of sperm
and they found that the ones who were
shy have more sperm than the ones who
were brave really
did they do they know why well is it
that
if that what they said is that um there
are two different approaches you can
either have a live fast die young
approach
where you just go out and do it or like
the more successful ones have a stay
safe
and protect your giant sperm package
approach
um right so is the idea that they they
sort of know
they've got this valuable package and
they're really trying to preserve it
yeah but the ones who have got um less
good package of sperm
they have to go out and find the you
know
females yeah let's be more wow
so actually me staying in my room and
reading throughout my university is was
just because
i'm an exceptionally high quality male
is that what we're saying or that you
were storing up a lot of sperm at the
time
that other people were utilizing
[Laughter]

okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
james okay my fact this week is that
magna carta
smells of newly pressed sheets with
traces of
old socks so
this is the institute of digital
archaeology
and they're planning an exhibition
called sensational books which will be
at the bodleian
in oxford and at the new york public
library and what they've done is they've
taken a load of
old books and they've taken the essence
of the smell from all of these books
and you're going to be able to go and
smell what these old books
smell like basically and what they do is
they take the bucket they put it in a
sealed chamber
and they fire a load of air over it for
24 hours
and then they capture the particulates
or the little kind of
molecules from the book and then they
can take those filters
they spin them around spin them around
spin them around until they turn into
like some kind of
paste and then that paste they can use
to
synthesize the odor so they can work out
exactly what's in it and they can make
new versions of it
but if you're one of the first people to
go to the exhibition you'll be able to
get the actual smell that they
found from the box so it's one of those
things that if you're in the first
couple of people who go you're going to
get the really good stuff
and if you go a few weeks after it's
opened then you're going to get
something that spells exactly the same
but isn't the true magna carta smell
okay well because they would have
recreated it based on those chemicals
so basically we've invented the smell
printing press
600 years after the actual printing
press yeah so you could say that
kind enough andy's face makes it look
like you can't say that
but are they going to release a magna
carta scratch and sniff because that'd
be awesome
um i think they might do that i think i
might have said this before that i went
to a smell museum in sunderland once
and i got a book which you could get all
the smells of different things and it
was a scratch and sniff thing and you
could smell the sun and you could smell
like the death mask of toots and car
moon and stuff like that
wow that's what i'm suggesting okay
some of the better smells that are going
to be in this exhibition cs lewis's
private collection smell is going to be
you can smell his cigars very slightly
in the background
and that's incredible isn't that cool
and there's going to be books
from boston which smell a bit like
molasses because do you remember there
was a big flood of molasses in boston
where there's like
sugar went down the street and i think
killed a few people but
um is it someone's diary writing about
the molasses flood saying oh no
it's coming in the door i think it would
probably be
someone's library from the time which
got covered in malaysia
but yeah wow i hope that that hermit uh
who recorded all the snow
isn't going to have his diary done
because it's going to be a heavy center
semen
okay can we talk about magna carta
please yeah
we should say what it was sort of like
what what is this thing
basically um king john we had a king um
who
was spending loads of money on stupid
things like going battling in france and
stuff like that
and then we had all the barons in
britain who owned all the land
but the king was basically really
pissing them off
quite a lot and he was making them give
him money and he was doing nasty things
to their families and stuff like that
and so they'd had enough and they were
like this we're gonna get rid of
the king
one time they tried to assassinate him
and then a few years later
they went down and they said look we
have had enough and he said okay okay
okay i'll make a load of new laws that
stop me from being
an and they said right fine and
so they all agreed to all these laws and
then a few weeks later he went
ah only joking pranked you i was
crossing my fingers
yeah he contacted the pope saying uh
that can you
i've been forced to sign this dreadful
document can you cancel it and the pope
did so he said oh yeah i'll issue a
papal bull
and um so that was ten weeks after he'd
signed it i thought it was this huge
founding document of english law and
liberty
and it turns out it lasted ten weeks
well it didn't because it became it was
reissued ten years later and then it did
stay on the statute books but do you
know
what he had to give the pope in exchange
for the pope admitting to that
he had to give him england and that has
never been
reneged on so the way he got the pope on
site the pope was actually really pissed
off with john
because there was this absurd situation
where king john wanted one archbishop of
canterbury the barons wanted another
they fought so the pope picked a third
and then king john just hadn't let the
third come into england
and the pope had like you know uh got
really pissed off and banned england
from doing any kind of mass or anything
so the pope hated john so john got him
back on side by saying i'll give you the
whole of england as a papal fiefdom
and will pay sort of rent to hire it off
you
every year if you say that i don't need
to stick to this magna carta
and formally the papacy has never
resigned its claim
so technically it could come up to
england and say
wow can i claim sort of a few centuries
of rent off you please
that is so nice that sounds classic king
john
he uh he sounds like he just got a lot
of stuff wrong
because he wasn't he was never meant to
be king was he he was he was seen as the
the worst of of the brothers or the sons
of the previous king
um he most famous of all uh if you don't
know king john is he plays
the lion in the robin hood disney
animation
um just to put in your head who we're
talking about and um
he had many brothers one of who was
richard the lionheart and his father
the king gave them all bits of land so
henry
his oldest son was given normandy in
england and
jeffrey was given britney they all got
given stuff except for
king john who was just given a nickname
which was lackland
because he was given absolutely nothing
so he must have been such
a prick as a young man for his father
the king to be handing
out all this lovely land to people and
he doesn't give you this and i'll give
you this and give it and you're going to
get the nickname
lackland yeah that's he must have been
awful as a young person as well
yeah or he was meant to he was meant to
be a priest or
something like this yeah but then the
other three all died didn't they and
slowly but surely he got closer to the
throne yeah it really is very hard to
find a revisionist historian who's
willing to back john up
most people will say well there's
another side to this story
but he was basically a and not
that the barons were the greatest guys
ever right they just wanted power for
themselves
but i hadn't realized that the barons
before magna carta was signed and they
were trying to um
you know negotiate with jon or overthrow
him took control of london so well john
was off fighting his was in france the
barons marched into london
surrounded by walls and just took over
completely and he came back to find it
you know ruled by barons and the way
they got in he said how on earth did you
get in
because it's surrounded by these walls
it's meant to be defended
and they said they just found a ladder
lying up against the wall
and all climbed over it yeah and i just
find it so weird
to take control of a city you could just
leave a ladder surreptitiously lie
against the wall
and the whole army of barons climbs over
it that's so good bizarre but then
after magna carta and after it was
repealed the french came along and took
over
london which you don't often read about
in like in schools and stuff
yeah but basically there was a civil war
straight afterwards between the king
and the barons and the barons were known
as the northerners which i like
uh and the french came along and king
louie just came along
and went to london and was proclaimed
king
it was pretty so weird and then at the
end of the war when he went
back in the end he signed the treaty
saying oh no i wasn't king
no honestly i wasn't wow
but he was given 10 000 marks to do so
so basically king john just bought him
up and said
is that is that a lot of money we're
talking ten thousand marks
well i i assume it seems unlikely he
would have backed off for not a lot of
money doesn't it i mean he was in
control of more than half of england
i'm sure it was more than a fiver it
seems like it was a lot down yeah
yeah well no they were just giving away
a lot of weird things at the time like
england to the post just curious what
the equivalents were
but it didn't do king john any good all
this stuff because he died in 1216 so
the year after magna carta
and at the time he was also not popular
because the medieval writer matthew
paris
wrote that hell itself is made fowler
by the presence of john geez
[Laughter]
why did we book him to deliver the
eulogy what's going on
there were some weird clauses in magna
carta weren't there given that um
it's held up as this um it's
like the start of it's a british
constitution basically it was the start
of the rule of law
in england and then what became britain
a lot of individual people mentioned
like shout outs but they're with their
birthday shout outs
shout out to the lionheart it was
basically that
but the opposite of a shout out saying
you're banned from ever holding royal
office
and so if any of these people are
listening uh en gallarde de segoin
uh peter guy philip and mark and your
brothers
and jeffrey your nephew uh none of you
guys and your mom
and your mom soda none of these people
can hold the royal office
wow very specific that's a founding
constitution to name
bill bob and mary they had one bit in
magna carta which basically had
complete freedom of immigration as long
as you're a merchant
you're allowed to come to britain and
work as much as you wanted
wow james this is you're throwing a cat
amongst the pigeons here i know
but you're ready it's quite interesting
isn't it and they also um
they said that no one should be arrested
or imprisoned
on the appeal of a woman for the death
of any person except her husband
yeah i'm constantly accusing people of
murder and if my words were taken
seriously
there was this thought that women were
constantly saying oh this bloke
murdered someone uh and weren't to be
trusted
i think one of the one of the reasons it
was thought to be happening is because
women are exempt from trial by battle so
if as a man
you accuse someone else of having
murdered someone then
you could do a trial by battle where
you'd have to fight that person
and you might die yeah and so often men
ask their wives to accuse the person
instead
if you were in the battle with that
person who you're accused of being a
murderer
and you lost that battle your final
words would be like see i told you it
was something
[Laughter]
it's like minority report it's a
predicted murder
so we thought there were only a few of
the
magna cartas around the place you know
we we thought we knew how many there
were and the
most recent discovery of one was in 2015
and this was a 1300 one which is so
recently to have found a new
one of these it was found in a scrapbook
in a council archive in a sandwich in
kent
and the really nice thing was it was
kind of sandwiched
into this scrapbook yeah it's just in
there folded up and it's a bit tatty and
it's a bit
moldy and it's a bit wet but it's it's
it's still a magna carta from 1300 so
that's worth up to 10 million pounds
yeah they're all different shapes aren't
they because they're on
parchment uh made of sheets bodies made
of sheepskin
and so i didn't realize that basically
the
thing that you wrote on it was dictated
to by the shape of the sheep so if you
had a really fat sheep
then you had a particularly big
parchment that's why he was writing
and his brothers and his mom he's just
trying to fill the space
i've seen magna carta you've seen magna
carta
yeah i went to there was an exhibition
at the british library
um cool in 2015 i think it was
and they only they didn't let many
people in i think there was
1 217 people were allowed in to see it
as a as a nod to oh because it was
signed in 12 it was signed in 12 15 but
they let in 1200
[Laughter]
oh man imagine if i was at the end of
the queue and i'd counted them all i'm
like we're fine
we're fine we're getting it in you take
you have ticket number 1217
[Laughter]
wow that was it was amazing to see it
was um it felt like you were
you were witnessing the uh foundations
of not only british
uh law but american as well it was was
it how was it kept was it
in a box no it was um no because oh
yeah yeah like a see-through blanket
yeah yeah yeah yeah
imagine if you went to see that and it's
just in a box you're like can we look
inside the box no no no
jenny ryan is inside the box and she's
busy thinking
[Applause]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
andy my fact is that ford has a car wash
made of giant ostrich feather dusters
the whole car wash the whole thing yeah
um it's really good it's this huge frame
so it's it's at their factory uh in
valencia uh
in spain and it's it's to clean the cars
but not in
exactly the way that a car wash does but
it looks exactly like a car wash so
once the frames are stamped and welded
together they need painting
but they've still got some dust on them
probably at that point
and that car painters hate the dust
because obviously you're just painting
dust you're not painting the car it
doesn't give you a nice smooth coat
so it goes through this huge machine
which is lined with
massive um sort of it looks like a
really upsetting donna kebab covered in
feathers like those elephant legs that
you're getting
okay it's that but it's just covered and
swirling round around around and it's
covered in ostrich feathers like so to
get rid of the dust they have these
feathers is there no
better material that we've invented over
the last 100 years
like like you would think there would be
but it turns out the ostrich feathers in
particular
are really good for dusters because they
have these tiny little
sort of barbules these sort of micro
hooks which are really good at picking
up the dust
and they also um they prevent static
electricity from building
up which is also useful for the process
so wow yeah so this is their process so
if you whacked an ostrich are they
really dusty do they
do they just emit huge plumes
i guess bmw says
that it in 2004 at least bmw said it
exclusively uses ostrich feathers to
dust all of its cars
and yeah because they claim because of
this innate static charge not found to
the same degree in other
feathers i thought they used emu that's
interesting i wonder if they've swapped
or maybe they do emu in australia but
they certainly in 2004
no they don't they've actually got
they've got an emu farm in bavaria
which is where they get their emu
feathers from um
so maybe maybe they've upgraded yeah
maybe they've gone to ostrich
well ostrich anemia are pretty similar
aren't they yeah sorry to be reductive
about it um
so ostrich feathers yeah they um
are now used for cars but they've been
really popular as fashion items for
quite a long time haven't they and if
you were an ostrich farmer you could
make millions from just getting the
feathers off your ostriches and selling
them on
yeah they used to have feather palaces
in south africa which aren't what they
sound like because that would be a
terrible building material
uh it was this is around about the 1880s
south africa uh provided by 85 of the
world's ostrich feather supply i think
and the feather palaces were palaces
built by people who got rich off the
back of ostrich feathers
they're still there they went out of
fashion because of um
there was a i think it was morning
fashions changed
so it used to be or big daft hats
stopped being in fashion basically well
it was partly because of cars
yeah i went to the hat museum and they
said it was because of cars because when
you get into a car
if you have a big hat with a feather on
top then it's going to get squashed by
the top of the car
yeah all knocked off as you get in and
you have to replace your hat at the end
of every car journey you go oh
on the road somewhere and also there was
actually quite a strong campaign
this was in america where they thought
they were going to widen the market
there was a really strong protection of
birds movement in america which i didn't
know about
this was around the turn of the 20th
century and these two women harriet
hemingway and minna hall
led this campaign against hat plumes
which were
all the rage and they used to hold these
big swires and invite loads of women
to their parties and then persuade them
not to
have bird feathers on their hats and it
really worked and it ended up being
banned in massachusetts to
have um feathers used in the bird trade
on your hats
and so that kind of screwed the industry
too yeah um
does anyone have stuff just more
generally on ostriches yeah
yeah oh great dad you sounded like you
were really up for it so let's hear it
yep uh so ostriches
are so fast they're ridiculously fast so
they've got a land speed that they can
reach the top speed of 43 miles per hour
which is
insane and it's too fast even for them
to be able to
work out what to do like if it was us
running we would lose all control and
this is where the feathers and their
wings come into huge
use they act as basically rudders for
them as they're running
so when they reach these speeds they can
bring their wings up and they can
zigzag using their wings to sort of push
them in directions with the wind against
them clever
yeah it's extraordinary and they can
break suddenly um by pushing their wings
out and using their feathers to sort of
break the wind on them
it's it's an incredible thing but that
is so fast
have we talked about their penises it's
not yet but i think everyone knew it was
coming
okay great so very few birds have
penises
uh three percent of bird species the
males have a penis but ostriches are
among them
but when they have an erection
what do you think it's full of uh blood
right there we go it's not blood they've
got blood
obviously they're not saying australians
don't have but they don't fill their
penises with it to get an erection
they fill it with lymphatic fluid sand
just thinking what they have around
that's a very uncomfortable experience
for the lady ostrich i think
if it's full of sound um no they they're
full of lymphatic fluid which is so
weird and there's a big problem
because it lymphatic fluid in an ostrich
body is under much lower pressure
than blood their lymph fluid pressure is
much lower than their blood pressure
and what this means is that they can
keep an erection for a few seconds
maximum oh wow it's a real problem and
so
it means all mating is incredibly short
because it just
as soon as they've got an erection they
have to have sex or they're not going
through that all the males are
constantly apologizing
but all the females are constantly going
no it honestly is completely normal
how quickly can they get an erection
again
after they've deflated uh unclear not
sure
you think it's like an up and down sort
of i think it's like when you're trying
to blow up a balloon
and you get that initial and then it
goes back down because you've lost
breath
you've still you can go right back into
it right so
oh dan you've got to keep you got to
pinch your fingers over the seal when
you bring it up okay
sorry are we talking about ostrich
penises our balloons now
[Laughter]
oh um i'll go to your next children's
party then the thing
is that ostriches do get turned on by
humans there was a study done quite
recently which won an egg nobel prize
and it was that uh both male and female
ostriches do
way more mating dances and movements
when there are humans nearby
this is in farmed ostriches i should say
so it seems that they find
the farmers attractive and it makes them
feel a bit more
amorous and the guy who worked this out
was
a scientist called charles paxton um but
we have mentioned his work before
because he was also the person who
worked out
that a lot of people who saw sea
monsters actually saw the penis
of a whale yes because whales mate in
threesomes and there's always one spur
penis floating around
and that's it theory could be the idea
where um sea monsters come from
what does this guy's cv look like
[Laughter]
that's so cool um they've got really big
eggs
ostriches obviously big bird big eggs
makes sense
um do you know how long it takes to cook
an ostrich egg hard-boiled
uh hard-boiled yeah an hour one hour
yeah good guess yeah it's it's about an
hour and a half
roughly to uh coconuts i like drying a
little bit softer actually oh well there
you go
perfect um i found that out on the on a
bbc website that gave
recipes for boiling different kinds of
eggs so the next closest that they had
on the list was a goose egg which takes
roughly
13 minutes to hard boil so that's in
terms of size difference that's uh
just gives you an idea how big they are
but what's weird is they have
incredibly tiny eggs in relation to
their body size
so they should have much larger eggs um
than they do but yeah you could argue
that they have the smallest eggs in the
animal kingdom
in the bird kingdom right yes yeah
compared to their body size
yeah yeah oh wow because yeah actually
when they're born they are
surprisingly cute because they're so
tiny but also creepily fast so when
they're
three weeks to a month old they look
microscopic but they can already run at
50 kilometers an hour
[Laughter]
i was reading the other day this is off
topic but um this was about a guy who
saw an insect
called a deer buttfly and it was in the
early 20th century i think
and he wrote he was an entomologist and
he wrote that um he'd seen this buttfly
flying at 300 yards per second
no if that was true and this was it they
reported it in the new york times
it was such a fast insect they were like
this guy is about the fastest insects
ever
uh and it turns out now that we've found
other deer buttflies and they don't fly
nearly as they fight
quite fast but not that fast because
that is so fast that
if it was in a 100 meter race with usain
bolt
it would have reached the end before
usain bolt had been able to react
to the gun
how on earth was this guy claiming to
measure that how fast was he running
yeah he claimed he was keeping up with
it enough
exactly what he's seen is two bot flies
that's what he's seen that's very that's
impressive in its own way
but um what do you think he saw a
butterfly then traveled 20 miles home
it's you again

[Applause]
okay it's time for our final fact of the
show and that
is anna my fact this week is that
according to kellogg's
tony the tiger is an adult cartoon
a boy wow i think it's because he's
naked
so it's obscene i can't uh picture him
because i can't picture anything but on
the boxes do you only see his top half
then is that no you get his phone
yeah he's really buff as well and he's
naked do you see yes
you don't see his no no i thought you
didn't see his top i'm gonna have to
look at that has he got like a bowl of
cornflakes over his genitals
actually he has no genitals
of course he doesn't he's a cartoon
character he's been spayed
he has been saying when you get spayed
they don't cut your penis up
so what did i pay for
but hang on adam with your shock there
name a single cartoon character for
children
whose penis is hanging out dan i think
we've established
tony the tiger is not for children but
some of them are trousers right some of
them wear trousers so
you would assume that they uh
[Laughter]
okay let's be clear actually about why
he's an adult cartoon because it's not
really to do with the pornographic
elements
uh this is about the government trying
to reduce sugar in children's cereals so
in 2017 the government said that by 2020
this year
sugary products that targeted children
should have voluntarily
but still should have reduced their
sugar content by 20
and so kellogg's tried it out with
frosties uh
took 20 of the sugar out i think there
was sort of a tasting thing and everyone
went well this is absolutely disgusting
and so rather than take the sugar out
they actually sort of rebranded frosties
as an adult
cereal and so the argument was that
they're not targeting children with
frosties
and they've removed all children's
advertising like anything on the pack
that aims at children
and they've said that there was a
spokesperson actually this year
speaking on behalf of kellogg's who said
that with frosties
they're recruiting new shoppers into the
brand and in particular adult shoppers
under 28 years old in the pre-life
family stage and so
that was their defense and they said
that they'd done some research and found
out that most of the people who eat
frosties are millennials
did they they've i don't know how
rigorous the
stats that they've got are but they
certainly say that um
yeah their research tells them that it's
mostly millennials i read it i read it i
think it was in the article in the
telegraph about this
where they said that um it was only one
in five
people who eats frosties as a child but
then the telegraph did also point out
that one in five people in the uk is a
child
so that's basically the same proportion
although so that makes sense that it's
not targeting children if it's the same
proportion as the
population that makes sense but it also
means that they're targeting
children as well as adults right you're
right they're sort of targeting everyone
although apparently millennials have
changed the way the cereals are
advertised now because
we are eating them more i suppose there
was that cereal cafe that made a big
hoo-ha in
shoreditch or somewhere but they've
started advertising
cereals to not be eaten at breakfast
because the idea is that millennials
don't have time in the morning to eat
cereal
so if you watch adverts now then i think
there's one with them sitting with tony
the tiger on a sofa
these two blokes and it's obviously a
mid-afternoon
and they're watching some telly and
eating some cereal
how can you tell it's mid-afternoon
they're watching pointless
[Laughter]
so there were other uh rival figures for
tony the tiger it could have been katie
the kangaroo or el movie elephant or
newt the gnu
hmm either those were all rejected i
just think newt the gnu
is is a bad character it was rejected so
that's fair enough but it's not
alliterative
unless you don't pronounce the g in gdu
and also what kind of maniac would not
pronounce the g
that's the most fun letter to say and
also
he's named after another animal that's a
very good point it's just i'm not
surprised i didn't go with it it's all
i'm saying
i think newt will have known from the
start he was doomed i mean because also
young children i'm not sure how familiar
they are with the
gnu as an animal as opposed to the tiger
yeah but that's a failing in education
that's not the fault of the cereal firm
they also were going to go for henry the
hermit crab
um but when he reached his penis out of
his house
[Laughter]
have you heard of big mix no um what do
you mean
sorry big mix is mick is that
mick apostrophe s or is that a mix of
things
it's mixed with two x's and big has two
g's just so you know wait a minute
is this the parents of little mix
that's absolutely right it was a serial
released in 1990 by kellogg's and it
sounds absolutely horrific
it was multiple different cereals all
mixed together in the same box
so wow i mean pretty weird but the
brexit
they had their own mascot which was
called big mix and it was a chicken wolf
moose pig
and basically they've got this horrific
crossbred island of dr moreau animal on
the front of the box
it's a cryptid basically of cereals that
was terrifying
it's frightening also not for children
um
you know serial mascots uh i challenge
anyone to name a famous female cereal
mascot
oh okay um one of the rice crispy elves
is there anything else crackle and pork
come on do you think one of them's a gal
i think they're all remember no oh wow
that's really right there's a wikipedia
list of all the cereal mascots
there is not a single famous mascot
let me try a few more guesses oh yeah
you think you're going to beat wikipedia
here
no so wow that's amazing incredible
i mean i know this probably isn't the
hill that i should die on feminism
feminism-wise but
let's get a gal on the front of a cereal
box women can eat cornflakes too
katie the kangaroo i guess would have
been your closest then uh
that we know of in this conversation
that's true and she was the runner up
yeah
she was down to the it was down to the
last two they got rid of newt the gnu
and elmo the elephant pretty quickly but
katie the kangaroo was the second last
in the running things could have been so
different
guys not very we could have brought down
the patriarchy with
the kangaroo in japan they're obviously
mad about mascots yeah um and the term
for it is yurochara
and you had three fundamental components
to what made up a urochara
so the three things where it must convey
a strong message of love for one's
hometown
its movement should be unique and
unstable
or awkward and it should be
unsophisticated or laid back
and lovable and it's such a big deal
that they
since about 2010 created the urachara
grand prix which is
all of the mascots come together to be
named the ultimate
japanese mascot oh i thought you're
gonna say it's a race because they have
that in
like soccer teams football teams in
england have like uh
every year they have a grand national of
mascots where they're all running
against each other unlike really
cool do they yeah and the thing is like
some of them
some of the mascots is just a novel
quite fit
human being with a big head on them and
then some of them are in a massive
costume that you can hardly move in so
it's just completely unfair
but yeah you guys who like football will
know about west bromwich's boilerman
won't you much better than i do which i
hadn't seen before but that's terrifying
it's a boiler with arms and legs because
they're sponsored by boiler company yeah
it's so funny i remember seeing that
when it happened it was on twitter and i
thought this has to be
a hoax because westbrook were quite a
big football team
it was so weird boilers i mean boilers
keep you warm
they're they're cuddly they keep you
lame and cozy in your head they're
awkward
yeah you said they had to be yeah um you
can make a lot of money
by being a mascot i didn't realize that
if you were the mascot for
say a football team or an america a
baseball team basketball team
uh huge amounts of money because it's
it's usually
one person who's got the gig it's not
necessarily tens of
uh you know i assumed it's a new person
whoever is free on the day
jumping in america for sure they make a
lot of money yeah because it's not just
the
actual games and you know they they
there's a lot of games particularly for
like basketball and
well like every sport there's a lot of
games per season but it's also the
private events that they get hired out
for and public space events like in
malls
and they're actually they're in a very
privileged sporting position in america
at the moment because
they are one of the only spectators that
are allowed to watch
uh sporting matches at the moment so
while all the stands are empty the uh
the mascots inside
they're you know very covert proof
that's got to qualify as ppe
we need to get more supplies of mascot i
would i would be very unhappy in
hospital
if i saw you know fred the
gnu the boiler guy coming up
hi mr schreiber i'm here to deliver your
wife's baby
have you heard of cyril the swan is he
from swansea
yes mascot of swansea city and an
absolute thug by all accounts
um so in 2001 he got into a fight with
millwall's
zampa the lion tore off the lion's head
and kicked it into the crowd
before shouting don't with the
swans at the headless lion
um find a thousand pounds for that was
he the one there was one who got into a
fight with
three little pigs was that him i don't i
don't actually know if it was him
he has got form though so he has been
accused of throwing pork pies at west
ham fans
um pushing over a dog mascot he has a
he's had a touchline band which is quite
a big thing isn't it it's quite serious
to be
back on the touchline and he was
represented at his after attacking zampa
the lion
he was represented at the welsh fa
hearing by the same lawyer who defended
eric cantona
after he kicked a fan and
he said wow is he actually raising
awareness about how dangerous swans can
be
he's not raising any awareness because
uh his wikipedia page says as a mute
swan he doesn't give interviews
maybe he is in character and he just
goes around breaking people's arms
[Laughter]
with a single blow of his wing sorry
could we go back to i can't i can't let
this
sit uh not talked about um can we talk
about these three little pigs that you
mentioned very quickly
does anyone have information on that
because i can't really remember it but
there was definitely a big
fight between three pigs and one of the
mascot
and i can't remember who the other i
don't think it was a swan i think
bristol city were involved but
surely it would have been a wolf if it
wasn't a wolf mascot
yeah who blew down you're three stadiums
you're so it must have been i'm sorry i
can't remember do you
do you know who won because presumably
that's three adult
men in the pig costumes so that's a
three on one situation
okay i've gotta google it okay so
it was um a wolf you're right so you
must be able to guess which
football team it was uh wolverhampton
yeah so it was wolverhampton wondrous
mascot wolfy
and bristol city happened to have three
mascots called the three little pigs
but actually no the three little pigs
were only there
on that day to promote a local double
glazing firm
just happened to be on the day that the
wolf turned up
[Laughter]
and all four uh mascots were sent off in
disgrace
oh my goodness that is hilarious that's
so funny
what was the second house built out of
there was one of those i know there was
one of the bricks
it was six one of sticks one of bricks
and one of ostrich feathers
[Laughter]
[Music]
dust free the first mascot ever
was by some accounts a virgin woman
called bettina
this is where the word mascot came from
so it was popularized by this play
called mascot in 1880 and at the time it
was a friend mascot was a french word
for like bewitchment or a spell
and mascot was about this virgin called
bettina
who turned up to a farm and so said to
this farmer look i'm blessed as long as
no one shags me and i remain a virgin
then your farm will be really lucrative
and there's basically this play about
this woman having to remain a virgin
so that the crops would all grow and it
actually ends with her losing her
virginity guys
and as a result no women have ever been
allowed to be a serial mascot again
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening if you'd
like to get in contact with any of us
about the things that we've said over
the course of this podcast we can be

[Applause]
[Music]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with james harkin
anna tsuzinski and andrew hunter murray
and once again
we have gathered around the microphones
with our four favorite facts from the
last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with you anna my fact this week
is that golden moulds shine in all the
colors of the rainbow and they'll never
know it
wow it's what a tragic fact
is it because they're they're stupid
they don't they don't even know their
moles
they don't know their moles they don't
have a concept of color they don't know
what a rainbow is
there's a lot of reasons why but it made
me wonder if there were things that we
don't know about
you know i mean it's like i'm weird
we're not smart enough to know
what they are so it could be that there
are amazing
colors that no one knows what they are
that we give off or smells
yeah so dog dogs are doing a podcast
saying did you know humans smell
exactly like i don't know rotting
mushrooms and they'll never know it
they've got the word written on
their foreheads
anyway so back to the old moles i read
about them in this fantastic article
in the london review of books it's by
catherine rundle and this is about the
golden mole and it's the first known
iridescent mammal so iridescent means it
like it shimmers like you know when you
spill petrol
um or in soap bubbles or a pigeon's neck
so they have this amazing fur which is a
very specific structure which reflects
and reflects light in a way that
causes this rainbow effect to happen but
they are totally
blind so usually iridescence in nature
is for attracting mates or maybe
warning off a predator to suggest that
you're poisonous but this serves
absolutely no purpose whatsoever
they're underground almost the whole
time they're they they do have eyeballs
weirdly
we think the optic nerve isn't really
functioning anymore they have eyeballs
but their eyeballs are covered with skin
and fur
so aren't doing that much good so yeah
they'll never know
and then we think that it's possibly to
repel water
um this particular sheen or it could be
to help them
skid through holes when they're digging
holes in the sun they can go really
quickly because they have these amazing
like scale like things on them
but the color is just a byproduct of
that right yeah
it's one of those um accidental bits of
evolution which are surprisingly rare
exactly so they're they've evolved to
have this very specific structure to
make them slippery
and it happens so that's all rainbow as
well so they live
in the deserts of southern africa and
i've seen videos of them and how they
travel
through the sand but what's really funny
is when you're watching the videos is
they they swim through the sand very
close to the surface
so you know where they're going it's
like someone trying to escape jail by
digging a tunnel
but doing it right at the surface so you
always know where they are
but they're really cool the way they um
the way they hunt because i think we may
have seen the same thing dan they
they come out of the ground and then
they hunt because they're blind they
hunt by listening to the
animals passing nearby and they're
mostly eating little insects and things
and the thing is they can hear a lot
better through sand than they can
through air
so they'll just completely plunge their
head into a pile of sand
just to check where their prey is and
then they'll they'll get a hero of its
footsteps and then they'll move that way
it's really funny they have in your ear
you have three little bones you might
remember like the hammer the anvil and
the stirrup
and their hammer is massive it's like
thor's hammer inside their head it's 10
000 times bigger than our hammer in our
head
and the way that this helps them is when
there are vibrations that come into
their head
it resonates and it makes the sound way
way louder
which means they can hear specific
frequencies really really well
and so they can hear the frequency which
is about the same as
wind rustling through grass and they can
hear that specific frequency really
really well
so when they're going around they can
just listen to where these tufts of
grass are
and why is that useful because that's
where the insects live so they just hear
this specific sound of
wind going through grass they know
exactly where it is and they head
straight for it and they get their
termites it's so clever
not not so useful in the deserts of
southern africa
what do you mean well it's sandy yes but
they have
they have little tubs of grass in the
desert right
and in those in those tufts of grass
that's where the termites live the
termites don't live in the sand they
live underneath the grass where there's
a little bit of soil
so that's exactly where they need to get
to there aren't many of them around
you're right but
it would be pretty silly for them to
evolve this incredible ability in a
bone ten thousand times the size of ours
if they lived in a completely
featureless environment it would be
afraid
it would be stupid if they evolved so
they could only hear ice cream fans for
instance
because you don't get many ice cream
vans there but you do get tufts of grass
yeah god i bet they've killed for an ice
cream van though that's true
there's one part of their body that's a
lot smaller than
the bone in their middle ear okay which
is massive
it's their penis so
this is the disadvantage of being a
golden mole and it's very important to
them so there is a
hot and golden mole that's one of the
species names
and females prefer males with bigger
penises and the reason for that is that
they have no other means of
differentiating between males
they're all underground they're all
blind there's no way of telling who's an
appropriate mate or not apart from penis
size
and the whole penis is approximately
a millimeter and a half long it's not
huge proportionally is that okay it's
still still tiny
proportionally it's still small it is
quite yeah
and they don't even have a scrotum so
they can't be judged on that so
the whole penis is between 1.2 and 2.5
millimeters long
which is i mean just to be clear we're
not judging them on anything are we andy
well speak for yourself i am just judge
judge
there's not many people and you can
judge on this particular metric
but the one millimeter penis golden bowl
you better
those idiots with their even smaller
penises
just
[Laughter]
oh my god um i was reading the other day
in fact this might have been something
that was written by you andy i'm not
sure about scrotums
and about how um all mammals used to
live
sorry has andy been publishing scrotum
papers in the background of this podcast
it's about how they're much too big
and they make perfectly reasonable
penises look small
right it was about how all mammals used
to live
um used to be nocturnal and used to hunt
at night
and um the reason was one of the reasons
was it was much colder at night
and if you're in the daytime it was too
hot
and if you didn't have a scrotum your
testicles would be inside your body and
they get too hot and so one of the
things that allowed mammals to
live during the day was scrotums because
then the testicles hung outside which is
a bit cooler which meant they could
spend time in the sunshine
oh wow so without scrotums we'd all be
living at night
so that's very cool yeah yeah great
hurry was that one of your papers andy
you don't seem to have a very good
memory of it if it was
all right so to be honest all right so
many papers
but uh it's hard to differentiate them
do they even like mating though because
they're super anti-social in fact
all all males are already antisocial
aren't they but golden moles don't
hang out together at all massive loners
and i think they're quite bad
parents again in common with normal
moles which after they're
when their kids are just a couple of
weeks old i think they literally take
them in the burrow they shove them up to
the top
and then they seal the entrance so wow
that baby is just then stranded
they've got a bugger off you could say
the golden balls they are the massive
loners with the tiny boners
that's how you can remember what they
are yeah yeah
that's a tug like this that's what
you're chanting as you go through the
desert bullying
[Laughter]
oh yeah moles like actual moles um
you're right they're really they are
loners um
they don't like to go anywhere near each
other and each animal has a territory
which is about the size of
a football pitch whoa that's a lot isn't
it
for each for one mole that is a lot of
greedy
it's a lot of real estate that's insane
we should say yeah the golden mole
is extremely mole like and i think it
should be a mole because it does
everything that hmongs do
but it's actually not an official mole
it's miles away from it on the taxonomic
tree and they're more closely related to
elephants
than they are to moles and in fact
according to the wikipedia page
uh it's at the moment classified as a
chrysochloride but that's under review
so we're kind of unclear where we put
them on the evolutionary what does that
mean it just means that they're
classified as something
but we're not really sure where they are
and you know we might move them to
another bit of the tree um the wikipedia
page on them is really good
i don't know who wrote it but some real
expert i guess you would have to be an
expert on the golden mall to write about
it
yeah no but some you know it's
i just shout out to wikipedia because
it's very clearly written and
comprehensive
it also has this fact which i loved they
have
only one toe on each forefoot which has
evolved into the shape of a pickaxe
and all the other toes on their front
feet have kind of withered away
um so they are so efficient at digging
through
uh the sand that they need to get cool
yeah yeah
and that that actually is a bit
different to moles isn't it because
moles have those
kind of big paddles on their feet where
they push through the sand but the
golden ones because they
swim more like a shark they've got to be
slick yeah they're sometimes known as
the shark of the dunes aren't they
are they yeah and i think that's because
like dan says they're so close to the
surface
they've probably got one of their
pickaxes sticking up so you can or maybe
even though one millimeter penis
sticking up
out of the sand so you can see that's
when we're doing backstroke
i've just got one thing on them on moles
in 1519
a community in italy launched a massive
court case against
moles on the grounds that they were
damaging crops
and you can read the full sort of
transcript of what the attorney's
arguments were against and for the moles
and so the attorney for the defense of
the moles the moles couldn't come to
court
so the attorney spoke for them in
absentia said they confer
all these benefits uh so they destroy
noxious insects for instance
and he eventually argued successfully
that if they are sentenced to be exiled
they should be found a suitable place of
abode and
have safe conduct on the way there to
secure them from harm from cats and dogs
etc
and the judge is there and you can read
his ruling where he did in fact agree
the moles were to be exiled
but they were given safe conduct and any
pregnant mole or more with young
children had an extra 14 days
to leave the community there's no
evidence as to how this was
actually enforced afterwards quite often
what happened with those kind of things
is they would say
okay well like let's say for instance
rats um
there are rats here we need to get rid
of them so we're going to make a law to
say they have to go within 14 days
and then when they haven't got in 14
days they go okay well we gave you a
chance
we're now going to exterminate you yeah
there's like killing god's creatures
isn't it you have to give because
you you shouldn't be destroying too much
of god's creation without having legal
authority to do it
mole prison would be amazing though that
would be a really fun um
thing to film because obviously they'd
all just tunnel away immediately
yeah yeah the great escape would be a
much longer film

okay on with the show on with the show
okay
it is time for fact number two and
that's my fact my fact this week is that
mozart and beethoven both compose music
for an instrument made entirely of glass
it was invented
by benjamin franklin benjamin franklin
invented what was an incredible
instrument
hugely popular in the 1700s and
so massive that it was used by some of
the biggest composers of the day i had
no idea there was a connection between
franklin
and say mozart and beethoven that's like
um
you know come on franklin's connected to
everyone he was the girls brand
i mean he knew everyone he did
everything
so dan why don't you tell us about this
glass instrument was it like a violin
made of grass or a drum made of glass
that wouldn't work
yeah so it's called an armonica and
effectively it's kind of like a glass
piano so franklin in the in the 1700s
was um
seeing a lot of people play glass bowls
that are tuned to notes which you still
see a lot of people doing you know that
thing with a wine glass if you lick your
finger and you run
you run it over the lid and it yeah
basically when the conversation dries up
enough in a wedding
everyone starts doing that tonight yes
exactly and so
he thought this is really beautiful
music and you can see people making
tunes out of it the problem is
is that if you were going to play that
at a gig you have to line up 50 glasses
it's not practical
because you could smash one and suddenly
that's your c note gone so what he did
was he created an instrument whereby
he had a glass blower in london um turn
it into
effectively like a piano that you that
you play and just to say when you play
it it works by
a foot pedal right so he made it
horizontal so you'd have the glasses
standing up vertically so you have to
hold them down with one hand and
we've all done it at dinner parties uh
but he put them horizontally and
attached them all in a row and then you
spun them around constantly with a foot
pedal so i think you just had to sort of
if you touched it with your hands it
would be constantly spinning yeah but
then i can't work out where you put the
jar
of water i must watch a video of it
because you've got to keep moistening
your hands to keep it working
so presumably you have to keep dipping
like a finger bowl yeah you have to do
that although
quite soon afterwards there was a new
version that was made like an
improvement
where there was a little trough of water
underneath the glasses so when they span
they kind of got moistened by themselves
which is quite clever that's
that's crafty um it went from being a
hugely popular instrument
to suddenly a lot of controversy because
people started noticing a few things
about it and reporting that
it was sending people mad oh yeah that's
right yeah and
and that um in some cases a few deaths
were
off the back of supposedly off the back
of it and
suddenly books were publishing that this
was a dangerous instrument and then
suddenly they were saying it was the
most dangerous instrument in the world
and it's reputation
yeah it's extraordinary it basically
fake news took it down
as an instrument and there was a lot of
theory that possibly
there's a bit of truth to why people
were sent mad which was off the back of
the instrument itself and licking your
fingers on an instrument
no okay so that was so the theory was
that there was
there were crystal balls and they were
they were on this harmonica spindle
and they uh they contained some lead and
some people thought
maybe the lead from the bowls because
you you can play with both hands you can
if you haven't brought enough spam you
can play ten notes at the same time it's
quite impressive
and people thought you can maybe absorb
lead into you
um into your fingers that kills you blah
blah lead poisoning however
it has also been pointed out that this
is unbelievably unlikely
because at the time that the armonica
was being played doctors widely
prescribed massive doses of lead for
various ailments
food was preserved with lead oxide food
was cooked in lead pots
people drank from lead vessels the like
the main
lead risk in the 18th century was not
the glass harmonica
instrument yeah yeah i think it's just
because it was spooky
it's it's makes really ethereal noise
and also
it was used by podcast favorite friends
mesmer
wasn't it so he used to go around
mesmerizing people we've talked about
him before hypnotizing people
and he used the harmonica because it
does make this very
ghostly noise and so it was associated
with hypnotizing
ladies it's always ladies
[Laughter]
constant 19th century panic that
anything women did
that might be slightly challenging or
might slightly encroach on the world of
men
must send them mad and cause them to
faint so they should be banned from
doing it
but actually all the best um players of
this instrument were women right
so absolutely the first person to
publish a book about it was called
ann ford she published it in
um she was married to a friend of
gainsborough who was called philip
thickness which is quite a good name uh
and she
was the person who actually came up with
the idea of turning the glasses into an
actual instrument whether franklin took
the idea from her and did it or whether
they came up with independently i don't
know but there was also someone called
marianne davis who is the most famous
player probably in the whole of europe
and she went around europe and toured it
and like mozart
met her and um mesmer i think watched
her play and then decided to bring it
into his mesmerization and stuff so she
was super famous
yeah there was there was a double
marianne it was a marianne sandwich
um although not with anything in the
middle because she was the one who
popularized it in europe and then
maybe the best player of ever ever was
this german lady called marianne kirch
gessner
and mozart towards the end of his life
wrote lots of stuff specifically for her
on the harmonica
and actually when he died he was in the
middle of writing her another piece and
she was very famous she was another jazz
brand she sort of knew everyone like
gerta and hayden and
um but she maybe there was some truth to
the harmonica
cursing people because she had because
she's dead
she's dead yeah in fact all of the
people who played in the 18th century
all dead
but marianne kirchgesner was assaulted
by napoleon soldiers in 1806
and she never really recovered from that
so that was more the cause of her
nervous breakdown i think rather than
than the instrument yeah there's a great
line about it
from 1786 this is a german player called
carl rolig
he said that the harmonica could make
women faint
send a dog into convulsions make a
sleeping girl wake
screaming through a cord of the
diminished seventh and even caused the
death of one very young
and that was a guy who played it for a
living recommendation i think someone
actually did die didn't they
at the time that someone was playing
good glass harmonica and it was like a
cause and effect thing everyone was like
oh my god it must have been
glass harmonica that caused it and that
was like the start of the big sort of
banning it they banned it in churches
and stuff like that didn't they in
germany
so dan you mentioned that franklin
picked up this glass harmonica idea by
watching people play
musical wine glasses and he actually did
that
in britain so in britain and ireland
this was an extremely popular
musical instrument before franklin made
it vaguely acceptable to the rest of the
world
there would be concert halls that filled
out with people just spinning their
fingers around wine glasses and
the most famous player was this amazing
guy called richard puckridge
or popcritch uh you know there are
various spellings but
have you guys read about him he's
amazing he's amazing i love him he's the
best
he's super fun so he was a
self-proclaimed inventor of musical
glasses
he um spent he had all sorts of crazy
ideas for how to make his fortune so he
designed wings for human
flight i don't think they took off um
he said he had this idea he wrote this
paper about how
you could regain youth by injecting
yourself with the blood of young maids
and so he recommended blood transfusions
between young maids and anyone over 60
um just on that so when he came up with
that idea people took him quite
seriously some people
and there was a big kind of hoo-ha in
the burial industry
and the funeral industry because they
were like well if people are gonna live
forever
then what are we gonna do for a living
and so
he supposedly agreed that everyone who
was having this treatment would sign a
contract
that as soon as they reached 999 years
old they would have to pay a funeral
company for the price of a burial
wow i think i think they discussed that
in parliament didn't they that was their
token nod
but what did the funeral people do for
the first 900 years
i think they discussed that in
parliament didn't they that was their
token nod
his ridiculous idea i liked he had an
account once of doing a concert where
three hours before the performance uh he
was going to do a concert on his glasses
which are always quite fragile and three
hours before the performance a large
unmanly pig
entered the room and smashed the whole
machine to pieces oh
that's an excuse for someone who hasn't
done the homework hasn't learned the
piece that they're going to need to play
they have a brilliant brainwave they
think get me a pig
sorry a pig at my instrument it's like
there was another thing i saw it was a
newspaper article uh he took out an
advert to apologize because he'd done a
concert that everyone thought was
terrible
and the advert said mr potrich takes
this opportunity to apologize to the
public for their disappointment
he added a glass too much to his
instrument
and i can't tell whether that means he
put one glass in there and it meant all
his notes were off or whether it's a
euphemism for i got really pissed and i
couldn't do the concerts
it sounds like i think it's that yeah
yeah that's true that's so good
another banned instrument uh during the
early 1900s was the saxophone
nazi germany banned it um they saw it as
a symbol of jazz so it wasn't that it
was turning you into
a different um mental state it was it
was purely
uh that they didn't like it at all but
um churches banned it as well in the
early 1900s
the vatican banned it in 1914 and i just
love
i've never thought of a saxophone being
in the vatican church
[Music]
solo um what an image but uh yeah they
banned it so um
maybe we'll never get to see it
obviously there was the thought that it
suggested um and promoted sexual dancing
so that was a
that was a thing that they wanted to
avoid as well that is like a church
sort of banning gangster rap in churches
though isn't it
it's like people going yeah we're not we
weren't going to do this anyway guys
don't worry about it
it's like me as a 14 year old banning
supermodels from my birthday party there
was never
any prospect
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
andy my fact is that envelopes used to
be made
of clay
so that must have been a hard job being
a postman in those days right
yeah so this is um we're used to
envelopes being made of paper obviously
that's what we think of as the classic
material for them but it's not it's not
the original
so this is um in babylonian
uh era times in 2000 bc give or take
um what you would do if you were writing
a message to someone you would write a
message on
a clay tablet and that would dry
and then that would be the thing that
you were sending but you wouldn't send
that just open because anyone could read
it so you needed an envelope and to make
that you would put more wet clay over
the tablet press the ends together to
seal it
and then you put the whole thing in a
kiln bake it and then you send that
massive baked package of clay and the
recipient has to smash it open
the outer envelope uh to receive the
tablet that's on the inside
that's what you do that's a pretty
exciting way of opening a letter isn't
it
smashing it with a hammer yeah i always
think like sometimes i rip the end off
an envelope
to get the inside rather than opening it
up with the seal
and i always think i'm pretty cool when
i do that but this is just imagine yeah
this is the next level
yeah imagine what fun you would have had
but people's birthdays must have been
thursday you just spent
about six hours beating away at clay
there really aren't very many samples of
these things around because obviously
they were designed to be smashed
on delivery there are some thank
goodness but yeah because um pierce
fletcher the producer of qei's got one
yeah he bought one when he was in i
think he was in iraq or something
many many years ago but he bought one uh
it's dated to 2028 bc he knows when it's
dated to
uh and he says you can see the
thumbprint left of the person who put it
in the kiln
on the thing which gives it some kind of
human touch but
he says that it was an invoice for a
consignment of animal fodder
which is not exactly the most exciting
thing because no one none of us can read
cuneifond which is what it was written
in right so he might as well have said
it was a love letter to someone or
something
they very rarely were they weren't they
it was all accounting
um i'm glad you clarified why he has it
because genuinely i thought that was
just a dig at pierce fletcher's age
because he is a middle-aged man
i just thought you're claiming that's
happening he got it for his 21st
birthday
he's got a few of them yeah
um didn't it used to be the case as well
that a lot of these and it was
sumerian and and babylonian wasn't it
and they'd have
the same stuff written on the outside as
on the inside
so a lot of the time they were used as a
protection against fraud and so these
are the very oldest ones
basically you'd have a record of a
transaction like i've sold you this many
bumblebees for this many
dinars and you put that in your play
and then you sealed it up and then you
wrote exactly the same thing
on the envelope and the way it worked
was when the recipient got it if there
was a dispute over whether the envelope
had been tampered with
then you smashed it open to check the
inside
it was to make sure they were the same
inside and out because otherwise you
could melt the clay
soften it and then change put an extra
zero on like i wanted this many dinars
very great all this many beads exactly
yeah it's
very open to sweet you get a lot of
envelopes um that you can see
in like postage museums that have got
holes punched in them
and that's because they used to fumigate
them when there were uh pandemics and
when there were diseases going around
so like for instance when there was
yellow fever around people would put
little holes in
and they would fire like formaldehyde
gas or smoke or whatever to try and kill
the
kill the pathogens and if you send a
letter to
any zip code in america that begins 202
203 204 or 205
then it will be irradiated before it
gets there
and that's because they are the zip
codes of washington dc around the
federal agencies
and they go to a special place where
they're put on a conveyor belt
and they're fired radiation at them
which will kill any bacteria any viruses
anthrax all that kind of stuff
then they're aired out and then they're
sent so if you're donald trump and you
get a letter
it's gonna be quite faded and crispy and
a little bit yellow
that's all all his mail is going to be a
little bit like that because it's gone
through this process
yeah it's so cool and that was a
response wasn't it to the um
the anthrax spores that they were put in
the post in washington about 2001
and five people died and you know there
were lots of facilities contaminated so
this is kind of their way of dealing
with that
yeah yeah apparently people who work at
the royal mail say one of the
serious problems they have the sorters
who have to sort through the envelopes
is that people don't seal their
envelopes and there's lots of
complaining about this online and they
say it's very annoying because often you
have to match a card with its envelope
and it's hard to do
i imagine there are lots of sort of
mis-sent things where the wrong card's
been put in the wrong
envelope and they don't know why people
do it but there's speculation
that it's based on the old paper rate so
this was something that was abolished in
1969 but i believe
piers fletcher formally mentioned sender
of uniform tablets
uh does remember it he's posted about
this on the forums before
and this was if you wanted to send
printed matter like newspapers or
pamphlets
it was just to hate me so it was a
reduced price but
you had to send it an unsealed envelope
and then the postman would open the
envelope
check that you hadn't put anything other
than a newspaper in there and then
you know seal the envelope up after that
and if you send a sealed envelope then
you'd have to pay extra
so there's the idea that there are still
some people out there who think that
maybe you'll only have to pay a hate me
if you leave the envelope unsealed
but yeah cheaper who is still paying a
hopefully for their stamps
other than piers fletcher producer of qi
who is doing that
it's hard to say um on the kind of
unexpected antiquity of
things you know the window envelope
and that's the one where you've got a
little plastic windows so you can double
up
you don't need to write the address on
the envelope because it's part of the
letter that you're being sent
you're not going to tell us they did
that with cuneiform tablets are you
no i'm just when do you think that was
invented well
i would say in the 50s thanks james good
guess
the 90s 90s brilliant even better guess
for my purposes
anna i think i think i've got window
envelopes at my house from before the
90s
um i feel like i'd be cheating because i
also researched this
okay okay well hey anna who was writing
window envelopes to you when you were
two years old
and you were in need i was i was a very
professional toddler
wow they were designed first designed in
1901
and patented in 1902 their older than
powered flight
which i find very weird you find it
impressive that we had the technology
envelopes before i've got to say andy do
you think the wright brothers when they
first
flew it kitty hawk everyone went yeah
but it's not a windowed envelope what is
it
come on mate there is a guy in sweden
who's scared of them
he has a phobia of um window envelopes
really
yeah he was in court a few years ago um
basically he'd been driving his scooter
unregistered
uh and without a license and so they
sent him
letters saying you need to pay a fine or
whatever but he says he had a phobia of
window envelopes and so he never opened
any of them
uh and the court partially ruled in his
favor saying
he didn't know what was inside them and
you know he just didn't like these
official things he thought it might be
something really bad
he did get all the money together for
the fine but then this massive
pig came into the room and ate all the
money
so well speaking of eating you used to
be able to eat the window down bloats
didn't you
first um in the original 1902
patent uh the wind just the window bit
was made of rice paper yeah don't eat
the whole envelope
don't eat the whole envelope absolutely
not but that would solve a lot of
problems today because they really
irritate me because they're
not recyclable aren't they because you
can't remember they are they are
recyclable
no this is one of the big modern myths
of society it's the biggest
god anna what have you done you've
destroyed literally millions of windowed
envelopes
i know because you've been getting these
envelopes since you were two years old
um rice paper is not see-through i don't
think it's it's almost see-through but
it's not really see-through
so i think they weren't as good probably
in the open days original patent it was
quite translucent rather trend
rather than transparent also if it gets
wet it just disintegrates
another flaw
well then you can see the address better
so that's actually quite useful
do you know you used to be able to buy
stamps from post boxes wow
this is this is another era that um
producer qy pierce fletcher might
remember this was in the 1930s
and again quite short-lived he does
actually listen to these podcasts and i
just say
no he does going to be so excited james
is going to talk about my babylonian
cuneiform
come round family come round everyone
sit down come around grandchildren great
grandchildren great great grandchildren
great great great grandchildren
um well as you'll remember in the 1930s
uh postboxes were stamped vending
machines and if they had the word stamp
engraved on them
you could put a penny in and you
automatically got two stamps
out of it but they actually were
abolished because they kept on just
eating people's pennies and not
dispensing the stamps
nice idea though very very cool idea um
can i tell you my favorite
envelope story from 2020. yeah of course
we've all got one
yeah so this was in ohio a man called
dan
kane uh was uh went to the post office
to pick up a letter he was expecting
from the college avenue
student loan company um his daughter's
tuition
fee it was a loan repayment scheme that
he was doing so
he went to pick up the letter and when
he got there he was told that there
wasn't one letter for him
but due to an administrative error the
uh
college had sent him not one but 55
000 letters of the exact same letter
wow there were there were 79 bins of
mail that contained roughly 700 copies
of the exact same letter
addressed to him and um he had to bring
them home
he had to take them home with him no
yeah and when he got home
he opened it up to um to you know
actually get the amount because he
needed to pay back this loan
and worked out that the company had
accidentally used the wrong interest
rate and they calculated the payment
wrong
so they were going to have to send him
another letter with the right
amount that's amazing yeah and he worked
out
that roughly it would have cost them
about or someone worked out it would
have cost them 11 000 american dollars
to post it although 1 imagine how much
worse that would have been in the days
of clay envelope
um do you want to know what my favorite
story from 2015 about envelopes is oh
yes
oh yeah i sort of rather have your 2020
one
afraid i don't have one um in 2015
there was a guy in gloucestershire who
got a christmas card
that just said england on the envelope
he was walking down the road and the
postman
said to him i don't suppose you're
expecting anything from germany are you
and he said well i've got a few friends
in germany and he said well
do you want to have a look at this it
just says england on it and he looked
and on the back it was the address
of his friends in germany and he opened
it up and it was a christmas card from
his friends in germany
wow and he said how did you know it was
for me and he said and the person said
oh i was just wandering around i've just
been asking people
millions of people it was from christmas
1993
and he'd finally made it to that town
wasn't that amazing
and what they reckon this is what they
reckon happened
probably it used to have the correct
address on and then it said england at
the bottom but maybe it was on a label
and the label peeled off so it got to
the right area it got the right
post office but it hadn't gotten the
actual final address on it
and so this postman goes well i might as
well just try everyone that i see had
just asked just in case
and he managed to find the right person
excellent i'm just sort of imagining a
guy with a beard down to the floor in
ragged clothes he lost his job 25 years
ago
just stumbling down the road is it you
yeah i found him he eventually opens
it when he's desperate works out it's
for him

stop the podcast stop the podcast
hi everyone we'd like to let you know
that this week we are sponsored by the
great courses plus
that is right the great courses plus is
kind of like going to university from
the comfort of your own
bed uh it's an online streaming service
which streams lots of lectures about all
sorts of subjects from
science to history to literature to food
you can learn
anything you want to learn about on the
great courses plus that's right
and actually when i was at university i
did spend most of the time in bed
so this is a much better way of learning
i would say even
then go to university in the 1990s
because i've looked at some of the
courses that they do i studied science
they have things like what darwin didn't
know the modern science of evolution
that sounds amazing and also
understanding the misconceptions of
science that's quite useful for a qi
writer sure
is 24 lectures and misconceptions
that's the next season written sure is
there really is something for everyone
there and if you want to test it out
then go to the thegreatcoursesplus.com
fish and you can get entire month of
access completely
free so you can try it out that's right
so go to the great courses plus that's p

i s h and get an entire month of access
absolutely free on with the podcast on
with the podcast
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that is
james my fact this week is that in 1939
america made a huge vehicle to drive
across antarctica
unfortunately they put no tread on the
tires so it couldn't drive on ice
amazing it's so cool it's a thing called
the snow
cruiser and they knew that they wanted
to drive across antarctica and they knew
they would need something
absolutely massive to do so because they
wanted to drive
out somewhere and then do a lot of
experiments when they were in there and
so they invented this
enormous machine it was in the middle of
america where they invented i think
somewhere near boston
uh and they had to get it from boston to
the boat and then from the boat to
antarctica and then from the antarctic
boat to the middle of antarctica to do
these things and they got it all the way
to the antarctic and they realized that
the wheels were just spinning around
whenever they tried to go anywhere
they added some chains to it and to try
and get a bit of grip and that was
slightly better
but they found out that the only way
they could get anywhere was to drive the
whole thing in reverse
and so they drove in reverse for 92
miles
to the middle of the antarctic and they
got there and they could start doing
some experiments
but they couldn't really get it back and
so they ended up just leaving it there
so amazing incredible which poor person
had
a horrendously cricked neck
you could just drive anywhere you i mean
you can just drive backwards can't you
you don't need to look around it's
antarctica what are you gonna
do you're gonna bump into penguins or
big lumps of ice
or something right it just sounds
hilarious the process of getting it
there in the first place right there's
this
photo of transporting it because i think
it left from boston but it was made in
chicago maybe it was transported from
chicago
and so to get to boston it had to drive
and it just drove along ordinary roads
and there was this huge
pile up because there's this giant 55
foot long
its wheels are twice three times the
height of a normal car
just sitting in the middle of a motorway
well the cars around it like what the
hell is this yeah
they stopped in a place called
framingham in massachusetts on the way
and they just stopped in the middle of
the road and so there was a traffic jam
of 70 000
cars behind it
um it was cool it had a plane on it it
had a biplane on the roof
for research so it needed to carry a
thousand gallons of fuel just to fuel
the plane
and then it needed obviously thousands
more gallons of fuel all over it
and it had to have two spare tires but
the tires were 10 feet tall
so they were in the back yeah each tire
had to be transported by a dog sled
yeah there's a brilliant picture on the
atlantic uh website of
14 dogs pulling a single tire that just
shows how big it was that they had to do
that and they had to go backwards as
well that was the really
yeah and on that in that article
actually there is a photo of it
abandoned
um just after they decided look we're
not going to take it back
and then there's a later photo where
it's kind of slightly buried by snow
and then there's a final photo where
it's almost completely buried by snow
uh and there's like a little hatch where
people can go in and out
and then someone went back i like in the
40s to see if it was still there and
they could find it and actually it was
kind of
they could still use it really i mean
they couldn't really use it much in the
first place but it was still kind of
working
and they found it again in the 50s in
1958
but now they literally don't know where
it is and it's
probably covered under some snow or it
might have drifted off on an iceberg
or something but we literally don't know
where this thing is wow
it's amazing maybe some penguins have
made it into a home oh that would be
nice wouldn't it
so lovely yeah there's one theory that
the soviets knew where it was and they
went back and stole it
why it's useless guys
do you know the first motorized vehicle
in antarctica as far as i know
uh no um it actually went with
shackleton oh really
yeah so this was in his first antarctic
expedition in 1907 and it was an aral
johnstone car which were the makers of
the first
cars in britain it was basically a big
bit of pr for the car
so quite inconvenient for the actual
expedition
it did have it had skis and it had
special oil that didn't freeze and it
had a silencer on the exhaust that
doubled as a foot warmer
so it siphoned the warm air around to
the front to where your feet are
um but they took it with them and so
they had to bring it on the boat they
had to unload some of their crucial
supplies and
equipment from the boat to make room for
this car they brought it with them they
got it off the boat
put it on the snow and uh much like
james's vehicle he mentioned
they started spinning the wheels and
they just went deeper and deeper into
the snow
uh they they thought okay we'll target
with us for a bit maybe we'll get it
working
they lasted two miles of pulling it
along with them before
shackleton's crew went can we just leave
this chat behind please
they abandoned it in the snow but yeah
first car in the antarctic
there was a car in the antarctic from a
shackleton
uh very recently uh it was patrick
burgle who was
um shackleton's great grandson um you
guys must have read about this it was a
modified hyundai santa fe
um but he actually did manage to get it
working
right so they said that the only
modification was
that they made the tires really really
big
and really really loads of air inside so
it's as much as
you could like it could roll over your
foot and you wouldn't feel it that's how
much air was in the
tires and that meant that it would never
sink into the ground and i
imagine they had a lot of tread on there
as well and they said that basically
this
is exactly like a normal hyundai santa
fe apart from these tires
but then they did say oh there is one
other modification that it runs on jet
fuel
[Laughter]
but the reason is because jet fuel
doesn't freeze quite as
um easily as normal fuel but would that
in that kind of atmosphere um lessen its
punch when you put down
the accelerator yeah they went on the
other average about
20 25 miles an hour i think okay
[Music]
across whether they went to the very end
i think they might have gone to the
middle and back
i bet that was dull i bet it was
exciting for the first couple of hours
and then old shackleton's great grandson
thought what was my
granddad thinking didn't he work as a
tedious he's a marketing executive this
guy
yeah he's not a polar explorer nah no no
he was just he just had to sit in a
passenger seat of a car to be there for
a few weeks they've basically gone we
have a car which can do this
anyone can do it really who can we get
to do it
do any of them have any relatives left
the people who went
um in the first place but they did have
one thing sorry just on this really
quickly um
they did have one thing where they had a
number of these vehicles going across
and they had to be roped together
because like you said they can be
crevasses and apparently one of them did
fall into a crevasse but luckily it was
kind of rope to all the other cars so
they could pull it out
so it was kind of dangerous i think yeah
yeah yeah definitely
that's very self-sacrificing of the
other cars because it could happen the
other way right if the crash is big
enough and you're in the front car and
you've made it over
and then you're dragged back in by the
the tailgaters
what come on anna i mean you're a team
going across antarctic
you're not like i don't have it i'm
in the front car the rest of them can do
what they want yeah
i think we've learned in the touching
the void episode of no such thing as a
fish who's cutting the rope
yeah i don't have the right attitude for
polar expeditions
this fact is about driving backwards uh
i found the guy who's driven backwards
for the longest time
okay there is a taxi driver in india
called harpreed dev who has driven
everywhere
backwards for about a decade now he's uh
does this mean that at the end the um on
your
meter on your taxi he ends up having to
give you money
um so he's been issued with a special
government license to drive anywhere in
reverse in his home state
and he has a he has a big old siren on
his cab to warn people
but it's so surreal seeing footage of
him just driving around backwards all
the time
he's reversed the gearbox so he's got
you know five gears in reverse and one
forward
and he says that the only disadvantage
to this great career he's got
is that he gets frequent pains in the
neck extremely bad back problems and
suffers what he calls severe vomiting
oh man i know the worst thing about that
with the severe vomiting is he's
facing in the direction of his
passengers
[Laughter]
you'd pull the glass window across
i definitely must have missed the detail
there why is he driving backwards sorry
no he didn't no he didn't you did not
miss a detail
he he thought it would be fun and he
thought it would be a fun gimmick
and then despite the dangers of it the
government of the area also thought that
was a great idea and basically gave him
license yeah yeah i think if i could if
one person is doing something extremely
weird and dangerous
but everyone else knows he's doing it at
least that everyone else can mitigate
their actions to
to help him right it's written on the
side of the cab
that this is a backwards taxi i think
you can see that when he's coming
towards you
yeah he did try to drive backwards to
pakistan to promote peace
but he did not have the permission to
cross the border so uh he was sent home
right um the we were talking about
people going across
antarctic um a few seconds ago um the
first person to walk solo across
antarctica
only brought one pair of underwear from
the entire 38-day trip
and unfortunately he himself on day
16.
i'm impressed he held it in that long 14
of antarctic journey
going great so far day 15 still
absolutely not regretting my underpant
decision
day 16. oh no
the thing is before he set off he did an
interview with business insider and he
said that he was only bringing one pair
of underwear and he was going to use
the weight that he could take he was
going to use it for food
so he's like i don't need the underwear
i just need food
which kind of makes sense without the
idea of retrospect
of realizing that it didn't and what
happened was it was the food that was a
problem obviously
is always the food that's the problem in
that situation but um
he shouldn't have taken vin duluth
he took he took these things he was
called colin o'brady and he took these
um 1180 calorie colin bars
that had been made especially for him
and so they had loads of protein loads
of good stuff in them and he was just
going to eat these bars all the way
across
um but one morning he just got the
munchies
and he just started eating all of these
collin bars they could take coconut oil
nuts
dried cranberries cocoa powder and he
decided to eat just loads and loads of
them
and he had about 2 000 calories worth in
one go which is about the equivalent of
eight big macs
uh and then the next morning well you
all know what happened
wow that is not exhibiting the kind of
self-control you expect
but he old colin is a very controversial
figure
and antarctica he certainly is yeah um
because so
he claims to be the first person to have
crossed the antarctic
fully unassisted and unsupported um so
that originally went to this norwegian
guy called borge
auslan and that was in the 90s i think
but
then they changed the definition to say
that unsupported
had to mean without even a kite so borge
had used a kite on like two occasions
very very briefly
to get himself sort of out of snowdrift
can we just explain how that works
because it sounds like he's just having
a bit of fun with a clown
was he allowed to take his yo-yo with it
sorry it's it's for transport it's not
like you stop you fancy a hobby
um so i guess you're on your sled or
whatever and you harness the wind that's
going in the right direction to pull you
along with your kite or to help you to
give you a bit of extra oomph
and he traveled a lot further to do his
trip than o'brady who's just done his
and a lot of people see borgae as the
person who really achieved this and
o'brady's quite a self-promoter
and he's written this book where he says
everyone said it couldn't be done and
national geographics interviewed
everyone who advised him they were like
no we told him it's pretty simple yeah
pretty straightforward and it was like
there were times i was told they
wouldn't be able to rescue me and then
someone's done an interview saying
getting rescued in the antarctica is
kind of like ordering an uber these days
you just you just call someone up there
it's very hard to see on the uber map
though because against a featureless
white background he could be two minutes
away it could be three days
unfortunately there's a huge stain
in the snow next to him
and he cleaned his pants you know um
you know you were saying about you could
use the wind with these kites
do you know how you can tell which way
the wind is going in antarctica
no um well there's a few ways you can
just put your
lick your finger and hold it up but yeah
not if you want to keep the finger
that's true
yeah uh one almost foolproof way is to
look at which way the penguins are
pointing
so if there is a storm coming in
antarctic
the penguins will drop to their bellies
and they will point their beaks in the
direction that the wind's gonna come
because they know that there's a storm
coming and they don't want to get blown
over
uh i was reading this this was um an
antarctic
scientist called lizzie meek who was
writing about this but isn't that cool
you could just see which way the little
penguins are fighting
that's really funny right um do you know
the first person possibly
to set foot on the antarctic continent
might have been
was it qi producer pierce fletcher
this is so random but i just came across
in my notes i found ages ago there was
this amazing discovery in the 1980s
where some bones were found in
antarctica and until then
um we thought that the very first
antarctic landing was a
ceiling expedition in 1820 and
they found these bones and they've dated
them to somewhere between
1815 and 1825 and they are the bones of
a
21 year old indigenous chilean woman
which is just extraordinary because
that's
no one had gone near the continent we
didn't think until then and suddenly
there's this young chilean woman there
no one knows where on earth she's come
from or how she got there
there's a suggestion that maybe the
sealers who were european sealers
had found someone from chile who would
know
more how to survive in that kind of
environment and taking her with them
then left her but
we just have no idea wow i just find
that incredible
mystery yeah i found a page on wikipedia
which is
the list of crimes in antarctica because
as we were saying before there's all
these sort of you know to the point
where you can order an
uber to get rescued it's all these
research stations that are
that are planted i don't think you can
get rescued yeah well it'll arrive
backwards
that's the thing it will sorry what i
meant is it's the point of you could
almost
in theory it's sort of got that sort of
dance with places
um and um yeah so there's all these you
know research units where scientists are
hauled up for ages
and as a result there's a big list of
the crimes that they've committed which
is always really hard because they're
isolated for so long but the first crime
on the list was from 1959 and it was
in a soviet research station and it was
between two scientists who got
into a massive argument then fight over
a game of chess
and it just got so heated that the um
the guy who lost became enraged was said
to have picked up an ice
axe and attacked the guy and it's really
hard to tell actually um whether or not
the
the wound was fatal because there's two
different stories that have been
presented
as a result um some say he survived some
say he didn't um but afterwards chess
games were apparently banned on all
soviets against russia and antarctica
that really feels like not the main
issue
keep hold of your axes only for weapons
encouraged
chess yeah no no but i just like that i
like the little communities that are out
there that you rarely hear about
in 2014 there was a scientist who
decided to launch his tinder app while
he was out there
and he matched with someone in that on
antarctica um
yeah unfortunately they were a
helicopter right away 45 minutes and
they were leaving the next one they just
get an uber
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening
if you'd like to get in contact with any

[Music]
hello
and welcome to another working from home
episode of no such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations
in the uk my name is dan schreiber i am
sitting here with james harkin
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with fact number one and that
is anna
my fact this week is that the holy roman
emperor once made
every citizen of milan pluck a fig from
a mule's genitals
with their teeth okay
there's so much to unpack here i've yeah
my main question is about the dynamic of
as in
how do you get a fig into a mule's
genitals like which bit of the genitals
are going into
oh well i'm i'm so glad you've asked
both of those questions actually
because i do need to be more specific i
believe it was the anus
uh according to most sources which which
we're counting as part of a general
isn't it genital yeah
i don't usually no no way you can't
generate new life
sorry we've got a lot of explaining to
do
right you could tuck it between the
penis and the ball bag
can i just say i thought it was a female
mule
no yeah i thought it was going in the
vagina of the mule
yes wow some sources say genitals some
sources say anus
mule which did all of those which would
stood in for every citizen
because that's a huge key it's a long
queue right yeah and you'd have to
you'd have to set up a city-wide system
well you didn't do this over one day
andy this wasn't like a
this was a years-long process like jury
duty
that's it yeah you get a letter oh man
what is it you going to war no worries
okay look um i have one more question
all right great um i think it's more
important
he's the holy roman emperor why is he
doing this kind of [ __ ]
he didn't have much on didn't have much
on um
no this so this was uh milan uh was
causing him frederick the first
frederick barbarossa a lot of problems
this is 1162
and it was all full of uprisings and
basically
uh he sent his wife went to visit milan
and the people of milan
disliked frederick so much that they
humiliated his wife tied her to a mule
and made her ride backwards on this mule
round the city
so he fred was like you humiliated my
wife
to make up for it i'm gonna make you all
do this thing
and uh actually in answer to your very
good question andy about how you get
the fig into the mules anus all vagina
sources differ
um you would have to put it back into
the
genitals with your teeth and then return
it
that was my other question do you get to
eat the fig afterwards
i'm afraid i think it's the same thing
fake expenditure that's true
oh yeah you don't want to be at the back
of that queue you know with a monkey
fight
that would be disgusting um anna in
fairness to the people of milan
they were being sieged by the holy roman
emperor at the time
it wasn't like they just humiliated his
wife just because they didn't like him
it was more because he was attacking
that city it was bigger than that yeah
he was besieging the city
um they he he was having a lot of
problems at the time with various cities
he was supposed to rule and yeah the
milanese did not like him
and actually as part of this uprising
the three wise men were moved
so milan was known for having the skulls
of the three wise men
and then when frederick sort of won
beat them down he had the skulls removed
and moved to cologne cathedral and
they're still there today
which is quite amazing this is like a
thousand years ago almost i think if
everyone was doing it i would have no
problem
in doing the fig challenge i mean that's
what it would feel like it would feel
like
yeah it feel like the ice bucket
challenge they were actually also
raising money for
it was a donkey sanctuary in fact you
had to nominate five people to
remove a picnic from the mule's genitals
afterwards
maybe there was a sense of solidarity
amongst them because they'd all suffered
together
but they did so what they had to do was
they had to get it out with their teeth
and then take it to the executioner
who was the person who would have
beheaded them if they failed and then
they had to say
echo ill fico as in look here's the fig
and then they had to replace it
and apparently in milan after that
sticking your thumb between your uh
middle finger and your index finger i
guess like i'm doing
right now um is a sign
of it's called known as making the fig
or it was known as making the fig
and it was an insult based on this
that's still an insult
quite a lot around the world actually
that doing the fig
uh because it looks a bit like a vagina
if you do it this way
and it's kind of still in russia for
instance if you do that
it's kind of it doesn't mean like a
really really bad insult these days it's
just a bit like giving the v's kind of
thing
okay it does mean your mother's vagina
like in madagascar i read
that if you went like that you are going
it's not screw you it's your mother's
vagina
i can't speak for madagascar but i can
speak i've had it done to me in russia
that's all i can say
and it's not because my father-in-law
did it to me and apparently it's not a
massive insult
it doesn't mean get away from my
daughter sure that's what polina told
you
yeah he was actually complimenting each
other
this is a there's a weird thing because
in italy
there's a really weird linguistic
confusion right because if you say
i hope i get this right bella fico means
nice
fig but bella figa means beautiful
women's genitals
so there's a weird verbal link between
the two as well yeah and
the bbc web a really old bbc talk board
had a thing about someone who'd been
trying
to order figs in italy and they said i
started off by asking how old was the
figue
how much i loved it when it was fresh as
long as it wasn't too old
how i love to eat it and on and on the
lady was clearly shocked but i kept
going on and on trying to explain how
much i liked it
it's very much got genital associations
around the world hasn't it and it looks
like a
famously like a look we all know what it
looks like guys
we don't need to go into that
um can i just i just wanted to say one
more thing i really enjoyed about this
besieging that frederick was doing
because i didn't know about this so he
um was really into underground warfare
so when he was proceeding
uh kramer which he beseeched before
melania milan he
uh dug a lot of tunnels and i didn't
realize in medieval times tunnel warfare
was a huge deal so you're besieging a
city
and you dig a tunnel underneath and then
you counter mine
from the other end as in you dig your
tunnel and you would meet in the middle
and then two enemies on it would have to
be big enough to take uh you
on horseback and then the two enemies
would meet
in this tunnel yeah the horses would go
down into the tunnel
and they'd meet on horseback and this
was a means of combat
and loads of people did it so agincourt
they had a lot of these they were dug by
the welsh
miners honestly so what happens is
you've got two armies coming at each
other and it is big enough to get a
horse down
but only one horse so it means that the
person at the front of your
battle can only fight against the person
at the front of their battle
and then whoever wins that then fights
against the next person in the queue
and you just keep going down and going
down until then it's like playing
conquers basically
it's extraordinary and the other thing
is that um you would have these tunnels
going towards a city but you might also
dig a tunnel
underneath the other person's tunnel so
that they kind of
fall through it and then get trapped and
then you can kill them
and i read once and that's where the
word undermine comes from although i'm
not sure if that's right
oh i don't like it though yeah henry v
was very famous for having a very
impressive fight in one apparently and
something else you could do if they
dug a tunnel under yours and popped out
on your side
they often had big tubs of boiling urine
and water
that they'd throw on you as you emerged
you could only come out one at a time
oh yeah i can't believe they met each
other though you would assume it would
be a bit like you know when you close
your eyes and you have to get your index
fingers to touch each other
and and they miss i would assume it must
have been so nice
you can hear it you can hear each other
digging underground if you keep quiet
you can hear the noise
each team had um each team had a golden
mole didn't they
which could hear where the other team
was coming
above the gates of milan until the 1500s
there was a work of art
showing a woman lifting her skirt and
clipping her pubic hair with a large
pair of shears
so whenever you went to milan this is
the first thing you would see
wow uh and no one really knew why it was
there but they think that probably
dates from this particular siege by um
frederick barbarossa
and it could be that when barbarossa was
attacking the city one of the women at
the walls did this
and they decided to memorialize it it
could be because milan asked for some
money
from um the empress lea bisser who was
in constantinople at the time
and was extremely wealthy and really
important um
empress and they wanted money from her
to try and stop frederick from attacking
the city and but she said no and so they
did this picture of the woman
as kind of an insult to her but no one
really knows why it was there but then
it got taken down by
cardinal carlo baramio in the 1500s
because he wanted
his eyes only to gaze on the stars of
heaven
yeah as opposed to the towering genitals
and pubic hair over
giant woman i suppose that's fair enough
he didn't include that part in the
quote but of course he would have said
it implied
yeah barbarossa by the way died because
he didn't want to queue
he hated cueing he was that's like you
you hate cueing i hate cueing because i
always think at the front of it i'm
going to have to pluck a pig from a
mule's vagina
but they were going to cross a river and
he didn't want to queue so he went
across the river
in a bit where you're not supposed to
you didn't want to go over the bridge or
whatever and he drowned
oh barbie i've read a bunch of theories
about how he died
which i think that's the sort of most
accepted version of it um
but it is shrouded in a bit of mystery
and one of the most confusing things
that i read was that it was a foot of
water which is very hard
to drown in uh supposedly that could
have happened because he was wearing
such heavy armor that he was just pulled
down yeah um
and there was also theories of fatigue
that he had actually gone just for a
wash and that
he was so tired that the sun just kind
of just he lost energy
but yeah what a way to go and the nazis
thought he was still alive
because there's like a um an ancient
idea that he's like king arthur and he
lives in a mountain
uh and whenever germany's about to fall
he'll come out and save everyone
and he can't leave at the moment because
his uh beard is stuck in a table
so yeah it's so big it's grown yeah it's
grown through the table
and he doesn't have scissors but he does
have a boy who's loose who he sends out
to check how german he's doing every so
often
so he'll just wave him out is this real
it's not right well according to the
nazis it was real
and they would have been so disappointed
if if he came out
and said right don't worry germany's
gonna be safe all i need is
250 000 mules i need a large queuing
system i now need a bunch of figs
but then of course that's why they
called you'll know andy operation
barbarossa
which was the attack on the soviet union
that was named after him because he was
such a
top guy according to the nazis and also
um another operation baba russell where
they killed all the intellectuals that
was also named after him
i can't believe the sentence was just
said who believes this the nazis
and dan
that's not something i want to be
involved but can i just say that by
saying
who believes this the nazi's undone i'm
saying that you're not a nazi
otherwise i would say the nazis
including them who is also yeah
they just share similar ideas and
beliefs
um do you know what happened to
barbarossa after he died oh
he got his beard stuck in a table
somewhere he's still waiting for those
shears from that poor pubic-haired woman
if you don't believe the theory of dan
and his nazi buddies then this is what
happened to him
so his body was apparently they tried to
preserve it in vinegar
um again like a conqueror but it didn't
it didn't work and he was buried in
three different places this sounds like
such a difficult confusing burial
process because
his flesh was put in the church of saint
peter and antioch
his bones in the cathedral of tyre and
his heart and inner organs in another
church that was in tarsus wow but that's
a rough
that's a rough gig having to separate
the flesh from the bones
yeah you wouldn't want the flesh i think
i know i was just going to say i think
the
got a raw deal because that's just a
pile of grossness isn't it
speaking of flesh fix have flesh so
shall we talk about fix
yeah yeah why not they're
very very important up to 70 of the
animal life in the rainforest
depends on fig trees um because they're
so high in energy
they fruits loads of times every year
they'll grow really well in that kind of
environment
and basically they're eaten by lots of
things and then those things are eaten
by lots of things
etc etc so without figs we wouldn't have
lots of other rainforesty stuff
we wouldn't be here today they're
amazing aren't they
i've never looked into figs before so i
read a quote from charles dickens which
he said train
up a fig tree and the way it should go
and when you were old sit under
the shade of it and the idea is that you
can you can push them into a territory
and that's the direction they'll grow
which is a thing that happens
um a lot of people end up making bridges
out of figs by positioning the direction
and they grow across
these sort of river passes and that's
your fig bridge
which is just naturally grown it's
astonishing the photos are amazing if
anyone wants to yeah
it's mostly it's in north india isn't it
where and basically suspension bridges
which
massively predate our suspension bridges
and they're so long i think the longest
is over 50 meters long
and over 500 years old because they do
yeah they've got these incredibly
strong roots that kind of you can they
weave around each other
and i think a lot of the bridges have a
handrail they will have trained some of
the roots to grow into a handrail as
well
amazing it's a long wait for your bridge
though isn't it when you commissioned a
guy
yeah frederick would not have had the
patience to wait for that bridge
um so figs yeah they are figs themselves
are extraordinary as well
in the way that they breed every fig
that you eat
has caught at least one corpse in it
probably lots of corpses
inside it is that all of the figs that
you eat like the ones from the
supermarket
oh technically probably every figure you
eat doesn't have a corpse in it because
these days they're often done
artificially but if you're eating a fig
that has been naturally propagated
it's got at least one corpse in it
because the way they breed is this
extraordinary way
where the every fig and there i think
there are more than 750 species of fig
has its own specific fig wasp and the
way the figs are pollinated
is that a female wasp will burrow inside
the fig
and weirdly a figure is an inside out
flower so the flower is on the inside
the bit then he's pollinating
burrows inside the fig and then she lays
her eggs
and then they uh spawn and then they
shag each other
and fertilize each other and then the
males the male siblings crawl up and
make a little tunnel
out of the fig so the females can escape
and then the males die sacrifice
themselves females fly off and then they
go and pollinate the next fig
beautiful it's amazing it's so cool
you've kind of you've kind of glossed
over the incest bit because a lot of the
figs
the wasps that hatch are siblings
reasonably i think to gloss over that
bit
i think all of them are siblings that
they're not no they're not because you
can get several different wasps crawling
inside a fig
which will then die but they will have
laid their eggs around
inside the little seed bits good point
yeah so you might it's not frowned upon
in the fig world in the same way is for
us
and that's why there are lots of corpses
often is that the ladies kill each other
don't they because if more than one
mother gets inside
then they have a duel to the death very
often sure
yeah to make sure that only one mother
can lay her eggs
but then the poor mums the figs amputate
their wings
as they go in right so the mothers can
never leave so they're doing their
entire
antenna as well yeah yeah have you heard
of
mike shanahan yeah i've met yes right
yeah yeah he came on our radio show a
few years ago he's
he is amazing he knows more about fig he
knows more about figs
than anyone i've met knows about any
other subjects apart from perhaps
erica mcallister and flies that's the
only other person i can compare yeah
or dan schreiber and um nazi's sacred
myths
guys um so yeah he's written this book
called god's wasps and stranglers
which is unbelievable i've only read a
chapter of it but it's
it is so interesting if you're
interested in figs this is the book to
read on the subject basically
i i actually found something that i
think mr shanahan got wrong
uh he knew his book yeah well
it was just we're talking about royals
and we're talking about um
so barbarossa and the fig i found a
modern royal that was associated with
the fig which is queen elizabeth the
second
who was asleep in a fig tree when she
found out she became queen
um excuse me sorry yeah our current
queen was asleep in
a figure she was famously in africa
wasn't she when she found out um
and it was a tree house was it or
something i think exactly didn't she
crawl inside she crawled inside a fig
she lost her wings and antenna on the
way but a nearby aquarius was able to
pry her out
yeah but let's gloss over the incest for
a second
she yeah she was staying in a tree house
and the story the the sentence is that
she went up the tree a princess
and she came down a queen um but i think
that they actually found out um quite
quite some type 40 kilometers away from
the actual tree where they were staying
because they were out and about
and philip delivered it in a sort of
cabin
so it's not quite true that she was in a
fig tree which would have been fantastic
wow that's so many preconceptions
shattered there
everyone at home has had to adjust their
whole belief system stop the poker
stop the podcast hi guys just wanted to
let you know that we are sponsored today
by expressvpn
yes and a vpn stands for a virtual
private network it's a way of creating
online privacy
and anonymity and the way it does that
is it makes a
private network virtually from public
internet connection that's right but
what it can also do
is it can make it seem like you're in a
different country which is ideal if you
want to stream programs from anywhere
around the world so let's say you've
watched all of the british office
and you think let's see if this american
office is is
up to up to scratch then you can just
toggle yourself to be in america
suddenly
and watch it there it's really really
easy to use you literally just toggle
yourself into whatever country you want
to be in and you exist there for the
purposes of watching tv shows
yes expressvpn has nearly 100 different
countries available
to virtually seem like you are in which
makes it a very
cheap way of traveling the entire world
especially
in today's world where travel is a
little more restricted
it's very fast it doesn't slow down
connections and it could not be easier
to use
that is right so if you want to do your
gap year in
tv watching terms at least then if you
go to expressvpn.com
fish you'll be able to get an extra
three months of expressvpn for free
yes that's right so if you sign up today
at expressvpn.com
fish you will get an extra three months
of expressvpn for free
okay on with the podcast on with the
show
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
james okay my fact this week is that
library books can set on fire if you put
them in the microwave
it's ruined many a dinner for me
certainly
all my cookbooks have gone up in flames
that's when it says cookbook it doesn't
mean cook this book
um this is more of a public service
announcement than a fact
and it comes via a library in michigan
the kent district library
that's asking people to stop microwaving
their books
to prevent the spread of coronavirus and
that is because they contain a little
chip in them
which is the kind of chip we've
mentioned before called an rfid chip
which is what you get in your oyster
card or in your
contactless credit card or in your
massive seal that you use to spy on the
united states if you're russia
and they're in also in these library
books and they're made of metal
and if you put metal in the microwave a
lot of the time it will set on fire
and people have been doing this with
library books and they've tweeted a load
of pictures of
very burnt library books where people
have been trying to
try to sterilize so these these chips
you can't put them in the microwave are
they oven chips
very nice very good but no don't put
them in the oven either
it's a very funny joke hannah but this
is not a funny matter it's not a
laughing matter
got it i didn't know people have been
doing this
yeah well they don't fully know why
they're doing it as well as in
they the the article that i read sort of
suggested
that they're a bit bemused it's not as
if there was a ginormous moment on the
internet where everyone said do this to
clean it
um so something's popped up on a site
somewhere where enough people in
michigan have seen it
and and done it yeah i mean there's some
there is a
fair amount of logic behind it isn't it
microwaves in theory could kill
viruses i suppose yeah that's like
stuff up like it's just that's not what
they made for
so don't put stuff in the microwave
that's not made to go in a microwave
that's basically the tip yeah and we
think the best way to sterilize books is
probably just to leave them for
a couple of days don't we in most
libraries just now leave them for two or
three days
yeah so um covet 19 will die after
a certain number of days uh i think in
perfect lab conditions it's kind of
over a week but in real life you know
you're not living in a bell jar with a
perfect amount of air and
no uv lights and stuff like that so if
you leave the library book for a few
days it should sterilize
by itself they did discuss i think uv
like treatment because people kept on
saying could you treat things with uv
and it was pointed out as well as being
quite carcinogenic so you don't and
expensive
you would need to treat every single
page of a book
so it would involve shining uv you know
imagine getting war and peace back
that's going to take
two or three hours to uv treat and it's
not like you can just get a little uv
torch and just shine it on and that'll
kill it you need a special very high
energy uv light in order to kill viruses
i was
looking into like sort of library scares
and things like this and that was a
really interesting account of um
worry about reading contagion in fact
there's a book about it called reading
contagion because
it was reported in 1911 in a library
journal that books seem well adapted for
carrying smallpox measles scarlet fever
trachoma diphtheria
erysipelas dysentery typhoid and
tuberculosis here is in there yes
please can i just explain that why we're
laughing at that so yeah
i'll probably cut this out but in our
live show last year we had
a spelling competition where andy would
say
very unusual words and dan would try and
pronounce them and then the audience
would try and spell them
and um eric c plus was one of those and
i never heard the word before that gig
and now it seems to come up virtually
every week
he's following us around and i'm still
saying it eerie sea police
[Laughter]
um and this was a fear because some
readers would lick their fingers as they
were turning pages so people got very
worried about this
and there was one scientist who decided
to experiment on it and he did it by
taking public library books
cutting out the dirtiest bits i mean the
physically dirtiest bits not the rudest
bits in the book
so that he'd have most wear and then he
would soak the pages in saline solution
then he would spin that liquid with the
sort of
gloopy matter from the library books in
it then he would inject that saline
solution into guinea pigs
and amazingly all the guinea pigs died
wow
all 40 of the guinea pigs he tried it on
died wow and is that's evidence that
they're catching germs from the book
rather than just that he just injected
them with saline solution
well no they did die of proper things
but it turns out i mean
if you're no one reads library books
like that no one does that with library
books no
no it would be an unusual thing to do
and also they don't let you return them
after you've
worked through a washing machine
injected yourself with parts of them
well do you know in um boston the boston
library how they
clean their books when they get returned
no they have a mini
book sized car wash that they send the
books through
so it's got all these compartments it's
on a conveyor belt and it can do
12 books a minute um they don't use it
on the extremely rare books
it's just for more modern books and it's
a dusting system as they come through
um spinning brush bars and so on it
looks you can watch videos of it online
and that's something
in their books that's not to sterilize
them or anything is that that's to get
rid of all the dust and
yes yeah but anything that's returned
just to for maintenance basically but
yes not not sterilization
um there was this this scare about book
germs
seemed to go on for a long time so it
started in the 1870s
i think um and it lasted as you say well
into the 20th century and in 1907 there
was a law in the uk
past that said if anyone was ill you
were not allowed to borrow a book from a
library or return a book
to a library and they tried yeah all
sorts of experiments to
figure out you know if they if they were
spreading germs didn't they
they got lots of doctors involved there
was another one as well as the guinea
pig one where they had
monkeys drink milk off a germy book
and then see if anything went wrong with
them again difficult to return that
monkey poo drenched milky book to the
library afterwards
i wonder if that law from 1907 still
holds or not like probably not the same
law but
like i'm pretty sure there's a law
that's around now that if you have
plague for instance
and you get in a taxi by law you have to
announce it to the taxi driver before
you go anywhere
and i think it's the same i think it's
the same public health act
that those two things are from so i
wonder if you have to announce to a
librarian that you have a
certain illness before you give your
library books back
because it was basically someone died
didn't they there was a nebraskan
librarian that died of tuberculosis
and that kind of made everyone think oh
[ __ ] you know there could be something
in this uh but do you know the um
spanish blue from 1918 or 1919
yeah um they thought that that could
travel on telegraph wires because a load
of telegraph operators got the disease
at the same time but obviously it was
because they were all in a room together
in the same manner there was also one
where a load of bank tellers in a bank
got sick at the same time and they
thought that maybe it had come with the
money
so it's like they thought that whatever
was coming into that
building might have been what caused the
illness rather than one of the people
giving it to everyone else hey um when
we were on tour last year
in america um we were in new york and i
went to the new york public library
and it is stunning have you guys been
when we were there
or been any other time it's really it's
just this majestic building
and i saw that they had a lot of sort of
relics of literature in there so i
started looking into it see what else
they have
and um there's some great things about
it for example
what there was one customer as it were
someone who came every day and sat at
the same desk
for 52 years and that was from 1923 to
1975
and it was the guy it was a man called
norbert perlroth
who was the head researcher for ripley's
believe it or not
and he used to sit in that library every
single day or most days at the same desk
doing his research
and because the research available in
that library is astonishing they have
the largest collection of restaurant
menus in the world
for example they have 40 000 restaurant
menus
and it's used by chefs all over the
world to sort of find
old you know ideas for what they can do
with their menus but it's also used
by um biologists marine biologists to
study fish populations to see if there
was a spike in what was being eaten in
the restaurants around
new york at the time yeah so it's used
for sort of
understanding ecology as well um there's
one
library designer who designed libraries
like the qatar national library which is
incredible
and also the seattle library which is
quite famous i think it has a spiral of
ongoing books
uh so you walk from the bottom to the
top and the library shelves never end
anyway this uh architect is called he's
a dutch guy called rem
cool house and his name is
cool what a name for an architect what a
great
hey cool house cool house yeah i hope he
just hears that
all the time um just as this fact was
about microwaving library books i've got
one thing on
microwaves okay i was looking for
interesting microwave stories
and things you shouldn't microwave and
in 2017
there was a man who had to be freed by
firefighters after cementing his own
head
into a microwave he he was called jay
swingler
22 from the uk he and his friends they
mixed up seven bags of poly filler
and they poured it around his head
inside the microwave which was protected
by a plastic bag he wasn't stupid
all right um so uh and unaccountably it
then dried and
they couldn't get him out they tried for
an hour and a half to get him out
before calling the fire brigade um this
was all for youtube
and um the emergency services turned up
and they sort of chipped
the microwave apart they destroyed the
microwave and
they then didn't find him very
generously because they assessed that he
had been at risk of dying
sorry i thought he said they didn't find
him yeah
they just keep chipping he must be in
here somewhere
he was later interviewed and he said he
he hadn't wasted the emergency services
time because they saved my life
whereas i say that he did waste their
time
there was an interview with robert
pattinson earlier this year in april uh
with gq
which i assume they must have done over
zoom or over skype or something because
um he's in a house which appears to be a
um
like a hired house rather than his own
uh and he's
while they're interviewing him he's
making um some pasta in the microwave
now he has come up with a new way of
making pasta
it's a bit like a pop-tart but you make
your pasta and then you put a load of
american cheese and sugar with it
and then you cover it in cornflakes and
apparently it's the most delicious thing
that robert pattinson has ever eaten
so he's making this while he's being
interviewed by gq
and um they're asking him about it and
he he had puts all the conflicts on the
outside and then he puts it all in tin
foil
and he says can you are you allowed to
put tin foil in the oven
and the gq guy says yeah you can put tin
foil in the oven you're not allowed to
put it in the microwave
and then robert patterson goes uh i
think this is an oven
and so then he puts his um his like
pop-tart thing
in what he thinks is an oven but which
is actually a microwave
and they're still doing the interview at
this point and then about a couple of
minutes later the whole thing explodes
the microwave explodes and all the
electricity goes off in robert
pattinson's house
and i gotta say this is the best
interview i've ever read in my whole
life
and has anyone checked on robert
patterson recently because i'm a bit
worried about it
my brother-in-law charbelle works in
hotels and he once got a call up to a
room
because the guy who was up there had
ordered room service
had his food but clearly hadn't finished
eating it so
um he called charbell up charbelle into
the room and he said i need your help i
was trying to reheat my food
but i can't get it back out of the
microwave but what he'd done was put it
into the safe
and he'd locked his bolognese or
whatever yeah this fight so the code was
probably three minutes or whatever
that's so funny
okay it is time for fact number three
and that
is andy my fact is that one of the kings
of leon was called
alfonso the slobberer i think somewhere
still going what do you mean was yeah
well
well i'm glad i'm glad you pointed that
out obviously kings of leon great band
three of them
jared and two others none of them's
called our fonzo the slobberer
it turns out that before the band even
thought about forming
there was a kingdom called leon and
that's what they're very cleverly
referring to their name
and leon is in the it was a huge chunk
of
the iberian peninsula so north west
spain and what is now portugal ii
and it had a king in the mid to late
12th century called
alfonso and alfonso was an angry guy
he would have fits of rage that made him
foam at the mouth and that's why he got
his charming nickname
alfonso the slobberer wow yeah
we do know a bit more about him we know
he married his cousin
twice not the same cousin different
cousins so he had a type
and annulled them because of it right
it's so bizarre that you can make that
mistake like he marries a cousin
and then he had i think three children
with the first one uh and then suddenly
he was like oh damn it it's incest
not allowed to do it so it had to be a
nulled and then did the same thing again
had five children with the next one
and hold again i think the second one
might have been his first cousin once
removed
yes it was yeah but did you i didn't
know this it's so interesting i had no
idea how strict the rules on
incest actually were at certain points
in history we usually gloss over the
incest on this podcast
um so the church had banned marriages
for relations up to seven degrees
removed
which meant that you had to count seven
generations back
and it was illegal to i mean who on
earth knows seven generations back it
meant it was illegal to marry anyone
closer than your seventh cousin so it
must have been an enormous hassle if you
fancy someone you had to really trace
you had to go on who do you think you
are
[Laughter]
alfonso also formed the cortez de leon
in
1188 which brought together all the
nobles in that area
and some people say it was the first
parliament in the history of western
europe
so that's one good thing yeah there were
quite a few kings of leon
over the years um henry the impotent he
was one
uh he was supposedly uh impotent as a
result of a curse by the bishop of
toledo
uh the curse was called frigidi at
malaficiati
and it's quite a common curse that you
would do in medieval times where you
would
um like make someone impotent just by
reading out this curse
um although he did have a daughter so
it might not have worked although the
argument was if he had this curse
it can't possibly be his daughter so he
must have must have been someone else
yeah maybe the curse wears off after a
while yeah alfonso could have done with
a bit of that curse
i mean he had eight children within his
two marriages and then he had another 10
children outside his marriages
yeah there you go needed a bit of
friggity arty yet maleficorium or
whatever
i read another guy another king um who
was in the 10th century
called di sancho sancho the fat he was
known as yes he was also a king of leon
wasn't he yeah king of leon interesting
story
he basically was said to have been so
overweight
um that it that it made it hard for him
to walk he couldn't ride a horse he
could he couldn't pick up a sword
and so he lost the throne as a result he
was disposed
as a sort of weak king and his
grandmother
took him to a doctor and the story goes
is that the doctor
sewed his lips shut except for a tiny
little hole
to put a straw through to give him what
was effectively the first
weight loss diet which was you can only
drink stuff through this straws as your
food
and he eventually lost half of his
weight to the point where he could ride
a horse again and pick up a sword and he
regained the throne because he came back
as a
whereas i have returned
after a long time doing a diet he was
immediately deposed because of his
speech impediment at least he wasn't
slubbering
with that little
[Laughter]
he did have a serious problem though i
think the contemporary account
say that he was well in today's
measurements is 38 stone
which is too heavy no horse can take
that
and i quite like that the guy it was
just such a testament to
what a mixed place europe was then that
his grandmother
walked him sort of wobbled him along to
a jewish doctor this guy was who worked
for the muslim ruler
abdul rahman and obviously he was
christian he was such a melting pot
and yeah cured him and it's good because
he replaced or don't know the wicked
it sounds like if it's between the fat
and the wicked
he'd probably go the fat wouldn't you
yeah yeah unless it was like a
really kind of positive thing like
wicked yeah
and also i suppose sancho could be fat
with a ph
he might have just dropped some heavy
beats yeah that's true
they were all djs the kings of leia oh
yeah if
they were all dj's then what about
bermuda the gouty
i don't want to watch his set uh there
were there were quite a few queens of
leon
as well as the kings of william joanna
the mad
she was one of them um she was married
to philip the handsome
and she really liked philip the handsome
but unfortunately he died and then she
kind of lived with his coffin and would
open up the coffin every now and then so
she could kiss his feet
and that's why they called her chihuahua
the mad actually alfonzo the slobberer
wanted to leave his kingdom to his two
daughters so sancha and dolce
he left officially after he died he left
it to his two daughters but
basically the people of leon were not
really up for female leaders
and the daughters and i think i would
have done exactly the same thing
weren't really up for having a big fight
about it so basically they met with
their half-brother's mum
so these three women met and they
negotiated look we'll give this chap the
kingdom and can we just have a bunch of
castles and some money
and it was called the pact of the
mothers they just went and lived the
life of riley somewhere
yeah it's a good call because being
being a king or queen in those days very
stressful and their nicknames alone
uh would have done you in um have you
got some more nicknames
yeah i found a few these i strayed off
territory a bit
away from leon and i just went to other
regal nicknames
um so there's a there was a byzantine
emperor who was called constantine the
name of [ __ ]
uh copra nymos is what that was uh at
the time
and it's allegedly because he shat in
the font during his baptism
i know so it's kind of a clever joke
actually it is a bit like
someone at school like being on a school
trip and having to [ __ ] in a bag and
being called [ __ ] bag for the rest of
school but the rest of the
and for the raid their reign as emperor
as well terrible yeah
yeah that's what happened when they were
like less than one or just absolutely
i'm not saying it's fair dan i'm not
saying it's fair but i am saying it's
funny james ii of england was known as
james the
bishop or something what's that i think
the irish called him that or something
yeah
yeah because he because they wanted him
to hang around and fight for them and
then he fled to france quite famously
disappeared and just gave up thrown to
william of orange so they're like well
you're a piece of [ __ ]
that's how he went down i have a quick
study about nicknames in general
oh yeah so there was a study by queen
mary university
and they were looking into nicknames in
online dating
and how you can make yourself most
effective which i know is not of any
special interest to any of you three
well i just need to know on my tinder
profile should i call myself james a
slobber
or not right exactly so
they studied loads of different research
papers they studied
like lots and lots and lots of previous
papers on online attraction and they
it's quite funny just the the things
they found out or their headline
results were quite obvious seeming
things so they found that nicknames with
negative connotations like
little or bug are linked with
inferiority so you shouldn't pick
them um and they said playful screen
names were good
so the name fun to be with that's the
number two and then the letter b
was universally attractive they claimed
they also said pick something near the
beginning of the alphabet because
if like all sensible people you arrange
your dating profiles you're looking at
in alphabetical order
um you don't want to be lost in the
bottom of the pile so does that mean you
should call yourself
like in the like in the edinburgh
festival program
that you always have like the aaa comedy
show yeah
exactly like that because zebedee the
gouty he's not getting any dates
i've just got a few more nicknames i
found of um rulers throughout history
um so there's you know so many manuel
the sausage maker
um wilfred the harry half dan
the bad entertainer that's not a good
one no come on yeah
that actually is your online nickname
isn't it
so yeah he was from norway he was the
son of einstein the fart
and yeah so he was very generous
paying his soldiers but he was very bad
in providing food and entertainment for
them
okay you buy your own food in
entertainment if you've got a good
salary
brought half down

podcast
on with the show
okay it's time for a final fact of the
show and that's my fact
my fact this week is that there is a
chinese poem made up of 92 characters
in which every word is pronounced the
poem
is called the lion eating poet in the
stone den or
sure sure
sure now for any mandarin listeners out
there
um just to quickly say i grew up in hong
kong and i was taught mandarin
throughout school but i have a foreign
mandarin accent so apologies if i
butchered that slightly it's a very hard
sentence to say
the poem is even harder to say that is
an
easy sentence to say sure
because you're saying it with one tone
and it's toner you just sound like a
librarian there james
wait a minute so when you said it it
sounded to me to my ears it sounded like
they were all the same tone
so sure it's neutral sure is
the downward um is the upward and
sure so those are four different sures
that you could be saying
as a result um which is why it's it's if
you say this poem
out loud even the best chinese speaker
saying it out loud no one will know what
they're saying
because despite the four tones you can
still have about 15 different words
which have that tone of sure for let's
say going on the upward sound
so it is totally amusing to listen to it
out loud isn't it true it's in character
form
isn't it true i might be wrong about
this because obviously i don't know
anything about this language but
is it not true that in classic chinese
it works way better
and in modern mandarin and modern
cantonese it really doesn't work at all
it's
not that's right yeah yeah but the cool
thing about classical
chinese that i never knew this is that
it's
it's quite similar to modern standard
arabic today but the way classical
chinese was used from
about sort of the 8th century until
about 100 years ago it was that
it was a way to communicate between
people who didn't speak the same
language
so the like china japan korea vietnam
all these areas in east asia spoke
different languages but they all wrote
in classical chinese
and so they'd have this thing called
brush talk where if you met a foreigner
you couldn't chat to them but you could
pass notes and so you'd meet a foreigner
and you'd do brush talk so
i mean it must have been extremely
arduous taking a lot longer but you
could just have a secret passing notes
in class chat
wow that's pretty cool yeah isn't it
it's like when you go to an airport and
the word for parking is the same in
every country
yeah already everything was like
exactly could i quickly um give a bit of
a brief explanation about this poem
and the author of it because um this was
written by
a man called ren ran chao and he's a
incredible guy he wrote it in the 1930s
and it was
done as a sort of linguistic
demonstration to show that you could
manage to stretch out
um these this one word into a 92
word poem he he was an amazing character
he um he moved over to america to study
mathematics and physics at cornell
university and he eventually did
philosophy at harvard
and he became a huge influence within
the world of um
chinese language for the western world
so he when he was back in china if
bertrand russell came over he would act
as his interpreter
back in america he recorded the standard
chinese pronunciation gramophone records
that people would get
that would be distributed nationally so
people would understand a unified
pronunciation
of chinese in america he translated
alice in wonderland
um he wrote pop hits back in china i
mean he was this
incredible character have you heard of
his puppet by the way i haven't actually
he
and weirdly he wrote the music not the
lyrics for it um it's
not exactly it's not exactly the kings
of leon
yeah 1930s chinese pop is uh is not
what you'd expect it's very repetitive
lyrics isn't it
it's like the two unlimited of its time
his wife was amazing um his wife
invented stir-fry
yeah which is quite amazing she wrote a
book called how to cook and eat in
chinese in 1946
uh which went through loads and loads of
what a specific title for a book
would have had a very quick sell by date
it was like the book of the year 2019
after that yeah but um she wrote a load
of techniques that they used to cook
in china um but her terms are now used
quite commonly in america so the term
stir-fry was invented by her and her
daughter as well who did a lot of the
translation
extraordinary what's quite interesting
and ironic is that people use this
uh poem as an argument against writing
the chinese language in
the roman characters because i like it's
way more complicated than that and if
you start putting them into
latin characters then you just can't get
the nuances
but of course this guy um yuen rancho he
was very much
pro translation he was a translator so
it's quite ironic that that has been
used as an argument
but it is true that it's so hard to
write down in roman scripts so there was
actually
someone who wrote beneath a youtube
video who was taiwanese and i think was
talking about
language spoken in fujian and said that
the sentence grandfather hit his head on
a metal tin
and grandfather felt giddy is the word
gong
written eight times basically so like
gong his grandfather
and then various other wow so much fun
word
that's such a common word wait which
language did you say that was anna that
was in
taiwanese and in fujian
and i spent about an hour this morning
trying to practice
the sentence the horse is slow mother
tells off the horse
is it all mars yeah i think it's like
mama ma ma how's that sound done
nonsense well it would sound nonsense
anyway
as is the point of the sure sure like
it's
it's impossible to grip on to i you need
to see that written in order to go okay
ma mother ma horus marslow that's
it that's where that would make sense
for you that's why it's so hard
have you heard of the hmong language of
vietnam yeah
that's got eight tones in it whoa
yeah so the word paw depending on
what you're putting where you're putting
the tone can mean either female
throw thorn pancreas to c
or paternal grandmother so if you want
to say
i can see my paternal grandmother's
pancreas
yeah they are brilliant these little
kind of
oddities though aren't they because most
languages around the world have
something like that so
in the ojibwe language of canada
which was one of the biggest first
nations languages
there's a phrase
which means we should really go and get
anna shouldn't we no
yeah so we might start using that one
whenever
anna's late to the hotel lobby before
can you say it again james
it's
no i'm gonna start singing that at the
end of hey jude
notices every time someone sings hey
dude that turns up right
i'm here you know um the drummer of
the band emperor yes that plays our
theme tune um
he had a song that he put out called
anik who was someone who used to do our
sound checks
for fish and record our sound and um
he named the song anik after anik and it
got picked up by
apple and was used in an advert in abu
dhabi and dubai
and it was a very popular song and what
happens a lot over there is that people
use their phone and shazam to find out
the name of the song
and so they knew that was going to
happen and after it been sold it'd been
pointed out
that the name anik in arabic translates
as
i [ __ ] and apple was suddenly
pushing a big song of their advert with
i [ __ ] so
adam had to desperately change the title
of the song so that by the time it went
out and shazamed
it was a different song and he managed
to do it within the space of 24 hours
before it went out
wow yeah he almost caused
international chaos for them
okay that's it that's all of our facts
thank you so much for listening if you'd

[Music]

=332
hi everyone james here now before we
start this week's show i just want to
tell you one
little thing about it and that is that
it was actually recorded
quite a long time ago all the way back
in february in fact and the reason i
want to tell you that
is because first of all it's obviously
in the
office and we're all still in our homes
at the moment
and also because there'll be a few
things that we might say in there that
might really
perhaps give away that we didn't record
it this week
uh for instance i do talk about jasper
carrot
for a while and that probably would have
been a dated reference
any time that we said it in the last
five years but
hey when you listen you'll get the idea
so
enjoy the show and uh just marvel about
how young we all
sounded back in february okay on with
the podcast
[Applause]
[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from the qi offices in
covent garden
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
here with james harkin
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
and once again we have gathered round
the microphones with our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with you anna my fact this week
is that in the 18th century
women expressed their political beliefs
by wearing decorative stickers on their
faces
wow that's cool what kind of stickers
did they say like vote labor
or uh yeah screw you boris uh just
sprawled all over their forehead
women have amazing foresight and four
heads
no this was so facial stickers were in
this huge
fashion for about sort of 200 years um
and about the turn of the
18th century they suddenly became
political
and so there was one commentator for
instance who said that he went to the
opera and he saw two parties of very
fine women as he said arranged in battle
formation against each other
and he said one group was wearing
patches and stickers on the left side of
their foreheads and the other on the
right
and became apparent they were wig
supporters and tory supporters
and i looked into this and this was a
thing so it wasn't
the stickers were just like little like
beauty spots or something but it was
where you wore them that was important
is that it yes that seems to be it yes
so they started off as for decoration
but it got to the extent that there were
some
marriage contracts where women would
insist before they married their husband
that regardless of their husband's
political opinions the wife should be
able to patch as she pleased wow
and it's so you would have one or two
things but did it get to the point where
people you know when you see full face
tattoos
did you ever see people just completely
you would see not completely the full
face but you might see lots of these
like
fake beauty spots uh and you could
supposedly identify prostitutes because
their faces had so many of these patches
on them
was that a sign of being sexy though
having lots of stickers
well having one sticker was supposed to
be and the reason is
supposedly venus the um goddess of
beauty
she had one mole on her face and it was
by that one imperfection that you could
see how beautiful the rest of her face
was
and the idea was that they were kind of
copying that and by having like one
little beauty spot
it would show the paleness of your skin
perhaps or you know show off the rest of
your skin so if you have lots and lots
of stickers that means you're really
really beautiful
because you've got you need so many
imperfections to disguise how fit you
are could be that
you wouldn't believe what i looked like
without these stickers really nice it
could have been that you are covering
the symptoms of
stds it's a real gamble
so what are you sorry well i didn't
think that we had um
glue sticker technology in the when is
this 18th century
blue sure okay were they kind of fuzzy
felt
stickers that kind of thing i actually
don't think we had fuzzy felt
they would be made of various things so
they could be made of silk or
taffeta or leather sometimes and then
they'd have
um a mouthful apparently mouth fur mouth
like on your
on your tongue uh no have i suddenly
developed a lisp
it sounded like mouse from where i was
sat but okay
okay i heard mouth as well ah okay right
in and tell us what you heard
um so and then they'd have on the back
uh often
a surface that you could lick so women
tended to take them out their handbags
and lick them to attach them to their
face so you get very thin paper that
does that or they had adhesive so they'd
just stick it on with some glue
yeah but sometimes the adhesive wasn't
so great so there was an article in the
spectator that spoke about a woman who
had a beauty spot on her forehead but by
the end of the evening it had gone to
her chin
[Laughter]
they got more and more elaborate as well
didn't they is it caught on so i think
it started in france
and the french called them moosh which
is for flies because they look like
little flies landing on your face
um but yeah they expanded to be weird
shapes so
by the end of the 18th century you'd
have them cut into stars
or sort of moons or crown shapes or any
shape you wanted really
you still get those don't you on small
children yeah
yeah and adults who like a bit of fun
yeah why are you wearing that weird
puppy dog on the middle of your
head i was so considering doing it this
morning bottled out of it again
but yeah no you do get them like a
little kind of um
i don't know stars and yeah i've been
very brave at the dentist today
stick those on your forehead though do
they uh no actually i've got
i used to have one of those but it was a
safety pin one so that's not for the
forehead
no that's for the clothes safety pin
really oh it's a badge i'm describing a
badge
but what's interesting about that is i
think you're only brave at the dentist
once so you don't need it to be a badge
you only need it to be a sticker do you
know what you're right i'm confusing it
with my
i've been to a party at pizza hut badge
which is a badge because that's the
thing that lasts for life
if you go to a party at pizza hut in the
early 90s yeah you want to show off
about that don't you that's why you wear
badges
you don't want to be wearing a badge
that says i'd be brave at the dentist
just to show off
you feel pretty silly at the military
parade wouldn't you next to all the
other medals
it was just being brave at the dentist
i got this one for bravery
and i thought there's some drawings that
people have done of some of the designs
and there was a horse and carriage one
and i think that's been
that was satire was it that was someone
taking yeah absurd they've gone
yeah i was really hoping that that would
be because i just thought how
interesting heads must have been back
then
just no i don't know what to do if
you're sitting on the tube and someone
sat across from me with a horse and
carriage drawn on their head
and they had other cartoons you know i
wouldn't need the paper just but
people still have tattoos these days so
do you just wait yourself the tube just
read people's tattoos
i do but they give me a look that says
i'm not friendly
oh well this is the thing about um other
kinds of stickers
is that they could be indicators of how
friendly or not someone is
so bumper stickers if people have uh
bumper stickers on their car they tend
to be more aggressive
and territorial drivers oh yeah yeah
study in 2008 by colorado state
university and they surveyed people
saying
do you have bumper stickers on your car
and do you drive like a bastard and
basically
people who said yes to one said yes to
the other they said yeah i drive more
territorially
more aggressively i do not respond
constructively on the road when people
get in my way
and how often are these the baby on
board stickers
well i read that article and actually it
said that it doesn't matter what's on
the sticker
right so you might have a sticker that
says everyone needs to be kind to each
other and you're
still going to drive like a maniac yeah
so baby on board as well
yeah yeah yeah more likely to be
aggressive just one more thing
on an alternative use for stickers uh
for yourself for decoration is to cover
blemishes and so i think that's that's
sort of where facial stickers might have
come from originally
but men wore them quite a lot to cover
blemishes
or to accentuate them and so uh so if
men had been to war for instance it
became quite common for them to come
back and they'd put a scar sticker over
their scar i think if a scar started to
fade or something
then you'd put a big black scar there
and so there's for instance there's a
bit in all's well that ends well which
now makes sense
if you know where bertram comes back
from war and it says he's got a patch of
velvet on his face
and it's unclear if there's a scar
underneath and it was sort of the thing
that people did if they hadn't really
seen much military action
and they're a bit of a coward and they'd
run away at the first sign anyway is
that they've suddenly put a big blemish
on their face to imply that they'd been
shot in the head wow yeah that's amazing
i've got a little scar on my face maybe
i'll try and accentuate it
have you with some mouse fur
one of the sides i'm not sure which side
that's like yeah yeah yeah
somewhere you got shot in the civil war
isn't it
um obscene bumper stickers can sometimes
be a matter for the law
okay so there are all there are these
lawsuits that happen in the usa over
whether you're allowed a particular
bumper stick or not or whether it's
basically creating a public disturbance
just by having it on your car
so in 2008 uh a guy uh
went to the georgia supreme court
because he had a [ __ ] happens bumper
sticker
okay and i uh he won and then
uh more recently this bit is very rude
by the way but the police in florida
arrested
and charged a man who had a bumper
sticker which said i eat ass
and that was really big it's right in
the middle of his back windscreen as
well so there's no way if you're driving
along that you won't see it and was he
referring to donkey meat do we know
but the police pulled them over and they
said can you amend it so it wasn't
offensive
and he said well how do you suggest i do
that and they said can you remove the
second s from ass
so it would be i eat as but then the
grammar police come in
um guys who's the grandfather the god of
stickers the god of stickers the god of
stickers
the football albums panini yeah oh no i
was thinking of mr avery oh avery again
oh avery
stanton uh sorry
you know well because you never do any
of the office admin andy
you are not familiar with avery stickers
but those of us who post letters every
once in a while
this feels like more of a regret it
feels like this whole fact has been
building up to a grudge
um no so stanton avery mate was the
inventor of the self-adhesive
sticker as in you didn't need to lick it
you didn't need to add glue to it
and he still dominates the label market
today so i was looking into him
and he um so that he built his first
sticker machine i love this by marrying
together
a motor from a washing machine and a
sewing machine sewing machine parts so
we smushed them together
and generated a shed load of stickers
his company was initially called
come clean products spelling [ __ ] kum
which i think is a good thing was
changed
uh how did he make his glue
he was actually very cagey about the
process he wasn't pretty tired
uh he was
he was super poor uh and so he really
like
dragged himself up from the bottom he
lived in a rented chicken coop
while he was rented he couldn't even
afford the deposit
on a chicken coop did he pay the
chickens
i don't know if the chickens owned the
coop i think they were also renting
oh wow that's a terrible flatmate
you get eggs every morning that's true
yeah do you want to eat
an egg if your flatmate has just laid it
before your horrified eyes
i refuse to eat food that's come out of
any of my friend's asses
however delicious that's amazing
yeah so cool he could have written i eat
and then in brackets eggs that have come
out of the chickens
close brackets ass good another strong
defenses so many articles are going up
for
um so he tried a bunch of business how
did he get a washing machine
in the chicken coop so i think this is
post chicken coop
and he got it because he married a
slightly wealthier lady who lent him a
bit of money
wow and he's all i need is a washing
machine we go back to your place online
chicken's
[Laughter]
he got laid that night
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is my fact
my fact this week is that the very first
print run of the adventures of
huckleberry finn
had to be pulped after a bookstore owner
discovered someone had sneaked
a drawing of a penis into one of the
illustrations
the first suspect has to be the
illustrator issue
yes we genuinely don't know we don't
know if it was the illustrator we don't
know if it was the photo engraver at the
actual
factory where they were printing the
book what we do know is when these books
came out at the end of chapter 32
huck finn is meeting his aunt sally and
uncle silas and uncle silas
has a big erect penis drawn in in the
illustration itself
and as a result 30 000 copies had to be
pulled and did they definitely checked
they checked the
plot and they don't it's not part of the
storyline that references uncle silas as
a record
weirdly weirdly i read the book and i
can confirm there isn't a bit where
uncle silas has an erection
and is showing it off to his family it
must have been very disappointing when
you got to the end of that
it's the only reason [ __ ] in the first
place
so this is obviously it's a very
important book in american literature
ernest hemingway said all modern
american literature comes from one book
and it's called huckleberry finn and the
idea was it was the first book that used
the vernacular
of americans at that point americans
were really writing in the tone of
british and european authors
um not using the day-to-day language and
he kind of set the tone
unfortunately it's also a book that's
laced with racism and
uh that's caused huge problems basically
since publication
it's not a book that's sort of not been
controversial throughout the years
the language use is difficult and racism
we should say that it's set mark twain
wrote it in the 80s but it's set
about 40 years earlier in the 1840s
isn't it yeah um and the main plot of
huckabee finn for anyone who hasn't read
it is basically it's about huck finn
who is this kind of poor kid who how old
is he 12 or 13.
and he runs away along with a runaway
slave who is called jim and they run
away together and they
are good friends and jim is a very
sympathetic character but at the same
time very problematically
drawn yeah one of them not drawn with an
erect penis like uncle silas we should
say
people have objected to stuff other than
that so it was extremely controversial
as soon as it was published largely
because of the
kind of crudeness of some of the
language and that was written in this
native dialect
it wasn't just like ordinary american
dialect it was proper mississippi
1840s dialect and it was banned for
bad grammar and employment of inelegant
expressions
things like in 1905 a brooklyn library
banned it because
huck not only itched but he scratched so
apparently that's
disgusting and he said sweat when he
should have said perspiration
so mark twain had been kind of unhappy
with the way the publishing had been
going and he decided he didn't want to
have
normal publishers like before and get
the money that way
he wanted to have a subscription service
so he sent people door-to-door
with like um you know the first chapter
and said look there's this new book
coming out
how do you fancy buying it and then
we'll send you all the chapters in
future
and he basically because he did this it
meant he could have full control
of it which meant he had full control of
all of the
illustrations and it meant that when the
illustrator kept sending him stuff he
was like don't like that don't like that
don't like that don't like that i do
like that but i love that penis
well it's so is that maybe why they
perhaps one theory that the illustrator
hated him so much because he kept asking
him to change things so he was like
right fine
but they offered a massive reward to the
press men working on the novel
a 500 award which would have been a lot
of money today and
no one fessed up so we still there's no
culprit
and is the is the investigation still
open
i think the office the reward is still
available
he had a terrible relationship with his
sort of typesetters and proofreaders and
everyone like that didn't he which might
be why they were so pissed off with him
he hated them and it does sound like
they kept on trying to improve his
punctuation and grammar which was
deliberately vernacular
and once upon getting a text back and
saying the corrections that have been
made
he wrote to a friend i've telegraphed
orders to have the proofreader shot
without giving him time to pray
so it was tense i think wow if someone
wrote that about him i'd draw a penis on
their picture
it wasn't the most successful book that
he published with that firm
so the first two books that that firm
published were huckleberry finn
and the memoirs of ulysses s grant
ex-president and it was pretty much the
last thing grant did was write this book
and it was so successful that he gave
grant's widow the biggest ever royalty
check in american publishing history
like it was absolutely massive
and it was thanks to that door-to-door
technique that james mentioned because
it was war veterans so civil war
veterans going door-to-door
selling the book and that's a pretty
strong sell you know
i might be wrong in saying this but from
the story that i know about that
it's that when ulysses s grant died his
wife
was really struggling financially and
was not given any
um help from anyone and mark twain
published the book and gave her that
high amount of royalties um before he
knew it was going to be successful so
that she had
money to live off for the rest of her
life um
apparently it's an extraordinary book
that autobiography
really yeah yeah i've read so many
things about it being the best book by
anyone in government ever as a solid
it's just incredible apparently surely
not better than the art of the deal
surely
shall we not better than jacob
rees-mogg's book about the victorians
that can't be better than that can it
now if we want to talk about offensive
language
mark twain was wrote the first book on a
typewriter
in america there's a bit of dispute over
whether it was tom sawyer or another one
of his books
um it's usually credited as tom sawyer
um but
he used to love writing on a typewriter
and no one really had it at the time so
people used to write him letters and he
would write letters back on his
typewriter they would then write back to
him
asking about the typewriter and that got
so annoying with so many people writing
back to him
asking him holy moly what is this this
is incredible that he stopped writing
letters
using his typewriter she's got yeah i
really love his correspondence because
he didn't really much like getting them
a lot of the time did he
i read one that he got in 1901 uh and
the letter said dear mr mark twain i am
a little girl
six years old i have read your stories
ever since they first came out
i have a cat named kitty and a dog named
pop i like to guess puzzles
did you write a story for the herald
competition i hope you will answer my
letter
yours truly augusta cortrecht to which
he replied
well no he didn't reply he just wrote a
comment on it saying
lame attempt of a middle-aged liar to
pull an autograph
[Laughter]
he invented one game for kids which i
think sounds pretty
cool so he he measured out a 817
foot path of his driveway
and he marked every single foot and that
was supposed to be a year
and it was the year from 1066 when
william the conqueror arrived
in britain and the idea is you would
walk along the path
and at each point when there was a new
king or queen in
england or britain then you would put a
stake in the ground
and you would be like oh this is edward
the first this is henry ii blah blah
blah
and it was a way of having fun but also
learning your kings and queens because
in those days
education was very much rote learning
like you just had to learn all these
things and this was a fun way of doing
it
or a very annoyingly slow way of getting
to the front door after a long day
in the office but
he turned it into a board game didn't it
or he tried to it sounds really
complicated i
didn't fully understand it even after
reading it and i thought it sounded
quite
it sounded a bit like battleship so
basically it was another sort of history
date memorization game and
essentially you'd have a chart with a
series of dates on it
and each player would say a date so you
say um
1918 and then the other player has to
say an event that happened on that date
say the end of the first world war see i
cleverly chose my day in advance
so i'd have something to say for it i
mean you also chose a date that was
nearly ten years after twain died when
no one could possibly
guess what was going to happen but then
a player puts a pin in that date if they
get it right and
if if they don't get it right they don't
get a pin and i guess when you've
covered up all your dates you've won
sounds quite fun yeah for a nerd
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
andy my fact is that before vaccination
was invented the main method of
inoculation against smallpox was to
powder scabs and blow them up your nose
lonely
or to get someone else to blow them up
your nose it's very hard to blow up your
own nose
um and this was how inoculation worked
for a long time it was done in china a
thousand years ago
this was the method they knew about this
and it did work didn't it
it worked reasonably well
so if you were healthy you would
get some smallpox scabs and
you would leave them for a little while
because fresh scabs were likelier to
give you
the infection properly so they would be
dried
aged smallpox scabs and they would be
powdered up and then they would be blown
up your nose with a special silver
blowpipe for the procedure as well the
chinese
doctors had special blow pipes to do
this and then um
apparently the right nostrils was used
for boys in the left for girls
and you would maybe get some mild
symptoms
and some people did actually just then
get full-blown smallpox but
uh most people then got it you know some
mild symptoms and then we're resistant
to any following exposure
it was a low percentage wasn't it yeah
yeah um so this was a really
decent way of doing it before we had the
method of vaccination
and we didn't know about this is that
right uh the 18th it took about eight
seven hundred years to get over and it
works by the same method as vaccination
right which is that it's an attenuated
or weakened version of the disease um
in a scab and your body then makes
antibodies that can fight against that
and then it can fight against the main
thing is that right yeah i think
there was another version where you had
some powdered scab as well or
you had some pus from a smallpox pustule
and you would make a little scratch on
your skin and then you would
just pour that pus or you know dust rub
that
powdered scab into your skin and that
worked too
and that's called variolation because
variola was the latin for smallpox
um in 2011 the virginia historical
society in richmond
had some things from its collection and
one of them was a letter from the 1870s
that had a smallpox scab
in it and the idea was that the person
who wrote the letter in the
19th century was sending it to his
father
it had been taken from the arm of a
child and his father was going to
make it into dust and inoculate people
yeah but then
it never got to the recipient and so
they just found this letter
and of course immediately these centers
for disease control came in the hazmat
suits
and said holy [ __ ] you don't need to be
having this
that the public can see this because
smallpox has been eradicated basically
hasn't it and
um so yeah in the end they've there was
some of the virus on this scab still
but it wasn't deadly enough i mean it
must have attenuated pretty hard by that
exactly
how when was it uh it was from 1876 and
they found it in 2011.
wow that is really spooky finding it not
knowing what it is
you just think you found a little button
or something all right maybe it's like a
little
um sticker to put on your face
but all these doctors have their own
different methods of doing variation and
there were some celebrity doctors in
britain in the 17th 18th century who
worked work this out
so have you heard of johnny notions
sounds like he's got some weird ideas
[Laughter]
well he was a scottish doctor and he had
a really successful method for variating
because he would he would collect the
pus
first of all and everyone had their own
method of making it a bit less deadly
basically
so he would dry it with peat smoke so he
had a lovely sort of smoky flavor for
the past
very nice and then he would bury it in
the ground between sheets of glass
okay with some campfire um then he would
keep it there for seven or eight
years wow this it's like he's making a
whiskey isn't it
yeah genuine years and then he would uh
insert it and he would then put a
cabbage leaf on top as a plaster
and this was apparently a really good
way of doing it and it just gave you the
nice amount
i suppose it does take the edge off the
um pus doesn't it
it's a nice pt cabbagey flavor to it
yeah
apparently you were more likely to get a
job if you could be seen to have
smallpox scars because then the
suggestion was oh great you can work
with us you're not going to pass it on
you've had it already
so that was seen as a sort of oh great
safe work
mate so two two of the earliest
people who worked with inoculation were
robert [ __ ]
in germany and louis pasteur in france
uh and they fell out with each other
because um pasteur once was doing a
talk and he used the phrase requi
alemonde which means a collection of
german writing
but the translator translated it as ogwi
alemand which means german arrogance
and so um [ __ ] never forgave him for
that because he thought that pastel was
calling him arrogant
although i think that before that they
loathe each other if you read the
dialogues that they had the letters they
wrote each other it's just basically
spitting with rage you know uh [ __ ]
writing letters to
pastor accusing him of stealing all of
his ideas and vice versa saying you're a
fraud
you know really foul language because
there was this huge fight basically when
we suddenly discovered the power of
the idea of vaccination between a few
scientists wasn't there
so was that was after jenna yes
jenna oh okay so edward jenner is the
person who um
kind of we give the we say created
vaccinations
yes today right he um got it from
milkmaids
did he yeah because there were milk
maids near him and he noticed that they
got a thing called cowpox which is a
disease that cow's got
and they would only get one single
pustule on their hands
which is where they've been touching the
cows because of all the milking and he
theorized maybe this is a milder version
of smallpox
so then he did this amazing gamble jenna
he took
some puss from a milkmaid and
uh he injected it into a child yeah and
six yeah not his child by the way
although he did also do it with his own
child actually later on so fair play
um i think when he knew it worked and
then he
six weeks later he injected the child
with full-blown smallpox
um and he didn't know how it worked and
um
yeah and then but later in life they
became friends so him and the child
yeah james phipps he was the son of uh
edward jenner's gardener
which if it hadn't worked would have
made the gardening very very awkward i
think for a long time i think he would
have ruined your rose bush after that
he had smallpox when he was a child
jenna
and one of the reasons that he kind of
went into getting rid of it later is
because he had such a bad time of it
he was very elated so they gave him some
of the
pus or some scabs or something
but he was prepared for that by being
starved purged and bled and locked in a
stable with
other infected boys they're affected
boys yeah
so they kind of verilated all these
people gave them like very mild
symptoms and then put them all in a
stable wow meanwhile stanton avery's
outside of the chicken coop
i don't know you're born mate
[Laughter]
okay it's time for our final fact of the
show and that is
james okay my fact this week is that you
can tell if a movie character is a
goodie or a baddie
by the kind of phone they use
that's that sucks now that i know that
and i'm watching movies i know
sorry this is not just a spoiler of one
movie this is spoiler of all movies
and so this came up in my rss feed
thanks to the blog neetorama which i
follow
and it was an interview with rhian
johnson who is the director of the film
knives out
and he said that apple have forbid
filmmakers from letting villains use
their iphones on the screen
and so if one of your characters is
using an apple product then they must be
a good guy
oh thank you so you can't tell who's the
good guy in the good the bad and the
ugly for instance
it's a wonderful life i'm not sure any
of them had mobile phones
they've been edited in it's yeah yeah
but sometimes it's not clear who is a
goodie and who's a baddie if someone is
if someone pushes one person in front of
a train to save five people who will be
allowed on my phone at the same time
you're absolutely right in
any decent story everyone has a mixture
of good and badass
everyone has one iphone and one android
yeah that's a good point
actually that saves it for me because
the movie might have been sponsored by
samsung for example yeah yeah so that's
good okay great
i'll stop googling which phone sponsored
all my movies
um but yeah and there was also an
article in the verge that says
that apple says that its products should
only be used in the best light
uh that reflects favorably on apple
products and they don't
they according to apple they don't pay
to have their
phones in movies but what they do do is
give lots of free
phones and macbooks and stuff to the
people who are making the movies
uh in return for them being nice but you
they wouldn't show someone looking up on
the internet
how to kill orphans
no on a macbook on a macbook you
couldn't do that on a macbook no yeah
were to inject this person
um but this is a thing called product
displacement
which is the it's always kind of like
product displays the product
displacement is where
you replace a real brand with a
fictional one because the original brand
i'm really annoyed about oh okay
so um there's a film called flight which
stars denzel washington as an alcoholic
pilot
who he manages to pull off a crazy move
he the plane's about to crash due to
you know it's all gone wrong on the
plane and he manages to fly it in
upside down and then land it the right
way up at the very last moment i gotta
say the first
five minutes of that movie is one of the
best things i've ever seen
it's so tense it's so amazing okay and
the rest is terrible right
you didn't want to say it out loud no
i've seen it too it's [ __ ] wow
dan thinks the film is bad i'm not gonna
tell you not to watch it especially now
the ending's been spoiled anyway
well the rest of the film is like either
just a lengthy legal process about
whether he was right to
save the plane it's a legal drama
imagine if you go to watch that film
and you're five minutes late
[Laughter]
that would be the worst thing ever
oh my god they should make it into a
short and release it
in short films yeah yeah anyway it's a
problem zamekaz who gave us back to the
future
he is an alcoholic pilot denzel
washington
the character sorry not robert mechas
not denzel washington the character
but he drinks budweiser uh and a vodka
that
uh budweiser own either while he's
flying the plane or shortly before i
mean you guys have seen the film so
you'll know
but budweiser were furious about this
and they said can you not show this
drunk pilot
sinking a bud before he flies the plane
and they refused
they said there's nothing you can do but
it's so um that happens sometimes movies
do have to buckle
to these bigger companies so slumdog
millionaire when danny boyle made that
uh he gave an interview where he talked
about the fact that he had some criminal
gangs drinking coca-cola at one point um
ice-cold coca-cola and i don't know
are we sorry are you personally
sponsored by coca-cola today
wow it was a refreshing ice cold
coca-cola
so yummy um available in all shops
but yeah they they're drinking in that
and coca-cola took
a sort of stand against it and so they
had to paint it out in
the post-production of it yeah slum talk
millionaire was the most bizarre film i
hadn't realized this but obviously at
the time
it was so huge and it won the oscar
didn't it yeah and it was massive i
didn't realize it was made by the same
company that makes who wants to be a
millionaire
so it was one huge piece of product
placement
oh yeah isn't that jasper carrot who
makes that
yes it is yeah well he wrote slumdog
millionaire
it might be it's called keledor yes yeah
he's pretty hands off with it but yeah
he's a direct beneficiary of both
those things i think it's celadar isn't
it yeah
it's well it's a company called cellador
of course so it's like cellar door i
just got it
i don't think i don't know i don't think
it's deliberately named to be like the
cellar door it might be it's just for
carrot he does love his
punch what's the metaphor behind that
like don't look behind the cellar door
it's actually jasper sarat
any international listeners who are
wondering who jasper carrot is there's
no time
yeah um so stelladore made this who made
he wants to be a millionaire and then
they decided to make slumdog to sort of
advertise who wants to be a millionaire
and the screenwriter
for slumdog millionaire was one of the
co-creators of who wants to be a
millionaire
but the only thing that they stipulated
was that at the end this is a spoiler
where he's being accused of cheating
the hero is being accused of cheating
the host of millionaire
sort of tortures him backstage and at
that point they said we can't have it
look like the show
is torturing this boy because that's
going to make us look bad so it's just
got to be the host so it's like chris
taran's gone out on a limb
but it wasn't chris taran in the film
any international listeners who were
clinging on after jasper carrick
without giving up chris
[Laughter]
so hang on torture equipment does the
host of
who wants to be a millionaire have
access to backstage like you couldn't do
more than a quick chinese burn or a
wedgie could you
he's got that tension music yeah he's
got a super long advert break
without telling him i found out
just looking at product placement stuff
i found out one of the first ever
examples
of product placement on a podcast
okay so this was in 2005 there was a
show called the dawn and drew show
okay and it was the newspapers at the
time had to explain what a podcast was
which is so the report i read said a
podcast is
or this particular podcast is a program
filled with strong language
that is available only in a digital
format and downloaded on ipods and other
devices that play mp3 files
okay so that's what a podcast is and
this one was the dawn and true show and
it was sponsored
it was product placemented by durex
okay and durex um had inserted their
product into the show because it was
hosted by a husband and wife
and the show featured the husband and
the wife and their dog hercules
tasting flavored condoms that was the
first ever
podcast the firm said they were
delighted and they said this is
exactly how we want to position the
branch
were they condoms for dogs and humans
alike
[Laughter]
no because you'd have to have a dog meat
flavoured
then i love strawberry today
so anyway i'm just saying we've got
further to sink before we
you know you're um this is not a bit of
product placement but we're recording
this podcast on
a mac computer and we're all good guys
um now if you were to close that don't
close it because we might lose the
recording but you would see that the
apple
is upside down as you're looking at it
so maybe if you half close it
you see it's kind of upside down as
you're looking now the reason that is
is for product placement reasons so
it was in legally blonde which is a
properly great film
yeah um she is using an apple mac
but the apple is upside down to what we
have it today because that's the way it
used to be because it makes much more
sense that if you have it closed and
you're looking at it the apple is the
right way up oh yeah
yeah um and that's how it used to be but
then there was an employee called joe
moreno who said to steve jobs look if
we're going to put these in movies what
we need is when it's open
and you're looking at it the apple is
the right way so they changed it
or if someone's just like watching you
in a cafe of course you've got to put
the right way up for the people looking
at it not the one who owns it already
that's really interesting so basically
the apple
on your apple mac is not for you it's
for everyone else yeah wow
some advertisers um this is sort of the
next step they're doing for advertising
and things so advertisers in soap operas
are now
selling billboards inside the fictional
locations in the soap
operas whoa yeah so coronation street
is a fictional street but it's a
fictional street with advertising
billboards on it yeah and
you know jewellery shops and other shops
are
buying up advertising space and
functional coronation street yes
so clever and there's a new thing also
that other advertisers are doing
where you know you'll be able to
digitally alter
what viewers see on screen when they're
streaming
so you should be different people see
different things so if you are watching
uh let's say you drink whiskey and your
tv
knows that you're drinking whiskey um
there might be billboards for whiskey
brands in the background
whereas if you but what if you're a
person
who like secretly buys dog meat
flavoured condoms
and you're watching coronation street
with your parents
that's such a good point the whole
family looking at each other
suspiciously
looks like an agatha christie
yeah exactly wow or they might do it
based on the time of day even
so if you're watching late at night
there'll be adverts for as we all do
watch coronation street later tonight
absolutely have another late night set
um
yeah they'll be adverts for i guess late
night stuff like swearing
wow cocaine if you're watching in the
morning it'll just be a bit for cereal
and orange juice
or whiskey just one ironic thing about
this
fact is that apples are a sign that
someone's a villain
what huh in films apparently people have
spotted this
if you're the baddie you're always
eating an apple not always this isn't
across
the bad guys and doctor who do that
don't they because an apple a day keeps
the doctor away
this is true please send in more if
you've seen them but uh draco malfoy
does it
jeffrey rush in parts of the caribbean
eats and crunches down on apple colin
farrell when he's playing a vampire in
something or other
um and it's it's got her name is the
arrogant apple
sometimes it's really just to show your
dominance because it's kind of showing
yourself so
loose yeah yeah i can eat an apple as
well as talking to you i don't
give enough of a crap about what you're
saying to stop eating my apples i wonder
if there's like the history of the
poisoned apple in
fairy tales and things that's been
theorized
on the internet james you should check
the internet out
for more on that garden of eden
again and apple was eaten there
it's all on the forums it sounds like we
can think of everything on the internet
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening
if you'd like to get in contact with any
of us about the things that we have said
over the course of this podcast
we can be found on our twitter account
i'm on at schreiberland
james at james harkin andy at andrew
hunter m
ed czeczinski you can email
podcast.qi.com
yeah where you can go to our group
account at no such thing or our website
no such thing as a fish.com
why not check the internet out as well
while you're there and uh we'll be back
again next week with another episode
we'll see you then
goodbye
[Music]
anyway uh our sponsors this week are the
new durex range of pedigree chum
stop the bug gas
[Music]

=333
hi everybody before we start this week's
show we
have to let you know that it is a
special summer compilation of
all the most wonderful stuff that for
time
space and legal reasons we have not been
able to fit into shows over the last few
months
hang on a second so we're releasing a
whole show that was legally dubious
this is the end of no such thing as a
fish we we're gonna be sued by
uh figs the people who run the fermi lab
russia
all of these things are mentioned in the
show and my catchphrase this week is
balls balls balls so listen out for that
is it
in what context you heard it a few weeks
ago you'll hear it again shortly
no no wonder that was cut all right on
with the show
balls balls balls
[Applause]
[Music]
there is a there's a theory that we only
have hands because of figs
i believe it i believe it it's that our
hands
evolved as tools for assessing whether
figs are soft or not okay so this sounds
insane but it's a proper
theory from a dartmouth paper okay and
what chimpanzees do
in the wild they squeeze fruit just like
we do in a supermarket to work out
whether it's
it's good to do that andy oh yeah okay
don't do that now um yeah fine
they squeeze fruit like we used to until
four months ago in a supermarket
which and that might have helped us
develop fine motor control because
chimpanzees get a massive advantage from
being able to squeeze fruit because it
they can do it four times faster than if
they have to detach it
bite it and then assess it right so they
can tell much less like birds and
monkeys they have to rely on visual
information or on oral information are
you eating a bit of it
so chimpanzees have an advantage there
um do they ever do the thing where
um they squeeze it a bit too hard they
put their thumb through it and then they
try and bury it under some other figs
and pretend that they haven't touched it
this is why you shouldn't squeeze stuff
in a supermarket guys
every time you squeeze an avocado it's
making it bruised for the next person
who comes along or if you put your thumb
through it eventually it'll be perfect
though eventually it's perfect for the
40th or 50th person who touches that
avocado
exactly i mean there are so many fruits
you've got to do this grease test
so i can't believe they've never used
supermarket fruit in crime solving
because
every item is covered in fingerprints
just a thought
for the met great
but it's not as if they're getting to a
crime scene and they're going should we
dust the avocados no no don't waste your
time on that
but what do you mean i think what i'm
saying is you go to a crime scene you
find some fingerprints then you go to
the nearest tesco and you dust
all the fruit yeah exactly sorry sorry
that does work
and then you cross reference it with a
cctv of who's been in the supermarket
it's a genius idea
everyone goes to the supermarket apart
from the icardo killer uh
they will get away with it for years
there's a
lab in uh it's is it called fermilab now
the the
physics guys in america um it was called
the national accelerator lab back in the
day and in 1971 they were testing their
particle accelerator
um so you know it has huge 13 ton
magnets all the way around this four
mile ring and they they noticed that it
kept failing and it kept messing up
because the magnets were kind of being
pulled into the vacuum tubes and they
were leaving these little metal slivers
inside the actual uh tube which is meant
to be all empty
so how do you get inside those tubes
to empty them out uh
how do you gain access um do you cover
yourself in butter
and then slip in well you're too big to
go in you have to send something into
the tube a child
a ferret a ferret a ferret it's always a
bloody feather isn't it
into a particle accelerator they sent
they got a ferret called felicia for 30
dollars
and um she didn't want to go she had to
be trained with progressively larger
tubes because they just started off by
putting her at this like 300 foot tube
and she said i'm not going in there
obviously
and then she's a talking ferret and she
was still only 30 dollars
wow she could only talk after she came
out of the particle accelerator
um yeah but then she she pulled through
she pulled it through and then they were
able to attach a cleaning swab and they
clean it properly
very sadly she died the following year
oh
but knowing that she'd been of use to
mankind which is what yeah
well so she was at a sanctuary i think
she might have died because do you
remember we talked about how female
ferrets die if they don't have sex for a
year
come on if you've just been in a
tactical accelerator and you can tell
that story
you are getting a lot of sex
hey um garden gnomes are they basically
the replacement of hermits did we
did we do them out of a job when the
garden gnome was invented there's debate
i believe there's debate about this
right okay some people point out that
they live in your garden
and they're bearded and weird and then
other people say
no um they are flamboyant and they're
like showing off and they're clearly not
like hermits at all
they're just both kinds of people who
like to live in your garden i don't know
if they're flamboyant
i can't believe we've stolen this debate
from newsnite
well i thought because i just very
quickly when i was reading about hermits
and they said that gnomes had replaced
them
um i discovered that one of the most
notable producers of gnomes
was a man called tom major bell who was
the prime minister john major's father
yeah he was one of the most notable and
he so he had a company called majors
garden ornaments
majors garden ornaments and yeah and
that took them from being quite a sort
of not well to do family to becoming
middle class i mean effectively
gnomes are the reason that john major
became prime minister
wow i mean i'm i'm speculating there to
a huge degree
i think that's right that's incredible
yeah didn't he then become a
acrobat or something no yeah he was that
was his previous career that was he
he was his whole life he was a circus
performer and an acrobat and i'm sick of
people
laughing at me in my circus job i'm
going to get into a serious career
and that's supposedly where this is just
a bit of trivia but supposedly where
david bowie got
major tom from because he saw on a
poster tom major um
so major tom of the space auto tea song
but yeah so garden gnomes gave us a
prime minister
wow it really does take david bowie down
a few rungs of cool
knowing that that song was written about
john mager's dad well actually
i don't know if he'd won that broadcast
here's what's even weirder the first
ever david bowie song
was the laughing gnome that was his
first single
wow just suddenly realize that
yeah spooky well there's that there's
that church as well that i think we all
probably know about which was called the
sand covered church
um and what was special about that so
this is a cornwall and uh an encroaching
uh
sand uh dune or just a whole cover of
desert was heading towards it
and um this church slowly got covered up
and covered up
uh by sand that it got to the point
where no one could get into the church
itself so they were constantly having to
dig the sand away to get through the
door there's a story that
um the vicar was once uh lowered once a
year
via skylight into the into the church so
that he could perform a once a year
sermon
i actually can't find any uh sources for
that except for qi so i don't know uh
was it recent or was it 13th century or
no 19th century yeah
yeah and it's a very old church it still
stands as a sort of restored version of
it which is just the steeple sticking
out of the ground now um and the rest of
the church presumably
what series of qi was it on was it
before i started or
yeah no it was actually um part of the
uh telegraph
articles um that used to be written by
qi oh yeah i used to write those
okay yeah your name's not on this one
all right
can i just ask dan if the vicar's being
lowered in through a skylight to give a
sermon to whom is he giving that sermon
when presumably no one else is entered
through the door
he's a missionary converting the death
worms
i have a feeling it was a symbolic thing
they had to do it once a year to sort of
um claim that it was still a church it
was it was something along those lines
it wasn't to a congregation though i
think that would really increase the
church attendance which is a worry often
if your vicar flew in through the roof
every time he gave you a sermon
like that's cool enough that i might
start going to church yeah
did you know just this is just on the
public health england report so there's
this report in 2017 that said you've got
to reduce sugar
in cereals but i read the report and
bizarrely
um it divides food into various
categories and kitkats and penguin bars
are not chocolate bars
hmm like biscuits weird fact i found
yeah they're biscuits
oh is this this is normal news to you
guys is it no no i just i just was
making a leap to what else it could be
i kind of half agree that penguins maybe
aren't chocolate bars
bang on chocolate bars yeah look at the
kitkat chunky
yeah it specified two finger kit cats
actually so it could be
the kitkat chunky was elsewhere still a
biscuit
it also cited under chocolate
confectionery as an example the
chocolate lollipop which i don't think
i've ever had
is that a thing sounds great i have
never had i have some in my house some
chocolate lollipops
and i have a big bowl of dum-dums in my
house
like there's about probably about 200 in
there
and some of them taste like chocolate
and they're the worst ones
i thought you meant dum dums the
explosive bullets used the assassination
attempt on ronald reagan
i was gonna say james edit this bit
i thought you met pacifiers because i've
got a shitload of those
dum-dums you know they're like um what
are they called chopper chops but
american versions of
childhood okay yes yeah yeah yeah okay
fair enough um have you guys heard of
the golden mole award
no no no okay so this is uh this was set
up in 2016 by npr and specifically
um inspired by the fact that the golden
mole does have this rainbow
shine on its fur and doesn't know it and
they
they talk of it as being accidental
brilliance
the fact that they have no idea it's
there they are accidentally brilliant
and so the golden mole award for
accidental brilliance was set up by
npr and the idea was to award scientists
who made accidentally
brilliant discoveries when they weren't
looking for the thing that they found
so for example there was a biologist
called shelly adamo who was trying to
study the stress levels in crickets
and in order to do that she introduced a
predator which was a
bearded dragon and the idea was the
bearded dragon was meant to just scare
them
by being around them and she could suss
out the stress um but the lizard
accidentally passed on a virus which
infected the crickets and the crickets
um gave it gave the crickets this insane
libido and they started mating
and it was suddenly discovered that it
was a parasitic
aphrodisiac and they had no idea that
this lizard would ever have the ability
to pass on something like this to
crickets and make them
have sex so accidental brilliance as a
as a discovery
and it champions all of these great
moments for scientists who've had these
little situations
and it happened in 2016 and it's never
happened again i don't know why they
stopped it it's such a wonderful idea
for an award
oh i thought you meant the so the awards
never happened again sorry yeah the
awards the golden roll awards as far as
i can tell have only been awarded in
2016. and then that's it they retired it
as a
and do they have any theories about why
it's an aphrodisiac because it could be
like you know if if i was there with my
partner and then there's a huge herd of
lions coming towards us on the horizon
which i guess is the equivalent
i guess you'd think sod it might as well
right get another shag out before we're
torn to shreds is that what they're
thinking
um we don't know i think that's notified
it was a parasitic
organism which jumped from the dragon to
the crickets
so that's one theory is the organism but
is the other theory that you only live
once
absolutely you're right you're right
screw shelley adamo and her biology
degree we should
have the anatomy that's probably why
they stopped the award because
everyone just went well that's a stupid
theory
your theory about the parasite i know
you've found an actual parasite
in the crickets and i know you can see
that it came from the dragon and i know
that you've given it to other crickets
and they do exactly the same thing i
know all that
but what about but clearly yeah clearly
the crickets are just going carpe diem
get on it literally this experiment
um we didn't quite go into it then i
think right so
uh basically what they had was like a
big perspex
circular tank um with two walls
so the sand dunes could go around the
circumference of the circle
right and they could kind of chase each
other and it was like a wind tunnel that
sent it round
uh but the guy who did it was called
carol batzik
or carol bachchick and he works at
cambridge university
and the reason that he did this
experiment is he was just looking at one
um sand dune going around this thing and
he's thinking this
is boring it's like it's taking
ages like to get any kind of um any kind
of data
and so what i'm going to do is i'm going
to double my capacity
and put two sand dunes in and then i
could get twice as much data
i'm just going to do that and then when
he did that it started a new experiment
that he hadn't intended to do
which was to see how the two interact
with each other
do you think when he proposed that
people said you're batshit
crazy because his name is batshit
yeah yes i i thought i thought of it
immediately when you said bat chick and
then
your explanation was so good but i i
didn't realize it would be that long and
so
gradually that became less and less
point in making the joke
it's good you've shown us you're working
yeah and it's nice that you held on to
it
uh i think it's important to explain why
you don't get a laugh
his name sounds like a colloquial term
for kovid really that's it
we should all just say we're about sick
that's just more catchy cardiff i wasn't
going to cut out these gel cats
in 2005 alaska zoo had an elephant which
was very she was kind of uh overweight
because she was in captivity she
couldn't
walk she you know um so they had a
problem here
so how would you solve that um you would
give her a treadmill
exactly they did they built the first
and as far as i can tell the only ever
world's
elephant trailer wow wow oh my goodness
yeah they got a company which does heavy
duty conveyor belts for mining
and they they put that together 22 feet
long
um could support this 4 000 kilo
elephant
and um this was september 2005. the
headline was
now to get the elephant on the treadmill
okay
the next headline from the same website
was elephant scorns her treasure oh no
she hated it she never got on got fully
on to it once
wow i can kind of empathize with that
everyone hates treadmills don't they
yeah yeah yeah and she was later moved
to a sanctuary in california but guess
what happened to the treadmill it was
used for different animals
um mice but like 5 000 of them
[Laughter]
you're kind of kind of close in a way it
was bought by
a dog musher oh
cool god that's a fat
dog you've got i don't know how that's
managing to run across the arctic if
it's the same weight as an elephant
no it's a full pack of ducks no it's a
pack of dogs because it's
it's a 22 foot long big it's a pack of
dogs that makes sense not one obese dog
that they were trying to bring the
weight down
okay they had
one particular one a russian mission
actually so this is after the fall of
the soviet union they kept hurling
probes at mars
and the mars 96 russian mission was
carrying 200 grams of plutonium and it
was going to use it as a power source
but obviously an incredibly radioactive
element and it messed up
as so many of those probes do and so
while it was trying to escape the
earth's orbit it failed
and it broke apart and then there was
just this satellite carrying plutonium
which would be incredibly dangerous if
it broke up anywhere on the planet
that was spinning around around the
earth and all the countries of the earth
were kind of watching it
like um like watching a roulette wheel
and at one point they thought i think
it's gonna land in australia it's gonna
land in australia and clinton
like clinton called up john howard in
australia and said okay i'm really sorry
i think you're gonna be hit by some
plutonium
we'll help you out don't worry about it
and then it sort of missed australia
and then the official report went out
that it landed in the pacific ocean
which was weird because about 200 people
in chile
said that they'd seen something burn up
in the atmosphere and crash into the
ground
and they've now sort of admitted that
it's probably somewhere on the border of
chile and bolivia
and if you see something don't do
anything with it
it's a bit like past the parcel isn't it
where it just keeps going around and
keeps going around you don't know when
it's going to stop
like the earth is just or actually it's
more like do you remember those games
where it's like
a water balloon and you keep passing it
around to everyone and eventually it
blows up in your face
or something no how is the water balloon
exploded in this like is there explosive
i think it's in like
i think it's in like a piece of plastic
or something i don't really know
you know what this is this is a game
which you could buy when i was
a teenager or younger and we weren't
allowed to have it so i only saw it in
adverts
oh no wait i think i remember the
adverts because i think in the middle of
the water balloon is an unstable isotope
of uranium and that might decay at any
point which will make the blue
pot uh quickly some stuff on wrestling
or not oh well yeah yeah
some funny wrestling nicknames yeah okay
there's
lots of lists online of um good
wrestling nicknames uh
jimmy wang yang nice
no beaver cleavage amazing
beaver cleaver cleavage is these
desirable attributes for a wrestler why
do you want a beaver cleavage what even
is that
is there a dam on it at the time there
was a tv show called leave it to beaver
apparently i don't know what it was
about but apparently
his name came from that for some reason
have you heard of um
balls mahoney he was another wrestler
his fans would shout balls balls balls
while he punched his opponents
where did he punch i haven't got that
written down
because it feels like a request
can i just mention the possibly
real-life animal whisperer who dr
doolittle was based on oh yeah
yeah um so we're actually not sure about
this but his life
resembled dr zuluto's in a way and it
turns out that it could be that dr
doolittle is the same person as dr
jekyll
and mr hyde no way wait so
he's three people that's so funny if he
drinks one dose of the potion he turns
into edward hyde a psychopathic murderer
but if he drinks
two he turns into a sort of charming
animal doctor yeah that's right yeah
cool
but he keeps on mixing up the potions
and that's where the essential comedy of
dr jekyll mr hyde and doctor doolittle
the original text lies
isn't mr hyde like almost an animal
creature in himself
so like he would be able to talk to him
to his animal
to himself he had to that's why he had
to invent dr doolittle to talk to mr
hyde
um no none of that's true except for the
fact that we think
both characters are based on a scottish
surgeon called john hunter who is one of
the leading surgeons of the 18th century
who is very famous
um and this is just based on
similarities in his life so
he really liked animals and he was also
a grave robber so the grave robber thing
is a bit more dr jekyll and mr hyde
and the liking animals thing is a bit
more dr do little
it's weird how they don't mention the
animal talking and dr jacqueline vista
hyde and they don't mention the grave
robbing
in doctor it's so weird they're just
different genres aren't they
um but hunter had over 3 500 animals
oh wow and he he was some of them were
dead
most of them flies i mean narrow it down
that would be cheating he had one dog
one horse and then 3
498 flies he had more good ones than
that he had two leopards so he lived in
leicester square and he had two leopards
who lived in his garden
and once got loose and ended up in a
fight with some local dogs
and he had to have to restrain them he
kept a pet
bull in his house which he used to
wrestle for fun
which is great all in central london
yeah all in central london he used to
live in
the there's a pub that i think is called
the moon over water or something like
that which is on leicester square and
that was his
house and at the back of his house he
had a massive sort of
place where he cut open bodies and stuff
like that i think if it's the right
person i'm thinking of
i think it was yeah there's that place
where you cut bodies and then where he
talked to his pet rabbit next to it
was nice uh he actually did keep a lot
of bees so maybe that was where some of
the cheating
came in andy and one of his friends
explained that he befriended the bees
and especially the less well-known kind
and this is the guy who might have been
dr doolittle
and i did read that he died of heart
disease that was complicated by syphilis
which he may have given himself when he
inoculated his own penis in his studies
on gonorrhea
to get syphilis from yourself is pretty
bad isn't it that's annoying i mean
that's an
excuse isn't it when you go home to your
wife and she says where did you get
syphilis from you
think quick think quick think quick oh i
inoculated my own penis with gonorrhea
[Laughter]
where did you get the gonorrhoea from
trying to get rid of chlamydia oh
god damn it
just one more loofa thing i found a
really fun loofah patent
so i was going through all the patents
looking for luffa the word
word search luffer and so there was one
in 1889 so this is just when they were
taking off
someone invented the luffa sock puppet
and the idea is that you know luther's
full size they can't get into those
hard-to-reach spots
so behind the ears for instance and so a
little sock puppet loofah was invented
you could scrape behind your ears
oh yeah and similarly more than a
hundred years later what sounds like
something very similar
was invented in 1994 there's a patent
for a finger-mounted toothbrush
also a great idea stick a bit of luffa
over the end of your finger
i've seen those don't they don't they
sell those in motorway service stations
yeah
there we go maybe it's just quite a few
times
yeah quite a few times i've been stuck
and sleeping in a service station
and i've had to get myself one of those
toothbrushes your marriage is on the
rocks isn't it
[Laughter]
um that's incredible it's thought that
the patent itself says toothbrushes
require a certain amount of dexterity to
get in the mouth
and it's easier if you just use your
finger but some people will have short
fingers and
and long mouths no come on
i can touch my back tooth just about but
not many people
are going to have such short fingers or
such long mouths that they can't reach
some of their teeth
that's a very small amount of the
population but isn't the point that the
toothbrush is like
if your hands are dirty your toothbrush
is clean whereas if you've got to get to
the very back of your mouth
you've been rolling around in a luffa
field well that's true you know
wash your hands guys if we've learned
anything for the last three months
i will give you andy that this wouldn't
work on crocodiles for instance
but i agree that most humans are
correctly proportioned or tyrannosaurus
rex's
so difficult what about a horse walks
into a bar and the batman says why the
long face and the horse says
it's because my i've not been able to
clean my teeth for a week because of
this new hoof brush i've got
it doesn't work um just while we're
talking about sort of
other bizarre uh transportation uh from
the early days
i was looking into the 1920s i found a
motorized baby carriage
uh that was used uh in england uh this
was to get
that so that had on the back a sort of
nurse chauffeur
who would stand on what was a motorized
baby carriage so you can see pictures of
it where
the baby is laying in a bassinet and
they're standing on the back as if on a
little platform and it had an internal
engine
which they said was really nice for um
sort of creating a little buzz and hum
you know how babies fall asleep in cars
it's kind of giving it that kind of vibe
and it could go up to four miles an hour
so people would just be
nurses on the back uh traveling with
their babies yeah
did the nurse stand on the back was it
like being on a segway or something
or were they walking exactly they were
standing on the back yeah
yeah um when was that so yeah it was in
england
sorry about the yeah 1920s
and i found this one other thing which
um i think this is one of those
prototype things we have a photo of it i
don't think it got anywhere
very far but it was a man in la who
wanted to
sit while walking so he wanted
transportation to do that so he
effectively invented a unicycle
which was instead of so he sat on a seat
but instead of it leading to a wheel
it led to two other legs that when he
spun the pedals
would walk the legs underneath his legs
so he was sort of eight foot tall-ish
and these legs which had proper shoes on
would be walking
underneath him but he would be sitting
and peddling
he's peddling the legs with his own legs
yeah yeah so he's
using his legs to peddle some legs that
are below him so it's all the
the disadvantages of cycling but with
the pace of walking
yes basically all the worst parts of
cycling and all the worst parts of
walking
yeah in one
minute
[Applause]
stop the podcast stop the podcast hi
everybody just wanted to let you know we
are sponsored
this week by blinkist yes blinkist is an
app that condenses best-selling
non-fiction books down to the key
takeaways
so you can get through an entire book in
just 15 minutes
just 15 minutes you can read a whole
book yes it's absolutely amazing so it's
made for people who
want to keep up with non-fiction books
especially
but they may not have time for example
to read it cover to cover and if you're
on the go you can listen to an audio
version of it
there are millions of people who've
downloaded it and who are using it and
they have
wonderful books on there as well they've
got brief answers to the big questions
by stephen hawking they've got the spine
the traitor by ben mcintyre which is
absolutely electric uh
bill bryson's a short history of nearly
everything is now an even shorter
history of nearly everything
there's so much on there and if you want

so mozart when he came to london um was
actually a bit of a disaster because he
was he was brought to london with his
sister nanel and his father
and they kind of launched this big promo
campaign to make him the sort of
superstar child
along with his sister and people just
didn't believe it they just refused to
believe that a genius that young could
be that talented
and um and so there's a sort of
promotional backlash everyone papers was
like you're just a you're a
hoaxer you're a fraudster it can't be
true so weirdly he ended up playing in a
pub
in london uh you know he went from he
played for the king
initially and then by the end of his his
time in london he was playing in a
tavern that's a good open mic night
isn't it
yeah imagine going on after mozart
somehows do farming they cultivate
other animals to eat did you know this
uh no you know about the burrowing owl
this is
you i'm sure you've come across it it
burrows on the ground instead of um
living in trees yeah like an idiot but
um it has a little burrow and it takes
dung
into its burrow and then eats the dung
beetles
um so it slightly cultivates dung
beetles
so that it can have something to eat i
don't think it burrows though
does it it steals burrows yeah the
burrowing owl does not burrow it's a big
old misnomer goodness
it nicks other animals burrows so it
borrows burroughs
it's a boring borough it should be
called the borrowing out
um so it will live in the boroughs of
prairie dogs or badgers or squirrels
owls never make their own nests they're
very lazy
and they collect yeah they collect all
this dung so not only does it nick these
people's homes but then it collects
loads of poo
and piles it up at the entrance to
attract the beatles i think it's quite a
clever idea isn't it because if someone
steals your burrow and then you go and
try and get it back but they filled it
with poo
you're probably like all right fine you
can have it fair enough yeah
there is one other l which does this
which is um
i haven't found too much more evidence
of this i've only got a little bit but
it's
it's the little l which i can only
assume based on its name is absolutely
massive
um because it and it stashes meat and
then supposedly grows
maggots from the meat really or lets
maggots develop in the meat for its own
food
yeah wow because that is like one line
in another article to me that's more
like farming because
the other one is more like fishing for
uh dung beetles isn't it you put some
dung out and the dung beetles come along
and you yes reel them in
but this one is actually growing maggots
that's like
farming that's incredible we should stop
propagating the idea that maggots can
grow on something you know that idea was
debunked about 200 years ago
what if i got this lions corpse in my
living room and i'm just waiting to get
the bees out of it
what a niche joke about tayden yeah
exactly you're gonna have to look up
golden syrup cans together
everyone um during world war ii the bbc
banned
uh perry como was deep in the heart of
texas
during work hours so you weren't allowed
to play it from nine to five
and the reason was that it's got a
little bit where people clap along
and they were worried that people who
were working in ammunition plants might
clap and drop the buns
that was amazing was it the case that if
you
dropped a bomb it exploded because if so
i think they need a better health and
safety on the bonds
you're right it doesn't feel like that
would happen
another ammunition factor has exploded
based off one person dropping a thing
i suppose probably it was just that they
it was distracting the workers rather
than they might blow themselves up
i don't know i think bombs are you're
encouraged not to drop bombs aren't you
that's
yeah i imagine if i got a bump that came
over from amazon
i hope on the box it would say do not
drop yeah yeah
confusing though when you're in a plane
actually ready to drop the bomb and you
see that
[Laughter]
um yeah before um before champagne came
to
the world before dom perignon started
selling his
um champagne we always drank perry and
that was
it was fizzy basically i mean baby champ
tastes a bit like champagne it's like
almost the same thing uh and we were
drinking it 150 years before
champagne was invented it used to be one
of the mainstream dom perignon
right yeah yep not worth interruption
hey i read a cool pie fact the other day
sorry for the tangent
just very quickly but pi if you look at
it in a mirror
it's 313.14
spells pie yeah yeah yeah well done good
it's great welcome to the party
it's exciting isn't it i didn't know
that i remember the first time i learned
that yeah yeah me too it was quite a day
sorry we were just talking pie and
mirrors
completely relevant four backwards four
backwards oh i guess it looks a bit like
a p
yeah we love it i think we're just
saying that we because you sort of like
sometimes have seen that done that in
school and been really excited by it
when you're 11.
i'm just excited that you're having that
moment now well i went to a steiner
school
yeah if you if you put the number um 58
0008 into a calculator and turn it
upside down
spells out boobs get out
of no i didn't know that one i didn't
know that one i'm all over boobs and
bubblers and
boobies they teach boobs at the steiner
schools they do
that's what we got do you know the
sayings
bringing owls to athens yeah it's like
bringing in newcastle
yeah it's a much classier version of
bringing coles to newcastle because the
owl was the emblem of
athens and so yeah i say bringing some
of ours to tula
do you it's like bringing some of us to
tula
that's just another version of that i
don't know where tiller is and i'm not
100 of what a salmon is either i thought
you were talking latin but i just
realized
i think it's is it in southern russia i
don't know i don't i actually don't know
where samavar is either
it might be in germany
i think what is clear is that i'm using
this phrase which i don't understand at
the top
there were some happy endings in pt
barnum's acts right so
um there were a few nice stories there
was a woman called katie brumback
who became known as the great sandwina
who was just
amazing i actually can't believe she
existed so she was a famous strong woman
she came from a circus performing family
and she trained to be strong from an
early age
and she beat eugene sandow
in a fight so eugene sandow i actually
don't think we've ever mentioned him but
he was the
champion strongman of the 19th century
he was like the first strong man wasn't
he
you know if you ever see pictures of
these kind of really muscly people
holding up barbells he's basically what
they're all based on
yeah i think the actual trophy for the
miss mr olympia is based on his body um
yeah he's the father of modern
bodybuilding wow there you go well it
should have been
this lady the great sandwina because in
1902
she'd heard all this chat about eugene
and she did an act where she'd call
men up from the audience and invite them
to fight her and they all thought they
could beat her and none of them could
and eugene sandow fought her or they
they actually had a competition to see
who could lift the biggest weight
and she won so there was a 300 pound
weight which is like
a 22 stone man like if you're that
overweight there's a documentary about
you
kind of level and she raised that up
above her head i think with one arm and
eugene couldn't even get it up
like over his chest that yeah is that
that it's really amazing
that is unbelievable because you can
imagine being able to beat someone in a
wrestling match because you have
different skills or something but
lifting weights is like literally just
muscle mass isn't it
really that's all it is so wow she she
met her husband
after kicking his ass in a wrestling
ring he was
he was one of the people who accepted
the challenge to try and fight her and
his memories of basically walking into
the ring and then nothing and then blue
sky above him
so she knocked him out and um they fell
in love afterwards
and yeah she had a she had a loving
relationship with him
yeah 52 years i wonder how much he had
in the decision
i do yes anything yeah
just one more thing and we probably
won't use this but it's so interesting i
just want to say it and that is
that um one more thing is that skates
you know the
fish they use incubators
on their eggs so they lay eggs like um
some fish like sharks for instance they
also do it they lay these things called
mermaids purses
which are essentially their eggs and the
skates
they intentionally put their eggs next
to hydrothermal vents which is a bit at
the bottom of the ocean where
heat comes out like volcanic heat and
they deliberately they don't put it
directly next to it because it would
boil the eggs they put it just the right
distance away
that it accelerates the speed in which
the eggs
um kind of uh grow that's genius
essentially
and so they have their own artificial
incubation
even though they're fish and if you have
left it a little bit too close then you
can just do the old take the top off
egg and soldiers soft boiled egg
what would you dip in if you wanted in
the water you'd have to get some sort of
passing
trip your soldiers your bread's gonna be
soggy isn't it
i always think so there's been this
debate about whether we need sharp
knives like pointed knives at all now
and this is the point that i think god
adam
literally on a weekly basis amazingly
you
can't believe you're using this as an
excuse to bring up this argument again
you've cut it out every time james and
if you keep coming out
so here's the debate listeners please
take your votes
um it's thought we don't really need the
pointy end of sharp knives because we
don't really use that we use the sharp
bit
but when do you use the point now james
weirdo james shoves the pointed
end into his tomatoes to cut them up
what i say is
just use a serrated knife well you know
what literally yesterday
[Laughter]
i stabbed someone with a pointed knife i
know i was cutting some sourdough bread
and i
stabbed it before i did the cut and i
thought anna would not approve it
there is a pear called a stinking bishop
do you know that one no yeah is that
related to the two geez
yeah exactly so those two things are
related and how are they related
same bishop
like poor guy poor stinky old bishop
um kind of but not really though okay
okay so is it you often eat if you're in
the 1970s
apple and um cheese on a stick
you do so is it related to that no it's
not that
it is that stinking bishop cheese is
made with
perry that's made from the stinking
bishop pear
and that's how it gets its name oh cool
came first
the pair came first and you make some
perry some alcohol out of it and then
you steep the
um milk and the cheese in that stuff and
it helps it
you know helps the bacteria grow and
that's how you get your cheese that's
very very cool there was there was a
story as well about a guy who
accidentally swallowed one of those
um iphone headphones i'm wearing one
right now these new
earphones i notice you're only wearing
one down what's the other
i am that girl we'll see in two to three
days what's happened to the other one
yeah so he swallowed it and then you can
do a tracker thing where it can locate
um your headphone i've not actually used
that yet and
apparently he says heard the beeps um
from within
and he passed the headphone and it still
worked and it still had
40-ish percent left on it by the time it
came out
no way it's amazing that was not an
apple product then surely
they were offering trips to go and see
the titanic recently i think
in fact there was supposed to be a sort
of tourist thing
this year which i imagine is not
happening anymore but
this is stockton rush uh is this guy
who's i think he's like the ceo a guy
called stockton rush who's the ceo of
something called
ocean gate expeditions and he's offering
tourists
week-long trips to go down in
submersibles to visit the titanic and
it's the first time since this couple
got married that they've offered it to
anyone uh so they used to until i think
about 2012.
and each seat cost 105 dollars which is
exactly the inflation-adjusted price of
a first-class ticket on the titanic
so that's nice wow or it did initially
and he liked that
sort of symmetry uh but then he actually
had to raise the price because he
realized that it wasn't expensive enough
i never realized it was that expensive
to go on the titanic that's
an incredible amount of money to go i
mean
yeah unbelievable isn't it yeah yeah
that's huge
um first class i guess they were
yeah i know what you mean but a hundred
hundred grand it's a good boat mad
it's not just james it wasn't just the
boat it's not just going out on your
mate's boat
it was the boat anyway it had to be
postponed in this trip first of all
because
it's supposed to leave from the coast of
canada
and it's a norwegian ship that he's like
got to take these tourists out in so
they can go down to the titanic
and there's all those weird shipping
rules so canada suddenly said oh wait
your ship's going to be flying a
norwegian flag
you're not allowed to leave our um
coastal waters
flying a norwegian flag so he's put
hundreds of thousands of dollars into
this expedition
and then there's a flag issue which
sadie meant he had to postpone
your flag down what what's his problem i
would have thought just repaint it paint
a maple leaf on top of it
i've got a feeling that the rules are a
bit more complicated than that
i think when you have a flag of a
country there might be some paperwork to
fill in rather than just going
it i'll put a different flag up i
don't know sometimes the simplest
solution is
the one that's disregarded i'll give him
a zoom call i'll uh i'll consult
um where's wallybucks yeah you know
those things where he's in different
parts of the page and it's a very busy
page
they are based on a german trend called
vimel builder books which is literally a
teaming picture book
and the idea of those was originally you
would have a picture with loads of stuff
happening in all the different parts of
the page
and it would be a child's job to kind of
make stories up about all the different
people who are
living in the different parts of this
page and so it's like a really creative
way of
of teaching children how to use your
imaginations yeah
that looks great it's cool wow so we've
dumbed down where's wally
well we've triple dumbed it down because
we think they kind of come from uh
paintings by bosch and bruegel and you
know those
amazing pictures like the garden of
earth templates or whatever it's called
where there's just stuff happening
everywhere it's kind of based on those
cool and then we just looking for some
idiot with a stripy jumper
and sometimes there are loads of other
people wearing stripey jumpers in the
same page
it's so why are crazy all at the beach
if they're wearing stripey jumpers it
doesn't make any sense
in real life wells wally at the beach
would be really easy because he's the
only one in the jumper
that's true where's wally you haven't
played the the
master edition which is where's wally
nudist edition
[Laughter]
very popular in germany though my
favorite animal that lives on sand dunes
is the saharan silver ant
and that's because this is one of the
fastest ants
in the world maybe the fastest dance in
the world it's so fast
it can run at 855 millimeters per second
which believe me in the ant world yeah
super fast
gonna say i could run at 855 millimeters
per second just about
yeah well can you run 108 times your own
body length in a second
no i don't think i can yeah exactly can
you do
he does 47 strides per second
okay so that is uh michael johnson the
old runner who
um he had a kind of weird way of running
where he did lots more strides than
normal people
and even he only did four steps per
second
uh and this guy did 47 per second so
it's like you know those cartoons where
you just see their legs going around in
a circle
it's a bit like that i didn't know
michael johnson did that did it look
really weird when you watched it yeah
it looked like he had an extra pair of
legs he was famously he had
he ran in a different way than anyone
else so he ran really
upright and he moved his legs really
really quickly
presumably in really small smaller
strides like a ballerina
tiptoeing across the stage smaller
strides yeah can i ask a question about
michael johnson for example if okay if
you came up with a new way of running
and let's say
let's just say that you came up with a
way of doing forward cartwheels or
forward
rolls that happen to be faster than any
other sprinter on the planet
would you be allowed to do that it's
fast to use your hands
it's a possibly flop isn't it oh you
mean if can you use your hands to run
yeah that's a bit different
if you run on all fours like kids
sometimes do yeah yeah actually no i
think you can because
if you're in a running race and you fall
over like let's say you're in a
steeple chase race where you you're
jumping over
hurdles if you fall over and your hands
touch the floor you're not disqualified
are you no
yeah so um yeah i imagine if if you want
to run
with it with all four give it a go arms
and legs like a racehorse i think you'd
be able to see i'm sure i've said before
that i invented a new way of doing the
um
walking race um which i i believe is
faster than the way that they do it in
the olympics
wow um it's extremely long
um strides and you move your hips a lot
and i reckon it's faster than anyone can
walk in their style
but if i do it for about 10 seconds i
get unbelievably tired
i think it might just not be very energy
efficient but
it might be just that i'm terribly unfit
so it you know
it's out there if any if any
professional walkers want to hit me
is there is there a 100 meter walk
sprint
unfortunately the shortest um distance
they go i think is about 20 kilometers
and the longest distance i've ever gone
in this technique is about 20 meters
we can set it up though why don't we set
up when we're all allowed back together
you versus andy andy cartwheeling his
way to the end
walk sprinting your way to the end and
dan and i all being popcorn
it's a shame if you have invented that
new kind of run like michael johnson has
that you have to expose it there's no
way that you can wear like a box around
your leg
so that everyone's just going what's he
doing yeah we can't we can't work out
why he's so much faster well you could
borrow
the wrong maybe that's what david
beckham was doing because he was a very
fast
footballer wasn't he uh maybe that's why
he was strong to conceal his trick of
doing seven more steps a minute than
anyone else
but i think the problem is if you're
wearing a sarong in the olympics and
you're running then people will just
assume you're
on a unicycle yeah
and so yeah they probably won't treat
you right that's what they'd assume
you'd have to literally take the sarong
off at the end of the race to show that
you had no wheels under there
yeah it's not you just you should just
ban it all together sarongs i think in
running races
it's not worth the hassle yeah it's
quite a tight wrap as well
i've got a long
you need the massive box that's what you
need a massive block a box covering
everything below the waist
yeah does anyone have anything else on
sand dunes
i got one fact about pears which i think
is quite amazing
do you know the phrase it's all gone
pear-shaped
yeah that phrase dates back to 1983 is
the earliest we have an example of and
it was used in the navy
uh and the phrase it's all gone pete
tong
is only four years younger
wow so the it's all got it's all gone
pete tong was from 1987
and it's all gone pear-shaped it's from
1983 there's only that four-year
difference it's amazing isn't it great
that
yeah you wonder what was going so wrong
in the 80s that they had so many other
ways of saying
um another time that a pair was
an insult was this amazing period in
19th century france
where it became this massive political
meme
this is it's the coolest thing so this
is in the 1830s there was a famous
caricaturist and political satirist
called
charles philippo charles philippo and
he um started publishing offensive
pictures of the king
and he was taken to court for insulting
the king and he said how do you guys
know that's the king
look i've even put someone else's name
underneath it and they were like well it
looks like the king
he said oh well that's you know you've
made that assumption not me
and then to demonstrate you could
interpret anything as looking like the
king he drew a pair
and then he showed in four pictures how
a pair could gradually transform into
the king's face
and anyway which is a pretty cocky thing
to do in court and he didn't get away
with it and he was sent to prison for a
while
but this became a meme for the king so
like all these caricaturists and all
these magazines published pictures of
pears
and that was a byword for how crap the
king was and it was really hard to
prosecute
they're just drawing pears yeah and
eventually they crack down
on the pair image and so what this guy
did was he started
writing so at one point they were told
to stop drawing pairs
and if you had a publication and you'd
had like a legal thing saying you
weren't allowed to publish something
you had to publish that legal thing to
be like sorry we did wrong
so he published what they'd been told by
the government but he published the text
in a pear
shape which looks really beautiful
it's a real slap in the face so good
he's asking for trouble that guy isn't
here
yeah i guess he is and he was shut down
another pair that looks like another
sort of leader um
is the new mini buddha pairs have you
seen those
no this is a this is a guy in china he's
a farmer he's spent years and years
doing this where he's been creating
molds
um where the pear grows inside the mold
and
for years he's been trying to get it to
look like a baby buddha
um and he's and he succeeded um he's got
10
000 of them which he brought over to the
uk and you look at them and it's like a
little squished together
buddha but it's a pair and it's um what
why
i would imagine it's easier to sell a
pair that looks like a butter than a
pear
that looks like a pepper cool it's just
cool and actually no
you know there's um there's soda and
alcohol bottles where you get a pair
inside
oh yeah i was trying to work out vaguely
how do you get
the pair inside um and the answer is you
grow
the pear inside the bottle from the tree
so that's how they do it yeah they hang
the bottle upside down and they
they weave through the um the branch and
they allow it to grow inside then they
cut that off
and that's how they get in that's
i didn't even know about the phenomenon
of pears in bottles but i'm still
excited to know what happened that's so
cool yeah it's not massive but you you
do see them occasionally
and they do the same thing with ships
and bottles don't they you get the tree
and then you put the
branch in
[Laughter]
this should freeze you should call those
pears i can't believe it's not butter
[Laughter]
um yes um that's the kind of thing we
cut out
okay that's it that is all of our
collection of off cuts
for this week uh thank you so much for
listening we will be back again next
week with another episode uh until then
you can get us on our twitter account so
i'm on that schreiber land
james is at james harkin and andy you
you like saying yours
i do it's balls balls balls
wow really committing to that it wasn't
worth the commitment
it's at andrew hunter m at andrew
huntsville um yeah
or you can go to at no such thing or
group account or go to our website no
such thing as a fish.com
we have all of our previous episodes up
there as well as links to bits of
merchandise we've released over the
years
okay guys we hope you enjoyed that and
we'll be back again with another regular
episode we'll see you next week have a
good one
good bye

=334
[Applause]
[Music]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
is dan schreiber i am sitting here with
james harkin
anna tyzinski and andrew hunter murray
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with you
james okay my fact this week is that in
1948
a drive-through fly-through cinema
opened in new jersey
where you could watch movies from the
seat of your car or the seat of your
small
aircraft that's great okay so a couple
of things to say before we get into this
number one is that most of the following
material you're about to hear from me
comes from an amazing book called the
history of driving theaters by kerry
seagrave
and secondly this fact would have made a
lot more sense if we'd have been in its
original setting which was
in a drive-in show that we were supposed
to do this week
yes yeah this episode was meant to be in
one very disclosed location
and um unfortunately got cancelled
sorry about that everyone yeah much
apologies fault
not our fault but you're going to get
the facts anyway i think we could
pretend guys we can pretend we can't
just all pretend we're in a car the
people at home won't know
andy we weren't we weren't supposed to
be in a car when we were doing the show
it was the audience that were in the car
we were supposed to be on the stage i
was going to bring
bring my car to the stage
um so this um this fly through did you
have planes and cars next to each other
um the planes were behind the cars that
makes sense because if the planes were
in front of the cars then it's a raw
deal if you're sitting in your car isn't
it
just looking at the arse of a plane if
it's a 747 or something like that
you don't want to climb in front of you
but this was organized by a guy called
edward brown jr who was a former navy
pilot
and his drive-in had capacity for 500
cars
and then 25 airplanes on the last couple
of rows
and what would happen is you would fly
into a nearby airfield
and then you would taxi into the not get
a taxi you would drive
the plane on its wheels into the last
row of the theater
and then afterwards they a jeep would
tow you back to the airfield and you'd
be able to fly off again
and the charge for the aeroplanes was 25
cents
wow extraordinary yeah i guess this was
a bit more in the time when
your average joe sometimes had a plane
[Laughter]
people sort of did a bit more in the 40s
didn't they did like small piece
together
aeroplanes i think it was much much more
common like people used to you used to
have hobbyists who would do
sort of trick flights in and out of
sheds and stuff yeah but
still very weird although i read that
that it sort of caught on
so it must have had a few people going
because a few more popped up
in the subsequent years right in like
alabama and texas that's right yeah
some of them opened by the same guy so i
don't know if that's a huge mark of
success um you don't you don't open up a
second drive through fly through unless
your first one was successful yeah
absolutely yeah
yeah that's true but he he really um it
was quite exciting what he did because
he bought this land
and he turned the whole so he set up the
airport he set up the drive-through
he bulldozed everything in the way using
a world war one tank
and um it also had a sort of golf range
next to it and an amusement park and
playground
there was a great article by someone
called mary morley cohen on this
and i'm just going to list the extra
things that one particular driving had
okay
um it had a playground pony rides a
dance floor
shuffleboard and horseshoe pitching
tournaments cartoon carnivals
midnight spook shows baby parades and
beautiful trials contests
daredevil car rides circus acts high
tower dives
anniversary and birthday celebrations
fireworks a picnic of play area
potato sack races and television
extra tv in case you're bored of the
film i guess that's amazing
there was one in memphis where you could
get your laundry done
uh when you went to driving so you turn
up with your laundry hand it in
and then they'd clean it for you and as
you left you'd pick it up that's so good
it's almost like the films just weren't
the main attraction and i think
this someone did an experiment because
they thought actually are people even
coming to see the films
and so they didn't advertise what film
was showing and the same number of
people showed up and then they started
interviewing people as they were driving
in and said what film are you coming for
and most people didn't know what film
they were going to see they're just kind
of coming because
it's a thing to do but i think the
laundry thing was particularly
interesting because that was about how
one of the appeals of the drive-ins was
that it like appealed to a much broader
audience
and so for instance one of the people
they advertised to was mothers
housewives
because you could bring your kids so the
idea was you didn't have to find a
babysitter to leave them at home
brought your kids along they also
specifically advertised to disabled
people because you can stay in your car
you don't have to get up and like
maneuver into a seat
and they advertise specifically to obese
people
at the start didn't they i think one of
the very first adverts from the guy who
invented the drive-in
was a picture of an overweight lady
trying to squeeze into a cinema seat and
then it said something like
kate doesn't have any problem at the
drive-in so she was called kate smith
the lady who was in that um
image and she was a really famous singer
and she was like the south of america's
version of dame viralin so she was
really big during the war and she sang a
load of amazing songs and everyone got
really patriotic about her
and she was also she sang for the
philadelphia flyers
so before the game before every game she
would sing god bless america
and whenever she sang they almost always
won
they had um a a record of 100 wins and
29 losses and five ties whenever she
sang and normally it was more like 50
50.
so all the other teams really hated her
because she was just this amazingly good
mascot for that team but yeah she was
super famous kate smith
i feel terrible i've i've described her
as just an overweight lady trying to
squeeze into a cinema scene she's
basically the lucky charm of the whole
united states i'm so sorry
but so that was the reason wasn't it for
the whole invention of the drive-in it
was um 1933 a guy called richard
hollingshead
was living in new jersey and his mother
found cinema seats uncomfortable
and he wanted to fix that so he thought
if she could watch it from the comfort
of her car
this would be a much better system so he
rigged up
a sort of system for her to test it out
on and it's so clever the sort of
innovation that he did
in the early days of once he had the
idea that this could be commercial
the thought of okay how do i deal with
it if it's raining for example so he
would have his water hose and sprinkler
systems going off
in the background while he tested
different ways he thought if cars were
going to be parked behind each other how
could they see each other
so he tested out these sort of ramp
systems whereby he could levitate
um not levitate no no no he kind of
levitated
that would be an amazing innovation
wouldn't it when
guardian love yourself the helicopter
driver
just on bringing your kids this is a
really clever thing and how it was
um advertised lots of cinemas put the
playground
for the children because the children
might not want to sit in one of the film
they put the playground under the screen
so as you were watching the film as a
parent you could just check in
and see your kids directly beneath the
cinema screen
that's so good although actually not
everyone was happy about this idea that
you could bring
your kids because in 1947
there was a picket outside one of the
drive-ins
by a load of babysitters who said
down with drive-ins more work for
babysitters
and while you drive in movie theaters
babysitters staff
and so they were outside saying down
with drive-ins
because they were losing money that's
what it feels like they've kind of won
now it feels like babysitters have
remained culturally necessary in a way
that drive-ins kind of haven't
that's true yeah have you ever heard of
another babysitter revive something
is that unique they're not very heavily
unionized the babysitter
i think if i was a babysitter i would be
really angry with like um
you know recipe box services because
when i was a babysitter what you'd get
is free reign of whatever was in the
fridge
but with those recipe boxes you only get
exactly what you have to cook so there's
never any spare food so it means
babysitters are starving
all right james as an outfit that does
something to advertise hello fresh i
don't know if we need to be putting
babysitters off it
driving a wedge between them well these
babysitters anyway um
in uh near seattle they picked it for a
while but then they were bought off with
a free movie and a hot dog
wow so cheaply i think that's what they
were going for
it could be uh i don't think i don't
think driving movies have ever been
popular enough that they've been putting
babysitters out of business on
mass i think they just wanted a free
film you know we know what the first
movie was
to play the drive-in was quite cool uh
so this was in 1933 it's a movie called
wives beware
and it is the story of a man who tires
of married life and he feigns
memory loss so that he can then pursue
other women
that's the the whole plot so when his
wife's like hey you slept with that lady
he goes dude that's weird um
and that that was the movie and the
reason they had that movie and this
became the thing for drive-throughs was
this was a movie that played in cinemas
for one week and then
it went off cinemas and drive-through
specifically
were playing films that were not in
competition with the cinema
it was the movies that were no longer on
screen there and
actually the popularity of it started
dwindling to more b movies and then
erotic movies i think one of the reasons
was as well though dan
is that there was quite a union between
all of the different movie making
studios
and then america smashed it and whenever
it was the 40s or 50s or something like
that but before then
basically if you weren't in on it you
couldn't get the best movies
and so all of the theaters really wanted
to stop the drive-ins from getting the
best movies because they thought that
everyone would go to the drive-ins
instead of going to the theatres
i think yeah i think they were they were
more forced into the position weren't
they because no one would actually sell
them they're popular although really
like hannah says no one really cared
what was on right
because they just they just weren't
there to snore they just when there was
a snake
so like there was a real big problem it
wasn't just the babysitters who didn't
like this drive-ins it was also
the puritanical people uh because they
were worried
worried about neckers so when their
first one opened in camden this first
one hollingsheads one that we were
talking about a writer noted
perhaps it will occur readily enough to
the reader what fun young america could
have
in a coupe under the added stimulation
of a sophisticated romance
so that was the first one that came and
they were already saying that they
people might be snogging in the cars and
they're
paranoid weren't they they were quite
paranoid but
i mean it did happen oh yeah that was
snogging a lot of snogging went on
yeah one of the owners said the only
thing that can slow us down is an
ugly rumor going around that the driving
are perfect for kneckers
they did have people go around checking
didn't they checking for necking
they had neca checkers yeah so a lot of
them employed policemen or just members
of staff who had to go around and look
in people's windows
because they got this reputation as
being passion pits and transportation
was from
people called blue noses which i'd never
heard before but as a term for sort of
prudish church types
in america and various uh various
drive-ins would have rules about what
was allowed so one owner of a drive-in
specified
if a man puts his arm around a woman
that's okay but if she
puts her arm back around him and then
they go into a clinch
that's out and then they're removed from
the premises
so that's where the line is there was an
actual law against it in 1972 in new
jersey
which would find the operator 100 if any
cars remained on the premises one hour
after the end of the show
and they said that the reason was
because they didn't want to
they didn't want any carbon monoxide
deaths but actually it was just to stop
the knackers
if you can't get your necking done
within an hour then you know
i genuinely didn't know what the word
necking meant so i googled it and
apparently it's a short plain concave
section
between the capital and the shaft of a
classical doric or tuscan column
[Laughter]
you probably need um a third person to
be in the car with you to
not be caught out for necking right
because it's it's hard to see what's
going on around you when you're kissing
and um and general kissing sort of
etiquette means you have to have your
eyes closed
so if you had your eyes open while
kissing a you risk being a weirdo but
you are safer i guess
if the other person has their eyes open
as well then they're a weirdo so you can
usually get away with it because they
have their eyes closed you're right one
person has to have their eyes open at
all times looking for
blue noses and the other person gets on
with removing their neckers
you need both with eyes open because all
i'm getting is you're getting that
window only
of your position you can have a mini
periscope installed in the car and then
you can just see all the way around you
at all times
oh that's cool in which case you only
need one eye open i don't want to be a
female in the car with you andy when you
say periscope up
the second ever drive-in was built by a
man called wilson
shank whaler it was wow
he was from pennsylvania and they um
tried to stop it by doing by taxing him
and so they wanted to give him a massive
amusement tax
and he tried to avoid it by advertising
as free movies
parking 50 cents so it was like he
advertised it as just a parking lot that
just happened to have free movies
happening
shang quailing is another activity that
was bad
[Applause]
stop the poker stop the podcast
hi everybody just wanted to let you know
we are sponsored this week by stitchfix
yes ditchfix um listen to this andy
wouldn't it be great if every clothing
store you shopped in
only had your size what styles you like
at the price you want i would like that
wouldn't that be great well you would
but the rest of the world wouldn't would
they
because we'd all be wearing exactly the
same clothes as you wear everything i
want people to wear clothes in my size
and i want to pick the clothes they wear
that's not what this is stitch fix is a
firm they are a personal styling company
and the idea is you go to their website
you set up a profile and they will
deliver you they'll send you clothes
which are personalized exactly for you
as james says
in your colors in the styles you want
and according to the budget you have it
really is quite amazing that they can
really nail your style quite well it's
embarrassing you thought you had a
personality it turns out you didn't
and all you do is you pay 10 pound
styling fee for each time and that is
credited towards anything you keep so if
you buy something
you don't pay it at all it's pretty good
deal absolutely yeah it's really good
and if you don't want to buy anything
you can just send it back and there's no
subscription
required and shipping and returns are
easy and free so if that sounds
interesting to you then just go to

podcast
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is my fact
my fact this week is that the beatles
once rejected a 50 million pound reunion
gig
because the warm-up act was going to be
a man wrestling a great white shark
this is according to ringo starr who
revealed this in an interview
recently in the lead up to his 80th
birthday and he was talking about how
back in 1975
they were approached by a incredible
character called bill sargent who um
wanted to reunite them and he had 50
million pounds which is roughly 200
million pounds in today's money
and the idea was for them to do this gig
and according to the beatles
the pitch was that it was going to be a
warm-up act of a man
underwater fighting a shark now i i
think ringo's muddled
this story a bit um i don't think that
great white shark was going to be the
warm-up act however
bill sargent you put the great white
shark on last
there's no way the beatles can follow a
man fighting a shark
it's going to be such a letdown for the
audience even the beatles reuniting
you've got a mug with a shark and
there's some people saying i am a walrus
come on octopuses garden um
now desperately trying to think of they
would have needed a yellow submarine
in order to get to the stage um we can i
can play this all night
okay we can wait i'll need for another
one
also i'm not sure he had 50 million
dollars because he was like the father
of pay-per-view wasn't he so
his idea was that he would put it on and
then people would pay to watch it and
then the beatles would get the money
from that oh
i think so i see uh but he said there
was an interview with him in 1976
and he said i definitely asked them to
do this and as far as i know they're
considering it
but he said that the problem was that
paul mccartney was about to start a us
tour
a 20-date u.s tour that was going to be
huge for mccartney
and that it was because he didn't want
to bring the beatles back together quite
yet that it didn't happen
that was quite a surge james i don't
know if we read the same
thing about bill sergeant i was reading
people magazine from 1970 same article
nice i reckon for probably about 15
years no one else has read that article
and then four people read it this week
the people at people magazine are going
to be so excited by this boost
yeah do you think the office there was a
ping noise four times
um but what it was so funny because it
reported that uh this guy bill sergeant
had made and lost a million dollars
seven times over and he'd also had two
heart attacks and then it said
as of now the beatles seem more likely
to provide sergeant with coronary number
three than fortune number eight
yeah and actually the guy who fought the
great white shark i think might have
caused
current another coronary because that
was also supposed to happen
uh as a pay-per-view thing and they even
made the posters and everything but bill
sargent had a heart attack before they
could do it and so they
yeah i actually found the um the press
release that they
issued to companies around the world
about this big fight
um and it's remarkable reading it's
about six pages long
it's written in such great so in the
most unusual death-defying event
ever to come to the screen bill sergeant
has announced that he will bring a live
fight
to the death between a single man and a
giant live man-eating shark to theater
arena and coliseum screens by satellite
closed circuit television
and it was a guy called wally gibbons
who was a shark expert
and um he was going to be given a spear
and that is how he was going to fight
the shark and the sharks three of them
were going to be brought
five weeks early to samoa where the
fight was going to occur
so they could acclimatize to the water
and in the 48 hours
leading up to the fight they were going
to be starved
so wally was going to have to fight a
starving shark
and he said a lot about in this press
release about what he thought his odds
were of surviving he thought if he could
shoot the
shark with the spear gun first time and
get him that was gonna
bring the odds up but he needed to shoot
it about five times to kill him
but what about otherwise two other
sharks yeah they were back at the sharks
they're holding the towel in the bucket
can i ask you andy if you're in the
water what are you keeping in the bucket
i don't know
i don't think it would have defied death
i think it would have really embraced
death i have a suspicion that old wally
the absolute wally would have died
within maybe five seconds
ah because i don't think yeah i think so
because i know so i think that um
he tried this a few times because there
was someone called jeffrey mann
who wrote a book later in life about
bill sergeant trying to get him to fight
a shark in samara as well which
you've got to assume is the same kind of
setup and
apparently that was cancelled according
to this guy canceled last minute by jack
cousseau
who i don't know what he was doing being
involved in the event
but famed oceanographer jack cousteau
cancelled this
shark fight but he was going to have a
knife which i think is going to be quite
similar to a spear and in the end
i was looking up how you'd kill a shark
if you faced it
and stabbing it is the worst possible
thing you can do
according to a guy called not the worst
the worst thing is to climb into its
mouth
yeah he actually does say when he's
giving advice he says
go for the face and gills because
they're quite sensitive so you know like
punching them in the face
but do try to keep your hands out of its
mouth that's always the best thing
but wally gibbons was an interesting guy
wasn't he like
there was a 1952 contest between uh
fishermen
and spearmen which were people who
caught fish with spears
and he caught more fish than all the 37
fishermen who were in that competition
on his own wow he is amazing and during
uh just after world war ii he
uh swam around the solomon islands
picking up
like uh unexploded shells and then
taking them away so that they wouldn't
affect people
in the future isn't that amazing that's
right yeah he was incredible there's a
biography in this press release where
they say
that he has killed more sharks in manta
fish underwater combat than
any other man in australia and possibly
in the world
i mean so yeah i i find it unlikely that
anyone from
um anywhere else than australia would
have killed any sharks and vanta fish by
lichtenstein probably not
yeah he was known as a man fish that's
that's what they called him
merman we've got a name for a mountain
fish it's a mermaid yeah
wally gibbons also had the best
collection of seashells
in the whole of australia he had um the
world's rarest
shell he owned it the gloria maris
which is also known as the glory of the
sea cone and that
shell it was used to be so rare that um
there was once a collector who bought
one in an auction
only to immediately destroy it so that
he had the only one
because he found this other one that was
he didn't want he didn't want two in the
world to exist so he bought one in the
auction when it came up and he destroyed
it so he had the only one
that's pretty supposedly that was in
1792 but then um
there was only a few of them in the
world wally gibbons had one of them
and when proper scuba diving got
invented
they found oh yeah they're just down
there they were just a bit low they're a
bit lower than we could normally go so
people
you can collect them quite easily now
you can buy them for not too much right
i think that would be a disappointing if
the shark fight couldn't go ahead
but he said but don't worry wally
gibbons we'll be showing you his
seashell collection
because i was thinking anna said that he
would die after five minutes if you're
the beatles
and you're thinking okay we're going on
in an hour after the fight
and then after five minutes they're like
well sorry the guy just got eaten so
you're gonna have to go on early i'd be
pretty pissed off
also there's a bit of a weird vibe in
the audience right now
they probably had a backup warm-up act
which was a therapist to come out on
stage
um just can i just say one weird
interesting thing about bill sergeant
the guy who dad mentioned at the start
who was organizing these shark fights
so he was an inventor he invented tons
of stuff he had i think over 400 patents
of gadget patents and one thing that i
think he invented
is something that we think of as new
which is televised theater
so you know now you can go and see the
national theater live at your local
cinema
or you could before the you know theater
stopped happening and he invented the
precursor to this called electronic
vision
in 1960s and so basically it involved
him going in and videotaping
plays and then broadcasting them in
cinemas
and he made loads of money out of it and
the first one he did was a take of
richard burton in hamlet in 1964
and he filmed three separate productions
that edited them together to get the
best
best of highlights showed in 1 000
cinemas and made him
millions of dollars amazing um bill
sargent's first job was a radio
repairman which he had
at the age of six wow started work at
the age of six
uh in fairness it was in the family
workshop which was attached to his
family home
uh unfortunately a year later he burnt
them both down by accident
and then later on when he got a load of
money for his movies he set up an
electronics laboratory in missouri
but then he burnt that down as well so
you kind of had a habit of burning down
electronic shops i that time when he
burned down the
second one james apparently it was
because he put down
just not really thinking he put down a
welding torch in the wrong place he put
it onto a drum of
paint thinner yeah or thinner so kind of
which is obviously highly
flammable according i guess to him
because i don't think there were many
other people around he was blown 170
feet into the air
what's that no 170 feet
someone's
[Laughter]
i love him love this man so much so this
thing of a man fighting a shark was
basically an insane
weird warm-up act yeah and so i looked
into a few other weird acts like kind of
vaudeville acts from
you know the last century so have you
heard of a ali who was also known
as the egyptian enigma
he was amazing okay so he was a
vaudeville performer his act was
to swallow kerosene then he would
swallow some water
okay then he would regurgitate the
kerosene and set it on fire
as he did so but then he would
regurgitate the water
to put out the fire that he had lit from
the curtain
so i think he was also known as the
human volcano or something like that
and then there's just one line about him
saying he would also regurgitate live
goldfish
and nuts
[Laughter]
the knots was actually more impressive
than it sounds wasn't it without glee
because
he one of his tricks was being able to
regurgitate stuff in the order specified
by the audience so he'd follow a bunch
of objects and then be like all right
bring up the goldfish now
okay bring up your braces and so he'd
swallow for instance
50 hazelnuts and one almond
and he'd start regurgitating them one by
one and when an audience member said
bring up the almond now mate he'd call
the almond up
no it didn't it's amazing apparently oh
my god i genuinely think if you gave me
a bowl of nuts and said which one of
those is an almond i would struggle
maybe that's what he was relying on he
just told the audience it was an almond
uh i can say one more um vaudeville
thing related to animals
uh and this was an amazing act which is
a group of women called the barristan
sisters
and it seems like their entire act was
to do
a little bit of a sexy dance uh that
gets more and more sexy and all the way
through they would ask the audience
would you like to see my
and then when eventually the audience
said yes they would lift their skirts
and they would all have a cat
in their knickers
this was absolutely massive this they
were they were
huge they were so famous these people
they played berlin for eight
months with this
is it like the mousetrap james are they
like please don't tell anyone the
spoiler when you leave
it must be right it must be that they
must have been
exactly like that there was a french
nobleman who committed suicide because
he loved one of them so much
and they were so shocking that after
their eight months in berlin they were
banned from ever re-entering germany
i like the fact that they waited eight
months to ban them
okay now that everyone in germany's had
a chance to see you now you're banned
because now that's not appropriate the
senses went
countless times dozens of times yeah
we're just we're just trying to assess
whether or not it really is offensive
enough to bend
a few more months of seeing them to be
sure
were the cats alive yeah they were live
they were in like a little pouch over
their crotches
so the cats had to sit there in between
their legs for the full
backs they must have been sedated i
don't know whether they regurgitated
them somehow
there was an article about them and one
um guy in new york said
it was the most audacious piece of devil
tree and abandonment i ever saw
offered to a new york public wow i
really thought you were going to say
that he committed suicide
because he was so disappointed when they
lifted up their skirts at the end and he
didn't see their vaginas
just oh finally a cat it's almond for
nothing okay it's time for fact number
three and that
is anna my fact this week is that in
1919 it was ruled that women
would be allowed to swim competitively
without wearing stockings
on the one condition that they quickly
put on a robe as soon as they got out of
the water
[Laughter]
and this was specifically in america and
i think these are
nylon stockings because there won't have
been any nylon in 1919 would they so
what were they was it like wool or what
i think they were wool i think
a lot of people have to wear that's not
good that's not
conducive to a quick swim is it it's
like carrying the sheep while you're
swimming that's
yeah it's like that um did you guys all
do that swimming survival test when you
were younger we had to wear pajamas in
the water it's like every time a woman
swam in the water it was like having to
do that survival test
in every olympics they had to pick up a
brick from the bottom of the pool didn't
it so this was in america and
it was the amateur athletics union which
had
only recently allowed women to take part
in competitive swimming events
anyway but it was very controversial
what women would wear in the water and
they essentially had to be covered
from neck to toe fully and this
irritated
the women because they realized that
this would put a massive disadvantage in
the olympics for instance when
they were competing against other
countries like australia who were a bit
looser with their regulations
and uh they would be weighed down by
their massive cotton
waterlogged head to toe outfits while
the aussies were smashing them
so there was sort of a campaign there's
this amazing woman called charlotte
epstein who was a court stenographer
actually and she'd
formed the women's swimming association
in 1917.
and she campaigned to have the stocking
requirement removed
and eventually she did this stunt where
she invited some of the best swimmers in
the country female swimmers in the
country
to come to a beach in california and
stripped down to ordinary swimsuits
without stockings and they were all
arrested
and she invited the tabloids to see them
all be arrested and this kind of
created this atmosphere of how
ridiculous is this women are just being
arrested for wearing swimming costumes
come on
come on guys sort your out and so
they relaxed the rules but you did have
to very quickly put on a robe as soon as
you emerged
yeah yeah the rules were pretty strict
weren't they back in the day like in
1921
uh in new york everyone had to wear a
two-piece
swimming suit everyone and there was a
specific law
uh that made it illegal for any bold men
to stare at women
yeah i said i saw that what does that
mean
i think that was one person on the beach
like the person who's monitoring that
beach who thought that bald men were
sort of equated with
perverts and he said i'm gonna stop bald
men from staring at women it's so
strange
maybe there was a specific bald man that
they were worried about
like starry steve and they sort of said
well we can't say
starry steve's band from the beach but
we will say this
yeah well weren't weren't hats very
popular back then so maybe bald means a
hatless because maybe they were taking
their hat down to hide
a protrusion below
is that how you know how they always say
um in the olden days whenever you met a
lady you had to lift your hat
it wasn't to hide your protrusion then
the taller the hat the bigger the brag
you remember mr darcy always had a very
tall top hat
and yeah but that's how you catch them
is that you just say can you show me
your hands please and if the hat stays
where it is
on their lap then you know that a
protrusion situation
in the olympics uh the first time that
women swam in the olympics i think was
in 1912
and the british team had to wear a bra
and knickers while they swam as well as
their swimsuit and that's because
they had this amazingly awesome silk
swimsuit that would help them to swim
really fast
but it was completely see-through when
it got wet
and so i mean it was amazing it was so
thin the
the silk that you could take the whole
thing and pass it through a wedding ring
that's how thin the
material was but it did have that one
problem that it was see-through so you
had to wear underwear as well
and did you was it a superman situation
where it's on top of the outfit
i've seen the pictures and they were on
the inside but definitely they should
have gone the outside shouldn't they
yeah
i found it really bizarre that women
weren't encouraged to swim until about
the 19th century so this only really
became a
situation then or late on then
because before that you just if you're a
woman you just didn't swim
i thought there's very little evidence
of women swimming before the 17th
century
there is some yeah yeah i found the
description of
a standard ladies bathing costume in
1687
by someone called celia fines uh who
said it was made of fine yellow canvas
um which made it that when you went in
the water it filled up with water so no
one could see the shape of your body
crafty like a mr blobby costume
because you can never tell how sexy the
person playing mr blobby is can you
they don't need they don't need to be
sexy on the inside if they're wearing mr
blobby costume i'm theirs
and in their 18th century in the uk they
made a laws
every town could make its own laws about
um what you would wear when you were
swimming
so in the city of bath uh they made it
illegal for
men to swim without a waistcoat
is that is that with um would men have
to have the
the sort of the top as well or is this
bare chest with a waistcoat i think the
waistcoat just referred to anything that
would cover your chest really it wasn't
like a proper
you know top hat and tails kind of thing
yeah
did you guys come across uh donald clark
in your research
he was an early he was very much
fighting the tide of history he was an
opponent to mixed swimming
he was a counselor in tonbridge and
he said that by making girls look like
wet scotch terriers mixed bathing stops
more marriages than
any other cause and much unrest in the
country due to the barbarous license of
women's dress so he was basically saying
women look like such mingers when
they've been in the water that no one
will want to marry them
and he was then so this is in a sort of
furious
letter to the papers or something he was
then given a job by the daily mail to go
around beaches looking for outrageous
things to be angry about
some things haven't changed that's
amazing
wow that's so good because i think the
daily mail does employ a lot of people
like that still today doesn't it
literally just find something to get
angry about we need
to fill our pages anything yeah um i was
reading about
a swimming hero called gertrude edel
so she was the first woman to swim the
english channel in 1925
and she she was trained by this guy
called jabba's wolf who was a bizarre
character himself i don't know why she
chose him to train
her because he'd tried and failed to
swim the channel 22 times previously
and despite apparently he employed a
bagpiper for encouragement
and that didn't help but anyway she she
tried and
if the bagpipes are behind you then that
will encourage you
possibly you're trying to get as far
away from scotland as you can
then so her first attempt he
jabez her trainer pulled her out of the
water halfway through saying that it
looked like she was drowning
and she said she wasn't drowning at all
she'd just been having a rest face down
in the water
eventually she did it she was the sixth
person ever to swim the channel and she
was the fastest ever
of men and women she did it in 14 and a
half hours so she beat the previous
person by two hours
did front crawl all the way and the
first thing she did it from france to
england and the first person to meet her
on the beach in kent when she arrived
was an immigration officer who demanded
to see her passport
he was actually working for the daily
mail wasn't he at the time
do you know what she was fed on the way
i find this so weird
what she got fed chicken legs i think
because if you if they touched you in
the water then that sort of you're out
because you've been kind of supported by
humans but her support boat was
apparently full of chicken legs which
okay
throw someone a check and under the
water oranges and chicken soup
to sustain where she went and i have no
idea
how she would spread the soup right what
must happen right
is i don't want to take anything away
from her swim but they give her a straw
to the soup and actually she's biting
onto the straw while it's attached to
the boat and she's using it to pull her
along
there basically basically doing that
this is a great and niche conspiracy
theory that niece needs to see more air
one person who tried to swim the channel
before gertrude
was an australian called annette
kellerman who was probably the most
famous swimmer
in the world she was the first woman to
publicly wear a one-piece swimming
costume
she was arrested on the beach she was
one of these people who was arrested for
public indecency for wearing
um like too sexy a swimming costume uh
but it wasn't really very effective and
she ended up
releasing her own line of bathing
costumes and became massively rich
because people wanted to look like her
because she was so
famous she was paid by the melbourne
exhibition hall to swim in
its aquarium so people would come and
watch her swim it was like you were
saying about the borderville earlier
andy it's like you would just go to
watch her swim
she was she was like a swimming costume
hero wasn't she she was the person who
brought us
the swimming costume annette kellerman
we've been pitching about the daily mail
so
for some balance uh here's some
perspective on the daily mirror
she came between australia and america
she came to the uk to do some swimming
and she broke a record for swimming from
dover to margate
and she caused this huge stir and it was
all great and the daily mirror
paid her to swim along that coast every
single day for two months
and they said to her she was like every
day for two months oh
god i mean that sounds like hell and
they said it's a huge thing for women
it's going to go down as a great
success for women kind and what they
actually meant was there's a lady from
australia in a
swimsuit which we've never seen before
here and they obviously invited lots of
crowds every day to come and watch her
in her swimsuit and made loads of money
selling their papers
and it was sort of the first page three
type things with these pictures of
annette kellerman and people like her in
swimsuits i read about her
show she was called the diving venus um
and she the show ran on broadway for
four years
and then she went to hollywood and
she starred in a film called daughter of
the gods
she did loads of films but this was in
1916 and the film
uh used 20 000 extras it cost a million
dollars to make which was pretty unusual
at the time
and there were scenes of her swimming uh
nude in it
i think from a quite a distance but this
led to the formal banning
of as they were called nude scenes in
films
yeah it's it's thanks to her yeah she
did all her own stunts in that movie
including a 20 meter dive into the ocean
with her hands and feet
tied together and also being thrown into
a pool with six crocodiles
wow it sounds like it promoted bill
sergeant
he really would have made a lot of money
out of that woman and when she was on
broadway making all her money she made
1250

modified lobby great courses plus to
take the course down before dan has a
chance to complete it
okay i'm with the podcast rock on
okay it's time for our final fact of the
show and that
is andy my fact is that the film of dr
doolittle was delayed for days after the
giraffe being used accidentally stepped
on its own penis
so how long is a giraffe's penis
is it like a fifth link well is it that
before or after you've trodden on it
that's the question
they have really long legs i just can't
i just can't work out the mechanics of
this andy at all it doesn't well
they i mean they're they're like folding
deck chairs you know it's very easy to
get something caught in a folding deck
chair and i think that's the same
principle
you need to stop going on those nudist
holidays andy i
can't take many more of those injuries
i'll tell you that much
so to be completely clear this is the
1967 doctor doolittle with rex harrison
not the 2021 with robert downey jr where
pretty much all their animals are cgi
and nobody steps on anybody's penises um
and this comes from a great book called
scenes from a revolution the birth of
the new hollywood which is kind of an
in-depth look at
five films in particular uh it's by mark
harris and one of those films is dr
doolittle
and there was a guy working on it called
herbert ross who was the choreographer
and he wrote to a colleague saying we're
postponed for three days the giraffe
stepped on his
and so extension
[Laughter]
um yeah so that's that it was pretty
chaotic wasn't it
amazing um apparently it was revealed
afterwards one giraffe died and i don't
think we know how
still but one of the people who worked
on it said one giraffe died but i mean
the general management of animals sounds
like hell it had lots of different
filming locations so it was partly
filmed in la and then in the caribbean
and in the uk
and because of quarantine laws they had
to hire separate sets of identical
animals for
each place to play the same characters
and
and then also the animals grow so far so
they have to keep finding replacements
like doppelgangers so i think
there was a pig called gubgub in the
film which had 40 different piglets
at various times yeah i mean it does
seem questionable doesn't it a lot of
the
the sort of stuff they did to the
animals there was a squirrel that they
had to sedate during a scene that they
needed him for
by the sedation method they used was a
fountain pen where they dripped
gin through it to just get it drunk but
it ended up losing consciousness because
it was so drunk that they couldn't
properly get the scene done
that doesn't seem very ethical in terms
of i think
there's a great story uh where um in one
scene that rex harrison
was doing he kept stop this is the story
uh that he kept stopping the scene and
the director's going what are you doing
and he goes will you keep calling cut
he's going i'm not calling cuts he's
you're definitely calling cut
and they worked out that it was the
parrot that was in the scene that's
going to mimic the word cut
no way yeah and uh and rex uh was
getting confused so they they built a
set for
the house of doctor doolittle whose
holster is that he can talk to the
animals so he lives with a load of
animals but the whole house
um the set had to be built on a slant
because obviously the animals are pooing
everywhere and peeing everywhere
so they had lots of people in the crew
just standing around with brooms
waiting for when that happened all the
furniture had to be either plastic or
painted so that it could be hosed
down at the end of each day filming in
this set house
they had to have double the sets because
frequently animals would just kick a
hole
in the walls or the furniture like the
trainers got hepatitis from being bitten
i read one amazing sentence in the in
the link you sent andy which is
unfathomably the ducks in the pond
appeared to forget how to swim
and started to sink you know
you're having a bad time you think you'd
be able to rely on the ducks to be able
to swim
so funny but apparently what had
happened was they
it was the wrong time of year so they'd
lost all their waterproof sheen on their
feathers
and at that time of year ducks don't
normally swim or something and so they
all just started sinking yeah i found
that amazing i hadn't
i didn't know didn't know
has anyone seen the movie years ago as a
kid yeah really was that any good
oh yeah i do i mean as a kid it was one
of those sunday afternoon movies and i
do remember
loving it but i've read a lot of things
that suggest i'm completely wrong about
that
a very low it got the best pitch and
oscar nomination but it's the lowest
rated score on rotten tomatoes
ever to get a nomination oh what's it
what's it rocking on rotten
32 um rex harrison who was the star of
it
uh was so horrible to everyone that he
was nicknamed tyrannosaurus rex
which is very clever when you think
because it's a film about animals that
are talking yes
he had a good reputation for behaving
like that quite frequently didn't he rex
harrison he was a grumpy
bastard or a character depending on
which way you want to frame it
but i should say so i'm a huge my fair
lady fan and a big rex harrison fan
in that and there's a guy called will
harrison who's his grandson
who listens to the podcast so we have
inside
rex harrison info apparently on if you
look at the film poster of cleopatra it
was supposed to just have richard burton
and elizabeth taylor on it as anthony
patcher okay but rex was like i'm the
big star here guys what the hell are you
doing get me on the poster and so you
see
just behind them julius caesar rex
harrison staring really creepily down at
this loving couple
and he was always doing stuff like that
um there's one particularly famous
anecdote
which is that he'd performed in the
theater and there was an autograph
hunter waiting outside she had her book
ready for him to sign
he came out she asked for the autograph
and he said
sod off and what she did was she rolled
up the program she wanted him to sign
and she hit him
with it and the co-star of the play
stanley holloway
uh later said that it was a rare but
welcome case of the fan hitting the
that's how that's how they viewed him
you know christopher plummer the actor
yes who's
the sound of music and stuff i guess he
was paid three hundred thousand dollars
not to be in doctor doolittle which is
such an epic fail by the
by the accountants i think so basically
harrison temporarily quit the project he
decided he wasn't completely up for it
and then so they said well who do we get
we need some hollywood giant so they got
christopher plummer
um signed him up for three hundred
thousand dollars and then harrison said
oh fine i will do the film then so
plumber never filmed a scene never said
a line of the dialogue but still got
paid his full fee for it
it's the dream job it's the dream job it
was originally written by a woman called
helen winston uh and they rewrote it
they just completely rewrote the thing
apart from they used
loads of her stuff but then didn't tell
her she was going to use it and so she
sued them and she got 3.2 million pounds
out of them for that whoa lost 9 million
in the um in the box office so like a
third of that
was just due to stealing this woman's
work so actually the two people
in it who had their work stolen from
them christopher plummer
and this lady sounds like they were the
real winners here
so dr doolittle is incredibly loosely
based on a series of stories written by
hugh lofting
in the 1920s and and during the first
world war
and they bear no resemblance i don't
think the plots but any resemblance to
the stories he originally wrote but they
are about a doctor who talks to animals
and it's quite a sweet story so i hadn't
realized he wrote them
while he was fighting in the trenches in
world war one and he was writing letters
back to his children
and he understandably thought i'm not
sure i want to tell the kids about my
trenches-based experience and so instead
he wrote these
brilliant stories about a guy who talks
to animals he was a real crusader for
animal
rights in lots of ways and he once beat
up three men including one who had a
knife because they were trying to tame
some wild horses
and they would i think not being
especially pleasant to the horses
so yeah yeah yeah he was very strong on
um sympathizing with animals he was
shocked by how
horses were treated they did have a very
bad time in the first world war
um yeah it was the way that he saw
horses being treated and
um they needed to be looked after by
vets but he was like well they can't
really tell us
what's wrong with them because they're
horses and that was kind of what gave
him the idea of writing dr doolittle
but we should say that if you have read
dr do little in the last
20 or 30 years you're probably reading a
massively sanitized version of it
because it is the original is extremely
racist
so in 1968 there was a librarian called
isabelle sewell who wrote an
essay about a few different books but
specifically about dr doolittle
who described hugh lofting as a white
racist and chauvinist guilty of almost
every prejudice known to modern white
western man
and that was in the 60s so yeah yeah
exactly and so basically
um from then on he just got pretty much
cancelled and
um really all his books went out of
print for quite a long time until they
got
re-written with a lot of the racist bits
taken out yeah with no resemblance to
the originals
basically but on the other hand loved
horses
yeah i mean anti-war and pro-animal for
sure
yeah yeah um so i've been looking a bit
into
uh talking to animals and people are
doing
serious work on this right now and it's
really cool
so there is a new device which is trying
to train basically lassie
technology so the idea is that dogs will
have a vest
and if the person needs help they can
pull a tab to communicate a message
okay right so it might be
someone's fallen down a well but that's
probably not gonna be it because it's
only one message
on the tab that they can pull right um
so
for example lots of children with autism
find it very helpful and calming to have
a dog and if they are
panicking or upset it might be possible
to train the dog to pull the tab
on its little vest because it can spot
the size that its owner is upset
and then that will read out the dog
saying could you please pet me now
and then therefore the child will pet
the dog and we'll calm down and that
will help
so they're trying to see if they can
train dogs to have several different
messages
so either could you pet me now or
someone's fallen down a well or whatever
it might be
it's just those two they've coded
wait so the dog senses that the child is
anxious
and so then pulls the tab that says can
you pet me so the child signals their
anxious without realizing it and then
the dog does something to make the child
calm down yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah
well you might be anxious because the
dog's just told you that someone's
fallen down
i really wish i hadn't mentioned this
wealthy complete red herring
do you know that um i was going to do
this as a fact in a future week but do
you know that the traditional way of
preparing melody in france was to put it
down a well for four hours
mellow
[Laughter]
a small child who fell there many years
ago no they um
basically you wanted your melons to be
nice and cold right and they had no
refrigeration but they did have a well
which was cold at the bottom so they
used to traditionally in france they
would put their
melon in the well a few hours before and
then bring it up and it's nice and
cold so the dog would in this case have
a third tab which says
your melon is ready sir
that was in an article written by b
wilson that i read the other day
which is pretty amazing um artificial
intelligence might help us to talk to
animals
or to understand what they're thinking
uh there is a scientist called dr
christa mclennan
who is working on a way of using ai to
tell you what sheep are thinking
uh and apparently it's really hard for
farmers to tell what a sheep is thinking
just by looking at its face
because they don't have much expression
on their faces
and you often see farmers kneeling down
just staring deep into a sheep's eyes
don't you
going why can't i tell i mean i believe
this so i was reading this article about
this ai
algorithm that tells you whether a
sheep's happy or not happy
and there's part of it on nbc um they
had a quiz
where they would show you pictures of
sheep and you had to guess whether they
were happy or sad
and i only got one out of four and that
was a lucky guess because i just had
three
sad sheep in a row and i thought the
fourth one must be
that's gamesmanship i did that same quiz
yeah i'm very proud
i got three wow so i'm a sheep whisperer
basically
um i didn't it's quite specific isn't it
though it is
it is tricky so the signs of pain or
emotional suffering in a sheep
are narrow eyes tight cheeks oh hold on
i don't know if i
really want to do the test yeah okay
don't tell us
your facts tell you the symptoms before
you do the test and yeah
test is basically that's the thing they
say if it has a nostril shape like a v
rather than a u and it's either happy or
sad even though it told me that i
couldn't do it although i think candy
because there were only four and it was
a 50 50 choice each time
then one out of four and three out of
four is within the standard deviation of
what you would expect
okay all i'm hearing is that i won't
i'm going to be the sheep farmer
[Music]
okay that's it that is all of our facts

guest on today it is the mighty host of
qi herself
sandy toxifig finally to have the
supreme boss comet and fight us with
facts

that this week by coincidence genuine
coincidence sandy's
book between the stops is coming out in

12 bus where she travels around london
jumps off at the stops and explores her
childhood and memories from her life

and um we hope you enjoy the show as
well so let's do it
on with the show
[Applause]
[Music]
hello and welcome to another working
from home episode of no such thing as a
fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations
in the uk my name is dan schreiber i'm
sitting here with james harkin
andrew hunter murray and special guest
it's sandy toksvig
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with you
sandy uh so my fact uh is that sloan
square underground station in london has
a river
running through it well actually does
this run through it
it runs over the trains yeah wow and i
think this is a marvelous thing that you
can actually go under a river
but be on a train in that way i love
that it's astonishing i've been to
sloane square station a lot i've never
noticed that i've looked up photos and i
now understand what this giant
metallic pipe that sort of sits above
the trackers
i mean that's the exciting thing about
london uh is that really
nobody has a full map of it that's the
extraordinary thing we don't really have
a full map of where everything goes
where all the pipes are where all the
deserted tunnels and so on and that in
sloan square is the uh the westbourne
river used to be called the serpentine
river
and it was they had to divert it uh when
they built the underground and
they diverted into a massive pipe and it
crosses between the platforms just above
where the carriages travel
and you can actually see it but it's not
it's not the only one
there are just loads and loads and loads
of rivers that
that that stock ball or used to cause
when i worked at the
palace theater years and years ago which
is in the in the west end of london
if you go right down into the
sub-sub-sub-basement of the theater
you can open a large metal hatch and you
can see the fleet river still
cool oh my god i've seen that i've been
there yeah
um it was our mutual friend chris buddle
wasn't it ah
there you go yeah yeah chris brother yes
he used to be the chief electrician
there
oh i can go on this tour am i the only
person in this podcast recording who
hasn't seen the fleet river through a
hatch i'm afraid
yeah probably probably the only person
listening to this podcast who hasn't
seen that
quite embarrassing yeah that's a very
small club that you belong to
chris chris says please stop contacting
him andy he just doesn't like you okay
so i love that i love that about london
i love uh i love that that you can find
the
extraordinary bits of history do you
guys know the thomas beckett pub
on the old kent road do you know it yeah
yeah so it used to be it's i think it's
closed down but it used to be a spot
called
thomas a watering and it was a place
where uh horses used to go and drink it
was the last stop out of london it was
also the sort of first into the capital
and now there's a closed bob and i think
an ex-white
[Music]
it's the very available uh where charles
ii
processed with 20 000 people on his way
in to reclaim the throne in 1660
um and it's a really important place but
the the the stream that used to run
there the river necking jokes
there's no sign of it now i think um uh
whatsoever but it was a
really important place for horses coming
in and the and the water was the
you know the the thing that drew them
there so i i love all those
yeah if you look for those old rivers
then you'll find that tremendous history
yeah i i really didn't know about these
rivers as in
i'd i'd heard that there was um the one
in sloane square and so on but i didn't
appreciate how much
they were the fabric of london in in the
old days in the 1700s and before
and i it's extraordinary because all the
names of the tube stations
are a reflection of the rivers and their
names so bay's water and knightsbridge
where there was a bridge for nights and
so on
and it would be insane to bring someone
from old london to new london to show
that we've turned it into sort of metal
rivers now like the robotic future
yeah especially knightsbridge which was
um also the westbound river so the same
one that goes through sloane square
um the knightsbridge was the bridge over
that river and it was where
all the highway men would get you so if
you were leaving uh london to the north
uh west you would have to go over this
bridge and they would always get
captured by highwayman and obviously now
knightsbridge is
well obviously no high women there now
but still i think some highwaymen in
knightsbridge and some of those shops if
i'm honest with you yeah the price of a
handbag
um apparently apparently you can swim
in the westbourne river even these days
a little bit of it
so not very much because obviously it's
in the tube and you can't go into the
tube the red hot on that
but uh it empties out into the thames
proper at chelsea embankment
and if you go there at low tide the
opening
is visible where the pipe comes out
basically and apparently you can get 20
meters in
uh there and then there's a hatch um so
you could theoretically get it's
probably more paddling than swimming
yeah and probably more dying of botulism
but yeah is extraordinary when you think
about all the stuff that's going on
underground that we don't know about i'm
reading a book at the moment called the
mole
people and it's about the number of
people who live underground in new york
city
wow and they estimate there's about
2000 people who live full time in the
old
tunnels that are now abandoned do they
not worry isn't this supposed to be
like an urban myth that there are
crocodiles in the sewers in new york
awesome alligators alligators alligators
yes uh when i was a child uh if you came
up from florida there would be people at
the side of the road selling baby
alligators it was perfectly allowable
and children used to pester and say
please can i have a baby alligator
um and you would drive all the way to
new york
with this baby alligator and then the
baby allocated this very annoying thing
and grow into a bigger element
and people were said to flush them flush
them down the toilet
yeah to this day i still check the
toilet to make sure
to isn't going to appear there was a
trend for micro pigs wasn't there
wasn't there there was i think this
might be another myth too that people
bought micro pigs lots in the early
2000s and it sounds like they were just
buying pigs
just small pigs
there's like a really old russian joke
where a guy walks into a pub with a
massive bear and says
where's that bastard that sold me a
guinea pig
those are russians but about the pig
sandy
the um the theory the idea of the being
alligators in new york there was also an
urban myth that there were wild hogs
living in the sewers of london
and this was um there was a group of
people called tosha's
who went through the sewers collecting
like people's refuse but they'd be able
to find little bits and pieces and
trinkets and make a load of money
and they believed that there was a race
of wild hogs that was down there that
might um get them
so toshi was a full-time career for some
people particularly in the east end
uh and the best thing that you could do
is have some kind of accommodation where
you had
uh a manhole cover in your in your
garden
i mean i say garden it'd be more like a
you know sort of a yard uh
and any tasha who had their own manhole
cover was simply able to go it was a
very easy commute
to go down into the sewers uh where they
would
find i don't know coins and things that
the rich had dropped down open grates
and it was a living yeah it's a the
tashas were famous but they also kind of
helped keep the sewage system
moving you know we now have these fat
mountains and stuff down in the sewage
systems but the tashas were
busy making sure that areas were cleared
because they wanted to get through the
sewer system and see if anything of
value had fallen down into the sewage
system
and they i think they had a special
bucket that they would keep the things
they found in and that was called a top
pot
and um very nice yeah if it's not true i
think we should spread the word that it
is
i believe the etymology of tough spot is
to toss back a drink like if you had a
drink you would toss it back and it was
a word for people who drank a lot i
think that's right
that's okay but andy's is way better i
think you're right
another river that goes um into the
thames um which you can't see anymore is
the ephra which is in south london
and it kind of bends around um stockwell
and oval and
the reason that the oval cricket ground
is oval in shape
is because it had to go where the river
wasn't basically so
the river went meandered around there
and so they put the cricket ground there
which was oval shaped
and then all the other cricket grounds
in the world were oval because of the
oval in south london and that's why that
all cricket grounds of that shape is
because of this particular river in
london that's quite i love that
you just think well we've found a shape
let's stick with it let's
that square cricket ground thing not
working for us
we'll just stick with that i love that
while i was looking into this i found a
couple of things about the
the london underground just actual you
know general facts about it and i
really wanted to mention this one i read
about a
train driver a tube driver called red
pepper i don't know if you guys have
heard of red pepper
re double d pepper so he was a he was a
london underground driver
and his thing was any time when a train
was in the middle in between two
stations and had to stop because they
had to regulate the services
he would often when they were sitting
there would turn the lights off inside
the carriages of all the trains and go
this is your driver speaking or is it
and he was a real he was a real
prankster and he used to love doing all
these
silly voices anyway one day he pulls
into the station
and someone comes and knocks on the i
believe this is the story knocks on the
window
and hands him a card and says i'm a
voice-over exec
um please get in contact so he gets in
contact red pepper writes to him
red pepper goes on to be a voice over
man who does
the inner world for trailers in
hollywood yes
a london underground tribe driver did
the inner world voice for independence
day
for space jam for armageddon for the
blair witch project
for mr bean's holiday uh his career kind
of
went a bit lower in the uh late 2000s in
fact the last thing i could find on imdb
where he did a hollywood
movie or a movie was um so he did the
blair witch project in 1999 but then in
2010 he did the blair project
which was a jesus very much a b movie
yeah misogynistic
starring linda blair of the exorcist the
girl in the exorcist
oh wormhole then
i was reading about one more train
driver who was hannah dads
um do you know about her sandy i bet you
do she was well she was the first
woman to become a tube driver because
what happened was
when the war happened uh when both was
happened they needed to
bring new people into the underground to
do all the jobs
and loads of women started doing those
jobs and
in fact when made a veil opened it was
staffed completely by women
but there was one job that they
basically didn't let women do all the
way until the late 70s and that was a
tube driver for some reason
which is weird because it's not like you
can get lost
men are always so unwilling to ask for
directions

okay on with the show i'm with the
podcast
all right it's time for fact number two
and that is
andy my fact is that in 1992
hoover ran a promotion which was so
successful that the firm collapsed and
had to be sold off
what the heck happened so
they thought this is the european arm of
hoover we're talking about and in 1992
they thought of this brilliant
promotion and it was this if you spent
100 quid
on any hoover product you would get two
free return flights to uh somewhere in
europe
and that was very exciting and they had
worked out the mass of it they thought
people will spend enough money
on extra products and you know there
were hoops to jump through and things
like this
it sold a lot of hoovers brilliant and
then so that that kind of gone all right
and then
hoover got a bit confident and they said
we're going to expand this deal
and say if you spend 100 on any hoover
product you will get two
return flights to america and
they were advised by risk management
people not to do this and they said no
it's fine
people will spend so much on hoover
products but it will completely offset
the cost
unfortunately they weren't reckoning on
the british people
who flocked to hoover shops bought the
absolute cheapest thing they could which
is about 120 quid
and then sent off for 600 pounds worth
of free flights
and it it was such a disaster 500 000
people
applied for the promotion oh my goodness
i know and they weren't making much
profit even
on the cheap vacuum cleaners that they
were selling at the time they made about
30 quid
profit on the vacuum cleaner and then
they had to spend 600 pounds on
plane tickets amazing i read that people
were buying a vacuum cleaner and they're
just leaving it
in the shop and then because
they didn't need a bag and hoover
started panicking obviously when they
saw the numbers coming in so they
started
um you know being really finicky about
the fine print they said
it was a really complicated procedure
you had to go through to get to return
flights
but they started saying people hadn't
filled in the forms or
they they would offer you the flights
and you could accept them or say oh i
can't do that
so they started offering people flights
from airports which were hundreds of
miles from where they lived
uh or they would send out request forms
on christmas eve in the hope
that the post would be closed and people
would miss the deadline to return them
because it was christmas they they tried
everything um yeah it's an astonishing
even
but the first um promotion that they did
where that was the tickets to europe
the the complications of trying to
actually
be someone who actually receives it is
extraordinary they would send you a
registration form you had 14 days
to fill it out send it back then they
sent you another form which had three
different
destination airports um and combinations
and dates that you had to fill out and
send back then that came back
if they rejected it you had to pick
three more like they made it as hard as
possible but it worked out for them the
first time
the problem with the second time is they
didn't send anyone to america
they should have at least sent you know
some in order to make it look like it
was a genuine thing but
they they just knocked it out so heavily
that no one ended up going as far as i
could see
andy you look like people did i don't
think that's right i think about 220 000
people got their flights
both promotions yeah it was yeah because
it's absolutely
i know one person who in fact we all
know one person who got one of the
flights and that's stephen k
a moss the comedian really really yeah
and he
says that it kind of started his career
he when he was 19 years old he got these
tickets
he went to new york and he met a
promoter called delphine manfield
who said hey you're a really funny guy
you should become a comedian and she set
him up
in a show in london when he got back and
he said that was his big break
so what happened to the mandy they
obviously when it was a disaster well
there was another problem so the company
spent 15 million pounds on airline
tickets in the end
um and the other problem was that so
many people had bought hoovers
that everyone now had a hoover and
people started selling them off cheaply
and second hand
which meant that no one was going into
shops and buying new hoovers because you
could they were on every street corner
as far as i could tell the observer said
if left uncontrolled britain could soon
be knee-deep in hoover turbo master
uprights
and just i'll tell you what i'll tell
you the final thing that happened but
the the just one previous thing is that
there was a kidnapping or it's kind of
slight kidnapping over this which was
that there was a hoover customer
who bought a washing machine that was
his way of getting the free tickets
and a repair man from the firm came
around to fix it some little problem
with it
and the guy said yeah i'm going to be
getting these flights and the hoover
repairman called him an idiot
for thinking he would get these flights
and this customer
uh it was called david dixon he saw red
and he blocked in the hoover guys repair
van
and he held it hostage in his front
drive for 13 days he was a national hero
oh the temptation the temptation i know
i found one other promotion which was by
tesco in 1997 and i'm pretty sure this
is neat enough that it'll be news to all
of you
this was a deal where if you bought
three pounds of bananas
um you would get 25 points on your tesco
club card all right
and that was worth one pound 25. that's
how um that's how i started my comedy
career
i bought all those bananas and left them
on the street so people slipped on them
and videoed them and
you're still living off the you've been
framed income aren't you 250 pounds at a
time
um no so you get these things if you
you get one pound 25 on your card if you
bought these bananas and the bananas
three pounds at the time only cost one
pound 17
and a heroic shopper he's probably still
out there somewhere he's called phil
colcott
he said i did a mental calculation and
it seems like you couldn't lose
basically they were paying shoppers
eight pence to take away three pounds of
bananas
so he spent 367 pounds on 942 pounds of
bananas and took them away in his car
had to make a few trips he ended up with
about 3 000 bananas
and he just started giving them away he
got the local nickname banana man
because he was just constantly giving
out bananas
he ended up making 25 pounds and 12
pence in profit thanks to the scheme
the thing is can you be asked that's the
thing ken can you be bothered
to go and do that is the real question
that's amazing
phil if you're out there write in we
want to know we want to hear from you
yeah we need to track these
these people down um one or two things
on hoover's
yeah sure yeah sure okay so this is
this is i think of no interest to anyone
but me but i want to say it anyway
which is that the lead singer of ac dc
is a guy called um
brian johnson his final
job before getting the gig as the lead
singer of ac dc the biggest
you know heavy metal band in the world
was a hoover advert
was singing the jingle on a hoover
advert really
yeah i don't i don't think you're alone
in finding that interesting i love that
oh
i love that very much in fact he got the
because he got the job because the
previous saying upon scott had died and
he was auditioning but he made the band
wait they were waiting in london for him
to get to his callback and he insisted
on going off to record a hoover jingle
first
and then the very next thing he recorded
after that was back in black which
was the second biggest album of all time
wow i know
but on the way up everybody's got to
make a living you know what i'm saying
but that's that's more extraordinary
that i thought he had you know done the
gig and that was on tv and then he went
to this audition he actually said to ac
dc
the the most rock and roll band at that
time
sorry guys i got to do a corporate gig
before auditioning
i think in i think they were down in
london saying can you come by and he
said yeah i'll come by in a bit but i
have a i have this thing i've got to do
first
yeah we've all done adverts where you
think i'm ashamed that that happened
years ago i did an advert in in ireland
for cottage cheese which involved me
being inside a giant pot of cottage
wow yeah so i'm just saying i've never
seen it but
it's out there somewhere wow i mean if
anyone can find that video and send it
to us i would be very grateful
that's so funny i want to hear more
sunday
so yeah you were in the pot was there
actual cottage cheese
and also it was just before that people
could do green screen and all these kind
of
technical tricks oh no they didn't
actually actually made this enormous pot
and i think they chose me because i was
it seemed you know like
they didn't have to make such a big pot
with me
[Laughter]
thing and they were wonderful it's just
the most glorious people to work with
and uh i finished we worked all day i
was in cottage cheese all day and then
uh i went back to the hotel early
because i needed to
get a flight first thing and at about um
six o'clock in the morning i got a call
from the director
saying we just wanted to wish a good
flight i said oh thank you very much i
said it's very sweet of you to get up at
this time
to wish me a good fight ah sure no we're
all just going home now
so they'd be not partying around around
the cottage cheese
for the entire night sorry sandy can i
just check what the conceit was of the
effort was it that
this pot you were in was normal size was
there going to be a massive
knife sort of diving in i never saw it
darling i feel really bad
i never i never saw it i've done a few
adverts in my time
i did that and i did an advert for a
torah beef suet
once which i played a small girl you had
to get into a giant pudding for that
me and me and imelda stalin played
school girls
wanting to eat wow that's so funny
again didn't get shown i don't think
um that's very good some more hoover
stuff anyone
sure um so the first um upright
hoover or vacuum cleaner you see we call
it hoover in the uk right but i think
it's mostly because of this promotion
isn't it because
so many people owned them because of
this massive promotion
they were completely ubiquitous and so
that became the name for any vacuum
cleaner
right yeah yeah but the first one was
invented by james murray spangler
in 1908 and he had terrible asthma
and he decided that the reason that it
was is because it was the carpet
sweeping that he was doing so he
uh came up with a basic suction system
and
to start off with he could only make two
machines a week to sell
because he was doing all the designing
his son was assembling them all
and his daughter was assembling the dust
bags and so
it was like literally a cottage industry
where that was all they could do
two a week and it was only when they
sold it i think to his
brother-in-law the company that they
managed to put some money behind it and
make loads of them but yeah
and he was he was an inventor throughout
his whole life and this came
very late in his career i think he'd
just hit his 60s when he invented
this hoover but after he sold it to the
hoover uh family
um william hoover he was he worked as a
superintendent for the company so he
stayed on
working for them and then finally um he
decided he was going to go on his first
ever holiday
because he never had a holiday before um
and he was going to go to florida and
sadly he passed away
the night before going on his first ever
holiday yeah
and i know the tragic thing was thanks
to inventing the hoover he was actually
given
two free flights which is a very good
thing
i've always wanted to be an inventor i
just think it's a nice thing to say
actually this is what i what do you do
for a living i'm an inventor my great
grandfather was an inventor his name was
field trickett
and he worked with he worked with the
sahara maxim i'm embarrassed to say wow
wow but he was also which links us back
to
an earlier conversation uh he was the
person who put electric light
into the west end and he put the
lighting into the palace theater
where the river fleet runs below and
where i
once where i once worked in the
electrics department wow
you worked in the lighting was that
nepotism did you get that
i don't know how i got the gig i was too
small to operate any of the lights i had
to
uh the chief electrician chris butler
had to make a special box for me to
stand on in order to
also you probably had cottage cheese
still all over your hands disaster on
the decks
yeah chris puddle's a guy andy that we
know really nice guy
yes yes you've named him before yep
thank you
hi again chris if you're listening
please right back
[Applause]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is my fact
my fact this week is that after he
retired from dancing in his late 70s
fred astaire became a skateboarder
just a classic just wonderful career
shift
so when you say became a skateboarder
yeah he
he didn't he didn't you know become a
pro skateboarder you know
it's very hard to skateboard but this is
you know one of the most elegant dancers
that we've ever
committed to film um an extraordinary
human whose whole career was defined by
his career largely with ginger rogers on
screen
and um when he hit his late 70s um he
realized that the grace of his dancing
wasn't going to keep up so he thought
better leave it on top
he could still act so he thought i'll
continue on with that but he retired
from dancing and then he was hanging out
with his grandkids
when they introduced him to the
skateboard and
this is someone who danced on screen on
roller skates you know it's someone who
was an innovator of dance and he saw
this as another
place to innovate dancing so he in his
late 70s was reportedly doing handstands
on his skateboard across the tennis
court this is these are the reports
um and he was he was just very good with
it he was very obsessed with it if he
went on a talk show like the merv
griffin show he would talk about how
incredible
the skateboard was and his fascination
that if he had discovered it years
before how he definitely would have
brought that into the films that he was
doing um but then unfortunately one day
he fell over and he ruined his um
his wrist uh in the process and had to
be in a cast for
for weeks on end and that was the sort
of end of his skateboarding career
but you know he he was made a member of
the national skateboard society of
america he featured in skateboard
magazines
he pushed it as a sport i think that
counts as a skateboarder
dan i read that that he was given
lifetime membership of the national
skateboard society but i can't find what
the national skateboard society is there
seems to be nothing online or anything
like that and i looked for it as well
couldn't find anything so i went
i found an old article in the british
newspaper archives um
and it was from actually the irish
independent and it was an interview with
avera ster
who was fred's daughter and she said
that
um after he broke his wrist he got a
plaque from the skateboarding
association which definitely does exist
for highlighting how dangerous the sport
can be without proper protection so i
wonder if that story's been slightly
kind of bubblerized yeah also he got a
he got an award for being crap that's
not even a good
that's not even a good award um i tell
you it is a very uh odd kind of six
degrees of separation but
uh i i know his daughter over really
ireland i'll ask her oh sandy i was
hoping you'd have a frederick connection
somewhere i was banking i was crossing
my fingers i thought
she must do yeah i'm so glad she's
absolutely lovely cool
yeah she's a smashing person i've had
dinner with her many times so
i will uh i'll see how i can ask her
okay
but i mean he was clearly he was clearly
somebody who was full of um
pep as it were because when he was 81 um
he married a woman jockey called robin
smith and she was 45 years younger than
him i mean he uh
you know and she's the one who looks
pleased you know what i mean she's
looking very
in the photos so he clearly didn't lack
um vim and vigor shall we call it
yeah we should put together a list of
questions for you to ask his daughter
because i've got so many serious things
so
um one thing that i wanted to know about
uh was that he was in an episode of
battle star galactica
that looked like a man as in oh you know
he was a
human-shaped alien but everyone in
battlestar electric
well i've only seen the new series not
the original but i just find that insane
that
i've have you watched it have you
watched it i tried to find it no i
didn't find it
there are some clips on youtube and you
know how you said he didn't dance
anymore
well he is dancing in this episode of
battlestar galactica but he's just kind
of swaying and
moving his hands a little bit so it's
not really he's not dancing
no but you're right he came out of
retirement from the dancing
um retirement in order to do one final
dance to disco as an alien on battlestar
galactica
and um yeah and i i really want to see
it i'm glad it's online and again it was
because his grandchildren loved the show
right
and i think there was an interview
afterwards and he said it was
the favorite thing that he did in his
whole career but only for the reason
that it was something that his
grandchildren really loved and were
really proud of him
i did i did bake off for the same reason
my kids liked him
for me the most interesting thing is the
success of the frederickster
and ginger rogers films is extraordinary
so top hat and follow the fleet and the
gate of orton shall we dance and so on
and um i discovered why they all seem
so successful and such they're so
beautifully shaped it's because the
director mark sandridge
he did what he called minitage for each
film so he had this elaborate
color-coded chart and he detailed minute
by minute
everything that was going to happen in
the film so there would be a blue
section for music there'd be a green
section for singing a red section for
dancing and a yellow section of
novelty and speaking and so on and he
made all the films
look roughly the same so you would have
that much singing in that point in the
film you'd have that much dancing at
that point in the film
and actually if you look at the
color-coded charts you can see them
there's
there's a book called the friend of
sarah ginger rogers book and they
reproduce a panel from one of his
colour-coded
charts you can see that he used it's
almost mozart-like in its mathematical
calculation about what makes
the perfect song and dance musical
because
he'd worked it so like the phrase to
make a song and dance out of something
really it should be
we've done this then and then
but you wouldn't expect it to be so no
no way so prescriptive in it
in a way when you're writing your um
plays or books or whatever sandy would
you do similar kind of things to that
would you
try and have a yeah so uh i'm sitting in
my office at the moment i'm writing an
opera with my sister my sister and i
write
musicals and stuff together and we have
different colored post-it notes
depending on
whether it's a it's a it's a particular
kind of song or whether it's a light
moment or a
big moment an eye and are always our
great moment which we got to yesterday
is that we now know what the opening
number is and we know what the closing
number is so we know how we begin and we
know how we end and then
all we've got to do now is
and um that's all there is to i'm sure
verdi had exactly the same technique
posted notes all over his office um
so one thing i did read is that when
astaire and rogers were making these
films
they had to be adjusted in part because
the films were almost too good so
every routine they did dancing was
followed by applause
live cinema audiences would applaud for
a little while after
the the dance ended so the producers had
to follow
in the movie they had to put in some
applause
after the end of the dance awesome
laughter or some thing
just to let the atmosphere in the cinema
calmed down you get those brilliant
scenes with edward everett horton
doing guerning you know just basically
doing a lot of similar funny faces
and uh and that's really a sort of cover
to make
sure make sure that the audience has
come back to the story not that the
story was ever so
complicated it was difficult to follow
yeah ginger rogers a speaking sandy of
your great great
grandfather who was an inventor um
ginger roger's
great grandfather discovered something
as well he was the person who discovered
quinning for malaria really wow
he's called john s sappington and he
developed
a sort of precursor to
hydroxychloroquine
which is something we've been hearing a
lot about uh from the president
of the united states of america um
stupidity well it hasn't yet
ginger rogers i mean genius and as she
said herself
um you know i did all the same dances as
fred but i did it backwards and in high
heels
and um there is something in that it was
tougher for her i think than it was
than it was for him there's a wonderful
early film called stage door with her in
it and lucille ball
and catherine hepburn have you guys seen
it it's a black and white movie
with all of these incredible it's a it's
a set in the boarding house of lots of
young
engineers who want to get into show
business but it is actually lots of
women who became incredibly famous and
um the thing about ginger rogers about
from being a brilliant dancer is you can
see what a
a phenomenal uh amount of comedy timing
she had she just was a
a comedic genius um i found out her
first
famous uh catch phrase which i've never
heard before
so the first movie she was in was called
young man of manhattan
and she said the line in it there's a
line where she says
cigarette me big boy and this became a
popular catchphrase across america
[Laughter]
we should all take that on now i almost
feel like taking up smoking i've never
taken up smoking in my whole life
but just the chance to say cigarette me
big boy
i don't think vape me big boy that's
quite the same effect
is it true that um he didn't really want
to pair up with ginger rogers at the
start because he'd had a
duet with his sister yeah his sister
was his uh his partner for many many
years um
in the years when he did live
performances um and i mean his original
name i think is austelitz not
astaire at all i think he's he's fred
frederick osterlitz
um but i think his sister married money
and decided to give up show business and
dear god that's such a good idea
i mean i think anybody i thought my wife
did have money which is why i was on my
way out but um
what was she what she was called adele i
think adella stir yeah right yeah
one of the not charges i mean he was
obviously pretty much the greatest
dancer ever to live but he was
accused of being quite sexless or or
that the dancers were not
sensual in in the way that maybe in his
later career when he was dancing with
jeremy they were a bit sexier actually
but when he was younger
they weren't and that might be partly
because he spent pretty much his entire
early career dancing with his sister
yeah and that would have been a bad look
darling yeah yeah but and she and she
was
the the one who was going to be
successful this is a really fascinating
thing yeah
but the the first one of the first
dances they did was when
he was about five years old when they
were dancing together as a pair
and they did a bride and groom dance on
top of a wedding cake in the first half
yeah it sounds amazing and in the second
half he played a lobster
wow yeah was that a was that a border
bill thing andy i think yeah i think it
was yeah i think it was called juvenile
artists presenting an electric musical
toe dancing novelty
it's not that it's not exactly that is
it
i don't often get professional jealousy
but i totally want to play a lobster
i think in this weather we're all
playing lobsters and we're
his first wife sounds pretty um
pretty intimidating actually so this is
he before he married the jockey he was
he married quite young and he and his
first wife were together until
uh 1954. she died of um of cancer
unfortunately they've been married 21
years and he absolutely adored her
yeah he was yeah inconsolable and then
didn't marry for years and years and
years afterwards
it was a love match but she was very
concerned about his leading
ladies i believe and she would turn up
at the side of the set
and knit uh to make sure that there was
no
inappropriateness going on and i know
and this is the amazing thing is that
fredericton and general they made 10
films together they
kissed once on screen and even that kiss
had to be
it's behind the door i think that kiss
who was it yeah so i think it's not even
you don't even really see anything
because the thing i heard or this
well maybe maybe there's one behind the
door and one on screen i'm not sure but
the the one that was on screen was
extended in slow-mo to make it seem
longer than it actually had been it's a
pretty brief peck
and um they did have one scene in bed
but for that they used a dummy instead
of a real woman
really instead of ginger rogers i like
the idea of the wife knitting like the
women at the guillotine
i was just gonna say the same thing it's
like the intimidating knitters of
history there is something quite
intimidating about someone just sat
there knitting isn't that
yeah definitely and if ginger roger
comes on with a low-cut dress she goes
i've knitted you a cardigan darling
yes here's a little bolero for you
um i was reading about some other
dancers actually
um national tap dancing day is may the
25th
and who hasn't celebrated that
well it was designated that date because
it was the birthday of bill robinson
uh and bill robinson is a very
he was the highest paid black american
entertainer in america during the first
half of the 20th century
one year he did 400 charity events in a
single year
this guy was absolutely amazing and
whenever he did a show he needed to get
publicity for it there was no
tv in those days uh how do you get
publicity he would
run backwards and have races running
backwards against local athletes
because apparently he held the world
record for running backwards which was a
hundred yards in 13.5 seconds
wow wow that's pretty good holds it now
we should surely meet this person we
need to find that
i think there would be i think it is a
guinness world record thing but that's i
mean 13.5
seconds or 100 yards is certainly faster
than i've ever run that distance
forwards in my entire life
even when i was a young man i couldn't
do that that's i i haven't covered it
that fast in a car
there was another dancer um who the name
caught my eye which was anne miller
obviously our colleague
and she um was incredible she could
dance 500 taps in a minute when she was
tap dancing that's what she claimed
no one doubted her 500 taps in a minute
and she was
stunning yeah oh so you know about her
sandy like yeah yeah i mean i'm a big
musical theater buff
but what i like about miller is when she
was very young she suffered from rickets
and she had to have her legs
strengthened as a child
and that seems to have been what made
her a brilliant dancer as she got older
and there's a lot of other people like
that like there's a soccer player called
garincha a brazilian who had rickets as
a child and then strengthened his legs
and it made him a great player
and last week we talked about annette
kellerman do you remember the
the swimmer it's australian swimmer yeah
exactly and she was exactly the same she
had
this problem as a child very weak legs
but they really strengthened them and it
made her a brilliant
swimmer when she got older so she got
into trouble didn't she for wearing a
one-piece swimsuit from stuff
exactly yeah she invented that um but
and miller as well she was
quite tall and she once danced with fred
astaire and she had to wear ballet
slippers so that she wasn't taller than
him
should have danced with me would have
been all right
[Laughter]
um i have a link a link fact which is
that fred astaire
10 years after his death appeared in an
advert for a vacuum cleaner
no yeah very good start
with the vacuum cleaner yes because
um as you'll know there's a bit where
he's dancing with a mop in one of his
films
yeah and um i think they
cgi'd it i think this would have been
the 90s um
uh they cgi'd it so he was dancing with
a vacuum cleaner instead and
his widow the his second wife robin the
jockey she said it was artistically
suitable to use the vacuum cleaners as
props but
his daughter ava was so angry about him
being used in a in an ad without his
permission obviously because he was dead
she returned her dirt devil vacuum
cleaner to the firm
well that's told them yeah um
i'm not surprised i am surprised that it
happened at all i'm not surprised his
daughter was angry because one of the
things he left
very strict instructions about was that
he was never to be portrayed
after his death he didn't want his life
story done he didn't want anybody to
um to to do his autobiography on film as
it were or portraying him in any way so
i suspect she wouldn't have been
thrilled with that
because actually it's a great story him
coming up hoofing through vaudeville and
working with his sister and coming to
hollywood and making it and so on
working with your georges
it's it seems like a natural biopic but
apparently he left incredibly strict
instructions saying that the estate
would never give permission
but he didn't mention vacuums
[Laughter]
okay it's time for our final fact of the
show and that is
james okay my fact this week is that the
icelandic word for museum
is the same as the word for a flock of
sheep
i love this fact yes me too
i think it's so icelandic it's got two
of the most icelandic things which is
sheep and museums because
um they have so many museums in iceland
they have about
300 which is one for every 1 000 people
just about
which is proportionally 25 times more
common in iceland than they are in
britain
um so this is from a book by uh someone
called a
kendra green uh which is called the
museum of wales you will never see
and it's all about these museums in
iceland and the word is
saffron i'm sure i'm pronouncing that
wrong it's s-a-f-n
and that comes from saffner which is an
old norse word meaning to collect
or assemble so it was a collection of
things became a museum and also a
collection of sheep
like a flock of sheep became that word
as well and there's a similar word in
english
which comes from the same root from
thousands and thousands of years ago
and that is the root sam which is where
we get the word same
or similar and the russian taj samoya
which means the same it's like all these
words all come from the same
original roots from thousands and
thousands of years what did you say safn
did you say
safn in icelandic yeah so savn in danish
sound
means means to save means to you know
save things together so
exactly and then this word also summer
became
hammer in greek in ancient greek and
that's where we get
words like homeopathy homosexual meaning
the same
you know things homeopathy it's where
the same thing cures the same thing
and like that but it's the same with the
actual word isn't it because it's a
homograph it's a
it's a exactly you know it's the similar
spell the same
but it means too completely different so
really interesting stuff about
etymology of words which is what i love
but really i just want to talk about the
amazing museums in iceland because i've
just been
just you've just been there yeah you
just had a weekly
what i did on my holidays
listen to everything james says now to
be tax deductible
in the course of this chat so james
which museums did you see
well i mean everyone's going to expect
me to say the penis museum in reykjavik
which of course i did go to uh
i mean it's brilliant it really is a
good museum there's so many interesting
things there and it was started by this
guy
um who acquired his first penis in 1970
well
a second penis but i was gonna go for
number two there
he acquired it must have been so
thrilled he acquired his first penis
i should start a museum it's like a
clip-on thing
yeah it's like a potato head
the curator speaking of clip-ons the
curator does have a bow tie made from a
sperm whale's penis which he wears for
the christmas party every year
uh which is on display but he acquired
his
first or second penis in 1974 when he
got a bulls
puzzle um which was being used by a
local teacher as a blackboard pointer
and then that was handed to him and he
wow later on a few years later thought
you know what i could turn this into a
collection
is that not a kind of child abuse to
point things out with a penis i mean
it depends what lesson it is i guess i
guess yeah
but so james i i read that people
started giving him more as a kind of
joke once he had the bulls one
sort of you know if someone's into
something you always give them a taurus
bit of that and then he
he got sort of almost every mammal in
iceland and he thought actually this is
a proper collection now
yeah a bit like a bit like collecting
like football cards or
you know football stickers he wanted to
get them all oh pokemon
he wanted to collect all of them so he
was like okay well we know all of these
animals in iceland i need one penis from
every male
animal it's like the noah of a bison
that's a weird calling from god two of
every animal
yeah actually just one of every animal
actually just the penis of every animal
um and they have the um penises of the
2008
icelandic national handball team um
which are not the actual ones sorry but
they're not the actual ones they're
silver plaster casts they're silver
casts because they won silver medal in
that game
ow god what a really he must have been
hugely relieved they didn't take gold
because the cost would have been
exorbitant
never mind that what about the molten
metal on youtube
it's like gold fingers that where they
cover that lady in gold all the way
through
they probably through the match go we
can't win gold
have i remembered incorrectly guys but
in parts of the arctic
um when people made wooden huts they
sometimes used to make windows out
of stretched foreskins is that right or
yeah i made that up no i think you are
right yeah you're right yeah but
straight not um
i think there were yeah obviously it's
going to be a walrus foreskin if you're
going to
make a window sorry the windows are so
tiny
[Laughter]
they've been those mullion sort of
diamond shaped windows you get in old
houses
it really worries me that that's in my
head
you guys are too young to remember play
school where they used to look through a
different window every day but oh god
let's look through the walrus horseman
um the other things he has in his museum
are
um penises from various uh animals in
folklore
so they have an elf penis a troll penis
and the testicles of a corpse eating
ghoul cat
and again what it is it's like locals
just give him these things and say i'm
pretty sure this is the testicles of a
ghost-eating ghoul cat
yeah and then they go home and sob with
laughter did he not go sorry the
testicle museums down the road we only
need
penises actually the tesco museum den is
on either side of the penis museum
well we do have a vagina museum don't we
in london
yes in camden the vagina museum which
was started by
someone we all know uh someone the elves
know anyway uh florence who
uh worked with us for a little while but
um yeah they're um
i think they're closed at the moment
just covered but they're still doing uh
events online so it's worth searching
twitter for vagina museum
and following those guys for sure
worrying about what the opening hours
are for the vagina
not something that had occurred to me
until this moment
i've always thought they'll open if
you're that keen you know what i mean
you have to buy them a drink first
honestly
um did you swim in the blue lagoon yeah
we went to the blue lagoon it was great
it's a um it's a hot water
kind of spa area cool because obviously
iceland the land of ice and fire they
have a lot of geezers and hot water and
stuff like that so
yeah it was really good it's amazing it
has a sort of
sulfur coating on the on the bottom of
the pool which is white
and people cover themselves all over but
i've been there when
it's um deep snow and you have to run
through the snow to get into the wow
blue lagoon but then there's all this
steam and you're covering yourself in
this kind of weight
it's supposed to be incredibly good for
you but it's a very surreal experience
to be in a swimsuit in the
freezing point yeah i had a couple of um
facials of the um
of the local mud and stuff and i'm quite
surprised
you guys haven't noticed how how young
my skin looks it's just the quality of
the zoom james
i i hardly recognized you
i'm honest with you but those uh geezers
what it means is that for example the
whole town of reykjavik
nobody pays for central heating even
though you are talking about one of the
coldest countries in the world because
uh there's enough natural heat
underground which they have
um you know transferred into domestic
heating
um so you you get you can have it as hot
as you like
um it's freezing cold outside which is
absolutely fantastic and there are
restaurants where
they cook they have deep pits outside
the restaurant and the pits
they put the pots down into the steaming
heat down into the ground and cook it
and then bring it back up again so
there's
they're even using it that's wonderful
it's a fantastic country i really need
to go i really want to visit james did
you go to this while you're there it's
not in reykjavik but the museum of
sorcery and witchcraft
unfortunately we got stuck behind a
landslide
which meant that we lost half a day
which meant that we couldn't go but um i
do i have always wanted to go there
because i want to see the necro pants
the necro pants they sound incredible
the necro pads so
from the 17th century they are a pair of
trousers that are made of
human skin corpse yeah
and they were supposedly used um by
you'd have to have permission from a
dead man to to skin him afterwards and
use his skin as the trousers
um and then the idea is that they were a
money-making device they would provide
money out of the trousers for you to
become rich
um so you had to in order to access the
money get a coin from a widow
uh and put it in the front of the
trousers um but from then on in it sort
of produces
more and more coins it's astonishing i
don't know if it really worked
you've got to match yourself up with a
friend who's going to be the right size
i mean if you're a big fat guy you don't
want a dead skinny guy
to make trousers out of that's true and
if you're meeting someone as a friend
for the first time and they're kind of
looking at your legs going hmm
they're sizing you up but it's a curious
thing because
uh traditionally which is uh around the
world if you think about the pendle
which is this country and you think
about the
the salem which is in the united states
it's it's traditionally it's been women
but i believe the icelandic
witches are predominantly male 1 that's
right only one
of all the there were 21 icelanders who
were burned alive for
being witches um in the 17th century and
only one was a woman
quite surprised that's unusual it's
unusual a blow for equality there
i know right finally
the first person to be executed for
witchcraft was a guy called john johnson
uh who admitted having used farting
runes against a girl
sorry farting parting the runes um
so you kind of toss them and they they
then you do a bit of magic and then
someone just starts farting all the time
oh so you call someone to fight curse
yeah it's like a curse or a yeah
magic spell death by farting wow
and then okay james to suggest i feel
you've lowered the tone
with your penises in your farting i'm
just gonna say i'm just gonna i think
you might be right
we had quite erudite conversations about
underground rivers and
um i saw a quite a fun thing that
iceland's doing at the moment as a sort
of
um global mental health incentive
and it's that the tourist board has made
it so that
all of us uh all four of us here anyone
listening over the world
can go to a website and scream at it as
loud as we want
and they will play your screen in one of
seven locations in iceland at the moment
where they park these giant speakers
into these vast empty quarters either
looking out to the ocean
or inland and you just it's it's a
primal scream
thing where they just want you to vent
all this pented up
anxiety and depression from the lockdown
period
out onto their website and they'll bung
it out into the open airs of iceland
um and that's the thing that if you go
to their website um you can actually
just record that scream and have it
played out there
i think a few of the locals aren't that
sure about the shouting thing though
done because um like
let's say you have some nice puffins
sort of living around the speaker
they're just hearing people yelling into
them
i was um i went to this lagoon it's
called the iceberg lagoon
and the glacier um the biggest glacier
in europe
kind of comes to the edge of the sea and
bits of it break off and you see these
icebergs
on the on the water it's quite amazing
but um a few years ago do you remember
there was a bund movie where they
drove cars on ice i can't remember yeah
i can't remember
is it tomorrow never dies or something
like that
really bad
so they they filmed that on that um
lagoon
but to do so they needed it to be quite
thick ice and so they damned the lagoon
so no sea water could go there and it
froze to like about six feet deep or
maybe even deeper
and i was talking to the guy who was
showing us around i said was that not
quite bad for the
you know animals the seals and birds
that live here he's like yeah yeah that
was pretty bad
and apparently it used to be owned
privately owned that area and they
damned it often so they could film this
and then as soon as that happened the
government went
we're going to have to buy this off you
because we can't be having this kind of
thing happening in our country and
you know killing all our animals just so
he could get a good scene in a bad movie
yeah yeah not one seal's life is worth
giving up for the film die another day i
think we can all agree with that
i'd have that on a t-shirt that's right
[Music]

accompanying podcast which is also
called sex power money
which you can find in all your normal
podcast providers
both of those things are absolutely
brilliant you should definitely check
them out
but for now on with the podcast
[Music]
[Applause]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing
as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you
from four undisclosed locations in the
uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with andrew hunter murray
james harkin and special guest sarah
pascoe
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with you
sarah hello everybody my
fact is for 15 years
german police hunted a serial killer
who didn't exist wow that's
amazing it is amazing but it's also
quite dark it does involve things like
murder so i
it isn't like a trigger warning but i
know that your show is sometimes just
like oh this lady bird bought a hat
so if anyone is like listening
i think you're confusing us with play
school
yeah i mean more like this ladybug looks
like she bought a hat but actually it's
a very interesting evolutionary
shadow yeah yeah so i just wanted to say
to people who are listening like if
there are children
i'm not going to go into any great
detail about murders but it does mention
murders so in 2007
two police officers were shot in hell
bronn
so obviously it's terrible a 22 year old
female officer is killed
and her male colleague was badly injured
now they
found the dna of the killer at the scene
and they ran it through a database where
obviously dna has been stored from other
crimes and they found
multiple matches in 2001
a 61 year old furniture dealer in
freiburg germany
had been murdered by strangulation and
the dna
of the killer of the police was found
in his apartment and so this is
completely
befuddling for the police because this
is completely different mo this is a
manual strangulation of a furniture
dealer
and then this murder of the police which
seemed to be completely different
because they couldn't connect the
reasons why you would commit those
murders
this becomes even more confusing when
they found a match
to a very very cold case from 1993
a 62 year old woman and again a
different murder mo
they tried to find links between those
two victims the
involved in the 62 world but they
weren't connected in any way
at all so they've got a serial killer
and
it turns out from this dna that this is
a woman which is
incredibly rare to have a female serial
killer she's been working for nearly 20
years not working i know it's not
working
[Laughter]
she's been employed as a serial killer
for like for like two decades
they're going back through all of these
cold cases going through the data and
the stuff that's coming up on her
is just so incredulous so at the end of
october in 2001 in buddenheim germany
there's a break-in in a trailer right so
no murders are committed because it was
empty at the time
and her dna is found on a half-eaten
cookie on the side of this trailer
so they don't know what she was doing
there but
they now have a name for this this
serial killer this woman they call her
the phantom of hell broon
but if i was if i was the german police
at this point in the
case i would have called her the cookie
monster because she's killed three
people i think that
the reason they had no sense of humor
about it is because she'd killed a
police officer
i think if she i think if she hadn't
they'd have had a lot more fun with the
name
but sarah you're saying she didn't exist
what's going on
well well at the moment at the moment
she she does exist very much
sorry that sounded so playful andy that
i think sarah's justified
in the lady bird with a hat but what
happened
um so so it's it's um completely
incredible
at this point they now have a whole room
of police officers who are just
completely focused on catching her they
also call her the woman without a face
because also so far they have no
witnesses obviously wait a minute how
did she eat the cookie if she didn't
have a face
this is why she's so mysterious
uh so the woman makes no sense she's
killing she's robbing she's snacking
and there's no consistent mo and by 2007
she is now in another country
she is in austria robbing an
optometrists
and now because her crimes have gone
into austria they actually have
different rules in terms of what they
can do with dna
and so they find out that this woman is
of
very likely of eastern european descent
so between 2003 and 2007 the phantom's
dna is found at over 20 burglaries or
motorcycle thefts
they've got a reward of 300 000 euros
for her capture
and over 16 000 hours of overtime have
already been
paid for the police force and um i've
also
i looked at some of the press from the
time so
this is from 2007. now this was quite a
big deal because they found her dna
on a syringe that was half full of
heroin
so perhaps she was also an addict did
that was that why her
her spree was so unpredictable such an
old story isn't it you start on the
cookies and then you just work your way
up to the really hard stuff
or maybe because you're so i don't know
if heroin gives you the munchies
but maybe that's why she was like i'm
busy
and busy robin but also i would love a
biscuit so this is from time magazine in
2009
the phantom was not only a brutal killer
suspected of committing six homicides
but also a common thief she had been
involved in a car dealership robbery and
a school break-in
but in both cases others convicted of
those crimes denied her existence
no one had ever seen her no security
camera had ever captured her image but
when witnesses described her
they sometimes said she looked like a
man
so this is what those are this so this
is what those police are dealing with
right so this criminal is
this eastern european woman who looks
like a man
is so incredible at her job and that and
everyone is so scared of her that even
people who they definitely know were in
the same place as her
doing the same crimes they're like no no
there was no woman what woman are you
talking about
um it's crazy it's like kaiser sose it's
like this mythical
super boss that everyone probably thinks
they're working under
exactly that like so who is this woman
it's starting to sound to me
like she doesn't exist okay
where was the clue was it in the
original fact where sarah said she
didn't exist
so the story ends in 2009 they found the
burned body of a male asylum seeker
they took his dna in an attempt to
identify him
and their results had a hit on the
database it was the phantom
of hell broon they found him but the dna
is definitely female
so they've got this man who's been
killed
but then the dna is coming up as this
definitely definitely
female dna so obviously um i've written
what the was going on was probably
that's probably what the police said in
that uh task force that what
what the hell is this and that's when
they realized
that this must be a contamination
all of the places that had had shown up
the the phantom of hell bronze dna the
cotton swabs that are used to take
dna traces they um they all came from
exactly the same factory
in bavaria where they employed eastern
european women
and the reason that this had been
allowed to happen was that those swabs
were supposed to be for medical use
not for forensic police use so there was
never an instruction to them that they
couldn't like
lick the swabs or i mean
they're not licking the medical swaps
though are they no i don't think so i
think they're just maybe not having the
same you know
airtight completely safe things and so
yeah it was just this incredible dna
mistake and
there have been other dna mistakes
do you think sarah because it's like
everyone trusts dna so much
don't they it's like this basically if
dna says it's right then it must be
right and
all of the other evidence pointing to it
being wrong must be
wrong do you know what i mean the people
who are really scared of dna is for that
exact reason like so we've had cases in
the uk there's a case i think his name
is adam scott
which you guys might have read about but
he was sent to prison for four and a
half months
for a crime in manchester it was a
really brutal crime on a woman
and and he said that he was in plymouth
or portsmouth he was one of those places
down south he said he said i was
definitely there
so he he had an absolutely watertight
alibi
which they didn't check because they had
his dna on the victim
and then after four and a half months of
being in prison and obviously he was he
was actually in a pedophile
and rapists wing of a prison so he's
also having like a
terrible time um it then turned out that
his crime actually what he'd done is
he'd spat in the street and they'd taken
his
um saliva and then that in the
lab that confused the samples one from a
brutal crime one from
one from spitting and he'd gone to
prison for nearly five months
now i'm not saying that that's an
appropriate sentence
i spent five months in a pedophile wake
of a prison for spitting in the street
but i it's not
far off yeah i do hate spitting i do
but but also i think a lot of
premiership footballers are going to
suddenly be
can i just ask do we know who this
bavarian woman is and was she informed
of
all that she's just she's the phantom of
hell bro
right but so did we did they track her
down i
actually couldn't get to the bottom of
that i'm sure she really
made sure they didn't want to be
attacked yeah there must be data
protection issues about that although
although if i was a serial killer uh and
i wanted to commit crimes across
multiple jurisdictions across multiple
years
i would definitely get a job in a
factory that packed cotton swabs and
then i would just track the cotton swabs
to where they had been
that's a lot of work i'd like to
remember andy that's your second novel
right
oh yeah there was a murder called the
time travel murder
it was in the 90s and what happened was
they found the body
and they took dna from it uh and they
matched it with someone who had died a
few years ago and they were like
how on earth could that happen you know
how can you have someone who
who died and then committed the murder
and what it was is they've been using
the same nail clippers
to cut the fingernails to test
right and from now on they always use
disposable fingernail clippers whenever
they're taking any fingernail stuff
and they always put the clippers in with
the clippings
so whenever you take the dna you always
have the item which
found the dna in the first place i found
a case like that as well so this is
this is in america in california um so
a man called lucas anderson was
considered
as the main suspect in the murder of a
silicon valley millionaire
but what happened was that paramedics
had treated him earlier in the day so he
hadn't died
but they'd then accidentally transferred
his dna to the crime scene when they
attended with the victim later on
they must have thought that's such a
coincidence as well god that's so weird
that that bloke we were treating earlier
today turns out to have been here
murdering someone
but i don't know if it's the same one
but there was one that was like that
where the guy was being treated because
basically he was blind drunk
and they took him into the hospital and
obviously all this kind of contamination
happened
but then when they arrested him
afterwards he was like well i was drunk
i might have killed someone i guess
[Music]
it's pretty bad but you can like if um
if you shake hands with someone for two
minutes
and then the person that you shook hands
with is uh touches a knife
then your dna will be on that knife that
again doesn't have a great plot
that's a great plot line yeah and it's
the handshake murderer
no no it is two minutes he's
shake your hand for two minutes i bet
darren brown could do it
that's true i found a dna related crime
this year that was a
this is a good result for the police but
it's not a human one it's
the police in south wales there's just
been this year a trial about a missing
cow
oh yeah um so this cow went missing very
expensive cost 3000 pounds it was worth
that
and um the farmer who had owned it he
suspected one of his neighboring farmers
so they've took blood samples and this
by the way this all happened three years
ago and it's come to trial now i imagine
there was a very lengthy pre-trial
procedure but they took blood samples
they compared with them with samples
from the complainant's farm from the
victim's farm
and it proved that the cows were related
so
it's a good result that's a good news
story yeah
no one was murdered and the guy got his
cow back you know what
2020 hasn't been that bad
um have you guys heard of soulmate
um you're gonna have to give us more
context so
i've been looking into lots of different
ways that you can you can bust a
criminal and obviously it's from dna
through to looking at uh prints there's
so many different ways and
soulmate is a really interesting thing
that's been set up which is
they also track the footprints of
criminals as they're leaving and
arriving
and often you can see the print of the
soul of a shoe
but you don't necessarily know
immediately what that shoe is a soulmate
is a database that has over 31 000
individual footwear records that quickly
helps you to identify so on the spot you
can put in the shape you can put in the
logo you can put in
the crime scene print basically and it
matches it to an existing type of
footwear
it's remarkable how they can track down
if it's a new shoe they can find out who
bought
shoes in the area and so on andy another
one for your novel maybe is like someone
takes
some converse and cuts the soul off and
then puts them on the bottom of some doc
martens or something
that's really good different size
um some more ideas for your novel andy
while we'll start brainstorming
so um if you get a bone marrow
transplant from someone
then your dna will be the same as the
person who gave you the transplant
so that's quite a good one that's wow
that's amazing and also you know
um they kind of one use of dna is to
find
species in the wild right you might take
a bit of soil and then
sequence the dna and you can tell what
animals have been there and stuff like
that
well the best way of doing that is not
by collecting samples
but by collecting stuff from spiders
webs because whenever an animal hits a
spider's web they leave some dna
in that web and so you can take the webs
and you can work out what animals live
in a forest for instance
so maybe your murderer kind of is
running through a forest gets caught in
a massive spider's web and they use that
as a
as a thing i love that okay so how about
this
while you're shaking hands with someone
for two minutes right you're the killer
um you use they're distracted by the
handshake and you use that time to
inject them with some of your bone
marrow
right so then they've got your dna
inside them but you've got their dna
on your hand really and you can go and
commit the chronic it's like face off
uh but slightly wow but hang on
if you're able to transfer the bone
marrow as the murderer isn't that all
you need to do
transfer the bone marrow and then drop
them off outside a police station and
they would be busted as you
for all the crimes andy's just going for
a second level i think
i haven't committed the crime yet down
because i need their dna on my hand
before
sorry yeah i think the third level what
you're getting is actually
it should be a spider because they've
got eight hands they can shake hands of
eight people
at the same time they can get eight lots
of dna
while catching people in their webs and
stealing their deal
and also no one will suspect them
because they're a spider and then
imagine how small their fake
converse will be
oh well guys thank you you've put so
much thought into what is going to be
easily the worst novel published
stop the podcast stop the poker hi
everybody just wanted to let you know we
are sponsored this week by hello
fresh that is right hello
fresh is the sexily pronounced food
delivery service
that delivers recipes and all the
ingredients in perfect proportions
to your door really easy really
delicious recipes and all you got to do
is make them yes it's absolutely
fantastic they send you recipe cards
they send you exactly how
long the meal is going to take so if it
says 20 minutes and you'd be cooking
three hours you're probably going wrong
somewhere along the way
but it's very hard to do that because
it's very simply laid out
and there are delicious recipes that
change every week there's a huge
carousel of different options for you to
choose
you can have delivery slots you like
it's very convenient you can ask for the
food to be left in a safe place if you
know you're going to be out
it's completely easy to do it really is
so like on this week's menu
it's got mexican beef loaded wedges a
thai style pork rice bowl a chicken
pasta bake it's a real variety and as
andy says
you can pick your favorites from the
list so if you want to try this out then
all you have to do is go to
hellofresh.co.uk and to get 50
of your first box and 35 of your next
three
use the code a fish at checkout yes
that's right so just to say that again
if you go to hellofresh.co.uk and put in
the offer code
a fish or a fish then you will get half
the money off your first box and 35
off the subsequent three that is right
okay
on with the show on with the show
[Music]
okay it's time for fact number two and
that is
andy my fact is that to run a boeing 747
you need a binder full of floppy disks
okay so is that like the key is that the
key to turn it on
it's not the key to turning on no
wouldn't that be nice um
but this is a fact that's been revealed
recently or
i mean i think quite a lot of people who
work in 747s will have known it already
but uh boeing 747s and in fact a lot of
planes boeing 747 737s
um they were products of the late 80s
and at that time the most effective way
to store
information was uh with the floppy disk
and
um there was a recently a cyber security
firm did a walkthrough for of a
decommissioned 747
and someone spotted a drive in there and
said oh that's a
that's a floppy disk drive that's uh
very old-fashioned
now this isn't every 747 some of them
will have been updated by now but it is
still
uh quite a few of them wow didn't we
have a very similar discovery a few
years ago about trident
yes yeah yes the nukes were all
uh well certainly american nukes were
all on floppy disks i think
until like only last year or something
right the american ones
yeah it's amazing it's it's terrifying
oh it's kind of terrifying and it's nice
is it terrifying because i guess you
know as long as you have the equipment
to read these things does it even matter
what they're on
exactly i like the idea of the
old-fashioned technology because i like
i always really liked clippy the
microsoft paperclip
and i really like the idea that he might
be just like popping up on things
like hello it looks like you're trying
to launch a nuclear missile
um and so andy what did they use these i
i read i think that they have like the
details of where the airports are
and the flight paths and things like
pretty much that right yeah
exactly and there is a problem though
because these discs
they they can store i think a
standard like three and a half inch
floppy does can store about 1.4
megabytes on it give or take
um but the databases that they are
loading onto the planes
are getting a bit bigger and sometimes
you have to load up to eight disks in
sequence and get all the information off
them and onto the plane wow
but there might be a bad disk and you
might have loaded seven floppy disks
worth of stuff on and then you find one
of the desks is
flawed or corrupted in some way then you
need to start all over again
it'd be a bit disconcerting if you got
through seven of the floppy disks and
you had to start again
if i was a passenger and i heard an
announcement saying from the captain
apologies this flight is going to be
taking off late the uh floppy disks
are not uh respond does anyone have
floppy disks number eight
for the london two barcelona route just
on the off drive um do you know that tim
burner's league used to go door-to-door
with the internet
on a floppy disk no yeah in order
in order to because the big problem
obviously when you were telling people
about how the internet would work is
that you would
need to show them but the reason he
invented the world wide web is because
computers weren't talking to each other
if he sent them something
their computer was running on different
systems it wouldn't necessarily
translate it
so he had on a floppy disk in his
computer which he would carry around
with him
he would go to different places and show
them the first website the original cern
website that he'd
created and uh it lived on a floppy disk
and there's a project that's going on at
the moment where there's a guy who works
at cern he works a couple of offices
down from where berners-lee
uh worked and he's trying to preserve
the earliest bit of the internet where
we have the first websites and so on and
the very first website is missing which
is the one that tim berners-lee created
wow that's very cool we don't know where
the earliest one is we don't know
they're convinced it's out there
somewhere they think that there's a disc
out there
and it was lost at some sort of
conference in california
one night uh someone disappeared with
this and so it should be out there still
there's a hunt going on they've asked
the globe that's the job for the work
experience
kid isn't it can you just go through
these five billion discs one of them
should have the first website on it
if there are any pilots listening can
you just have a little look around the
cockpit
if there is there is a spare disk just
check what's on there
i would think that the work experience
kid wouldn't even know what a floppy
disk was did you see this survey in 2018
that asked
children under the age of 18 what each
of these things are so they showed them
like a
floppy disk and a teletext or a postcard
or whatever
and 67 of children didn't know what a
floppy disk was
wow i think that's fair i think i think
it would be higher for things like the
minidisc which um we have an extensive
mini disc collection of the family home
and yeah well you know my parents got
really into storing things on
on mini desks which didn't take off
spoiler sorry
it's weird isn't it that basically
everything that we use now is just going
to become
obsolete and it doesn't even matter what
kind of things we're saving or whatever
it's all in 100 years time no one will
be able to read any of it it's not like
a book where you can
everyone will always be able to read the
book well maybe not always but for a
long time they will be able to
it's like they've come up with a new way
of storing data
on um like a little quartz thing and
it'll last for 13.8 billion years it
lasts forever
but of course the problem is that in
about 20 years no one will even know
how to access it it's gonna look like a
bit of rock
yeah i just find that really interesting
it'd be really cool though if like the
next rosetta stone is literally a little
stone
wow it could be like the next rosetta
stone they get a usb
stick and a mini disc and a floppy disk
and they're like how do we get the
data out of this one it's a bit like
getting the data out of that one and
stuff
um james just on what you're saying the
bbc in 1986 they made a what they called
a digital doomsday book okay so
i i'm not sure if it was a copy of the
real doomsday book or if it was
an example of what civilization was like
in 1986
but they made it on an acorn computer
and they used a
a video disc player uh so for the
storage device
anyway 13 years later by 1999 it was
completely unreadable
and a team of researchers had to spend
three years developing the software to
access
1986. wow so yeah it's a problem
it's cool though there is a lot of
floppy disk archaeology going on which
is quite fun
so um for example andy warhol a lot of
art of andy warhol's is saved onto
floppy disks that we don't have
and i think it originates with there was
a party that yoko ono
threw for sean lennon when he was young
just after john lennon had died
and at the party was andy warhol and one
of the guests
was steve jobs and steve jobs brought
him the original apple mac
computer as a present and he was showing
sean lennon
the paint function on it where he was
drawing and andy warhol spotted that and
went over and started
doing his own drawings on it and he was
fascinated by it and that led to a whole
thing of andy warhol doing original art
purely on
his his apple on pens or on another
computer sorry
was that on paint wow that yes and
there's he saved them to floppy dish and
never published them and so
people have been finding lost andy
warhol art on all these floppy disks
that are kept in his archives they're
going through all the floppies
god he might have the original internet
yeah oh he might do it
i've got just one more thing on floppy
disks which is about prince
um no it's so yes the artist prince the
musician prince
prince we all know how i'm talking about
prince um so
you may remember in 1993 he changed his
name to a symbol
which he called the love symbol and it
was a combination of the
you know the male and female symbols
symbols with the arrow and the cross and
things
um and it had entered his consciousness
during meditation and so obviously he
wanted to get it out there
but the thing is nobody knew how to
print it and so
his management warner brothers they did
put it up online as well but they also
sent out floppy disks of the symbol to
various magazines saying
this is what you have to call prince now
this is his name
um and so yeah that was how they
distributed the new name of prince
that's really cool yeah
i think he did it also because he was
very annoyed with his management um
yes because he had a lot of uh beef with
them he had 500 songs that he wanted to
release
and warner brothers said that might
flood the market for prince songs just a
little bit could you not do that so he
was
furious about that and as a result he
changed his name to that um i got one
tiny thing which is
referencing back to our first fact which
is that um there was an
american serial killer who was um
they were on the hunt for him and they
were reaching out to this guy
to communicate with him and the guy
asked out in various channels whether or
not he could communicate with them
not in person but via floppy disk and
they said yes to that and they did that
by putting it in a newspaper by saying
rex
it will be okay as a message to him but
they said he couldn't be tracked
wasn't that the thing as in yeah yeah
it'll be completely anonymous if you
send us a floppy disk
exactly he was asking will this be okay
will i be will it be anonymous and they
said yes anyway they he sent him the
floppy disk they were able to trace it
back to his church
and then um they caught him this is
extraordinary
and he was furious because they used
they found out that he'd use the floppy
desk on a particular
library computer or something like this
and they said
who's a member of the library and it
turns out he was i think the head of a
church yeah yeah
they like so basically they lied to him
he said that they won't you can't trace
computer like geographic information via
floppy disks and they said no you can't
but they
they can yeah and he was really annoyed
with them for
febbing about that when he murdered
multiple people
yeah buying is also against the law andy
yeah is it yeah you don't expect the
police to be also
criminals it's like you can't trust
anyone anymore why they call floppy
disks when they're not floppy
i'm so glad you asked james they should
actually they should be called stiffies
in south africa they're called stiffies
aren't they yes are they
it's because the very original ones but
i think also if you're on an aeroplane
and you hear the captain saying has
anyone seen my stiffy then that's going
to be even more worried isn't it
okay it's time for fact number three and
that is
james okay my fact this week is that in
the 1920 u.s election
which was the first after women got the
vote in america
only one woman in the whole of georgia
managed to cast a vote
um so this is the 19th amendment uh it
was ratified in august
1920 and it granted women the vote but
the election took place on the 2nd
of november so it's only a few months
later
and most of the states kind of
facilitated the new voters like they
came up with ways to make sure that
people could register in time
but mississippi and georgia especially
were so against the idea they were so
massively against the idea of women
voting
that they tried to make it as difficult
as possible for women to vote
and in georgia they said you had to be
you had to have registered six months
before
the election in order to cast a vote and
obviously
six months before the election they
hadn't ratified the law yet
but luckily there was one lady called
mary jarrett white
who somehow on april the 1st signed her
name
on her poll tax and also registered to
vote at that time no one's quite sure
how she managed to do it the time
traveling vote
[Laughter]
it's so strange because it seems like
she shouldn't have been allowed to do it
but whoever was organizing it um allowed
her
and she was allowed to vote in november
and she did but she voted for the losing
candidate but
she still managed to book oh i like the
idea that they were like um
or what harm can she do she can silly
idiot we'll let her sign up she'll never
be able to actually use them folks
yeah also april 1st not the best day to
sort of have what looks like a prank
a woman finally voting yeah i don't know
if you'd believe it
oh do you think that's what she was
doing in april fools and her husband
she came home like guess what i've got
the vote
and then at midday she's like i got you
um yeah but georgia um at the time uh
58 of the population of georgia were
baptists
and the baptist religion uh certainly
then is still now but certainly then it
was
very much against women being allowed to
do anything they were subservient to the
men
the men organized the family and the
women just
if they had any influence they were
supposed to influence their husbands and
then their
husbands would influence society um
george's constitution said that females
are not entitled to the privilege of the
elective
franchise nor can they hold any civil
office or
form any civil functions and there was
only one
position in office that they were
allowed to hold and it was state
librarian
if librarian was the only job that i was
allowed and
i was to be subservient what i would do
is cut the last page out of
every single novel in the library and
then i'll be like
you man oh my god imagine getting
through all the way through andy's
second novel and not finding out that it
was a spider after all
all the reveals are on the last page in
this novel
um i was looking into sort of other
examples of uh women voting early also
other earliest women to vote in various
places um this was a really weird thing
after the american revolution for three
decades
in new jersey women and men had exactly
the same
voting rights and women were allowed to
vote not in
national elections but in new jersey
they could and um
and they did vote so the people have
been looking through old electoral lists
and they found
lots of women's names in some places
it's not 50 50 but it's up to
about uh 15 percent of voters were women
uh
there and it was um it was racially
equal to as
whether you were black or white and then
um it was restricted in 1807 to white
men it was seen as
some kind of oversight that had happened
because there were all these charges of
the people said there were
petticoat electors which is women who'd
been manipulated you know they couldn't
possibly know
make an informed decision about who they
were voting for um so that was one
supposed problem with the system and the
other problem was apparently men putting
on dresses to vote
and then voting six or seven times for
the same person
i'm manipulating the vote that way which
i would have thought would make you more
conspicuous
as a as a voter it's not clear to me
yeah
how that helps yeah and how come they're
not petticoat manipulators
yeah they're dressed as women surely
that's also yeah yeah andy
again i i'm not saying that i approve of
this
lockdown that happened but i think
that's amazing that that was such an
early
sort of aberration there yeah again not
aberration in a bad sense as an
aberration
a positive aberration from the norm but
actually before 1920 there are a few
different states that allowed women to
vote so uh wyoming
um had full women's suffrage from 1869
but the reason they did that is because
they wanted to attract single women to
the state
really yeah they had a lot of kind of
migrant male workers who were working in
wyoming and they thought well
how can we get more women here well
let's let them vote they should have
done what nightclubs did in essex
on a friday which is make it free hooch
free hooch for ladies in groups who
don't have a man with them
what what is what is hooch sarah oh
you're so
young what does that no it's not young
what it's poshness
um so you remember alcopops uh yeah yeah
yeah yeah
so so hoot was kind of one of the
original mass-marketed
wow it was it was a lemon-flavored drink
uh so like
uh i guess and it was marketed towards
women
oh well i liked hooch as well okay well
i mean
when i say marketed towards i absolutely
don't mean that it was supposed to be an
effeminate drink but it was like a
if women don't like the taste of beer
then you've got this now sweet drink you
can drink out of a bottle in a nightclub
actually i quite liked watermelon
bacardi breezes as well so maybe i was
of course you did you've got a heart
and taste buds
and the other state which had full
women's suffrage
at the time was utah and the reason they
did it is because they wanted to show
the rest of the country that the
women were not oppressed by the practice
of polygamy and they were saying no no
but look they can vote
they confess yeah i read about this and
they also didn't they hope that women
would vote for
um the the non-church leaders so they
would perhaps this
this was a way of ending the practice of
polygamy was to allow women to vote and
then they would vote against
it unfortunately they kept voting for it
and then people said all right well
let's take the vote away from women in
utah after all yeah so
backfired well that was the thing wasn't
it they they sort of worried that
once women were given the vote that it
was a sort of useless vote anyway
because of the
nature of the relationship between
husbands being this dominant character
in the relationship
they would only vote for what the
husband told them to vote for anyway so
it was a sort of
a it was a cancelled out vote in terms
of if they'd go the other way
which is really interesting because
there's been recent polls that show that
had it not been for the voting of women
in recent elections in america between
1968 and 2004
republicans would have swept every
single presidential race
in that period uh when they broke it
down and looked at it yeah
so interesting but also that's why it's
so important that voting is secret
because then of course even if you did
have somebody oppressive in your
household
you can always say oh yeah i voted for
exactly who you told me to
but you still have your autonomy and
your freedom to cast the vote through
yes
if all of your wives are telling you to
vote one way you've got to have the
freedom
to say yeah yeah absolutely of course
yeah i love the idea that the women in
utah were like why would we get rid of
polygamy i don't want a husband
all to myself
god spread him out between i only have
to see him once every eight days
when the 19th amendment was passed um
the president at the time was woodrow
wilson
but woodrow wilson had had a stroke um
in october of 1919 and
actually his wife was the de facto
president of america around that time
so the doctors came in kind of secretly
and didn't really want anyone to know
that he was really sick
and they said he said well obviously
woodrow wilson can't really do anything
but what we're going to say is maybe
edith wilson can kind of run everything
on the sidelines and he can kind of just
be there and not do any press and stuff
like that
so technically or not technically but de
facto
lee um the president of the united
states
when the nineteenth amendment was passed
was edith wilson
female i knew it was suspicious i knew
it was suspicious
well on the other hand um she was very
much anti-suffragettes i think
possibly because she had to be uh and
because
you know obviously they were fighting
against the president at the time
but um she called the suffragettes the
devils of the workhouse
so yeah that's reverse psychology that's
how you
that's that's how you get yourself into
a powerful position
no no that's the last thing i want
have you guys heard of um the
suffragette cookbooks that were
published in the usa
no no this is very weird so you don't
associate um the
suffragist movement with you know the
home economics thing and publishing
cookbooks but this is exactly why
they were published so the the kind of
stock impression or uh that was given
by opponents of the suffragette movement
was that you know these women were
neglecting their families
they were letting their children go
hungry they weren't looking after the
home so
the the movement got together and
published lots of um
cookbooks with kind of suffragette
recipes and um
they were quite they were quite good one
of them was for emergency salad
which is one part onion to nine parts
apple
uh with any dressing that's the salad so
how bad is this emergency that you're
going to eat an onion
um yeah and so these books had lots of
stuff
one of the women inside there was alice
bunker stockham
who was the uh only the fifth female
doctor in the usa
and she was openly pro-masturbation for
men and for women alike which was her
that was her big thing is this part of
the recipe is
[Laughter]
if one of my criticisms of the
suffragettes was that these women aren't
uh neglecting their domestic duties i
don't think the apple onion salad would
convince the otherwise no that's a good
place that would be
i think that would be my proof of like
look at what these lazy are
handing in
calling it dinner
it's an onion and an apple are you
kidding me i want lasagna
i didn't realize what an influence the
british suffragettes had on the american
ones
um i read a few articles about this and
it's
so for example emmeline pankhurst did
tours of america
talking to huge groups of people about
the
the fight for women's rights and she
played madison square garden
wow which has you know we're all
performers here like what a gig
madison square garden yeah do you think
that was already like i've broken
america
exactly she didn't fill it she had 3 000
people there but i mean that's
that's as big a gig as you know the
three of us from fish have ever played
that's nice
are you comparing no such thing as a
fish to the suffragette movement in the
usa can i just say also dan we
we played three thousand three hundred
at the um hammersmith apollos so oh
slightly more actually
than uh yeah okay
what is the capacity of madison square
gardens it's
it's over 30 000 i think oh okay so
actually she did
she did really badly
she hacked it maybe she said it's
socially distanced
yes spanish fluv yeah gotta be careful
yeah yeah sorry it's 19810
just to just to lessen the bombing of
the sales for her
um no but that is that is that's the
depressing thing when you get the email
every sunday with your ticket sales
and she's sending out loads of tweets
like plenty of tickets left bring your
friends
can't find out about british feminism
there'll be a free emergency salad for
everyone who buys a ticket
[Music]

okay we are sponsored this week by
harry's
and harry's are a company that make
razors and they make very very high
quality
razors because they bought a factory in
germany that's been making blades for
over 100 years
yeah it is really incredible i use
harry's andy uses harry's james uses

fish right now that's right to get your
hands on that travel set
all you need to do is go to harry's dot
com slash fish it's three pounds 95
get shaven now okay on with the podcast
on with the show
okay it's time for our final fact of the
show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that there is a
species of japanese water beetle that
survives being swallowed by a frog
by crawling through the frog's body and
escaping out of its anus
now wow this is amazing it's the first
documented example of prey
doing this through a predator escaping
via the digestive system it has to
literally crawl
all the way through the digestive system
and make its way out the back
and it's um it's a thing that was
discovered at kobe university
where a frog was put into this enclosure
see-through box and this water beetle
was in there water beetle got swallowed
and there was nothing for 115 minutes
and then suddenly
you see and there's videos online you
can watch crawling out of the bum hole
of this frog
is this full water beetle that's covered
a bit in feces you can't really see that
but they tell you it is
and it just wanders off and we've never
seen this before so it's
just very exciting i'm a bit a bit
worried that you sold that so well that
you could go online and watch a video of
a beetle crawling out of a frog's anus
covered in feces that probably no one's
listening now they've probably all gone
to watch it oh that's true
okay well welcome back to the show
you've seen it now amazing isn't it
so yeah so uh this is um this is a guy
by the way who experiments a lot on
the defense mechanisms the defense
mechanisms that he says are
sort of impossible defense mechanisms
that you could not predict
and he's found a number of things that
are really interesting a bombardier
beetle being swallowed by a frog
will eventually be vomited back up
because of an explosion of chemicals
inside he's he's responsible for us
documenting all that stuff and this is
his latest discovery we should say this
guy's name he's called shinji sugyura
and he's an ecologist at kobe university
and he's got loads of form on this as
you say dan it's unbelievable
and so he he he wanted to test properly
because the frog doesn't have teeth when
it eats the beetle so that's partly why
the middle survives
um but i say it's a really big part of
the reason
oh yeah yeah they haven't i i cause i
feel like all the animals who can't
escape
from bum holes or from mouths like it is
because they've been chewed up by the
the person or the animal eating that
it's not because they haven't evolved to
be clever enough
no no you're right it's yeah it's a
major part of the success strategy make
sure you're eaten by someone which
has no teeth um but he wanted to test
how they do it
and so he took some of the beetles that
he was going to be testing on and he
glued their legs together with sticky
wax
so basically he turned them into harry
houdini uh beetles and then he let them
be swallowed by the frog
and those ones uh were immobilized as it
were
and those ones did not manage to make
their way out
so his hypothesis at the moment
is that what they're what they're doing
with when their legs are free and
they're swallowed
is that they're using their legs not
only to propel themselves through
but to hammer on the sphincter of the
frog
and and convince it to expel them i read
it as tickle
the cloacal opening rather than
hammering right i may have sexed it up a
little bit i'm sorry for
you know sorry hammering over tickling
is more sexy well it depends how it
depends how you want to kind of
anthropomorphize the beetle
is it terrified going get me out of here
or is it going
all this is i really don't like this
hypothesis where he's like i wonder if
things are harder if your hand cuts
oh yes it turns out it's actually more
difficult to do
things it's interesting though because
the tickling at the end almost suggests
that that's a bit of information that's
passed on to all the beatles that once
you get to the end
the way to open the magic gate is
there's a little tickley thing and
you've got to
tickle that that sounds to me more like
that you have to have inherent knowledge
where's the hammer
dan can we use the technical words like
anus rather than magic gate
we tell you this every week
dan what you just said sounded like what
used to happen in like just 17
and more magazine where it's like if you
want your guy to speed up
there's a magic button up he's gone
okay tickle the magic gate has very
different overtones to hammer on the
anus
yeah it's a terrible children's book
but yeah the hammering sounds more like
the right hypothesis i would say sort of
just uh i'm at the end i'm trying to
keep going
it's like when you know when you're
running out of seconds at the crystal
maze get me
it's that kind of moment but also
presumably if you've been
struggling all of the way down through
the frog's body anyway
like you would still be moving there
it's just that because because human
beings have two sphincters don't we we
have
kind of one that we have no conscious
control over
and one that we do have conscious
control over and
and so obviously if there's movement in
a part of your body
where it's kind of automatic you would
just then feel the need to go to the
toilet
um yeah it's how you can have
emergencies
because you that the non-cot then the
part that you're thinking
you don't have conscious control over
will be like right i'm ready to go and
then the conscious part goes oh my god
this is an emergency situation what's
the why did we intense is that why did
we evolve to have a dumb
sphincter and a smart swing do i think
maybe it's a safety thing as in
it might there might be scenarios where
it's more dangerous
to draw attention to yourself yeah if
you're trying to stay very quiet and
avoid a predator
uh and then yeah yeah which doesn't make
sense because actually it's a fantastic
weapon to have to hand
yeah if you are in danger well just
randomly pooing with no
no because then you could just throw you
could just throw it at the line
or whatever yeah or the or the bad
monkey
um so just very quickly on the rest of
this um study so the
really interesting thing is we we do
know of other animals that
um pass through the digestive system of
another animal right
there are a few of those but what is
really interesting about this is the
fact that we
we think that they're actually actively
crawling through there
and the reason that we know that is
because like you say they
he celebrates his legs together or
whatever glued the legs together
but also that the bugs can get out with
as little time as like six minutes
whereas normally it would take a couple
of days for a frog to digest its food
but they can get out there in six
minutes
six minutes is the real that is the real
crystal mace thing isn't it
yeah imagine eating a meal completely
unaware
and then feeling terrible and realizing
that your meal is still alive
and it's yeah it's got a destination in
mind
there is a beetle called the coffee
berry bora that
lives exclusively on coffee beans um
but it can't eat caffeine so
it only eats coffee but it doesn't like
caffeine
and the only way they can do it is they
have a special bacteria inside them that
kind of deals with the caffeine
and if you take all the bacteria out of
it out of this um
beetle by giving it antibiotics or
whatever it'll die because it can't
can't deal with a coffee so you're only
like science is so awful
and if you and if you glue all their
hands together then they
they can't even pick up any more coffee
beans what's an interesting science
experiment
yeah you're right i mean how are you
going to learn things but at the same
time
for the individual coffee berry borough
why can't we just all appreciate life's
mysteries
um have you guys heard of the epomis
uh beetle in fact i i i don't think
we've mentioned this before
uh again frogs prey on it uh the frog
bites it
but at the moment where the frog bites
it this beetle lover
sinks its teeth into the frog's tongue
right
and then it starts releasing enzymes
which
melt the frog's flesh and this
this goes on for a few days
unfortunately for the frog
and the frog is just stuck there with
what it thought was its lunch and it's
slowly being eaten
by its lunch it's basically um it
gets turned into a straw through which
the beetle lava is drinking
and eventually the frog is just a part
of skin and bones it's dead and the the
lava wanders off
so the scientists who were testing this
they observed 400 standoffs
um between these two the beetle
always wins oh my god there was
one case there was one case where a toad
managed to grab the beetle and quickly
swallow it
and then it started looking a bit peaky
two hours later it threw up
and then the beetle ate the toad
oh my god and andy can you let me know
is there anywhere i can watch this on
youtube
uh yeah yeah yeah it's funny pranks for
toads
there's there's another beetle the male
diving beetle
it has sperm which uh team up with each
other
so this is very rare obviously because
normally normally sperm is a kind of um
one of those games it's sort of one
versus everybody you know zero-sum game
yeah like british bulldog british
bulldog it's like british bulldogs sorry
sarah came up with a proper
epic arts from what i was trying to say
was it's like british bulldog
so but this is the really weird thing
the male diving beetle
their sperm uh effectively do a conga
and they team up hundreds of them and
and even thousands of them and they all
go in line or they sometimes go on a
crocodile they'll go in pairs
and it's because the female diving
beetle's reproductive tract is
unbelievably complicated
and um the female will often store sperm
for for months or
years to fertilize herself later and
the males kind of form a train trying to
just get through
to the area they need to be to fertilize
the egg
because otherwise they will just be lost
what's in it for the other sperms the
sperms at the back of the conga
i don't know i guess it will probably
improve all
of their chances of getting there even
if they're not the person at the front
i suppose and you all have this very
similar genetic material don't you so
you're still passing it on that's a good
point but what
as you say what is the point of being at
the back of a conga what's the point of
being in a conga
well sometimes it splits off and you
become the front that's very stressful
i wonder if that happens with these
sperms not at the back though
you can't let go at the back that's just
the person walking
if you're still kicking your legs out to
the side then it's still a conga
even if it's just you i've never had
that happen to me doing a conga but i
would be terrified that it would
i would cling on for dear life to avoid
the responsibility of becoming this but
sometimes
the conga sometimes like flips around in
a way you're not expecting and no one
has a good enough grip to hold on to the
person
oh it goes it goes into a place you
don't want to go like if they start
going they think it'd be funny to go
into the toilet so it's like it's a
wedding i don't want to go and look at
people at the originals
um i think if they have like very
complicated labyrinthine
um vaginas that probably that is exactly
what we're saying about there will be
conga and splits off and things going
around and also getting becoming
becoming very tired
the energy exerted means that some of
them will get tired at the front and
i think it will be a collective yeah
still give you a good chance because
that also happens in a conga sometimes
you get like a wave of speed don't you
like some of the people at the front go
a bit too fast
and then some of the slower people can't
hold on and then they become the front
of the conga
that's very cool i feel like biology is
actually so easy
just use a conga analogy
[Music]
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening
if you'd like to get in contact with any
of us about the things that we have said
over the course of this podcast we can
be found on our twitter accounts i'm on
at schreiberland
andy at andrew hunter m james at james
harkin
and sarah at sarah pascoe yep or you can
go to our group account which is at no
such thing
or our website no such thing as a
fish.com we have all of our previous
episodes up there as well as links to
bits of merchandise
or you could also go to an independent
bookshop website and get the new
paperback
sex power money by sarah pascoe sunday
times bestseller
uh that's out now do do that we will be
back again next week guys we hope you're
all doing well we will see you again
with another episode
[Music]
goodbye

=337
hey guys andy here just before we start
this week's show we have an exciting
announcement to make which is that we
are returning
to the stage we have a show it's a live
show
booked in and it's going to be at the
london podcast festival
later this month it's going to be on the
27th of september
at king's place which is in london it's
going to be at 7pm and it is going to be
so much fun but andy
i don't live in london and or i don't
want to go to a gig
because i'm a bit worried about leaving
the house at the moment can i see the
show
of course you can james because not only
is it being done very carefully with
only a very limited number of tickets
being sold so it's all socially
distanced
you can also get streaming tickets so
you can go online and at that time you
can
watch us make fools of ourselves with
stupid facts on stage
so how do i get these tickets andrew
james all you have to do is go to qi.com
fish events and i'll say that again
qi.com
fish events and when i say events i mean
event because it is
the only thing in our diaries so
for your possibly last ever chance to
see us on a stage
just go there now we'll be back on time
next year oh i hope so
but andrew what is going to happen next
uh the show is going to happen next oh i
better do that yeah on with the show
i'm with the podcast
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
is dan schreiber i am sitting here with
james harkin
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with you
anna my fact this week is that by
complete coincidence
the center of north america is called
center
mad amazing
so a lot of people weirdly put quite a
lot of effort into working out the
geographic center
of various places and this is the latest
research on
the center of the whole of north america
so you've got and it's it's mainland
north america
so uh not including the islands and
this research was done by a university
of buffalo geologist called peter
rogerson
and he worked out this mathematical way
of defining the center of a place which
has never been used before
and essentially he ran his sums ran his
algorithms
and the place that was thrown up was a
place called center in north dakota
total chance it's i would say it's tiny
isn't it
it's 1.24 kilometers square yeah so it's
not even like it's a big place that had
a big chance of being it
no it is quite weird because there's no
way of actually working out the middle
of somewhere there's no universally
agreed way
so his mathematical definition is that
the
center's location minimizes the sum of
squared distances to all other points in
a region so if you want to work out the
middle of something there you go
that's how you do it but the way he
changed it is that he realized the way
we've worked out the middle of places
before hasn't accounted for the
curvature of the earth
and so that actually affects distances
whereabouts on the curvature of the
earth you are
so he used this special 3d projection
and
i wonder how many different methods he
came up with before it yielded somewhere
well he reckons that his isn't exactly
perfect because he hasn't taken into
account that the planet
is a slight ellipsoid so that it's not a
perfect ball
so maybe he might find that science
yeah yeah see this is where they're
gonna get shot in the foot that they're
only 1.24 kilometers if they're a bit
bigger they might still be the center
but this
this is a very small fraction well maybe
there'll be a massive population boom of
people flooding to the area given this
exciting news
i love it though i love i love the
competition between different
centers because there is so much
skullduggery going on
so um you i'm sure you guys will found
the place uh that was rugby
rugby in north also in north dakota so
quite near center probably
um they announced that they were the
center of north america
in 1931 and they put up a stone monument
and they
they used to hold a they might even
still hold a miss geographic center
beauty pageant every year yeah and every
september they have a geographic center
day
which features a mechanical bull and a
basketball tournament for reasons that
are not immediately plain i think
because they're both
quite american things that americans
like to do isn't it
yeah it'd be weird if they had a paella
making competition
and a boomerang throwing competition
[Laughter]
so this place rugby it could be that
when they take into account the fact
that the earth is shaped a little bit
like a rugby bowl
that rugby then becomes the center of
america would that be nice
yeah yeah fingers crossed calling on
mathematicians to force that to be
free so there's another place which is a
in north dakota that also claimed to be
the center of north america called
robinson
and it was the mayor who declared that
it was
the center and specifically a bar that
he owns
uh called hanson's bar was the absolute
center
um quite nicely for he he had this idea
when he was drinking with his buddies
in the bar and his name is bill bender
which is a perfect
uh going on a bender drinking the bill
yeah but um so both of these two towns
rugby and robinson are furious
that uh it's been calculated that center
is in fact the center
yeah although you've got to be
suspicious of the guy who was randomly
drinking with his mates in a bar
and thought let's try and work out where
the center of north america is and it
happened to be the bar they were
drinking it's his bar his
it's this is a complete con designed to
get people to build bender's car
no it's infuriating because there was a
big new york times piece about it
and the new york times because they're
very diligent fact checkers they said
how did you calculate that you are the
exact
center of north america and his his
words were it was trial and error i
can't give you an exact formula
and then he said it was bar room science
that they'd used
um and then when rugby got involved
because bill bender registered his bar
as the legal owner of the phrase
geographical center of north america uh
because rugby had let it lapse in 2009
foolishly they took their eyes off the
ball
and bill bender grabbed it so when rugby
sent a legal letter to him he offered to
fight the mayor of rugby
i don't think he's not reputable enough
to own the center of north america in my
opinion
i think he sounds like a wiley
businessman andy and you're jealous that
you haven't come up with any such idea
to sell your various shows and products
over the years
by the way i looked on wikipedia of
places in america called center
and there are over 15 actual
towns and then there's places where no
one lives at a called center but roughly
15 places that are all called center
all for the exact same reason that they
claim to be the center of
alabama or wherever it is that they are
all except
one which is center in georgia which was
actually named after a man called mr
center
that's the only one it used to be that
in america you would put your
kind of county hall in exactly the
middle of your county because
um they thought it was like more
accessible like for instance
if the parliament in the uk is in london
obviously the people in scotland
have to travel a long way to get there
but if it was exactly in the middle of
the country the idea is it's more
accessible for more people
yeah i think that that is sort of the
only reason to work out where a centre
is isn't it to work out where to put
your seat of government
and then to satisfy weird facts lovers
um there is a problem with being in the
center of america
someone found out there was this massive
problem that was generated
for someone who lives quite near the
center of the u.s in fact
and this is to do with a company called
max mind have you read about this story
about ip addresses okay so it's so weird
basically
uh max mind is this company who about so
just over 10 years ago
started calculating the location of
loads of ip addresses so you know with
your computer you've got an ip address
max mine figured out whereabouts they
all were geographically and then it
could sell that information to companies
like google and facebook and lots of
other people
but often when you're trying to work out
where an ip address is you can't get it
exact
and sometimes it'll just say this is
somewhere in america or somewhere in the
u.s
and so for all of those max mine just
default
assumed that they were in the middle so
they got the coordinates of roughly the
middle of america
and said okay all the ip addresses that
we can't quite place
they just are here and it turns out here
is
a rural farmhouse belonging to someone
called joyce taylor
who now has 600 million ipa dresses
in her farmhouse and it's so it's a
complete disaster because basically if
there's a troll
online or if there's someone who's
hacked your company or if there's
uh someone doing criminal activity
online and the police are tracking them
down
they chase up their ip address and they
constantly find it's at joyce taylor's
farmhouse
and she's just inundated with kind of
abuse and people writing her threatening
letters
and had no idea why for about eight
years she was just like why am i being
oh no what's happening to me
are we definitely discounting the fact
that joyce is like a massive cyber
criminal
is that she's she's a criminal
mastermind
an 82 year old criminal mastermind it's
possible
that's funny oh poor choice um they used
to work out the middle of
america by doing a cardboard cutout of
the whole country and then balancing it
on their finger
and wherever it balanced that's where
the center was isn't that amazing
it seems like is it quite a good method
yeah they got this they got it accurate
to within 20
miles of the current center what did
they do i know that they
they use the exact same method for
countries that have
islands that sit around because they're
obviously apart do they include when
they do the cardboard cutout do they
sort of just slam that onto the end or
do they include the ocean bit
that's difficult isn't it because you
couldn't just slam it onto the side
because
if it's further away from the pivot it's
going to be weighing more but then you
can't attach it because then the thing
you've attached it with weighs something
so that actually sounds like it might be
a slight flaw in the system that's true
the uk i looked up the ordnance survey
website and found out how they
calculate the center and they actually
said
on they say on their website now we
calculate the center of great britain
using the gravitational
method so that is the one you're talking
about that is the cardboard cutout
that's still in use effectively yeah do
they probably do like a simulation of a
cardboard cutter
using a massive supercomputer they don't
go into detail actually which makes me
think it's probably a cardboard cutout
where is the center of the uk it's in
lancashire isn't it yeah
it is it's a place the forest of bowland
oh yeah there's there's one claim that
it's a place called meriden
yeah uh marydon i think is the center of
england because i've been oh it's the
center of england
yes um forest of bowland where my
grandfather i think was born
um it's just enough no it's central
lancashire i think
right but there is in in the meridian uh
one
there is a monument that stands there
it's been there for five hundred years
you can go and visit it i have done that
have you no way
of course i have i was once within 20
miles of the centre of the uk with my
long-suffering wife and said
oh look i've just noticed that somewhere
i could take a photo
and we we drove that extra bit wow
that's really funny
um james have you been to the center of
the eu uh
i don't know where is it oh yeah come on
the odds are astronomical
but basically there's a real problem
with calculating the geographical center
of the eu which is that the membership
of the eu
it changes every few years so it used to
be
in a particular place then it changed in
1986 when spain and portugal joined
then in 1990 germany was reunited and
that shifted it a bit
and so it keeps moving it's just moved
again due to brexit
and also what did you do before brexit
what did you do with the united kingdom
do you just sell a taper onto france or
do you include the bit in between
right i can't remember and in fact i'd
suspect i never bothered to find out
um so where is the center then where's
the current one do you know
actually this i'm now looking at the one
for europe which i think might be
slightly different to the eu but the one
for
europe uh is in lithuania and it's got
five reviews on tripadvisor and
they're all from james saying on my
fifth visit my wife was really pissed
off
sort of ruined the whole experience um
the center of the eu
the news center is going to be or is now
a field in gadheim in germany which
has they've already erected a red and
white pole there and various flags
flying
all around it and in fact they got
really impatient there was an interview
with i think the mayor of nearby area
saying because britain took so long to
figure out when it was leaving the eu
and they're just desperate to announce
themselves as the new middle
they eventually erected a sign saying
future center of the eu
just to prepare people so it wasn't too
much of a shock i was just thinking
right
bear with me if you um if you wanted to
influence
um an election say a brexit election
then you might do a lot of online
work so you might send a load of fake
news and fake adverts and stuff like
that
and what would you need you would need
to find a lot of ip addresses to send
all these things
and who would have all those ip
addresses someone in the center of
europe
and who has a motivation to want brexit
the people who are in the center of
europe
so you're saying it's the farmers of
gadheim who have clubbed together and
swung the election for brexit exactly
what i'm saying it's possible
that's a really good that would be a
great crime thriller
i don't know if it would i don't know if
that's getting made
they'll get the tourist boost though
that's what they count on they think
they'll be flooded but the warning comes
from the previous center that's now been
deposed which was somewhere else called
feston grund
where the local baker there said we
thought chinese buses would be coming
there every week when we became the
center
but it didn't really turn out that way
uh james have you and polina been to the
center of the world
um where is it is it in russia it's in
ohio
oh no i've never been to ohio in america
what's that done
center of the world it was set up by a
sort of eccentric businessman called
randall willmott in 1845
it's when he first moved to this area
and he set up a business there he set he
settled there
some houses were built and he thought to
get the attraction of people and give it
a name
he called it the center of the world uh
which i believe it's still called till
this day
to this day and um he just seems like a
really fun character he before doing
that lived in new york where he had an
establishment called
the beginning of the world so when he
left the beginning of the world he went
to the center of the world
and he was there for a very long time
and then eventually
business dried up and he moved 13 miles
away to courtland in ohio
where he set up a grocery store called
the end of the world
and that was the last thing major thing
that he did so
it's a guy who had in three places the
beginning center and end of the world so
so he's saying that the end of the world
is only 13 miles from the middle of the
world
yes i don't know if those mathematical
calculations are rigorous
as the previous ones this guy sounds
like a distant ancestor of bill bender i
have to say
do you know what the uh the roundest
country of the planet is the roundest
country
i do know that is it ivory coast or
something i don't think you do know oh
it's somewhere no wait is it somewhere
in africa it's not cold
no it's somewhere oh so close
you are so close is it so there are
various different ways of working it out
you can define rectangularity as well
which is how much of a country overlaps
with a rectangle of the same area
and you might be able to get this one
the most rectangular country on the
planet
uh it's very rectangular that's your
clue
is it somewhere like it's libya oh oh
you're so close
uh in that case egypt yes you did
oh with the pyramids that's amazing
yeah well no just amazing that the sort
of national shape
that we know it is the actual shape of
the country well no because the pyramids
are more triangular than square aren't
they
yeah dan what have you seen only half
built pyramids really haven't been
shipped off the site you're not talking
about ziggler
i thought we said i thought we said oh
what did you say she said rectangular i
did
cool it just sounds very similar to
triangle doesn't it
it does they're very similar they are
the same don't they it's amazing those
primary school kids managed to gather
this at all
so any chance the most triangular
country is huge
you've got to look into it i'll get back
to you guys
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the focus hi
everyone we'd like to let you know
that this week we are sponsored by
hellofresh
yes hellofresh is a company and a
service that
sends you fabulous meals in the post but
not
it's not like getting a ready meal
through the post which is cooked you get
to cook it at home
following very simple delicious
instructions
yes so for instance andy have you ever
wanted to sample prince harry's chicken
pie
don't be disgusting james i'm not being
disgusted oh sorry
yes of course i have that is one of the
options
in this week's hellofresh and i googled
it and apparently it's because chicken
pie
is one of prince harry's favorite
suppers to have that's great
if you fancy that or or meghan markle's
broccoli for catcher then
hello friendship for you so it's really
easy to
cook as in the recipe cards make it
super simple but they're also delicious
nice meals and they suit every style you
know there's vegetarian options
there are rapid options which take only
20 minutes to cook yeah it basically
takes all the stress
out of cooking your dinner doesn't it
it's like yeah you don't have to go to
the supermarket you don't have to plan
your meals
you just get the box and you cook and if
you want to get 50
off your first hellofresh recipe box and
35
of your next three then use the code a
fish
when you go to hellofresh.com.uk that is
right just go to hellofresh
dot co dot uk and put in the off code a
fish to get as james says 50
off the first box and 35 off the next
three okay
i'm with the podcast on with the show
okay it's time for fact number two and
that is
james okay my fact this week is that the
modern da handle
was invented by ludwig wittgenstein
now
i mean he was quite recent yeah he was
more recent than doors
yeah i thought no one no one could get
through doors until he gave a lug
they were just walls just empty houses
but
when you say the modern door handle this
is what fascinates me
because it's as though there was a kind
of archaic bad door handle and then he
fixed it well that's kind of what
happened
so wittgenstein philosopher mid 20th
century
uh very well renowned pupil of bertrand
russell
and kind of influenced pretty much
everyone who came after him
but also inventor of door handles
because i read this in a in an article
about door handles
in apollo art magazine and wittgenstein
was working as a school teacher
and he'd hit one of the kids because
they'd upset him
and he'd had to kind of be taken out of
the school and be suspended and stuff
like that
i think he got fired actually and so he
kind of was sat around
feeling sorry for himself didn't have
anything to do but he came from an
extremely rich family
and his sister gretel decided to
distract him from everything by
commissioning him
to design the interior of a new house
that she bought
and he was extremely distracted by this
because it took him
a year to design the door handle alone
it took him two years
to design the radiators but what he came
up with was a really
modern kind of i want to say like
minimalistic
kind of design of a house and the door
handle which he invented
was kind of short coming out of the door
and then
a long straight bit with a little kink
in it
if that's it's not a great explanation
but that's basically yeah yeah
if you look at a door handle now most of
them will be that kind of design
and until then it was more kind of knobs
or it was straight
handles or stuff like that so all future
door handles were kind of influenced by
this one that was invented by
wittgenstein
in much the same way as all future
philosophical thought
was influenced by him too i wonder how
much that was seen
you know like he probably was asked to
do a lot of talks in the way that we
have like ted talks now
and he'd always email back or write back
the time going
do you want the philosophical chat or
the uh door handle
lecture i've got both ready i think it
was probably he'd be giving a talk and
there'd be questions and answers at the
end
and everyone only wanted to ask about
the door handle i bet every time he'd be
like come on guys
talk to me about my philosophies um
it sounds really different to the house
you grew up in so
as james said it's a very minimalist
place this uh place in vienna
but the house he grew up in was he grew
up in a palace this was how wealthy his
family were
so the four court had sculptures in it
by uh rodin
and there was someone who was employed
in the house for the sole purpose of
bowing to visitors
that's what i read soul purpose wow i
know
it had seven pianos this house um it had
an organ built in
had a fountain inside it well they did
have
i think they had the largest private
fortune in europe possibly
didn't know the wittgenstein really they
were loaded
yeah so but he was really trying to
simplify when he designed this new house
you know against the kind of
incredibly opulent vietnamese i never
thought of it that way about his
previous house because when he moved to
trinity college
after he became a famous philosopher his
rooms were completely devoid of
furniture he had no furniture in them
and when he left cambridge he became an
assistant gardener at an austrian
monastery and slept in a potting shed
so maybe he was just trying to escape
from that opulence
yeah yeah well he gave all his money
away as well didn't he
he uh he inherited a lot and he's he
just gave it to his brothers and sister
and should have money the kid he was
hitting at school which got him sacked
from the job
well to be honest later on when he kind
of had a bit of severe introspection
um after the war he kind of went to live
in norway
and he did a lot of confessions so
anything that happened to him
previously in life which he felt bad
about he went to those people
and apologized for those things and he
apologized to to this
um at least to one of the children whose
ears he had pulled
did he yeah uh it was she he was the
original
the original my name is ill is that what
that is oh yeah you guys remember my
name is ill right
yeah sap tv series about that guy who
committed loads of crimes and then spent
his life going back apologizing to them
well it sounds like that's exactly what
pikmin said i think it's based on this
sounds like my name is ludwig
wittgenstein
my father is a girl
um one of the reasons he became a
teacher was that he essentially gave up
on philosophy didn't he he wrote in
he wrote this thing called trachtarchus
logico philosophicus
and it's a series of numbered bullet
points
it's not a well it's a tough read i
would say it's a dense read
tried to get through some of it he was
very a man after our own hearts because
it opened with things like the world
divides into facts
the world is the totality of facts the
world is determined by facts the facts
in logical space are the world
he sort of should be our mascot wow but
then he
he wrote this thing uh with some
impenetrable bullet points in it
and then he believed that tract artists
have cleared up all the confusions that
had tormented philosophy until that
point
and so he decided it was never necessary
to write again and that was when he
disappeared off to the alps after the
first world war he was like i've solved
philosophy
yes yeah now open his doors
[Laughter]
you're welcome although then he decided
against that and i think went back to it
by 1929 and wrote his other
great work so he he initially studied at
cambridge uh as james said under
bertrand russell and uh when he arrived
there
he he seemed like a bit of a cocky dick
when it came to
uh philosophies like as in i'm surprised
russell
didn't go get out of here at some of the
stuff he did i read an obituary that
russell
wrote about him and he describes his
first encounter and he says he
maintained for example
at one time that all existential
propositions are meaningless
this was in a lecture room and i invited
him to consider the proposition
there is no hippopotamus in this room at
present
when he refused to believe this i looked
under all the desks without finding one
but he remained
unconvinced i mean if i tried pull that
on you guys
you'd kick me out of the room right like
it was do you remember that time you
tried to convince us that triangles and
rectangles were the same thing
uh that's true i've still got a job yeah
maybe
um isn't there a story about
wittgenstein and
russell i might be wrong about this
because i haven't written it down but
did he not go to cambridge
and russell said tell me why i should
take you on as a student
and he gave him a piece of paper with
one sentence or one word written on it
or something
and russell looked at it and then kind
of threw it away but
gave him the job based on that and we no
one knows what was on that piece of
paper i think that's true wow
that's that's the story yeah
door handle or something
yeah that is the story i don't know if
it's apocryphal but uh sounds it does
yeah
he had such a full life it's amazing i
mean he fought in the first world war
which we haven't even mentioned um as
i guess loads of men of that age had
done he also had been an engineer before
being a philosopher
so he built an aeronautical engine um
which actually proved useful when
helicopters were being designed later on
as in this is a really really really
full life he had
yeah and he was a genius but he's
basically the philosopher's philosopher
isn't he like all other philosophers
said this is the smartest guy you've
ever met
guys so maybe he was justified in that
arrogance but he
in his lectures he used to throw
students out when they didn't
insult him basically so he if students
didn't ask him pertinent questions
or lay into him about his arguments he'd
kick them out of the lectures and at one
point there was just one person left in
his lecture at the end because he kicked
everyone else out for being too stupid
and accepting wow and that was actually
a guy called francis skinner
with whom he planned to emigrate to the
soviet union in 1934 he wanted to become
a manual laborer
what and he in fact visited the soviet
union to kind of do a recce of it
and be like is this place good for
manual labor and he came back and
decided against it
as i think you would if you were
considering manual labor in the ussr in
1934
there's another reason why he was a man
after our own hearts i think
um because one of his famous things that
he wrote was
if a lion could speak we would not be
able to understand him
and what he means by that basically is
that you can translate one human
language to another human language and
that's fine because we've all had the
same kind of life we all have the same
experiences
we all feel the same we all smell the
same we all see the same
and so it's easy to translate those
words to other words
but with lions we just do not know what
it's like being a lion
and if they could tell us stuff we just
wouldn't understand a single thing they
were saying and it was a point he was
making about language
um but it's the point that i always make
that a lion doesn't even know it's a
lion
don't try and pass yourself off as the
heir to the greatest philosopher of the
20th century
we see we see you
[Laughter]
can we talk a bit about his family as
well so i'm sure you guys came across
this book the house of wickenstein which
is
a book about the entire clan uh and it
sounds
insane i mean the book sounds remarkable
but the family also
they were dreadfully unhappy as people
so
he was one of five brothers three of
whom took their own lives and the other
two of whom
seriously considered it so the two
brothers who
who didn't were ludwig and paul and um
paul was an amazing he was a pianist uh
who lost an arm during the first world
war but stayed
as a pianist um a one-armed pianist and
he commissioned
one-handed works from lots and lots of
composers so strauss
prokofiev britain ravel which could have
been a really nice tool
for other pianists with one arm but he
declined permission to other one-armed
pianists to actually play the pieces
this is the worst thing
even if he couldn't play them himself
because he found them difficult
he would not let other people have a go
he wrote back to prokofiev
thank you for your concerto but i do not
understand a single note and i shall not
play it
i mean but he was because they came from
a rich family they were all kind of
spoiled brats in a way
except that constein who it seems issued
all that so paul
eventually had to flee to america
because he'd impregnated this woman
uh in their first piano lesson in fact
that he was giving her and so he fled to
america sorry during the first piano
lesson he got her pregnant he should
have been just practicing his fingering
[Laughter]
so he played the piano differently then
i had so many piano lessons did you get
pregnant
why didn't he um
so he impregnated this student fled to
america
and he didn't have a ballot once he was
in america which he wasn't usually
didn't have to live without that so for
instance he was staying in a hotel
and he just uh took off all his clothes
and left them outside the door of the
hotel
assuming that a valet would come and
wash them and return them to him and
they all got stolen
and so wait surely outside the door of
his room not outside the door of the
hotel he's outside the door of his room
can i also say if he decided he wanted
to get his clothes washed by a hotel
every single time then he would have
lost the entire family fortune
in about three weeks if your experience
is anything to go by
yeah look let's not go let's not revisit
my hotel bill from our us talk last year
uh it is a great way to lose your entire
sole reason the tour lost money
um but he sat around wearing bed sheets
he just wore a sheet over himself until
someone eventually
sort of heard about it and said got me
to be your pa because it seems you don't
know how to live in the world
and she was hired and there was another
anecdote about
him walking out into the street and
someone had given him a hat
and he was wearing the hat but it was
still attached to its hat box
because he didn't know i guess how to
put on his own hat
wow that is posh uh what about gretel we
mentioned her earliest who was the
person who bought the house which
wittgenstein
um designed um she found it by following
a trail of sweets to the door didn't she
so gretel was the subject of a portrait
by gustav klimt
and you know klimt one of the greatest
artists of the early 20th century
uh but she just hated it and so she just
kept it in erratic
i mean you know fancy having your
portrait drawn by clint and then just
thinking that i don't like it very much
have we have we is it out of the asic
yet do we know what it's like maybe
he was having a really bad day no it's
good i think it's good i mean she has
quite a long neck in it
but you know that might be
not madeliani long it's just like it's
slightly longer than a normal person's
neck she's still
she's still fitting into onto the canvas
right she's like yeah
it's not such a long neck that she had
to chop off the top of her head
she had to chop up the hat box at the
top
[Laughter]
she wasn't very nice i don't think well
she was a bit of a nazi wasn't she in
fact both her sisters were a bit
had nazi tendencies and in fact sided
with the fascists
against paul uh and gave away a lot of
their fortune to the nazis
and they all kind of hated each other
the siblings they ended up variously
estranged from each other
as well as all sort of committing
suicide okay so we start family there
was a lot of
uh obviously there was a lot of nazism
about at the time ludwig was actually a
classmate of adolf hitler's
no no yeah was he wow he was they were
at the same age and they were at the
same school but
wittgenstein was put forward a year and
hitler was taken back a year
ah dodged a bullet so hitler was taken
back a year
yeah yeah wow so they ended up two years
apart yeah exactly even though they're
so they probably wouldn't have known
each other well they knew each other
there was a small school
small schools oh okay that's
embarrassing for hitler that's like don
jolly and osama bin laden
yeah they were at the same time sorry
dom charlie and somebody went to the
same school
yeah they went to the same school i can
see that you're kind of putting osama
bin laden and hitler in the same bracket
but don jolly and loving witkenstein i'm
not
i mean he's a great comedian but trigger
happy tv
is the track tartus logico esophagus of
its day
in my opinion he was another one who um
recorded when he masturbated
oh good now we've thinking about this
before i think
but yeah who who did we mention had done
it in a previous episode
was it hook robert yes that's it
um but wittgenstein continued that
tradition and he wrote in his diary
during world war one he would write in
his diary when he'd masturbated
and actually this is a i couldn't find a
verification of this except in the slav
or zizek book but i think we trust him
and he said that wittgenstein used to
get annoyed
because his fantasies while he was
masturbating kept on being plagued by
maths problems
and he found this very annoying
distraction because i think i think it's
a problem that we've all
he wouldn't be the first person to be
thinking about an ex
very strong wonderful
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
andy my fact is that in 1801 england had
a celebrity ox which had its own coach
and horses
yeah so um this is from a great book
called jane austen's country life by
deirdre lafaye
which is all about life in rural england
in the early 19th century
um and there was this ox which had been
bred
by a man called charles colling of
captain hall uh in durham
and um it was known as the captain knox
at first and it was renamed so it became
the duramax and um colin was interested
in cattle breeding and he was one of the
pioneers of breeding animals to make
them really really big
and the duramox was a
huge success and i mean that in every
sense um
it was reported as being between 170
stone
and 270 stone stones weren't
standardized at the time but it was
well over a thousand kilos this uh this
bull
and um it's about four times the size of
a modern cow basically
it was really big it was impressive it
sounds impressive because cows are big
already
they're quite big yeah that was it's
interesting because now there's a lot of
pressure on celebrities
to lose weight but it sounds like back
in the day there was a lot of pressure
on celebrities to be
as heavy as possible that's very
something that's changed
as well as the fact that celebrities
have cows
can i just say a fact about a celebrity
animal because i was gonna do this as my
fact next week but i think i'll say it
now anyway to see what happens
in the third series of french big
brother
uh one of the housemates was a dog
really and it was a dog called
and part of the rules were you had to
have a secret
and all the other housemates had to work
out what your secret was
and society's secret was that he once
run for the mayor of marseille
did he spill it on
[Laughter]
did they have to work out what the
secret was did you say yeah they had to
work out each other's
secrets that is absolutely impossible to
work out
from what the dog's giving i know what
you mean
but saucy's the dog doesn't really have
an ability to
form complex thoughts so he's also at a
disadvantage
well it's like vic ernesto instead he
said if cersei's the dog could talk we
wouldn't understand his platform to be
the mayor of marseilles
sorry andy we should talk about the arts
sorry no actually genuinely i
i'm quite interested in talking about
sausages
where did he place where did he place in
the i think in the final i can't
remember
i haven't done the research on it
because it isn't one of my facts yet
yeah
yeah yeah um so anyway this
now comparatively dull ox which never as
far as i can tell ran for elected office
anywhere
lazy um but it was it was bought by a
man called john day
for a couple of hundred quid and um it
had a special carriage
uh and it was pulled around by four
horses it toured england and scotland
for
five years it played 200 different
venues across the uk
amazing many more gigs than we have done
as a podcast put it there
yeah it played international gigs as
well it played madison square garden
yeah which i did italy played
okay so a couple of weeks ago oh my god
i've mixed up my famous celebrity oxes
uh yeah it was a different ox very sorry
back out on that one
okay i can't wait to hear about this
other celebrity
that's a spoiler for later in the show
yeah
um it wasn't just size that it was
renowned for
you can't just be big it was also
symmetry
apparently they're the two attributes if
you look at news articles from the time
it's always about its size and its
symmetry
so you have to be you have to be
balanced on each side
and it was uh bulls would be advertised
as having been
sired by the dura marks wouldn't they
and there was sort of like a type of ox
that was called duramax after this
he was so famous that he became his own
breed i suppose well do you know about
the breeding of
his parentage it's please tell us it's
very incest heavy
this honestly makes game of thrones look
like rosie and jim so
there was a bill called favorite who was
bred with his own mother
his mother was called phoenix they
produced a cow who was called young
phoenix
so favorite had been bred with his own
mum to produce his daughter
sister young phoenix but then favorite
was bred with his own daughter
sister young phoenix to produce the
durham ox
so as far as i can tell that duramax's
dad was his grandfather and his mum was
his half-sister
yeah or you could say that young phoenix
was simultaneously favorite's daughter
sister and sexual partner oh boy nice
well it saves on giving presents at
christmas time doesn't it
what are you gonna get your daughter
sister mama and sexual partner
probably just get her a necklace it
works the inbreeding i mean if you if
what you're going for is
massive cow then it did well you didn't
want to get any genes involved that were
inferior
and i think it was pioneered first by a
guy called robert bakewell who was this
massive uh
guy in the agricultural revolution who
sort of made all his
cows chag each other within their own
families
and he revolutionized selective breeding
really and darwin cited him quite a lot
and he was incredible at building cows
to the ideal
size and shape um the duramax has an
entire town in australia named after it
it's called thermox it's got 74 people
living there and um
i went on the australia's guide website
which says there is one thing to do
within 20 kilometers
and that thing is a jumper shop so
that is quiet say a jumper shop yes in a
shop that sells jumpers sorry yeah
that's the jumper shop is the nearest
local attraction um
but it's the safest place to live in the
state of victoria
so okay in 2015 new the news reported
that there had been just seven crimes in
five years
wow okay this is how it broke down 2014.
it was no jumper theft as well as i can
tell um
2014 there was an arson thing okay
that's quite a serious crime
2013 no crimes 2012
no crimes 2011. there was one
drug offense but in 2010 there was an
abduction
there was arson that was a weapon and
explosives offense and there were two
counts of disorderly and offensive
conduct
it sounds like the biggest year in
durham's history ever
but wait was was that all one event kind
of like this is my sister lover
didn't mention any incest related crimes
[Laughter]
there is um do you know what the second
most safe place in
victoria is no i thought
this is brilliant so this is a place
called speed
okay so again they've had very very few
crimes it's very small place
um but one thing that they did used to
have a problem with was
speeding because um when when you drive
into speed it's on a main road
there's a big sign that says welcome to
speed
and people took that as an invitation
and would start going really fast in the
town
and so in 2011 the residents of speed
started a campaign to get the name of
the town changed to speed
kills and they got 32 000 likes on
facebook to try and get their
name changed and they in the end they
renamed the town for one month to speed
kills
and as part of the campaign as part of
the campaign there was a local farmer
called phil down
and he changed his name to phil slowdown
no that's the second safest place in
victoria
um durham ox had a sort of quite sad
end in a way well it died yeah yeah
so it dislocated um its hip uh while
being led out of the carriage the famous
carriage that we've spoken about
while in oxford and it had to be
slaughtered two months later but
day ever the showman turned that into an
event itself
and i believe correct me if i'm wrong
guys there was an autopsy which was sort
of shown to the public
on the day uh that it had died and
i think they might have shown you might
be able to buy a ticket to watch it
die basically to watch it die yeah but
then it was
yeah and then it was chopped up and part
of the merch stand
that he set up was selling off cuts of
the durham ox yeah
i don't think that's called when you go
to a butcher i don't think you say you
know can you go to merch stand over
there
it's not branded well it could be
branded if it's
yeah yeah okay um i found another famous
ox actually a couple of famous oxes and
this was over in america
there was two oxen called mount catardin
and a granger named after the two
biggest things
sorry does anyone else feel a madison
square
i'm really excited to know what kind of
venue they might have made
so they were named after the two largest
items in maine at the time that's where
they got their names from
and um they were humongous they were
supposedly i can't find anything to uh
contradict this the biggest and tallest
oxen respectively that the world has
ever seen
so mount katardin weighed two and a half
tons
so they they were tall they were wide
and
they were celebrities and they went
around and they did a lot of gigs and
eventually
they played madison square garden
yeah yeah madison square garden
which um a couple of weeks ago when
sarah was here sarah pascoe
that um or you said i think that
was it emmeline pankhurst played madison
and she had a crowd of 3 000
a 19 000 seater stadium do you know
how many people went to see the um
actually i assumed that it was the
current madison square garden with the
ginormous
18 000 capacity but actually it turns
out that it's been rebuilt a few times
and she actually played the second
iteration of the madison square garden
which had a capacity of 8 000 people so
she still was kind of suffering in the
sales department she only sold 3 000
that's less than 50
but it's not as great a discrepancy as
eighteen thousand
uh so yeah so apologies to all the
people on twitter who pointed this out
very very sorry um but this is the very
same madison square garden madison
square garden two
where these two giant oxen played in
1906.
they must have somewhere a you know how
some venues
uh in the uk have a like a book for all
the acts that play there to sign
yeah presumably somewhere in the
basement of madison square gardens there
is a book which has got the signature of
emily pankhurst and
a footprint of a giant box
how cool yeah we can only assume we
haven't actually said what knox is
oh it's a it's a castrated male cow um
but and they they used to be really
popular uh for farming and they used to
be way more popular as draft animals
pulling plows and things uh than horses
um but there were a few disadvantages
and gradually they they went out of
fashion a bit slower and a bit less
versatile
one of the problems is you can't change
their shoes like you can a horse
so horses stand on all four legs um
and when you want to change the shoe you
can the horse can stand on three legs
it can cope with that um and you can
change the shoe and then you put that
down and you change the other shoes
oxen can't do that they can't stand on
three legs so to put shoes on an ox
which is necessary if you're farming
with them what you have to do
is you have to push it over onto the
ground
and then you have to have a basically a
massive fork
to gently hold it in place by the neck
and then you tie its feet together so
you don't get
gourd a pitchfork like what a big girl
put a in its neck
around its neck oh it's gone either side
so it's like that
kind of comment it's like in action
films when someone always has a
pitchfork kind of thrown at them and it
lands on either side of their neck does
it look exactly like that oh yeah i like
it
in an action yeah that in die hard i'm
not sure
i don't really remember it it's in one
of the sequels
um but so that's one method and then
that's pretty hardcore you have to be
pretty brave do that the alternate
method
is to use a thing called an ox sling
which is this massive framework of beams
and you get the oxen to walk in
and then you just lift it up off the
ground and you have it hovering in the
air
and then you have to fit the shoes like
that so you can see where they went out
of fashion
yeah fun for the orcs though the sling
one i prefer that to the lying on your
back with the pitchfork around your neck
and your legs tied together
if you had the choice next time you're
in clarks and buy some new shoes
this is like die hard
[Music]
okay it's time for our final fact of the
show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that the world's
least frequently published newspaper
is released once every four years on
leap day the print edition
costs 4 euro 70 or you can subscribe to
it for 100 euros per century
that's a cool subscription yeah um so
this is
labuji dusaper which is a satirical
newspaper that began in 1980
two friends decided that they wanted to
do this as a thing and they made it a
reality so the title
translates as the sappers candle and
it's a reference to a cartoon character
who was called the supper camembert and
he was born on the 29th of february he
joined the army just as he'd celebrated
his fourth birthday
that's the reference to the title but
yeah it's a it's a wonderful newspaper
that is still going
to this day and it has a huge readership
that just keeps growing and growing and
lots of lovely little in-jokes they have
a last minute section that they managed
to squeeze in
you know late news into it sometimes
obviously if you've done the crossword
you've got to wait four years
for the answers to appear um and
sometimes
they make the decision not to publish it
until eight years later the answers and
just keep people hanging
so yeah they're really fun these guys i
was surprised that they
had that you get that subscription
because there was an interview with the
editor in 2012 who said he had
considered offering subscriptions
but it would be too difficult to find
people because the likelihood is they
would have moved house between
publication dates
so he's obviously got a better way of
tracking his his um
well it's a good way it's a good way of
getting 100 euros out of people
they had a sunday supplement in 2004 and
the next one is going to be in 2032.
so they kind of like do a kind of each
day of the week thing which is quite
cool i think that's really good and
they're not working on this full time
are they but they can't be
no they don't want to once say every
four years they kind of meet up in a um
in a restaurant i think in paris and
drink champagne and kind of come up with
what funny ideas they're going to put
into it
brilliant that's so good yeah but the
the editor the current editor has been
working on it for
you know over a decade at least and
certainly it's been the editor for
about three issues or so so it's got you
know stable staff
which is good and it has does have a
print run i think this year of
200 000 which is not to say that's the
number that we'll sell
but that's his print run so it's got big
tickets on itself
yeah yeah um there's some interesting
stories in this week in this um
not this week's this what do you say
quadrennial
edition uh they talk about brexit of
course there is
a interview with cedric villani the
mathematician con merrell candidate
there is
and story about maurice um the cockerel
do you remember this so they're
basically talking about all the things
that happened over the last four years
and one of them was maurice the cockerel
who became really famous
because um people were complaining that
he was cockrelling too loud
and the people who lived in the
countryside said well
this is what the countryside sounds like
so if you don't like it go back to paris
kind of thing
and they came up with a law basically
protecting the sound of the french
countryside
i'm sure you guys remember that story
but um i found out that
since the magazine came out maurice died
he died in june
is there any merch that we can get hold
of maurice it's maybe maybe a breast or
a leg
[Laughter]
he actually um he died in may uh but it
was announced in june
because the owner said that what with
lockdown people already had enough to
worry about
without having to think about maurice
the cockrell's death
right that just would have been the
cherry on the icing wouldn't it
damn you 2020
[Laughter]
um so i was looking into some other uh
interesting
or innovative newspapers and i don't
think we've ever said this
quite a few newspapers used to have
space that you could add your own news
in
okay this is so cool so the first ever
evening paper was launched in 1696
by a guy called ichabod dorks and um
such a good name d-a-w-k
not uh d-o-r-k great either way what a
name
and it's called dork's newsletter was
the name of it
um and basically there was just space so
that the buyer uh
who might be the the grosser or it might
be the individual but you could
write your own news in you could or you
could say hello to an individual
subscriber but it's amazing
the only docs are going to be bothered
to do that right
wait but what do you mean you could
write a message to a subscriber so who
was
who was allowed to write the news in the
blank bit i think the book anyone is but
if you're the let's say it's the local
news agent you could say
hello mr jenkins thought you might like
to know that murray's the cockrell is
dead
uh waited to tell you until now because
you would have been set
and then you could add that or as even
as the end user of the newspaper you can
also write in it and then hand it over
to your wife saying
uh i've made you some nice pie if you
write it
i was reading about it's now online it's
called the antarctic
sun uh but that used to be a paper that
was published
um for people who lived the scientists
who live in antarctica
and it'd be sent around to them all and
it would cover
sort of relevant news to them as opposed
to news from the rest of the world
so is there a weather report
i'm getting very slightly warmer but um
before them before they existed there
was another paper which was called the
mcmurdo news
the sort of predecessor to them and that
was then followed
by the mcmurdo sometimes because
the publishing schedule was so erratic
that they couldn't promise that it would
always be
consistent and that lasted from 1960 to
1980
uh as a as a paper i love although did
you know that mcmurdo sometimes
changed its name halfway through to the
mcmurdo sometimes explain that
it was the murdo sometimes in 1960 but
it was spelled s-o-m-e-t-i-m-e-z
and then for some reason in 1972 they
decided to change the name to spell the
word sometimes correctly that's great
maybe they got a publisher without a
sense of humor bizarre
um the latest article in the what is now
the antarctic sun did you see what it
was about
no well this i think andy might want to
subscribe maybe move to antarctica
because it was called
masses of mosses it was about
the moss that's taking over antarctica
get me on a plane
brilliant i imagine that's probably also
covered in the darks time zone whatever
it was
and as soon as you said that i thought
which which thing am i going to be
slammed for

going to be funicular railways it's
going to be one of the other things i
developed and i'd like to crush on
over the last six years and did you
manage by the time i did the big reveal
did you manage to have worked out which
was more likely to exist in antarctica i
[Laughter]

hi everyone james here now before we
start this week's show just a couple of
bits of business
first of all this episode was recorded
while
anna was still away and so her place has
been taken by one of my
oldest friends the absolute genius that
is jenny
ryan now if you're a fan of quiz shows
you would know her as the vixen of the
chase
if you're a fan of singing talent shows
you might remember her from celebrity
x factor last year where she got to the
final if you're a fan of podcasts which
i know you are you might know her from
fingers
on buzzers the brilliant quiz based
podcast that jenny does with comedian
lucy porter and actually if you go into
the back catalogue
of fingers on buzzers you might find an
old episode
with myself and anna tashinsky on if you
are missing her so much that you really
need to hear her dulcet tones
one more thing we will be doing a live
show quite soon
the live show will take place on the
27th of september
it will be at the london podcast
festival and actually
all tickets are sold out but you will be
able to watch it online
so if you go to qi.com fish events
you'll be able to see exactly how to do
that and
this is very exciting it doesn't even
matter
if you're in the uk if you are in
america
if you're in australia if you're in
sierra leone if you're in tuvalu
you can still log on and watch us do our
thing
live from london now one of the problems
with watching live
comedy from the uk if you do live in
tuvalu
is the time difference but luckily the
people at the podcast festival have
thought
all about that and so the show will be
available online for 72
hours after the end so if you can't get
there in person
if you can't be online at the time you
can still watch this show
and for all other details go to qi.com
fish events okay on with the podcast
[Applause]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
is dan schreiber i'm sitting here
with andrew hunter murray james harkin
and special guest
jenny ryan and once again we have
gathered around our microphones with our
four favorite facts from the last seven
days
and in a particular order here we go
starting with you
jenny here we go trigger warning for
grossness
um one theory of the origin of the
nursery rhyme pussycat pussycat
is that it's a reference to queen anne's
poor personal hygiene
and an accumulation of grime that once
fellow to burst skirt
during a service at st paul's cathedral
oh
wow wow okay where to start with that
one okay well
let's start with the um with the actual
nursery rhyme because
not everyone might know it right so how
does it go andy why don't you
regale us with that oh it's um please
you can't persecute where have you been
i've been up to london to look at the
queen
followed by loads more lines uh
that's actually the important bit now i
think that is the important thing yeah
yeah so it's it's thought that that
little
mouse is a mouse-shaped deposit
of all sorts of things that might
accumulate
in a time when nobody really had a bath
or washed their nethers um
so supposedly this uh this particular
lump was known as a soutakin although
that may be a more modern name
for them because they resembled
little mice and people would have to go
and sweep them
up off the weights and hang on are you
saying that the tv series and
sweep has anything to do
with this no okay
great well i can my childhood is intact
i will i'll link them up somehow right
so um the word sutterkins does exist
it was it comes from the dutch uh
it was kind of a joke about dutch women
supposedly
they would put heaters up their dresses
to keep warm and some people thought
that by doing so they were breeding a
small
animal up there and that the animal
would kind of drop out
and they would find this thing and the
word
came from um the word sut it's similar
to the word sot
as in the stuff you get enough chimney
uh and of course suti and sweep is a pun
on the fact that chimney sweeps would
also find such so they are linked in a
way andy if that's what you oh
great okay no my childhood is ruined
thank you very much yeah brilliant
um what kind of person was running so
low on inspiration for nursery rhymes
that when they saw
a mess-shaped mouse fall out of the
queens
that they thought this is perfect for
kids well i think
what we should say is that most um
explanations for nursery rhymes
are speculative at best and
there was a couple called iona and peter
opie who wrote
the oxford dictionary of nursery rhymes
and they basically came to the
conclusion that all of these things
that people think probably not true and
also
that they might just be kind of nice
words
that kind of sound like a good poem and
there might not be any reasoning
behind them all so whether that's true
or whether it's not i don't know
but the other thing is that queen anne
had quite a lot of enemies right so
it's possible that if this is true this
origin
that it was people trying to say bad
things about her and
you know oh yeah it was basically gossip
wasn't it the the nursery rhymes you've
had
a way of spreading anything is to make
it into a little folk song
and get it spreading around the streets
of london weirdly this is not the only
nursery rhyme that queen anne is
supposedly involved with
really yeah there's another one okay so
do you remember the warming pan baby
no so um ann
when she wasn't queen yet she was in
line to the throne and so was her older
sister mary
um and their dad was james ii uh who was
king
and in 1688 james ii
had a son a baby boy with his new wife
which displaced
mary and am from the line of succession
so they were kind of
lowered down the rung now um and anne
was furious about this she refused to
attend the birth
and there was a rumor spread that the
baby
had not been born alive it had a bit of
a miscarriage and actually a live baby
had been smuggled into the bedroom
in a warming pan which were these big
sort of brass pans that you would put
hot coals in to warm up the bed
right that's the story okay or is that
also
untrue but we might get the nursery
rhyme
rocker by baby from
that child really yeah and what's the
explanation behind it
it's incredibly serious okay
about how you thought that someone might
swap the baby isn't that why
and i'm gonna get this wrong but isn't
their home secretary supposed to be at
every birth
is it an album every royal birth not
everywhere
it might not be the whole secretary no
it is it is it is the home secretary
yeah who's the current home secretary
pretty patel oh man
imagine if she had to go around to every
single birth in the country
but she would be saying get back in
there get back in there don't want you
don't want you
go on back up you go
[Laughter]
i love that idea that you would sort of
shame people in history via
children telling rhymes we don't do that
so much these days like that would be
that'd be an incredible satirical kids
program where it's just us
shaming politicians and so on with new
songs that we put out it seems there was
a stop a nursery rhyme when i was a kid
which was called maggie thatcher's
sticker in the bin so
in a way it still does continue that
there will be they're probably seeing
boris johnson stick you in the bin now
it'll be any prime minister um
maggie thatcher sticker in the bin put
the lid on seller tapering
and i remember when um when she actually
resigned as prime minister they came in
and told us in the classroom
and we all sang it really wow
eight we had also maggie thatcher milk
snatcher kind of
a little rhyme about that didn't we oh
yeah hey just very quickly for
international listeners and i
included myself slightly in this because
i'm not okay with uh the british
monarchy's history but queen anne um was
a queen
from her birthday it was 1665 to 1714.
and there's not really been much about
her she's she's not one of the more
popular
people for pop culture except for the
fact that she had the movie the favorite
which was a fairly recent one which
olivia coleman won the oscar for the
portrayal of her
but outside of that she kind of slips
through the cracks a bit in terms of
uh people's knowledge about her and the
only stuff that really comes through is
all this quite shaming sort of
information about her people
attacking her for her looks and her
hygiene and
all the accounts of her body size and
so on it was claimed that when she
passed away
14 men had to carry her uh for her
burial
and i don't know if this stuff is true i
don't know if this is part of the
shaming of her
but that's kind of what we know about
it's 100 true that she did have health
problems
and that she was she was definitely a
large lady
she had a lot of gout she really
struggled with that
um but there was definitely also a lot
of um
she had a lot of enemies um for instance
this thing at
st paul's cathedral it was a
thanksgiving ceremony after
the war they just finished a war with
either france or spain
spanish succession wasn't it spanish
succession yeah i
trust you to know that jen i'll probably
just throw out some half-remembered
facts and then you can just fill in the
gaps today maybe
um but they both they built stands along
the side of the strand and they had 4
000 children singing patriotic songs
while they walked down to
saint paul's cathedral but a lot of
people weren't really happy with it
because they thought that queen anne was
secretly trying to
get the jacobites back onto the english
throne and that she was kind of slightly
sympathetic to the catholics uh and so
there was i mean it was a real
kind of time where the monarchy was
losing a lot of its power and
parliament was kind of coming in i think
that's why we don't hear much about her
it got called the age of party um wow
that sounds cool
well yeah it was unfortunately it was
the age of the wigs and the tories as
opposed to everyone having a good time i
was thinking
it was a gatsby style
[Laughter]
poor time travelers who read that
sentence go let's go
everybody stank and there were no
parties right
no three rhymes yeah let's do it
okay now that there always seems to be
james has mentioned this there's a lot
of debunked stories
about the origins of nursery rhymes and
i'm sure that some of them
have been retconned into the the nursery
rhymes themselves
i mean there's there's the grand old
duke of york is clearly about a failed
military campaign but there is about a
dozen different
ideas of who it's talking about um who's
the current duke of york
uh oh i don't remember um
anyway pop goes the weasel i really like
that one
i love people that one actually is about
prince andrew yeah
um no one really knows what it means
what pop goes away
there's a lot of cockney rhyming slang
in there though and references to the
city road
and the eagle on the zero which is
actually still there the pub
it is and it has like a side on the side
of the building doesn't it with the
nursery rhyme on it um but yeah yeah so
weasel could be
your weasel and stoke your throat so
it's like ah
get it down your weasel mate when you
give someone a pint
of beer get it down your weasel or
your weasel uh could be a coat so
there's an idea that it's about putting
your coat into the pawn shop
to to pay off you know all your debts
and
anytime a new expense comes in pop goes
louise ah there goes your coat again
yeah so um yeah it's it's it's a really
good cockney knees up but what i really
like about it is in the 1850s
it was like a dance craze pop goes the
weasel
so if you were a time traveler and you
wanted to find a real good party then
you want to go to 1850s london
because you're gonna know the dance
you're gonna absolutely smash it
you can go into your music hall and you
just dance around and then at the end of
it
everyone shouts out pop goes the weasel
and that's kind of the big sort of
ending of every verse and it was
absolutely massive
um baby shark of its day so adults were
doing this
adults were doing it yeah it was um
there was an advertisement in the bath
chronicle in 1853
um that offered instruction to the
highly fashionable dance of pop goes the
weasel
so people would you could pay people to
teach you how to do the pop goes a
weasel dance
and even then no one really knew what it
meant it was just like a nonsense phrase
really
but yeah it's just it well it's like
it's like us loving the macarena i don't
know what the hell that means
but it's you know singing a dancer
you know i haven't dedicated myself to
understanding the lyrics i think it's
about a lady called macarena
it's about a lady whose husband has gone
away and she's
um courting all the other local boys um
because her husband our boyfriend isn't
there anymore
500 years from now people will be saying
actually the macarena
is about actually it's about brexit
[Laughter]
do you guys remember the one that goes
uh do your ears hang low do they wobble
too and
that kid's song we said so can you tie
them in a bow i think yeah can you tie
them in
and actually i think it was do your
boobs hang load that'll be yours well
i think it's do your balls hang like do
your balls and do your boobs
are the are the sort of the rude
versions of it um
but the assumption is is that it was the
kids song two years hang low and then
when you got sort of rude kids at school
going have you heard this version you
would sing it
anyway it turns out that the original
versions were do you balls hang low and
do your boobs hang low and then it got
sort of turned into
a more presentable for kids do your ears
hang low so it was sung
in wartime during world war one on the
western front um
they would be singing it in the trenches
do your bulls hang low
and then you have the sailor's hornpipe
yeah right yeah can you swing him to a
frog can you tie him in a knock can you
tie him in a bow
can you tuck them to the ceiling with
that free and easy feel anyway
[Laughter]
that's amazing i never heard that
version
i don't think that's that's the only one
i i like that one as a child
yeah these things just stay with you
don't they along with you know margaret
thatcher she's our hero
[Laughter]
haven't we went to very different
schools gave everyone in the classroom
a black armband when she resigned
have you heard of telltale tit this is a
really short one
telltale tit your tongue shall be slit
and all the dogs in the town shall have
a little bit
so i've never heard that before but it's
very common in bolton i could say
i hope the dogs in bolton will have a
little bit but i just think that's
amazing
it's because it's basically a children's
equivalent of saying snitches get
stitches
yeah yeah
and all the little doggies will have a
little bit that's what you used to say
it's terrifying you guys know piss a bed
no goes kiss a bed piss a bed
barley butt your bum is so heavy you
can't get up
and this was this was published in
the very first um nursery rhyme song
book
that was printed in britain in 1744 it's
the first time that baba black sheep was
ever printed
in a um in a nursery rhyme book so it's
called tommy thumbs pretty song book
and we thought there was only one copy
that was left which was
held i think in the british library but
one went up for auction a few years ago
um so there might be a couple more out
there but it had 40 nursery rhymes in it
and all the classics baba black sheep
hickory dickory dock
uh london bridge is falling down mary
mary quite contrary sing a song with six
pence and then
piss a bed tommy thumbs pretty soon book
they were actually all about pretty
patel weren't they
that was that's where that name came
from

anna's catchy slogan stop
thinking start eating
okay on with the show okay on with the
show
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
andy my fact is that in 1862 there was a
special
cravat invented to stop people
strangling you in the street
so if i went to strangle you andy with
this my hands go for your neck
oh yeah is it that the cravat is so full
of folds and so on i can never actually
find your neck how's it it's a real
pencil necks yeah
no it's um it's got spikes on the inside
so you could go for the neckblock on the
inside
oh sorry
the spikes are on the outside all right
okay concealed by a layer of cloth
yeah don't put that on the wrong way
round
no you're right you're right you're
right sorry they're on the outside but
they're cleverly concealed by the
ruffles at the front of the cravat
and um so dan as soon as you you'd
probably try and put your thumbs around
my windpipe
nice try mate uh you're gonna get a
spiky thumb i also read that and some of
them had razor blades sewn into the
folds
as well yeah pretty intense
uh items of clothing and these were
designed to
fight the menace of garottings because
there was a panic
in fact there weren't there were two
panics in the mid 19th century about
grottings one in 1856
and then it sort of flared up again in
1862
and there was this massive panic about
actually a relatively small crime wave
of people being mugged
uh and the the method of mugging was
someone would grab someone around the
throat
and then their accomplice would rob them
and um yeah i should just say
like a garotting to me is like you get
some cheese wire or something
like in in a movie they would get some
wire and they would put it around your
throat
but this was actually more like putting
someone in a sleeper hold in like a
wrestling move wasn't it then
yeah yeah i mean it could definitely it
could hurt you very badly i mean it
could i
could absolutely it could kill you as
well i don't think very many people at
all
were actually killed by this um but it
led to a change in the law
the parliament passed the 1863 garottas
act
uh and yeah this was a big panic there
is an argument that
not only did not many people die of this
no people died of it and it was
clearly made up yeah absolutely an
argument that it was completely made up
by newspapers so there was an
mp who got um mugged he was called hugh
pilkington and he had his pocket watch
stolen
and they said that he was garrotted when
they
stole his watch but actually it seems
like he wasn't
really and then basically newspapers
started calling any minor incident they
said oh this was a karotting
and then some of the um magistrates
would say that it was a garrotting even
though it wasn't because they knew that
the person would get more time
or a stronger punishment for it and then
after the 1863 act there was no more
garottings
but the argument among historians a lot
of them is that there were never any in
the first place
[Laughter]
it's very much what's it in the simpsons
where it's like this rock
scares away tigers or whatever it is
yeah right
yeah yeah yeah but there were
descriptions of how it worked
so it would be a three-person gang which
consisted of a front stall
a backstool and the nasty man okay
so okay attack yourself
i think the front stall distracts you he
stops you and says oh excuse me do you
have the time
and then the back stall is the lookout
who's making sure there are no police
coming along
and the nasty man is the one who
actually does the garotting
yeah i'm gonna work that out oh okay
[Laughter]
there was another thing you could buy in
1858 a guy called henry ball
invented a pistol one on your back which
would discharge
into a criminal's crotch so that would
go
i suppose that would go for the batman
would it or oh yeah
that would be to take the back stool
yeah yeah um
well no the garos is the grotto is going
around you with the sleeves right here
oh good point so that's for the nasty
man yeah
yeah yeah that's nasty man wow um i
think i can't believe it
did that work did anyone i'm not sure
any of this stuff was
no no this is a real thing it was real
sorry it was real but i don't think
everyone was wearing them you know it
was right
[Laughter]
wow imagine that you're going out just
to the local pub you're wearing spikes
around your neck you've got a pistol
facing backwards
i mean jesus this gun sounds amazing
because it looks just like a little belt
pack doesn't it
and you but the thing is obviously you
had guns weren't that advanced yet so
apparently you had to reach back to
the hammer of the gun
and then you had to kind of pull a rip
cord at your waistline which would
actually
fire the gun and fire a lead ball into
your attackers
like normally recoil goes in one
direction but if it's firing there you
would just be kind of thrusting your
crotch forward wouldn't you
like whenever you fired this gun yeah
you would get blasted into the front
stall
so you're a kind of human cannonball
the nasty man's nowhere to be seen it's
so amazing the henry ball belt pistol i
love it
oh you could just hire some bodyguards
to walk you to and from the pub like the
the bayswater brothers
who advertised um the bayswater brothers
whose height is respectively six feet
four inches and six feet eleven
and the united breadth of whose
shoulders extends to as much as three
yards one foot five inches
give respectfully notice to the gentry
and public of paddington kensington
stoke newington chelsea eaton square and
shepherds bush
that they will be most happy upon all
social and jovial expeditions
to escort elderly or nervous persons in
the streets after dark
wow that's great they sound great so
they
they'd served several months in the
police force and uh they would
they would go through any neighborhood
even the worst garrotting districts
well-known
yeah but they don't go south of the
river do that that's typical it's just
like cabbies all over again
no garage south of the river wow
um some more kind of panics um oh yeah
because i i'm saying
i'm saying that this garating wasn't
really a thing
it might have been a thing but that's
the kind of angle it's definitely a way
smaller thing
than uh the 1863 garotta's act would
suggest
[Laughter]
in um 1954 a lot of people in seattle
were really worried because there were
loads of holes in the windscreens
and everyone was going out looking at
their car and they find little holes
and they didn't know what had happened
they thought it was vandals
they thought it might have been fallout
from nuclear tests that were happening
to be honest not that close to seattle
but they thought that maybe it was that
uh and then the load of scientists were
brought in and they looked at what had
happened
and it turned out that these pits were
there
all along but it was just happened that
in that year 1954
someone noticed it and then everyone
else went oh my god i've got that as
well oh my god i've got that as well
that's very funny that's so good have
the um
in 1788 you have the london monster oh
yeah
oh yeah who was a guy who went around
basically
stabbing ladies in the in the skirt area
um
ripping their clothes uh sometimes you'd
be
presenting them with flowers and there'd
be something sharp
concealed within them oh no yeah
it was it was a disgrace um but it
probably didn't happen
oh okay up to 50 women reported to the
police that they've been attacked and
it was later proven that some of some of
these women had inflicted wounds
themselves you know they were just
scratched or they just ripped the dress
but somebody did get convicted a woman
was attacked in the january i think of
1790 um and
she saw a guy in the park
six months later got a boyfriend to
follow him home it was this um
ex-ballet dancer who now made artificial
flowers
this welsh guy um who
got up before the beak and they found
out that the worst defense they could
charge him with was actually
damaging clothes
[Laughter]
apparently they're damaging damaging
clothes under the law at the time
because
they were expensive foreign clothes came
with a harsher penalty
than actually injuring these women
attempting murder and stabbing
um so eventually this guy got six years
but
mysteriously there were no attacks after
that even though he probably wasn't the
attacker
but during a two-year period women
started wearing copper pants
under their petticoats as a form of
self-defense against the london monster
so there is a there's a james gilray
engraving
of um of the monster attacking a woman
and he pulls up a skirt
and uh there's just a pan there so he's
disappointed
yeah well you would be yeah
did you say this was 1788 that this was
happening
1788 it started yeah 1790. i didn't
think there were people making
artificial flowers in the 1780s
yeah they'd be made of silk i would
guess rather than yeah i just sort of
assumed that stuff
they were a thing from the 70s onwards
like kind of
like plastic or i can't believe that
that what you got about that story
[Laughter]
in the earliest earliest days of this
podcast i mentioned a fact
about the precursor to the london
monster which was a man who used to go
around london
and he would slap women on the bum and
then he'd run off and as he ran off he
would yell spanko
and i think he was called whipping tom
or something like that can i just say
with that
i think in that case if you had a copper
pan
in your petticoats then it would have
the opposite effect because it would
make a really nice resonant sound if you
spanked someone in there yeah
absolutely a copper pot there wouldn't
it that's true
like playing the tim party that would be
like the j arthur rank symbol at the
beginning of films
hitting a petticoat and running off
so was he caught damned was he caught do
we know
do we know who the real spanko was banco
no i i don't know any
any i just that's an old memory as jenny
was talking about the london monster he
was a precursor but um
yeah amazing character the london
monster um and huge panic
off the back of that oh yeah when if
james gilray is doing engravings of you
then you know you've made it yeah i
don't know james gilray was he was he mr
engraver back then oh he was mr you know
your political cartoons
those are all those are all him you know
he's the the steep bell of his day
i didn't know who was either but i
thought by keeping quiet people would
assume that i did
you've definitely definitely 100 seen
his work okay yeah
they're all the really big complicated
drawings where
people have to be labeled quite
precisely so you know there's a
brilliant engraving
i'm just making this up now but you know
there'll be a monkey and a hot air
balloon
but the monkey has to be labeled
britain's response to the eritrean
and the balloon is labeled uh european
integration
after the 1763 act of like
[Laughter]
but back in the day people have one
glance at it like yeah get it like
brilliant
hilarious yeah genius yeah
okay it's time for fact number three and
that is
james okay my fact this week is that for
24 years
any ship traveling between wellington
and nelson in new zealand
will be guided through the most
dangerous section by a dolphin
called pelorus jack i should have done
that in a pirate voice shouldn't i
would be guided through the most
dangerous section
by a dolphin called pelorus jack
was that better no i couldn't i couldn't
tell the difference
so james what is this this is a fact
uh okay perhaps so
at the north end of new zealand south
island there's a little stretch of water
it's really really perilous um it's
called the french pass
and there are loads of really bad
currents uh
and high waves and it could be really
difficult to get through
and at the turn of the 20th century
any boat that was going through there
would always have this dolphin
alongside it now whether the dolphin was
deliberately helping the humans across
or whether it was just being a dolphin
and kind of swimming in the wake of
a boat like dolphins often do we don't
know well we do know
because it didn't even know it was a
dolphin it was just
but what is it it wasn't there it was
there it was there and people
believed that that's what was happening
so people were writing at the time
there's articles from 1905 1906 where
people
said they were on this boat and the
dolphin was acting as a pilot for the
ships
and that it would take them deliberately
into the areas where the water was
deeper because it knew there would be
less
chance of the boats being smashed on the
rocks
and then some people didn't like the
dolphin being there
and some people shot at it on one
particular time when someone shot this
dolphin
there was a law that came up that said
you i'm specifically not allowed to
shoot this particular dolphin
in new zealand and it was the first sea
creature to be protected by law
anywhere in the world i mean with
between this and the 1863 garottos act
it does feel like legislators had a lot
more time on their hands
back in the day
but so the story goes that the um the
boat the ship that
shot at uh jack was called the ss
penguin
and the story goes that he disappeared
and he came back later but five years
later
the ss penguin struck rocks and sank
and 75 passengers perished um and they
they as the story goes it's because jack
when he saw the ss penguin coming would
ignore it he he knew that that was the
boat that shot him
and so maybe without his help that's
what led to it being
slammed into the rocks it's a great
story i love it
the polaris is a really weird name
because i thought when you said that the
french past this strait of water was
very perilous i thought oh maybe it's a
version of that i don't think it is
it's not it's a ship's instrument or
something uh there was a ship
called the um hms perilous
um and uh there's a pelleris sorry and
it kind of went around that area of new
zealand and australia so there's a
pelris island as well
and a few different things named after
pelarus which was this um
this discovery ship okay but pelarus was
also
the name of hannibal's pilot so that may
be where it comes from
hannibal hannibal lecter yeah hannibal
lecter
needed a pilot well you've got you've
got to have a private pilot
you're busy you're a busy man these
lovers aren't going to cook themselves
do you mean hannibal as in the hannibal
asked the elephant dude
the elephant dude carthaginian general
dude now sounds like we're talking about
the elephant man who was a different
person
now elephant d would definitely be the
name of hannibal's youtube channel
we're going to try and take some
elephants and invade rome next week it's
going to be completely crazy
uh hit like and subscribe to see if it
works
[Laughter]
but yeah there was um when i sent this
fight round andy you um
you found an article that said that
perhaps it wasn't
real and that the fact that the people
thought that dolphin was
guiding people was invented quite a few
years later
um but um i found an article from
april 1905 where there was a guy called
mr
generous hayes um who said that
no not definitely not made up
yeah what day in april
james
it was the 29th of april but this story
had come all the way from australia so
it could definitely take 28 days to get
to the um
central somerset gazette which is where
i read it
but he said that um that jack acts as a
most effective pilot escorting all kinds
of vessels in and out of the french pass
yeah and he was sort of globally famous
the stories of
mark twain specifically going on that
route to see him
yeah and another the an english author
called frank t bullon
as well um both have written about it
so yeah i think the contentious thing is
was he piloting them or was he just
having fun um but there's photos and so
on i must
say every time i read that i read that
in a few places and i always said
well-known figures such as mark twain
and english author frank t
bullon and i always thought one of those
i have heard of
for sure i saw uh when i saw
new zealand i obviously got in touch
with my friend who's a a
an expat kiwi amy and i messaged her and
and i said have you heard of pelhas jack
and she went oh my god i love him he's a
celebrity dolphin in new zealand
and i was like a celebrity dolphin and
there's more than one celebrity dolphin
in new zealand
it's a thing and they all have statues
so there's
really oppo who um was famous in new
zealand during the summer of 1955 to 56
because he played with children um and
very soon after
um had become stranded and died so well
his name
is his story his full name was a pony
jack what's that
himself because that's he's the
archetype of celebrity dolphins in new
zealand obviously
yeah um and then mocko came around in in
2006 to do a similar kind of thing
but you know neither of them was that
useful they weren't guiding they were
just kind of into humans so because
mocko was um mocha was a guide on one
famous occasion
because um again another kiwi dolphin um
in 2008 there were two pygmy sperm
whales who were trapped
i think they were trapped between the
beach and a sand bank that had built up
but they didn't know what to do
and the the authorities were saying oh
well
should we kill them because they
otherwise they can really suffer and
they might die
and mocha the dolphin um led them out
through a narrow
channel at the end of the sandbag that
they were in so there was a bit of water
that was just deep enough to get these
wells through
so it obviously became a huge celebrity
uh and then it all went to his head and
he started
um well he started sexually assaulting
swimmers
and i know it is you know
celebrity excess he started making what
was called amorous
advances to women in the water and also
just being a bit of a thug he started
tipping over water skiers and
i can't believe this but apparently
stealing surfers surfboards
now i don't know what i i can't envisage
how a dolphin does that
why do you need to you you're already
quite fishing in the water
i mean for a dolphin a surfboard might
be like a hoverboard for a human
like he might if can you imagine if
you're a dolphin and one of your mates
comes along and he's just kind of
lying on a surfboard that guy is he's
chilling
okay so james is trying to justify
mocko's crime wave
you mocko apologist
[Laughter]
but he still has a statue though they
are blooming statues yeah
well you've got to commemorate your
local celebrity dolphin that didn't get
pulled down in the whole
receipt it might be reevaluated
um you know who also seems to be into
new zealand dolphins
is the scottish so
it is it's just a very curious thing but
perilous
perilous jack was turned into a song and
a dance
in scotland and so there's
there's a song that goes and i don't
know the the music to it but a famous
fish there used to be called polaris
jack
he'd always swim far out to sea when a
ship came back
and this got turned into a dance which
you could do
and there's a there's a move called the
dolphin hay which i guess is a bit like
the pop goes the weasel it's sort of
like a
it's a dolphin move um so that was
turned into a dance and there's a full
dance routine
about pelris jack but also oppo who we
were talking about in 1994 was also
turned into us
into a scottish dance as well wow um
yeah
so you can if you go to scotland likely
there are people who know two new
zealand dolphin dancers
well i've dan i've got some ends with
the scottish country dancing community
oh yeah i can confirm there's no
shortage of things they've named dances
after there are so many
hundreds of dances
are they just going through wikipedia on
random pages
and going okay well i'm going to do this
after george washington high school in
milwaukee
it is amazing the number of things they
have done tonight after
yeah i think it must be an extension of
the nursery rhyme thing
so scottish country dancing has taken up
the mantle
have you ever done any scottish country
dancing but me
yeah yeah yeah i've done a bit yeah it's
it's great it's really really fun
do you know the dolphin hey i don't know
no i'm not off the top of your head
there are thousands of dances done
[Laughter]
it's not entry level anyway no
absolutely not that's a dashing white
sergeant is the first thing you learned
i think you have to be pretty
you have to be balls deep before you're
loading dolphin
did you do country dancing at school no
i didn't
um i i remember a couple of sessions of
it when they
they didn't have a pe teacher
it was raining and so a teacher who
happened to know some country dancing
oh okay so you didn't have a dance
instructor who'd been kept in a cupboard
for years
until the pe teacher fell ill because
when i was at primary school
so jenny and i went to the same
secondary school but when i was at
primary school we did country dancing
every week what was it was it english
country dancing you were doing
uh it's like morris dancing i guess it's
like
all i remember is that you had to dotsy
doe your partner that's yeah that's all
i remember
yeah although i remember is docido there
is one dance
that's an english country dance and
that's english consciousness is a bit
rarer for whatever reason there are
still loads of dancers but they just
don't get done so much because they're
all from you know jane austen's time but
there's one which is called mr
beveridge's
maggot it's my favorite name of a dance
wonderful and what happens at the end of
that
um i don't know i don't know if this was
named after an actual maggot that was um
like a celebrity maggot
which saved a carriage from crashing or
whatever
um i don't know where to go from there
um dolphins
let's talk about dolphins yeah yes um
one thing that dolphins do which i
didn't know is that they
can wear gloves over their noses
okay this is amazing they
they andy yeah is this a real glove over
her nose or is this an analogy
for a glove over a nose because sarah
pascal called us out last week
if you remember about um this ladybird
bought a hat
and now
oh my god i've fallen right into the
pasco ladybird hat trap because
no it's not a glove it's not a glove
obviously it's not a glass what is it
they
so you know marine sponges yeah
they they're animals technically aren't
they those sponges are very simple
animals they
kind of um pick up these sponges and
they
press them onto the end of their snouts
and then when they're foraging
they're using their snout and they are
probing for prey sometimes under the
surface of the sea
but there can be sharp things there and
so these
sponges on their noses act as a kind of
um
bit of protective equipment if you like
um to stop them
hurting themselves when they're jamming
around there and they particularly pick
conical sponges because they can jam
them more easily onto the end of their
noses
they're nice cool yeah i think i think
glove is acceptable for that because
it's basically their hand
and they're putting something over their
hands so they can go riffling about
in things so yeah i'll accept it
i'm not gonna passco you on this yeah i
don't know
if if james hadn't called andy out just
then i would be at parties going you
know they wear marigolds
on their face
dolphins can talk to each other on the
telephone
jesus christ okay i think we all want to
pasco you on this one
well there was there was an aquarium in
hawaii where they had
the mother in a separate tank to a
two-year-old uh
kaf dolphin and they they organized a
audio link between the two tanks and got
them
chatting to each other and the calls and
responses were in line with the kind of
calls and responses you would hear
in the wild even though they couldn't
see each other and they they don't know
what they said
we've spoken about there's a dolphin
dictionary uh that they're working on at
the moment scientists but
we do know that they were calling
responses that were happening and it's
it's sort of
they think the conversation was like hey
what's your name oh my name's this oh
great um there's lots of fish here oh
that's good to know
um yeah so wow they can chat over the
phone
okay actually again it sounded
unreasonable but i think that's
completely
legit they can't shut over the phone
they just they can't dial and they can't
you know they'd have to take the glove
off to die
obviously um so
also dolphins can attack enemies of the
soviet union
because that's a thing isn't it dolphins
they um
they are trained in various armies the
americans have done it and the soviets
did it
their first use of dolphins by the navy
was in 1970 in vietnam where they were
put on guard duty
um for the americans was that river
dolphins or was it
uh cec going dolphins that's a really
good point
i don't know about that you know it's
actually the least relevant part of the
most amazing fact i've ever heard
obviously
i mean the dolphins fought in numb is a
more interesting fact than whether they
were river or ocean dolphins
but you do get rid of dolphins in
vietnam dolphins there because it was
you know it's the mekong delta and all
that so i'm guessing there would be
guarding certain um entry and exit
points
andy you always ask the questions that
the people at home are all thinking
um so and the soviet union uh they
used their uh dolphin guards they would
carry a titanium clamp
on their nose which was about the size
of a ping-pong ball
uh and you would they would attach it to
a diver that they found
and they um the little kind of thing
would report back
and tell you where that person is so
you'd be able to find them
um and if they couldn't find them
eventually
the ping pong ball thing would inject a
high pressure charge of co2 into the
diver's body
oh so this is an enemy diver as well
like a u.s diver or whatever
that's the idea yeah to tag them and
their god and again i don't know
exactly what species of dolphin was
[Music]
stop the focus stop the podcast hello
guys we wanted to inform you that was
sponsored this week
by expressvpn yes an expressvpn
stands for express virtual private
network in fact the express is just
included in that that's just part of it
but the vpn stands for virtual private
network and what a vpn does
it's a service online which creates a
secure encrypted tunnel between your
device whatever you're using the
internet on
and the internet so that your online
activity cannot be seen
yes and that is because usually internet
service providers know
every single website that you've visited
and what they can do is they can
sell that information to ad companies or
big tech companies
and then they might be able to use that
data to kind of target you
so you google fluorescent green lipstick
at three in the morning for no good
reason and do you find that you're
having fluorescent green lipstick
advertised at your left right and center
can i just say i feel very seen
in this conversation um
so if you want to stop that happening
then you can get a vpn
and as andy says that creates this sort
of tunnel it's like the equivalent of
going to the toilet but
closing the door so that everyone else
in your house can't see you
while you're urinating what a wonderful
analogy
so if you would like to get your own
bathroom door
for your computer yeah i think we're
going with it then just go to
expressvpn.com
fish and you will get an extra three
months free if you sign up to them
that is right go for that extra three
months for free by going to
expressvpn.com
fish and don't let anyone see you
metaphorically urinate
online again okay too far on with the
show on with the show
[Music]
okay it's time for our final fact of the
show that is my fact
my fact this week is that the arthur
conan doyle estate is currently suing
netflix
for showing sherlock holmes as having
feelings and respecting women
so this is this is really interesting so
uh netflix is making um a movie called
enola homes
and it is the story of the teenage
sister
of sherlock holmes and sherlock holmes
appears as a character in it
and in the show they show him as having
sort of not sociopath uh qualities that
we know sherlock to have but
to be warmer and gentler and the conan
doyle
state is claiming they are unable to
represent him like that because yes
even though sherlock does have those
feelings he did eventually
sort of respect women and um become a
nicer character
he only became that in the last 10
stories that were written
by conan doyle and it just so happens
that those 10 stories are the only
stories that are still in copyright
and belong to the conan doyle estate so
anyone who wants to use the out of
copyright has to use
the more mean misogynistic homes and
they're fine but if you want to show him
being a nice guy
you're going to be sued wow
there's a few other things that you're
not allowed to um or
if you do show sherlock having these
characteristics then you have to pay
them
pay the family so if you show holmes and
watson having a genuine friendship
that's in copyright if you show his love
of nature
that is and if you ever show him liking
dogs
so if you ever make it i'm just going to
say this to everyone out there if you're
making your own version of
sherlock holmes make sure that he
doesn't like dogs whenever you do
yeah i guess the hound of the
baskervilles is
out of copyright yeah in which he
doesn't like dogs no
no it's quite right and the thing is if
you are gonna make
something where he does like dogs and
respects women all you need to do
actually is wait
two or three more years because that is
we're in the final years of them owning
this copyright i think that's why
they're trying to rake in as much money
yeah
as possible because they're about to
lose it entirely um
but these stories obviously have you
know he wrote them over a lifetime
so there's a bit of spread on when the
copyright ends
and the final batch these final ten were
written after he returned from world war
one
and he lost his brother in the war he
lost his eldest son and he came back and
he was a different man and he thought i
want to reflect that in sherlock
and so that's why there was this sudden
change in the uh
attitude of sherlock yeah interesting
yeah i i got deep into the legalese of
all this because
you know that's that's my uh my
background so there's
there's actually an in fight between
the conan doyle estate limited and
arthur conan doyle's literary estates
both of whom claim to have the copyright
of those stories and it's actually the
the conan doyle
estate limited is the litigious
um one of those two and so they're they
are described by the literary estate as
copyright trolls which is a whole new
tool
so um tracing it back the way that the
story is told by the literary estate
is that um all the rights were sold
um after conan doyle's death because the
his the three inheriting children so
it's two
two daughters and the widow of his son
um
had they couldn't agree on anything so
they all sold to the widow
um and from then on she you know she
went bankrupt and the rights were
required by someone else who was
acquired by someone else
and so that they traced that route back
in
2000-ish when eu copyright law started
to
to indicate that there wasn't much money
left to be squeezed out
in europe of the literary copyright
that's when
conan doyle estate limited which is some
descendants of conan doyle himself
decided to put the squeeze on so uh
some of the studios who are interested
in his work so they
they basically they went and threatened
warner brothers when they made the uh
robert downey jr
versions um and because you know
in those films you know he's got a
romance with irene adler there's
there's all that sort of stuff that
works come under the these sort of
stipulations and
the the fair to threaten those
filmmakers actually at the robert downey
jr
the people you wanna you wanna threaten
the people who made holmes and watson
what oh sorry so this is dan's favorite
film the wilson
so good yeah but nowhere in in
holmes is he bloody hilarious
there you go so that's that's actually
more of a divergence from the original
text and
i'm guessing that that studio paid them
off
um do you know the um obviously the very
famous quote elementary my dear watson
um it never never said in any of the
written work
of conan doyle's um so it's a line that
came much later
but there's someone who runs a site
called quote investigator who's written
a fantastic article about
trying to find the very first instances
where we use
elementary my dear watson and the oldest
that he could find
was 1901 the northampton mercury they
published a short parody
featuring the characters combs
and potson
and it is in that that the line
elementary my dear potson
is set wow then in 1902
there was a piece that was written about
dr joseph
bell now dr joseph bell is someone who
it is claimed was the inspiration
for sherlock holmes he was a doctor who
could walk around and look at you
on site and pick out what was wrong with
you by just simply staring at you which
is a
thing that sherlock is famous for doing
and in this article
the person writing it says as the
remarkable man would say
it is the merest elementary knowledge my
dear watson so that's the second class
that we get to it yeah but yeah no one
can find it in the actual canon itself
of
official sherlock writings i think if it
was there people would have found it
right
because people do take these books very
seriously
you're right and you get them they're
all digital now there's a search term
um i've got a uh just a recommendation
of an extraordinary real life story to
do with
sherlock and conan doyle that is worth
reading um
so it's written by a guy called david
graham
um and the story it was published in the
new yorker and it was called mysterious
circumstances
so basically one of the leading sherlock
holmes
experts in the world living in britain
was found
dead in his room in his house
with um no break-in no one could work
out how anyone got out
because but there was just one body in
there so this
turned in itself into a sherlock holm
style mystery
how did the leading expert of sherlock
holmes die it was a guy called richard
lancelin green he was the son
of roger lancelin green who wrote the
king arthur fables in their modern
version with the most famous version
that we would all know
and um yeah so it's extraordinary he was
found death by garrotting
by the way oh yeah hello
did you say the year then no um well he
wrote about it in 2004 and it wasn't
much
long before that that this story
happened um did he have one of those
guns that shoots people in the crotch
because then i'm just kind of trying to
channel my other sherlock holmes here
yeah it could i mean i know the answer
to the story but it's it's not that
um that doctor what was he called dr
bell
bell yeah he could tell just by looking
at you if you'd been shot in the crotch
[Laughter]
this man is a garotta he's a nasty man
sorry daddy carry on no no i think
that's all that i'd like to give in
terms of details it's an extraordinary
mystery
sherlock expert found garrotted yeah in
a locked room mystery and he's the only
person in the room
no one knows who killed him there was a
big paranoia on his part in the lead up
to his death
about people wanting to kill him uh that
he told everyone about
uh it's a big mystery and the story does
resolve so i highly recommend reading it
mysteriously oh you're not
going to tell us no no it's honestly
it's that's what i'm saying is this is
just a
you need to read it it would be it would
be horrible to ruin the brilliance of
this writing
yes so how have you told people how to
get hold of this how to fight
it yeah the new yorker mysterious
circumstances it's called by david grant
or in the book the devil versus sherlock
holmes but once we stop recording you'll
just tell us what happened right because
yes absolutely it was a self he put his
cravat on the wrong way around
[Laughter]
so easy
okay that's it that is all of our facts

okay on with the podcast
[Applause]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four top secret
locations around the united kingdom
my name is anna tashinsky and i'm
sitting here today with
andrew hunter murray james harkin and a
very special guest
youtuber tom scott and we are here to
discuss our four favorite facts
from the last seven days so in no
particular order
here we go starting with you tom i
wanted to make a youtube video
about how interesting strobe lighting is
but the likelihood was it would give
one of my viewers an epileptic fit so
i've come on your podcast to talk about
things
fair enough so happy to serve can you
give anyone an
audio epileptic fit i don't know
not to my knowledge uh but there's uh
there's definitely a thing
about lights and strobe lights so i was
trying to work out how to demonstrate
this
without demonstrating it and without
giving instructions because
statistically one of my viewers was
gonna find out that they have
photosensitive epilepsy
the hard way and i just couldn't figure
out a way to tell it
so one of the really cool things about
this is that it goes back a long long
way
there's a story that nostradamus once
received visions by
closing his eyes and staring at the sun
and waving his spread hand in front of
his face
so he was getting flashes of the sun
against his closed eyes at the right
frequency
that's probably rubbish but that's the
oldest reference i could find that feels
like uh
it feels like a not very uh cool
chemical way of inducing hallucinations
as well that feels like kids sort of
rolling up
non-drugs and smoking them and trying to
get high off that like banana peels
so what did he report seeing nostradamus
when he flashed his hand in front of his
face
the first reference i can find is sort
of early 19th century and they got
called
stroboscopic hallucinations and
basically you close your eyes you flash
a strobe light
so this could be something as simple as
uh you've got your eyes closed looking
out the window of your 19th century
buggy as it goes along the road and you
pass some railings
and that sort of flashing light dark
light dark light dark against your
eyelids
is enough to induce this everyone sort
of sees
grids and fractal patterns and sort of
weird 3d abstract shapes ah
okay so have you you've presumably done
it and seen that because i was
researching this yesterday
and had a relatively severe hangover and
i couldn't bring myself to
attempt to do any of this because i was
afraid i would vomit but how like how
intense is it really
so it depends on how intense the
flashing is which is kind of an obvious
thing to say
uh but uh the sort of basic version
where you just get a strobe app on your
phone and you point it at your eyes
after about 10 15 seconds you'll start
to see some sort of floating patterns
might be like you're rushing down a
tunnel might be like you're sort of
traveling sideways might just be some
flashing grids things like that
tends to be red and blue it appears the
first time i ever got to experience this
was a device invented by a hacker called
mitch
altman now i don't know if you've heard
of any of his stuff before have you
heard of the tv be gone
no no it's it's a little uh pocket-sized
device fits on your keychain
and he invented it sort of early 2000s i
think and it sends
every remote controls off code one after
the other
so if you're in a bar and you want to
turn off that tv in the corner
uh you just sort of point that and wait
there was um
there was a group of people called the
white dot organization or something
and they thought that no one should ever
watch tv and pubs because it's
you know anti-social and so they went
around to all the pubs and they
deliberately turned off all the tvs
and it was while i was working in the
pub industry and we were
furious it was on the people yeah it was
on the front page of all their like
industry newspapers and stuff it was it
was a big
story did they come but did they come
into your pub and
you'd you know have someone press a
button and switch the tvs off you know
just the threat of them i i reckon they
probably didn't do any of this stuff and
it was probably
like um you know a big story in the in
the local newspapers which never
actually happened but we were def it was
definitely something that we told our
landlords to keep an eye open for really
because these things do work don't they
and i kind of can't believe that they're
sold you can get one of the tv be gone
for about 30 quid
and apparently still sort of works i
think technology is
moving beyond it but then it catches up
right i don't know if you've tried it
tom but i really wanted to do it
i actually owned one once because i like
mitch altman i want to support his stuff
uh and i couldn't i think i only have
used it a couple of times
because it turns out that actually
having this thing on your keychain is
kind of annoying and it's quite a big
thing
he actually built two versions when
smartphones came along he built a super
powered one that looks like a smartphone
and works from a huge distance
uh and you can find footage of someone
taking that to a trade show and just
irritating every single technology booth
and it's just
like uh it's not nice like
that's something that's just someone
trolling does it work
doesn't work on traffic lights no sadly
but someone definitely invented that as
well that definitely exists
i think actively illegal oh yeah i it's
a brave person i think who enters a pub
on the evening of the champions league
final uh will the tv be gone
i think i wouldn't i wouldn't be willing
to risk it but it is pretty incredible
and he designed the
the um did mitch altman also designed
the glasses you were talking about or
the brain
yes i got to try one of mitch altman's
brain machines which are just uh
they're kind of glasses or at least the
one i tried with just like paper glasses
the kind of thing you get for watching
eclipse or something like that
but uh with an led in front of each eye
so you just close your eyes and it would
flash the leds at
roughly the right stroke frequency about
12 hertz he claimed they were at
brainwave frequencies
and they sort of match to sort of 15
minutes session over time
with adapted your brain waves to do some
i'm not
convinced of that section of it but yeah
like i saw a huge amount of patterns
it was it was really interesting to see
wow and then the bit above that the most
intense version they said i've
ever seen is an artwork called zee by
kurt henschlager
uh which i saw in liverpool once and it
was
a room filled so thick with theatrical
smoke that you literally if you stretch
your hand out in front of your face
you couldn't see your hand i have never
been in fog that is thicker than that
and then just super powerful strobe
lights going at 12 hertz in a pattern
i got told later that they were just
pure white strobe lights i thought they
were red and blue and all sorts of
colors
um you saw all sorts of enormous
patterns swirling around you it felt i
don't know like in some sort of
you're in some sort of star trek
transporter beam because there are just
fractal patterns swirling around your
hand
it is absolutely astonishing but yeah if
you look up
news articles about it there are all
sorts of things about uh yeah they
decided to close it gave two percent of
the people who went into it an epileptic
fit
uh it induced epileptic fits in people
who had never had photosensitive
epilepsy before
uh it was genuinely dangerous it was
also one of the most incredible visual
experiences i've ever had
but i can see why it didn't tour as much
as it uh perhaps should have i mean it
sounds extremely unpleasant i have to
say
i don't think i'd want to subject myself
to that even without photosensitive
epilepsy i've got a question do you ever
in these
experiences get beyond seeing kind of
fractal patterns and you start seeing
you know dogs with nine legs or whatever
does it ever get really crazy uh
so while i was researching this i found
that this was
part of the beat generation where allen
ginsberg tried
a thing called the dream machine which
was a bulb
and a record turntable with sort of
slatted uh paper around it
so you just started the turntable going
and it was calibrated to kind of hit
your eyes at the right frequency
which is the brain machine just built
for an entire room and i think that
was that inspired by someone uh was it a
guy called guyson who was going on a car
along a tree-lined street and had the
light flashing so if you do want the
cheap way you can drive
along a street of plane trees i suppose
in the sun and lean out the window and
close your eyes but that's really cool i
mean you you might want to do that as
the passenger but yes
but actually that um that dream machine
um when
geisin made it he thought that it was
going to replace the television
set in every single home which i've got
to say
if there's no dogs with nine legs and if
it's just like the fractal patterns
i don't know i know there's some crap on
tv at the moment but i think you could
you could do that because the visuals of
tv shows often they're not very
interesting actually often it's just
panels
let's say question time if you had the
audio of question time and you still got
the
content but you were able to see magical
fractal patterns throughout i don't
think people would not do that i know
that should be an option you should be
able to press the red button
to get fractal patterns over fiona
yeah i got a quote from ginsburg uh
while i was uh
researching this it creates optical
fields
as religious and mandalic as
hallucinogenic drugs although didn't he
also say that a combination of that and
drugs was really bad
right that's the thing like all this
does is create an optical
illusion it creates weird fractal
patterns i cannot find any sort of
research as to why
it seems to just be a failure state for
the vision system of the brain that we
never
dealt with you know 12 hertz strobe
lights in nature
so rain just falls trying to do it do
you know what the most common
hallucination is in the world
i think this is my theory um is it like
a mirage maybe
or is that that's not really a
hallucination
yeah i think no that's that's external
no i i would say that's
that's not a hallucination because your
eyes are accurately reported like yeah
is it the dog with nine legs yeah it's
the dog with nine legs
always nine five billion people have
seen it um
so i think it's uh the phantom phone
ringing thing
says when you are hallucinating or phone
ringing so phantom vibration syndrome
i looked it up a bit has a load of other
names more fun names uh it gets called
anxiety uh the fos-salaam
like foe as in false in french faux
salam wait a minute wait a minute the
word false means foe anyway so why do
you need to include up the word
foe that's a really good point yeah i
can't
it seemed clever but isn't it faux
salaam because foe sounds a bit more
like phone
phone salam it must be that andy it's i
mean i've copied it down directly from
the
but it started off the earliest
reference i found although i didn't look
exhaustively but
it was referred to in dilbert the comic
dilbert in 1996 but back then it was
called phantom pager syndrome
because people thought their pages were
going off and um
yeah so the only apparently the only way
to solve it would be to move your phone
to a much more sensitive part of your
body like if you
keep it in your mouth you'll always know
whether it's ringing or not
do you think candy they ever had i mean
that's very funny but do you
think do you we've all got a joke we
want yeah
and we'll keep it to ourselves so
although that does bring you meaning to
the word dictaphone so
there we go there's the punchline phone
today
um did you think when you used to have
pocket watches
and you would keep it near your hearts
that kind of thing and it would tick
do you think if you didn't have your
pocket watch you would have phantom
pocket watch syndrome
i bet you did yeah i can't can you can
you you can't feel it ticking against
your heart can you you might think
that's your heartbeat you're feeling
oh yeah if you i mean if it's normally
on the outside of a shirt and a
waistcoat i guess
if you're doing it properly whereas if
you're if you're if you're
going um going commando and you're just
wearing your pocket brush
where are you attaching it it's under my
full skin the pocket watch is up in my
forest
oh no oh oh have you got the time
yes but i'm not sure you're gonna want
to know
um i read that the roman novelist and
orator
aceleus he said that the spinning of a
potter's wheel could sometimes give
people seizures
like almost in the same strobing way
really that's true that's what he said
if you get a wonky pot
maybe that's why people are always kind
of
claiming that we've um managed to hone
this technology
to become a military weapon aren't they
when you research kind of
flashing lights and strobe lights being
able to have a weird impact on your
brain
it's always like the us military is
researching how to incapacitate
the russians with a flashing light and i
can't really find
any evidence that these things work even
though they're constantly tried
except last year it was reported that
russia had fitted two warships with this
light which i think flashes and it
induces hallucinations and vomiting
apparently it's called the
fp42 filling and it's non-lethal
but it releases a strobe-like beam and
apparently disrupts wow
eyesight which i would imagine you're
just flashing something in someone's
eyes yeah of course it disrupts eyesight
but according to them you can become
delirious and throw up everywhere
probably the fact they've just given you
a load of novichok doesn't help either
the reason i started down this whole
rabbit hole is that i got an email from
a startup in bristol
that is trying to use eeg sort of
brainwave
reading kit and then trying to
synchronize the strobes
with that kind of have a greater effect
they claim to be able to get altered
states of consciousness with it
uh they claim to be able to get
something higher than i'm just seeing
some patterns
i'm i'm skeptical because you can't
really test that against placebo
all that well you can't test it against
pretending to flash a light in someone's
eyes
um they uh they are in very early
studies but
they hope to be able to do something
with it i'm not sure what that something
is
uh but i wish them the best of luck i i
do find the placebo thing interesting i
only
only struck me recently how often you
can't use a placebo because of things
like that you can't do a placebo effect
of a flashing light or
i think they have problems with studies
into how much exercise
impacts health in certain ways because
you can't do a placebo exercise you
can't convince someone that they have
been for a run every day for a week
if they've been sitting in front of the
tv well they also say you can't do a
placebo
of a parachute you can't give one person
a parachute and then give one person no
parachute to see which one works
i think you could do a placebo of
exercise though can you
definitely yeah so if you let's say you
want to see what it's like for someone
running five miles yeah
and then and the sort of control group
is you'll have to get them
to run one mile but they'll they'll
think it's five miles
so you would put signposts all around
their local park
saying oh keep going you've nearly done
five miles and so on and then
by the time they get back there i've
only run one mile so that's a placebo
you have to get all the trees in the
park sort of moving towards them so it
looks to them like that
you'd have to create smaller trees maybe
so they thought they were running past
them faster
maybe you're revolving small everything
really small dogs but then you've sort
of created a cohort of people that think
they've got super human ability to run
and then they turn up at the olympics
and they're absolutely [ __ ]
um just on on strobe lighting uh it's
possible that the neuralizer from men in
black
might exist
do you guys remember what that is yeah
something lost your memory
exactly you flash a light itself yeah
but how would you know
yeah well that's a big question it might
exist already and it's just that it's
erased our memory of it every time it's
been used
but scientists have now done some
experiments shaw on mice as usual
but it turns out that if they so
researchers kind of shocked mice
on the foot when they went into a
certain room and then usually what would
happen is the mouse would freeze as soon
as it enters that room again because it
expects to be shocked again
but they found that when they flashed a
light in their eyes at a certain
frequency
they'd completely forgotten the shock
and they went back into the room
and so it seems like just by flashing a
light in a certain way at people
then it they think it interrupts
connections between the nerves that are
forming your memories
and so it blanks out your memory and it
only blanks out about the previous four
seconds
so it's just it's got to be something
that's happened immediately before you
push the light in their eyes
that you want them to forget so it looks
like we might be able to use strobe
lighting in the same way they do in that
film
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is
that why whenever i've been to a
nightclub i could never remember the
next morning what happened
exactly what it is yeah just flash a
torch in your face and it'll all come
flooding
back
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the boogers hi
everybody just let you know we are
sponsored this week
by hello fresh indeed we
are hello fresh is the service that
gives you
fresh seasonal ingredients delivers them
to your door along with step by step a
recipe card so you can transform those
ingredients into
really kind of restaurant level meals to
impress
yourself and if you're lucky enough to
live with other human beings
the people you live with wow it's such
an insight into your
life at home anna these efforts i always
think um
hello fresh is really good they can
deliver whenever you like
the recipes are super easy to cook
they're very easily explained and they
have all these different options so
you can do family recipes you can do
rapid recipes if you know you'll be
short of time
there are vegetarian recipes there are
limited edition recipes and you never
need to
enter a supermarket again and
fruitlessly wander the aisles looking
for
the specific jerk seasoning that you
might need so it's great
seasoning is for jerks i agree and also
by the way
if you're fruitlessly wandering the
aisles you might want to go to the fruit
aisle
but you never need to go to an aisle
again that's the point that's why hello
fresh comes in so handy i they genuinely
are great recipes i've been enjoying it
for a couple of years now i think
on the menu this week is a hoisin sticky
baked chicken
thighs uh steak strips and cheesy chips
and yeah like andy says there's a whole
range of stuff you can choose from
so if you would like to sample this then
you can get 50
of your first hellofresh recipe box and
35
off your next three if you use the code
a
fish at checkout at hellofresh.com.uk
that's right all you have to do is go to
hellofresh.com
and put in the offer code a fish for 50
off your first recipe box and 35 of your
following three
okay on with the show on with the show
okay it is time for our second fact and
that comes from andy
my fact is that from the 1880s until
1927
paris had an underground clock system
which ran on puffs of air
so this is uh from an article on
parisianfields.com
brilliant website all about paris and uh
some various weird things that it's got
in it
so in 1880 paris installed this series
of clocks
and uh they all kept the same time so
there were public clocks uh sort of
there as a public good
and each one of them um
was connected to an air pump and those
pumps were led to this wrought iron pipe
system
and all of that was fed from this power
plant in the middle of paris this
coal-fired plant
and every minute that system would would
pump out
a pulse of air which would get into the
clock and it would activate the small
bellows
inside the clock and it would move the
clock along by one minute
so that's how the system worked every
minute it worked
literally as regular as clockwork and um
you could subscribe
if you liked so some hotels signed up
and they basically had a kind of
subscription service to time
uh on the basis of this system
if you got a subscription service you
were agreeing that they would dig
a pipe in your floor running from your
clock back to this pneumatic system
i mean pretty much that sound yeah yeah
wow that is incredible because there was
um an article in scientific american
that said okay well there will have to
be a massive pipe in your house but
maybe you could paint it in the same
color as your wallpaper
no one will notice it lovely
yeah but yeah the whole hotel maurice
they had 148 of them
in the in the building didn't they yeah
so yeah you know
would some be a bit behind the other
because presumably you pump a little
puff of air out but it takes longer to
get to one on the outskirts of paris
does that mean they were a minute behind
i don't think it does i think they
probably adjusted for this because
uh there were these various kind of
holding stations along the way
so it wasn't like one puff had to get
either to the first
aaron dismal or the 20th so it was sort
of
it was there were a few that were a
little bit out of sync i think the
further away you were from the station
the obviously the slightly
further out it was but there were enough
of these stations that it didn't make
that much difference
um yeah you say puffs of air it was sort
of 20 seconds on 40 seconds off
so there was a caching system in there
that needed a big pump of air for a few
seconds
that would advance the minute hand and
then the next 40 seconds off would let
that sort of calm down again
so it wasn't sort of precise to the
second because nothing back then had to
be precise to the second
but it was precise enough yeah and i
wonder how often people use the excuse
when they were late to meet friends for
a cafe that oh i'm i'm actually quite a
long way from the air puffs so
it's further to get to me well i read in
popular science that it was never
allowed to exceed 10 seconds of error
so i think if you're 10 seconds late
i don't know we all know those people
are always 5 minutes late but 10
seconds i think i'm furious if anyone's
more than nine seconds
i'm absolutely limited also in paris
ten seconds late is ten minutes earlier
let's be honest very true very chic um
i kind of just it's kept going all the
way through the first world war
um you know 1927 is when it lasted until
and in fact the first time it broke down
was in 1910
and it was because the air plant was
flooded there was a huge flood of the
river center and that was the thing they
were always worried about
uh and the coal-fired plant temporarily
uh
had to be turned off and reset then and
then the clocks all stopped and there
were thousands all over the city by this
point
it's such an awesome system i don't
understand why you'd ever decommission
it
and sounds like it was an enormous
hassle to install because it's cheaper
for us to have a casio on our wrists
i think yeah i'm gonna invest in a
pneumatic wristwatch
i think i'd love to see that you
basically whenever you go into a room
you have to attach yourself to the
massive pipe
um you could have a second set of
bellows in your clocks which would do a
chime
so you would have one that would attach
to the kind of um
the minute hand and then you would be
able to divert it off and it would make
a little ding-dong
like that that's so cool that's nice
i did read though that there was a time
when in france in french
railway stations at least then clocks
were set deliberately five minutes fast
so the travelers didn't miss their
trains i think that was a thing until
about 19 10 or 11.
i think that's still a thing in
edinburgh isn't it i remember yes
yeah the balmoral clock yeah has always
been set
three minutes isn't that last it's on
the scotsman hotel right
it's on the balmoral hotel i think um
but yeah just outside
station yeah yeah yeah so the people i
think it's three minutes and
the only time that that one runs on time
is for new year so i think they they run
three minutes past all the time
and then they put it back for hogmanay
so they're not ahead of everyone else
it's a clever trick i always have my
watches run fast um there is a really
cool website i found which is a website
of stopped clocks
oh yeah yeah it was created in 2007 by a
guy called alfie dennen and it
basically is for people to submit
stopped clocks near them
you take a photo of your local the
public clock
it's not just that your clock has
stopped working in your home
um he doesn't want that it's so and so
people can campaign to get them up and
running again
unfortunately no one has posted on it
since 2014. so the website itself
has also stopped that's amazing
i i've been ranting about this for years
in london
i reckon over half of the clocks are
stopped and i've alwa i've always
thought if i took a sabbatical
i would use it to go around london and
take a tally of exactly how many clocks
are wrong and how many are right
and i do think it's more than half so
alfie dennan you've got to get that
website back up and running
yeah disgrace yeah that would be a great
user
i think so well people used to sell the
time didn't they which is such a weird
concept
so when you you know when people wanted
to know the time there were only a few
people in town who'd know it the
astronomer royal would know it
and so he used to get very annoyed in
the 19th century it was john belleville
and i think we've talked about
him before because people would knock
knock on his door and say hey mate i
hear you're an astronomer you know what
the time is
yeah but it was um it was ruth
belleville who i'm sure he must have
mentioned but um
at the same time as france had this
amazing kind of system of blowing
bits of air through to get the time we
had a lady called ruth belleville who
was walking around london saying do you
want to know the time she wanted
and people would cosplay people would
pay her to because she would
at the start of each day she would go
and set her pocket watch with the exact
type
and then she'd go around and sell it to
people it feels a bit rude
someone approaching you saying do you
want to know the time it feels a bit uh
do you want to have a good time well
that was the problem
so in 1908 there was a guy called mr
saint john nguyen
um who publicly made some comments about
ruth belleville
saying that she was using her femininity
to gain business
oh yeah you used the tricks at your
disposal
well what's sort of flirting with people
as you offer them the time yeah do you
want to have a good time or a long time
or
an accurate time and um
but then what happened was is uh what
people didn't didn't realize was
is that wynn was the director of
something called the standard time
company
which sold the time through telegraphs
and so
um he wanted people to get the type the
accurate time through the telegraph
system
and stop using people like ruth
belleville so that's why he kind of
slandered her with this
thing it feels it feels like using a
sledgehammer to crack a nut
to do you have to deliberately crush
this poor woman who's only me to becky
living is to go around asking people if
they need to know what time it is
that's so mean yeah although i i do
think that she was probably on the way
out anyway
technology wise i don't think she'd
still exist today even if he hadn't come
along
i reckon i'd be using my castle as
passing lady
i reckon you could walk around town in
london next to all those broken clocks
and just say this one's broken mate you
want to know the time
i'm on it i should say yeah they john
belleville wasn't the astronomer royal
sorry he was employed by the astronomer
royal because the astronomer was getting
so annoyed with people asking him the
time
and then ruth was his descendant that's
right i've always thought that
the sort of big synchronization of
everything to the second that we've had
uh since smartphones have come along was
basically the biggest argument
about there being some sort of weird
psychic
power like all that all that stuff you
hear about some psychic field connecting
people together
because basically on the hour every hour
to the second
somewhere in the world a huge number of
people get startled awake by alarms
like there is this wave traveling around
the world like seven a.m eight am nine
a.m
every country millions of people
suddenly get jolted awake
at the same time are you guys one of the
people who always sets you alarm for a
round number or for a non-round number
when you wake up in the morning uh round
number yeah
do you know i mean wait do you mean a
five minute do you mean like seven
o'clock or seven
well i would always like to set mine for
like 12
not twelve seven um let's say it was
seven that i woke up in the daytime
i would like to set it for 7 37 rather
than
7 30 or 7 45 yeah always the only time i
do that
is when i'm convincing myself i'm
literally going to have a two minute nap
and i'll set you know it'll be 7 30 and
i'll set 7 32 or something
i think the idea is that by looking at a
time which is slightly weird
it kind of confuses me enough that it
wakes me up slightly that i don't
kind of if it's 7 30 i'll just look at
it at 7 30 and go straight back to sleep
again
oh you think oh yeah it's a normal time
7 30 and then yeah
7 37 what the hell is this i did it from
when i was a kid and i had a paper round
so i don't know
like it's just a hangover i guess if you
were getting up at noon for your paper
around james i can see why it didn't
last
so just back to the pneumatic system in
paris this was actually not paris's last
pneumatic system
you could send someone pneumatically
driven post
in paris so you know pneumatic tubes
where you put a capsule in the caps who
gets whizzed after someone
um you could do that until 1984.
could you which is really late that is
late but it kind of still feels to me
like the future
do you know exactly putting things in
pneumatic tubes feels like what it will
be like in 300 years but actually
it's it's done it's been you're
absolutely right
i mean it is it is very futuristic it's
sort of the past version of the future
well it is efficient
it goes pretty fast uh anymore handy i
mean there's one final thing which is
just
kind of cute which is that berlin uh
used to have pneumatic nightclubs
so you would get shown to a table and
then your table had a phone on it right
and you could see and attract a stranger
across the club and you could give them
a ring because
all the tables had big numbers table
numbers lit up above them right
and you could give them a ring but if
you were shy you could send them a
pneumatic tube message
and it would sort of whoop up to their
table and it would say hey do you fancy
a drink
it sounds yeah but all the messages were
sent
via a sensor a female sensor to make
sure you weren't getting too
fresh with someone so to make sure you
weren't saying something really obscene
wait so did they have to install a
little female guard inside the tube who
stopped it halfway through and ready oh
no because
you you'd need a post office wouldn't
you you'd need a switching system
unless you've got like every tube going
to every place you need someone in the
middle who can look at the note
exactly anyway i think you might have
given the tube to a waiter who took it
to the sensor who then posted it onto
the
table i mean it sounds like a very
complicated system compared with just
normal talking but
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is james's facts
okay my fact this week is after a
penguin had to be isolated due to health
issues
zookeepers in perth are keeping him
entertained by letting him binge watch
pingu i thought we've been a bit
highbrow up to now so we should probably
talk about thank you for a while
so this is a penguin called pierre uh
they found him washed up
in australia uh and they're a little bit
worried washed up in a sort of
washed up inner celebrity psychological
sense you know
drugs gambling booze girls cocaine
incredible
so much too much krill krill addiction
so it's a washed up penguin
penguin and the thing is about penguins
right is
if you're a penguin your feathers are
really important because you might get
too cold
and also they're really important for
you to swim because they're really water
resistant
and so most birds when they molt they
kind of lose a few feathers here and a
few feathers there and they grow back
but penguins don't do that they do like
an explosive
molting period where they lose sorry
sorry i i know i know what you mean but
let's just all take a moment to
appreciate the phrase
explosive molting period because there's
feathers everywhere it's it's messy well
i'm not
i think there's an actual word for it
which is i think it's it's called a
catastrophic mulch
which is almost as entertaining do you
know what i read about this a few months
ago and i knew it had
a really impressive name but i've just
remembered the wrong word
but anyway so they have a catastrophic
malt
and so for a little while they have no
feathers but then they grow back quite
quickly
but with pierre they never really grew
back properly and so he's kind of stuck
in perth for a little while he can't
really
go can't really go anywhere else until
his feathers come back
and so he's stuck in perth he doesn't
really have any mates there
so they wanted to show him videos of
penguins which they did they showed him
videos of
certain of the rock hopper penguins in
edinburgh zoo but they also thought well
why don't we show him pingu because
pinkie's a penguin isn't he
and danielle henry who's looking after
pierre in the zoo said he probably
doesn't even realize that pingu is a
penguin he's just responding to the
colour and the movement which i suppose
it's probably james
is this a way of you working in the fact
he doesn't even know he will take me
into the that's your mainstream my next
level
my next level of the thick and steiny
and philosophy
is that penguins don't know their
penguins but they don't even know pingu
is a penguin
wow if pingu could talk would we be able
to understand him well
can pengu talk he goes wah yeah think
you can talk well we can understand him
yeah it's bizarre so did you guys look
into this as well the sort of language
of pingu it's so cool yeah
because he's pingu has only ever been
voiced by people with training in
clowning
and there's an italian is it a theater
language called gramolo or gramalot
where it's sort of sound it's designed
to sound like gibberish and they convert
the scripts from english
into penguins as they call it and then
they film those
there's a lovely interview with oliver
postgate about the clangers yeah
uh and it's exactly the same the
clangers scripts were written in english
and then translated
i i and i say translated they're just
playing on swanny whistles uh but there
is a lovely interview
that uh here we are at the beginning of
episode three when the doors get stuck
major clanger says sod it the bloody
things stuck again
and the bbc objected and required
to be changed even though it's just a
swanny one
so you've got a whistle making the
phrase sod it
the doors are stuck if you change the
script to
suddit um the doors are frothy
like it's gonna sound exactly the same
isn't it like the whistle
well apparently uh according to the
interview like this is many years later
so
who knows how much of it changed how
much but his memory here but uh they
changed to
oh dear the silly thing's not working
properly and i feel like that does have
a different kind of intonation to it i'm
with you i think the original version
would have got countless complaints i
think sodic goes
whereas oh dear goes like that
that's quite a big difference yeah isn't
it yeah that was also a wolf whistle so
my clanger translation's not uh not
great yeah the second one was more
offensive it turned out
gramalat is really interesting isn't it
because it came from
um like medieval italy and it was when
um
jesters used to go around to all the
different towns of italy
and they would want to do their plays
and their comedies
but all the different people in the
different towns didn't speak the same
language in those days or they might
have spoken a similar kind of italian
but each village would be slightly
different
and so you would have to come up it's a
bit like how mr bean is so popular all
around the world because he doesn't
really talk
so you would have to get your point
across but in a way where you don't
need to say the actual words and also
there's quite a lot of censorship so you
you want want to say the things in a way
where you're saying oh
you know the king is an [ __ ] but you
didn't want to say it in so many words
so you go
like that you just make the noises that
everyone would realize that that's what
you're saying
but you wouldn't actually say the words
it works by onomatopoeia basically
doesn't it
yeah so i saw a kind of onomatopoeia
where the sound conveys
meaning and emotion so for instance in
grammar if you wanted to say
something was big you would go boo
but if it was medium size you would go
woo hoo
and if it was really small you would say
and so everyone listening knows that
what you're talking about is something
that's big or something that's small
just by the noise that you're making
with your
with your voice yeah it's quite cool
yeah that's really cool and then
ping you became a global brand yeah so
it was exactly
badly popular you still get pingu dolls
in happy meals in japan
really wow it's really popular in japan
because they think it sounds like
japanese and people in
other countries think oh yeah he's sort
of speaking our language which shows how
the everyone thinks that he's speaking
to them
um i didn't know how they made it where
you because i thought they
would move the clay because it's
claymation pingu um
i thought they would move the clay and
sort of take a different photo at every
point
but that you have to have hundreds and
hundreds of pingus so somewhere there's
a box of pingu doing every conceivable
activity in the show
um and then if you show pingu walking
you know you take
stationary pingu and you replace him
with a pingu who's lifted up one foot
and then you replace him with the
piggy's lifted up even more so you need
eight pings just to show him walking
along
yeah they would have and you shoot all
these yeah exactly yeah that's one of
those things that in hindsight makes a
lot of sense
but yeah once you've got all of them and
you you know you need pingus where he's
being squashed into a ball
by an older angry penguin or whatever
like there are
hundreds and hundreds of them they
always need to be in the right order i
suppose and they can't operate unless
they have each other like there'll be
one pingu but in order to walk anywhere
it needs to find 10 other pingas
yeah it's a great i think it's a plot
waiting to be written it's an analogy
for how
society only works if we all work
together in one direction isn't it we're
basically all pingu
james did you just say one direction
i have a link i have a leg which is
there we go harry styles
of one direction has a tattoo of pingu
and ed sheeran has a matching one this
is the most pop culture this podcast has
ever been
wait if only dan schreiber was here for
this who got who got theirs first
because
they have a right to be pissed off i
think sheer and
i think they got it in the same same
same i've read this as well
same tattoo artist and they did it
because they got drunk and realized that
they were both pingu fans
when they were kids and so they thought
this is something that brings us
together
something definitely worth commemorating
forever i mean everyone's a pig you've
found when they're a kid
i never watched penguins i don't know
and what happened i haven't seen your
tattoos so
are you really a pig fan i keep my pinky
tattoo where i keep my pocket watch i'm
afraid
you were saying about uh when pinga gets
smacked on the head and turned into a
ball sometimes
well um some of those got banned didn't
they
there's a there's a pingu fandom page
online um of course there is of course
it's got a brilliant list of all the
episodes of pingu that have been
censored from around the world
so in the first ever episode of pingu
i've seen the video of this it's quite
violent
um ping which i think might be his
mother i have never seen pingo either i
have to admit
um but smacks pinger on the head and
just keeps whacking him on the head like
again and again and again in a really
quite violent way
uh and that got edited out by the bbc
when it was released on vhs because they
thought
we shall be showing kids basically
they're being shown to very very young
children
so you know it's like basically you
start there and then you go to grand
theft auto and then
who knows what happens and then you've
got terrorism
so the beast that's the interesting
thing because he is really naughty piggy
is really naughty and
there's a there's a version i think a
pingu after dark
pvd would sound like hotcakes uh and
actually at the north pole it's always
dark
so hang on are they from the south pole
from the south pole
south yes there's so many things in that
sentence
poor andy ed sheeran and harry styles
gathered at the north pole
what's going on we [ __ ] this up
um i don't have anything else on pingu i
have real penguins
um i've got some stuff on penguins and
talking about
colors and shapes there's some research
by nico
tinbergen who's a dutch biologist and
ornithologist
on supernormal stimulus so this is the
idea that you can build an artificial
object with sort of big
obvious features and the birds will
prefer that
over their actual mother or the actual
eggs that they're meant to lay
tim burgin took oyster catchers which
are kind of wading birds
and they sort of have small mottled
colored eggs
and he added in an egg almost as big as
the bird itself with high contrast
black and white spots and the birds
preferred
to incubate that one even though it's
clearly not an egg just because it has a
bigger stimulus
i also found several references to say
even when the egg was so big
that the bird kept sliding off it and
that is not in the original study
i checked that i can't find that
anywhere i think someone just came up
with the image of an oyster catcher just
constantly sliding off and oversized
well this should help them documentary
makers to film penguin shortly because
they
tinker around with making fake ones in
order to infiltrate
um the flocks don't they so i think
there are some documentary makers last
year or the year before who made a fake
penguin and then put
a camera on the inside of it what is it
what is it made out of is it like a
child in a tuxedo or
yeah holding a camera on its shoulder
what is it like a plaster cast or
something though
oh no it's very fluffy it's really cute
it's a baby and it's got a normal
penguin's head and then it looks like
it's just got a huge fluffy
skirt or cloak and then it's on wheels
and it wheels along and the penguins
much prefer that and get much less
stress than every human's there
and it causes problems actually there
was one uh there was one
who a researcher i think who created a
fake
penguin which one of the males started
to try and flirt with and to mate with
and his original mate came over in a
jealous rage
and attacks it and sort of ruined ruined
the fake penguin because
you know thought this is a threat to my
my man
if you're studying penguins and you're a
human actually going in with the
penguins
um that could be a problem because i'm
sure you all saw this study
this year where researchers are getting
high
off laughing gas which is produced by
the poo of penguins
so the penguin poo kind of ferments and
then it gives off this
uh what is laughing gas um
yeah it gives off nitrous oxide and then
they can it says
after nosing about in the guano for
several hours one goes completely cuckoo
feeling nosing about in iguana yeah
i think that could be a thing for us to
put in our new nightclub which is mostly
fractal patterns induced by seat going
a lot in a buggy past some plane trees
then you get to the end of the plane
trees and you get a big pile of poo to
sniff
a few yeah because actually like nitrous
oxide it's like hippie crack isn't it
they call it and it's really
bad for the environment to to make it
and stuff
so like it's really hard for the hippies
because they want to have the
nitrous oxide hit but they also don't
want to
wreck the environment but we're not
blaming the penguins for generating it
are we
no no no no but what i'm saying is like
it's quite uh an
ethical way of getting your laughing gas
fixed
to have a penguin in the corner of your
room just [ __ ] everywhere
if you have a penguin on the podium in
the nightclubs
that everyone could just gather around
and get a hit off that yeah
and then you send a little message on
your pneumatic tube saying
this nightclub is going to be fresh it's
going to be really good
they do have the same thing as we have
the cocktail party effect which i find
really amazing about penguins
so you know when you uh go into into a
crowded room you're meeting a friend in
a bar or something and it's very loud
not anymore no
do you remember i definitely recall this
yeah
you know when you're going to an illegal
rave
for the police rife you're looking for
your mate and
if they're speaking at the bar then
you'll recognize their voice and be able
to distinguish it from
the cacophony of sound all around and
penguins do this to an incredible extent
so they if they're parenting the parents
take
turns to go out and hunt and then return
to their mate who will be the one who's
sitting on the egg or looking after the
offspring and when they return they'll
return to a colony of
like 10 000 other penguins and they all
have individual calls
that they'll be able to recognize so
they'll be hearing 10 000 calls
but they'll be able to pick out the one
call that's meant for them
which is their mate saying can you come
the [ __ ] here and give me my my dinner
please
and they can they can track that down
which i think is extraordinary that is
amazing
it's incredible when you said cocktail
party effect i thought it was the thing
where you just have a lot of penguins
all together
and then just through coincidence they
all go silent at the same time
just says something really loud and
offensive over the top of everything
else
barry's been hogging the fish
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hi everybody just let you know we are
sponsored this week by a
babble bubble yes now babble is a
brilliant
app and web is it a website it's
everything james
this isn't part of it andy i know but it
is everything
it's an app it's a website you name it
okay it's all those things
and it's all those things which will
help you to learn a new language so
for instance i have been learning
russian recently i've been using bubble
and andy do you know what the russian
for podcast is
i don't it's podcast oh
and you see that is the kind of intense
learning experience that you can only
get with barrel
um i did know that tractor is traktor
but that is that's all i know i'll be
honest a lot of russian people do speak
quite good english so if you just say
english things in a russian accent then
you will get by
but if you want to get by even better
than that then you can use
babble because babel has a very clear
interface
it helps you go from basically nothing
to being able to know
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
words in kind of like a quite
amusing and fun and simple way it is
quite fun i've been learning german via
babel and
uh it's it's really fun you sort of get
to eavesdrop on people's conversations
and then fill them in yourselves and
there are kind of
all these different ways of learning so
you can learn either through
interactive dialogue or through uh sort
of
visual tests or through flash cards
there are all these different methods
uh it's super fun it's available as an
app so you can learn on the go if you
like and they've got 14 languages
wow so babel at the moment is offering
our listeners six months free with a
purchase of a six month subscription
and all you need to do to get that is go
to babel dot co dot uk
slash play and use the promo code fish
that is right and it's babble
b-a-b-b-e-l
dot co dot uk forward slash play and as
james says put in the off code fish and
you will get
six months of free trips to the kranken
house or to the tractor
factory i don't know the russian food
truck factory
okay podcaster
i haven't done that in german yet
[Music]
all right it's time for our final fact
of the week and that is my fact and my
fact this week
is that the person who measured the
world's tallest tree
did so by climbing to the top of it and
dropping a tape measure down
how smart how else would you do it it
makes more sense than standing at the
bottom of it and slowly pushing the tape
measure upwards hoping it doesn't bend
you know those yeah those mechanical
ones where you can keep pushing it up
and then that was the game you always
played as a kid wasn't it to see how far
you could get it before it collapsed on
itself
yeah i don't think you ever got it as
tall as this tree
i'm fairly sure that there's the world
tape measure championship somewhere
which is entirely about
how far you can extend that oh my god so
anna when you're taking your year off to
do all the clocks of london this is what
i'm gonna do train for this
championships i i say that but that may
just have been something that some
friends of mine did once
it seems like something there must be i
mean why wouldn't there
i think there are guinness records for i
don't know if there's a record for the
longest tape measure
it feels like we're missing the main
point of this which is that there's a
massive tree so there's a tree sorry
there's a tree yeah i think it's mostly
about the tape measures
which i should specify probably is it's
not one of your
you know day-to-day tape measures i
think he just dropped some tape from the
top once he got there
and then they would have measured that
but this is this amazing guy called
steve
sillett who is an ecologist and he's
been really into tall trees since the
80s
and she's the first person who ever
ended up in a redwood tree canopy
so i think it was like 1987 he was 19
and he saw a redwood tree a giant
redwood looked at it
and then ran at it and scaled it and
went up about you know almost 300 feet
and thought well i love this i'm gonna
do this for a living
and he's sort of is one of our leading
botanists
and he um identified this tree the tree
is called hyperion
it's a coast redwood in california and
it's 116 meters tall which is
sort of significantly higher than the
statue of liberty and
he yeah some hikers came across it and
thought that looks like a big tree
let's tell someone about it you can't
just like put a helicopter above all the
trees and just say oh that's the tallest
one can you because the undulations in
the land
they might be growing the bottom might
be lower right yeah
uh well i think measuring trees is
difficult although there are
other ways to do it like easy ways to do
it but this guy happens to love climbing
them
so they called this guy and that's the
most accurate way of doing it you get it
you know to the nearest center actually
uh hang on hang on how do you define the
top of a tree
because if he's dropped the tape measure
down he can't be perched on top of the
highest leaf
that's what it's a really good point
he's got two tape measures one he goes
he pushes up
using the harken method exactly yeah
exactly and then the other one he drops
so
he has to add the two together so it's
an extra line on the spreadsheet at the
end but
i think he might give the tape measure
to a passing bird
and ask it to just or maybe a little ant
or something and ask it to scale those
last few leaves
an ant yeah well you need something very
light don't and maybe then the ant gives
it to an even smaller ant that just does
a little bit top
exactly yeah isn't he afraid of heis
this guy steve said he does have a fear
of heights yeah
i mean he's picked the worst job i'm
skeptical about whether
feeling nervous when you've scaled 300
over 300 foot redwood and looking down
and feeling nervous is a fear of heights
or just kind of a rational human
response to being a dangerous situation
but he he does claim its fear of heights
yeah so
i have a theory that this isn't the
tallest tree in the world
ah um my theory is that
the largest tree in the world is a fig
tree in south africa
and that's because i'm counting the
route to tip
so i'm including the roots and there is
a fig tree
above the echo caves in limpopo which is
only about 10 meters above the ground
but its roots reach
120 meters underground
so from the bottom of the roots to the
top i reckon it's longer because redwood
roots are all quite shallow and quite
wide
they don't go particularly deep like
most roots don't go that deep but this
one they go super deep
i don't think it's a theory so much as a
trick a language
trick yeah fair enough
i know i think i think that tree's got a
claim it can shout that to all the
surrounding trees towering above it if
it makes it feel better
i think again there's like some kind of
story that we can all
relate to about being small but
underneath being
really anyway
yeah these caves in limpopo basically
the fig figs do have
long roots anyway but they were
searching for water and they went all
the way down
because in this cave there's like a big
water system and we only found out
about the roots because people went into
this cave and saw the roots and thought
where the hell do they come from because
we're so far on the ground and then they
worked out that it was this tree
that's really cool that's amazing i mean
that must be deeper than lots of
underground lines yeah oh yeah for sure
yeah yeah
it's extraordinarily deep given that
most i think most tree roots
don't even go low more than one meter
below the ground
120 meters it's gone insane it could be
just wrong of course because like
the tallest tree that was ever measured
okay ever
this was a eucalyptus in australia it
had fallen down and they measured it and
it was 133 meters high which would be
higher than hyperion but most people now
think that they just didn't
measure it correctly because they've
never found any other
eucalyptuses that were nearly that tall
and it was in 1871 when
maybe tape measures weren't quite as
good as they are today yeah
that is obviously the easiest way to
measure a tree is to cut it down and do
it long ways
but not recommended we i don't think
we've ever mentioned donald curry
on this podcast who is he do you
remember him he was a
he was a tree researcher in the 60s
and he was taking samples from a really
old tree
called prometheus and two of his um
drill bits
broke inside the tree he was trying to
remove a little core
see how old it was and he asked for
permit he said well this is really
annoying because i need to know how old
this tree is
and he asked for permission from the u.s
forest service to cut it down
and they granted permission so he
chopped down the tree and it turned out
to be almost 5000 years old and it was
the oldest
tree that had ever been discovered and
he chopped it down
and he later switched to studying lakes
which he promptly drilled into and
drained i just need to drain this lake
to find out how old it is i'm sorry
um just to say you can't just in case
you want to go and find hyperion the
world's tallest tree you can't
so don't try they keep the location of
these trees top secret now so people
don't go and accidentally sort of
kill them with love i think is how um i
think it might been steve siller who
said it
like that you know you go you hug it you
trample on its roots
you take it it kind of etch your name
into it and stuff
exactly because you get so much yeah he
also thinks that its growth might have
been stunted
so it could have got even higher but
there's a woodpecker that lives right at
the top i think right at the top
and it looks like it's just damaged the
tip no oh my god
yeah so that's so frustrating uh
something else
or someone else who was measured by um
dangling a tape measure
is the world's tallest ever woman
okay so um i kind of heard about the
world's tallest man quite a lot who was
um
wild low something like that william
wadlow or something robert
robert that's right but i'd never really
read about the tallest woman
and she's got a name that's really easy
for qi fans to remember can you guess
what that would be
stephen fry no sanji toxific
sandy is right and surname fry no alan
sandy allen so she was the tallest ever
woman and she um worked at an oil
company
and her co-workers realized that she was
really tall it's kind of sad because she
had a pituitary
issue um but her co-workers realized
that she was really tall
and so they climbed up on a load of
chairs and desks
and then dangled to tape measure from
the top of her head to the bottom
and then took a photo of it and sent it
to guinness and guinness
used that to say yes this is the tallest
lady that's ever lived
and then she became really famous she
was in a film with donald sutherland
uh and she would go around initially
kind of doing
you know ripley's believe it or not
shows but then eventually she went round
going to different like schools and
churches and stuff like that not for
money
um just to do talks about how if you're
different
it doesn't really matter and you know
you can make the most of what you
what you are and stuff like that and she
had her own phone number that people
could ring which was 1888
big sandy and they would play her little
um
speech that she did always did about how
being tall is no problem
and then she was she married to tom
cruise for a while
i feel like she was yeah it certainly
looked that way
but it wasn't um but yeah and then um
eventually like she did get sick and um
ended up in
in a home and in the home that she was
in which was in shelbyville indiana she
was there at the same time as
edna parker who was the world's oldest
living human
at the time so you could go to this
retirement home place
and see the world's tallest woman and
the world's oldest person at the same
time if you wanted
but she's really cool like this lady
honestly i've never heard about her
she's super cool god i wonder what the
tension was like between those two
they i bet there was like two clans like
the jets and the sharks in that old
people's home
i think that would be a great um that's
a great setting for a crime scenario
um like they're crime solvers you know
one of them's old
and one of them's tall oh yeah
commission that it's
serious every single crime is related to
a high concealed clue or something that
happened in 1912
this reminds me of something that
happened in the stockholm olympics
oh um but our book about the stockholm
olympics is on the top shelf
it's okay
yeah this is gonna be like the nightclub
this is gonna be
fresh yeah yep i got the christie eat
your heart out
i read a survey of tape measure
ownership in the uk
and the 77 of 18 to 24 year olds own a
tape measure
and 100 percent of the over 65s own to
take measure
100 wow that's a lot i want to know what
proportion of that 100 of people
actually would be able to locate the
tape measure if you ask them to
50 max i am in my 30s and had to buy a
tape measure last year for a thing and
now i own a tape measure
it feels like at some point there is
going to be a draw in your house and
it's going to have a tape measure you
never because people don't get rid of
them
why would you no yeah why would you ever
get rid of a tape measure
it's not big enough to to kind of have
to throw out because you're moving it
just sits in the box of stuff you know
who would own a tape measure
the world's oldest woman
you know who she'd measure yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
i think we're there with that yeah
okay that's it that's all of our facts
for this week if you want to get in
touch with any of us
you can contact these guys on twitter so
james is on

show that we're going to be doing in a
couple of weeks so you can go to no such
thing as a fish.com for all the details
about that
but for now that's all from us we'll be
back again next week with another four
facts see you then good bye

=340
[Music]
[Applause]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
is dan schreiber i am sitting here with
james harkin
andrew hunter murray anna cerzinski and
once again we have gathered round the
microphones with our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order
here we go starting with you andy
my fact is that along with their drink
new yorkers in bars used to be served as
sandwich
full of rubber
yummy yum yum yum why on earth would
that be
well this is a sort of
legal loophole that bars had to jump
through in order to serve their
customers so
um there's also something called the
reigns law basically
uh people were trying to curb public
drunkenness in the 1890s in america and
in particular in new york
and this politician called john rains
got this law passed which was designed
to put
nasty bars out of business so there were
various
you know the cost of a liquor license
tripled and you had to keep your
curtains open on a sunday
so that police officers could all sorts
of things wow
the law was partly designed to shut down
sunday drinking and that was very
annoying for people and for bars because
it was the most profitable day of the
week and it was most people's only day
off
um but there was a loophole in the law
where if you were serving a meal
you could serve a drink with it any day
of the week as long
as you were a lodging house with 10
rooms or more okay
so all these bar owners suddenly teamed
up
with lodging houses and they opened just
one room on the ground floor in the
basement they said oh this
is this is a dining room for an
establishment you know this is not a
there's not a bar at all
and they said they were serving meals to
the guests at the lodging houses
and what the meal consisted of was this
single sandwich
which would sometimes have a little puck
of rubber in the middle or it would
sometimes just be a weak old sandwich
which you would get given with your
drink and the barman said there there's
your meal
and then they take away the sandwich
immediately they'd leave it there for
two seconds and then take it away to the
next table
and it would be served to whoever else
had also ordered a meal with their drink
and that's the loophole i read that
sometimes the sandwich was either a rock
or a brick between two slices of bread
yeah that's taking the piss out of the
loophole a bit right
it is taking the piss and yet they went
to court over it and they said
well no it looks like they are serving a
meal so i don't know who the judge was
for that case but uh
yeah yeah there was actually there was
an incident i think
where in about 1902 police were called
to a bar because there was a massive
brule two guys are about to kill each
other
and one of the people was a customer
who'd been genuinely hungry
so he'd ordered a sandwich and the
inkkeeper had brought him the sandwich
and then tried to take it away and the
customer had started eating it and been
like i wanted a sandwich mate
and then keep said no no you don't
understand we don't really eat these
and it ended up in a huge fight and the
law enforcement arrived
and said look there's been a
misunderstanding it's just pretend
sandwich is here
give it back to the barman and we won't
prosecute you for trying to eat your
restaurant lunch that's so funny that's
brilliant
i love how much this backfired on john
raines who put this law in place for the
sunday drinking
for the fact that the sandwich itself
became known as the reigns
sandwich yeah uh the fact that all these
new establishments that opened up in
order to
use that loophole to their advantage
were called reigns hotels
i mean they really slapped this guy in
the face with his own
[ __ ] law yeah but and it was it was
bad as well because
uh not only did the number of hotels
rocket so brooklyn went from having 13
actual hotels to having 800 hotels
in six months which is insane but there
were lots of beds nearby obviously so it
led to lots of casual sex and
prostitution happening because
you got really really drunk not eating
your sandwiches and then there was
there was a bedroom right upstairs yeah
so yeah they had to have a minimum of 10
rooms didn't they
yeah but they tended to be just tiny
little boxes with a bed in there
yeah i just want to say for the people
at home um because andy is doing a
really good job of
um saying it with his voice but he is
actually doing the
um imaginary quote marks every time he
does
um like say hotel or
star of witch i certainly am
james
do you think the rubber sandwiches is
the origin of all american cheese today
oh sick on american cheese yeah
there is still a kind of rain sandwich
today and it's been brought in this year
in new york this is really exciting
new stuff so it's because of the
coronavirus new york introduced rules
about serving alcohol when you can get a
proper drink and it it said you have to
order food
there is a bar in buffalo new york which
has a food menu
and sorry hang on let me just say that
again a food
menu there yeah um it includes items
like
just a few grapes uh nine french fries
and literally the smallest piece of
cheesecake you'll ever see
and they all cost a dollar and they are
all they're all technically food
and they're designed to get around
safety legislation which is really meant
to be helping the situation
wait what's the idea sorry with the with
the safety is that so it'll only so no
one can share your food
i think it's because they want they
don't want loads of people going to bars
all the time
um but they don't mind people going to
restaurants a bit
i i think that's the design it's not
because people are sharing food
leading to the spread to stop the
obesity crisis
if everyone's only eating the smallest
piece of cheesecake you've ever seen
absolutely getting one grape for dessert
you know but no one else is gonna finger
that one grape if that's all you've got
so
you know it's a good good for the
germans the bars in
um late 19th century new york sound
pretty amazing
these places um there was one um
apparently the earliest ones that were
in the bowery area of new york they
didn't have glasses they just had
a barrel of beer or boots some kind of
booze
and what you did is you you would pay
three cents and they would give you a
rubber tube
and for your three cents you're allowed
to drink until you ran out of breath
and so what people learn how to do is
you know like um
some musicians can do this circular
breathing which means you can play notes
for longer and longer
some people learned how to do that so
they didn't have to breathe through
their mouths they could just breathe
through their noses and they could just
drink
more and more and more wow that's so
funny
you'd have to ban ban anyone who
belonged to an orchestra
yeah you see a bunch of guys with
didgeridoos turning up no absolutely not
out you go
out
yeah the bowery sound amazing right like
back in the 19th century it was just
packed with
so many bars that went outdoor and it
was largely men playing cards and
drinking and having
little meals and so on and and i've i've
actually been to them
in gangs of new york there's a whole
scene where someone has a little meal
isn't that
i remember i love the i love the fight
and the tapas joint
leonardo dicaprio digs into a campaign
i've been to the barrier i don't know if
you guys have that sort of area of new
york i've actually performed there i
i did a performance as a drag queen i
had to create a drag queen character i
was called
ganomite yeah i was dynamite it came
with that explosion sound
and um and there's still the remnants of
this kind of
awesome um bohemianness about it which i
imagine what these 19th century bars
must have been like you know this kind
of
wild sort of outlawy kind of place can
we go back to your drag
career briefly yeah right and you you
have to do it it's quite kind of fetish
that name i think
daniel might oh yeah
i was i was interviewing um a famous
drag act
in america in new york and as part of
the interview
she uh as linda suggested that i
experience it so she made me come up
with a character she dressed me up and
then we did this big bingo night
at the bowery and i was dynomite
oh was that part of the name actually
would that have been
in your passport it would have said oh
my and then
no no it's it's it's it's explosion it's
not head explodes
it's just the way you did for people at
home dad did the head exploding
um gesture so yes sorry that is
confusing for the
a lot of the shows so far relied on some
visuals
nothing to anyone um
you might have fit in quite nicely at
billy mcglaury's armory hall
then which was the hardest chorus of all
the bars
in new york in that time so um whenever
you
went there and got drunk you would
basically always get robbed that was
that was just known that that would
happen and it would be by
either the female regulars or uh billy
mcglory used to hire men dressed as
women to go
and rob people in the bar uh so you
would get
basically you would get robbed and then
they would drag you from your table a
bouncer would drag you from the table
they would throw you out in the street
and then when you were outside the
bouncer would try and get anything else
that was left on you
and then if there was anything left at
all the people walking past would get it
and then if you didn't have anything
they would steal your clothes so
basically
you just don't if you got drunk there
you would end up naked outside without
your phone without your wallet without
anything
why do people go to the spot why do they
keep going to the pub
it was it was well known as being an
extremely kind of rough place that
locals would go and it was the people
from out of town that would get
get the treatment but a lot of people
would go because there was like a
balcony upstairs
because it kicked off so often in this
pub that people would pay to sit in the
balcony so they could watch the fights
happening
wow wow isn't that amazing um i was just
looking at
i was looking a little bit at the
temperance movement in britain which was
also quite strong
around these parts so america didn't
have monopoly on it and this is
throughout the 19th century and william
gladstone who was obviously prime
minister multiple times tried to
temper people's alcohol consumption and
drunkenness by encouraging people to
sell wine
and encouraging the wider consumption of
wine in fact and
it was because everyone was drinking
spirits and he thought that this would
be a more sophisticated sort of drinking
which
we all know um is always successful but
he also
made like he also made it so the food
shops and grocers
didn't need a license to sell alcohol so
they could all start selling alcohol
and again this was to encourage people
not to get so drunk
because he wanted to end what he called
the unnatural divorce between
food and alcohol so the idea is that you
know you either go to a bar or you go to
a grocery shop
so people just you know get really drunk
without eating but the controversial
thing about the grocers
was that it meant that women would be
able to buy
alcohol so obviously if you could only
buy alcohol in bars
bit risque for a woman to go to a bar
definitely not on her own
but if they were going on a food shop
they could buy a bottle of wine and
there's paper written on it which said
obtaining alcohol from a licensed grocer
is regarded as perfectly acceptable if
women are using it for dining cooking
and entertaining
however there are concerns that some
women are purchasing alcohol for their
own personal use never so
extremely controversial wow um just
while we're on the bowery i defined one
or two
more good names of bars that were in the
barrier in the late 19th century there
was
uh the burnt rag there was chick
tricker's flea bag
and mcgurk's suicide hall
now i can't work out exactly why
mcgurk's suicide hall was so named but
it was the first ever bar to deploy an
armed bouncer
and his name was his name was eat him up
jack mcmanus
he sounds like a wrestler doesn't he he
does he absolutely does
i think he basically was he would he was
repeatedly arrested for assault
and yet every time it came to do an
actual police lineup people mysteriously
had an attack of amnesia when they were
asked to point out
which absolute thug is the one who beat
you up some of the most famous bouncers
around that time in new york were women
so there was one called gallus meg uh
and i'll read you this quote about her
it was her custom after she'd failed an
upstream
customer with her club to clutch his ear
between her teeth
and drag him to the door amid the frenzy
cheers of onlookers
though she would knock you out with a
club and they'd grab your ear with her
teeth and drag you by the ear with her
teeth
and then what would happen is if the
victim tried to fight back she would
bite the ear off
and then they would put it in a jar and
they would keep all the ears behind
the bars
i'm telling you this happened this
happened because she had
an enemy who was another female bouncer
known as sadie the goat
okay and say to the goats once had her
ear bitten off by gallus meg
in 1869 and she had to leave the area in
disgrace because she'd been kicked out
this bar and she'd lost the fight to
gallus meg
and she walked down to the waterfront
and she saw a few people trying to kind
of rob a boat
and they were failing quite badly and
she was like okay i'm gonna help you
guys out here and she helped them to rub
this boat
and then they decided to take over the
boat put a jolly roger
on the front of it and sail up and down
the river
just stealing things from people and
kidnapping people and becoming like
pirates
and they did this for quite a few weeks
uh until eventually
um the locals decided to get guns and
stop them from doing it
and so once she'd done all that and
finished all that she went back to
the bar where dallas meg was and kind of
made up with her
and gallus meg gave her her ear back
which she always wore the lockets around
the neck for the rest of her life
wow so she labeled the jaws of whose ear
as well i mean because that's
if you're wearing an earring you would
know which one was yours wouldn't you
awesome there we go
i think i'd recognize my own ear in a
jar of ears would you do you think you'd
have to go to the bar and show them your
other ear and say have you got one that
looks like this
yeah yeah have you got a size
size eight don't go into the back yeah
yeah like this i'm sorry this is all we
have left that this one's
twice the size it was a really big dude
um did you know they used to flavor
drinks
with dead rats temperance and
prohibition
yeah do they drink prohibition what to
put people off
no to put people to turn people on
well well there you go
this the bars had to come up or speaking
you had to come up with such imaginative
ways
of simulating the taste of what had been
legitimate alcohol
because they were getting all their
alcohol from sort of uh
petrol and you know this uh campstow
fuel
and like ink used alcohol to make it so
you have to
try and make that taste a bit like gin
and so apparently to simulate the flavor
of bourbon
you added dead rats or rotten meat to
moonshine and you let it sit for a few
days
that's right apparently so then you take
it out and similarly to simulate
scotch you wanted a smoky flavor and
apparently there was creosote which is
like an antiseptic made from tar
and that would make it taste nice and
smoky wow but
the temperance movement is still going
strong in the u.s in various states
i mean like utah if you try and buy
alcohol in utah it's it's not pill stock
sometimes
i didn't know that utah until 2017 every
single bar
had to have not an iron curtain but a
zion curtain
are you familiar with this i wasn't but
i saw this as well it's amazing isn't it
it's crazy so basically it's a barrier
has to be erected between customer and
bartender
so that no customers can see any of the
drinks being poured or mixed and the
idea
is that it um protects young people and
innocent people from their glamour of
bartending and drinking
right and so it's you just sit at a barn
you've got this big
perspex shield in your face all the time
yeah it's always like frosted glass
isn't it so you can't see them
are you like looks like they're holding
a rat what is that
all they need to do to stop the glamour
of bartending is just introduce
weatherspoons to utah
no one will see the impossible glory of
drinking
imagine if they filmed cocktail in utah
and they had tom cruise doing all these
dances but you can't see it because
there's a frosted screen in front of
them
do you think every time you order a
hendrix they actually just chuck a
gordon's in because you're not gonna
know are you
no yeah i bet they never say is pepsi
[Laughter]
okay
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
anna my fact this week is that dead fish
can swim upstream
absolutely insane um and this i have to
say thank you to someone called robert
tealing who sent me
a link to this ages ago and i came
across it again
and basically this was sort of
discovered by mistake a few
years ago when scientists at mit and
harvard were
looking at how trout cope when they're
swimming upstream but behind an obstacle
so imagine if you're in the water and
you've got a rounded obstacle in front
of you
that deflects some of the current so it
goes around the sides of you so it's a
bit easier
if you're sitting behind that kind of
thing a bit like a slipstream yeah
exactly and so they were looking at like
putting live chat in the water and
seeing how that worked
and then according to this article they
unintentionally
uh that's those quote marks again uh
they unintentionally
put a dead trout in the water behind
this rounded objects
and they were completely amazed to see
it swam
upstream so it swam towards this
obstacle but properly sort of like
swimming like like you would see a fish
swim and then eventually it would get
really really close and then you're in
sort of a suction region which really is
like a slipstream
where it got sucked into the obstacle
bounced back
and landed back where it started and
swam towards it again
yeah and just kept doing this there's a
video online you can see of it right
it's
it's pretty amazing basically like a
zombie
fish it's pretty mad that that's
actually dead
isn't it the case though that so if you
were to say um
by a river bed and there was a fish
swimming upstream most likely
it is alive because it's
i think that is true yeah i i read the
sleep most fish yeah
see swimming are alive yeah just like
it's important not to let this kind of
misinformation get out
without correcting you don't want people
going down to the river with their
friends and family just going see that
fish that's swimming
dead one probably dead as well
no such thing as a live fish turns out
yeah
but also the circumstances like they
were saying that when they put
the dead trout in it happened to land in
the sweetest of sweet spots
that if it was in any other conditions
that never would have happened so
again it's sort of you just wouldn't
probably see that in nature ever
really well you i think you might do a
bit so the way it works
is some very complicated fluid dynamics
but i think
very simplified uh when you've got kind
of a rounded object in water and you've
got a current going past it
it as the current goes past it it
generates these little vortexes
of water and what seems to be happening
is that this pattern of spiraling
vortexes
makes the fish spine move in a specific
way that sort of propels it so fish are
very flexible spines
and these vortexes sort of give energy
to the fish
so the fish takes energy from the
vortexes and then swims
upstream but yeah you do have to be in a
particular place and fish
yeah there aren't loads of dead fish
jumping upstream
to source but it does mean that a fish
could swim with no effort doesn't it
yeah a fish could not use its muscles at
all and it would still if it was in this
right spot get upstream which is pretty
cool yeah
and so it's incredibly useful to fish
this um
phenomenon because yeah they'll and
they're incredibly sensitive
so they can tell the movement of water
behind certain rocks so they'll sort of
sense the vortexes that are behind a
rock and then they can swim towards that
rock
and that will mean that they have to
expend much less energy because the rock
just sort of sucks them towards it
it's very useful one thing in looking
into this fact that i never realized and
probably you three
did know this but so a fish swims as we
all know
i'm doing it with my hands here but in
the sort of fishy motion right it's sort
of
it's it's swimming perfectly yeah
so it's it's spine allows for it from
its head to its tail
it's a sort of um it's a wave landscape
almost yeah it's like landscape
mode but for it's in landscape mode it's
not in portrait mode
portrait mode sea horses support traits
because you're in landscape
yeah we're finding it very hard to
describe this um
the spines go along whereas for mammals
um so dolphins and so on the spines go
like our spine so they move up and down
as opposed to oh your spine on a dolphin
goes along the very top of the dolphin
right
whereas in the fish it goes right
through the middle of the fish
exactly and that's that's the
distinction between what is
a fish and what is a mammal in the ocean
and i'd never realized that before and
that's why their fins are positioned
differently as well on their body
yeah that's very cool so fish wouldn't
be able to do butterfly stroke for
instance would they
is butterfly the fastest or is it the
slowest i can't remember got to be the
slowest
no it's not the breaststroke
breaststroke's probably the slowest i
think it's in between
it's neither it's it is fast it's fast
but it's not as fast as front crawl for
instance
okay i was i was reading about michael
phelps's top speed that's why
there is there is method here um there
you've sort of said
an incorrect fact that wouldn't have
even been that interesting if it were
correct
but it's gonna it's gonna bring him on
to this very interesting effect that
he's about to say about that
front loading pressure onto my quite bad
facts before i've said that thank you
sorry please go on it was just i was
just kind of amazed at how crap at
swimming we are relative to fish
because the fastest fish swim at about
70 miles an hour
the fastest submarines don't even do
that much and some of them are nuclear
power they go at about 50 miles an hour
absolutely top speed wow michael michael
phelps
maybe the greatest swimmer of all time
can do about 4.7 miles an hour and he
can do that for 100 meters and then he
has to stop
andy you saying top speed of a fish was
what for that i said 70 miles an hour
70 miles an hour and that's yeah so the
the very fastest ones
obviously yeah exactly there's a few
amazing fast ones so swordfish and
sailfish and so on i was looking at a
list of the fastest fish
my favorite one uh just for its name uh
because of its speed and i don't know if
the name is tied in with the speed but
it's called the
whoa
w-a-h-o-o okay
yeah it has to be right it has to be
there just like
it's just having and is it is it
particularly fast
yeah yeah it's um uh it goes just under
a few miles an hour under the fastest
speed of fish have you ever seen a fish
treadmill oh god everyone like
almost every week whatever animal we're
discussing they seem to go on a
treadmill don't they
well i'm starting to feel a little bit
self-conscious that i don't go on
treadmills because
every other animal kingdom seems to i
think whenever we discuss an animal on
this podcast we shouldn't mention if
it's been on a treadmill but we should
always mention if it hasn't
that's the interesting fact at this
point ants have
never been on treadmills that's a good
point
what are they doing on treadmills well
obviously it's not a rubber treadmill as
we would understand it but it's for
scientists to
experiment on how fish propel themselves
so they have to get a you know a tank
with a
current flowing in one direction and
they they then put
plastic particles in the water and they
record where they go
as the fish swims so you can kind of see
how the fish is thrusting
so you can see the directions that all
the water is moving
as well so it's like one of those things
in a water park where you sit on a
rubber ring and it just takes you slowly
around the water park
like that kind of thing like a lazy
river
yes but except in this version of the
water park you are having to resist the
flow of the current
uh to keep yourself in the same place
for hours on end okay but that's when
you're on those things if you don't have
a rubber ring the best thing is to try
and beat the currents isn't it you're
really trying to
swim as fast as you can against the
current and then normal people on the
river rings are going what the [ __ ] are
you doing
this is a rubber ring thing i'm like no
i'm having fun
aren't you being clocked by people in
rubber rings coming past you
this is why you're not allowed to go to
slide and splash anymore james
that's the reason so many reasons
and so they've just found a load of new
fish that can actually walk
on land i think we've always known there
were one or two of these
they've just looked at a bunch of fish
and looked at um
like the way their pelvic bones are and
they've worked out that there's at least
11 species of fish that definitely can
walk on land
so cool yeah they're not good at walking
though are they they're not yeah
like when you see a seal on a on the
sand sort of flapping its fins around
well i think that's the thing
i think why that andy was a little bit
unfair about michael phelps
because you know it's not like fish are
able to run as quickly as us so why are
we expected to be able to swim as fast
as them
there should be a competition which is
to work out the species on earth which
is least crap at
everything the best all-rounder the best
all-rounder it must be a kind of bird
right because nothing else nothing else
can fly
so you know or actually a flying fish
fly flying fish
oh come on it's not flying it's just
sort of jumping quite high
oh they're quite good they put they put
flying fish in
a um what they call a wind tunnel quite
recently
some scientists it was a dead one but
they filled it with stuff to make it
like as
sturdy as an alive one and they found
out that it's
the way that it glides is actually
almost as good as some of the best
gliders in the avian kingdom like there
we go
there we go that's a strong contender
they can fly they can swim when they're
dead
this is a very strong contender there
must be a bird which can
swim really i was thinking pretty well i
was thinking ducks
i mean they're pretty [ __ ] at everything
aren't they they're [ __ ] at walking
their shits are swimming
and they're not great at flying but they
can they can do them all of it yeah
yeah i think actually the duck is a very
strong contender
for this incredibly boring yeah
whether it felt you know that's probably
where the sprinting actually i don't
know if phelps is going to be the human
rep for the thing i'm just sort of
filling him in because if you think
about it the triathlon which is swimming
running and cycling the cycling bit is a
bit of a
fake i mean it's a fake spot isn't it we
invented the bicycle it's not natural
it should be swimming running and flying
[Laughter]
although it would be fun to put a trout
on a bicycle and see how it fared
in a triathlon yeah
the british government has its own fish
farm which i didn't know and it breeds
tons and tons of fish every year just to
fill up ponds around the place
it's really cool why do they fill up
well they're very
are all these sort of bodies of water
which uh you know i don't know
for fishes for fisheries part is partly
for fishermen but it's also partly i
think for general health and to keep
species
in good nick but it's called uh the
national coarse fish farm
and last year they produced 12.3 tons of
fish
to put in rivers and ponds they released
7.6 million
fish and you just they're just sending
bags around the country of fish
and buckets of fish and then that you
get to release hundreds and hundreds of
them into a river
it looks really fun and they do fish
rescue as well
because sometimes sometimes the hot
weather
uh will cause rivers to flow very low or
oxygen levels will drop
and this can be you know fatal to fish
which needs certain levels of oxygen in
the water so they have to go and they
either relocate the fish or they pump
oxygen into the water
in these places i know i want to find
out more about these people because this
sounds like a really cool
government body to you know fish the
government gets a lot of stick these
days but no one's
no one's saying about how they're
pumping oxygen into water
right no one talks about the national
course fish farm and i think it's a damn
shame
is that how fish get in lakes because
i've always wondered because i mean how
do they get there you know you see a
lake and it's a relatively new one
it's only been around for a few hundred
years full of fish what the [ __ ] is it
done i mean it hasn't walked so we've
discussed that they are quite bad at
walking even if they can do it a bit
mental and some fish might go like this
i guess
yeah but lakes lakes which don't have a
you know lakes which don't have any
waterways moving into them
yeah maybe it's the national coarse fish
rearing unit
that's what it is god although you know
like what is god if it's not really in
some ways the fish god
is the national course river fish thing
well we've really we've built up this
government body only is it cool
but it's also god-like um salmon and
trout very good at swimming upstream
kind of as disgust but they have to be
right this is why this is so useful this
fact that they can even do it when
they're dead because they swim all the
way back upstream to spawn
um in their place of birth and they
actually do that by smelling
so they have stored in their brain the
smell of their home so where they're
born
they swim all the way downstream and
they retain it and then when they get to
breeding stage
something is triggered in their brain
which makes them desperately want to
return to that smell
oh my god so does that mean it's like as
if
you could smell where you were conceived
and you go back to the place where you
were conceived is that what that is yeah
and one day you'll start lusting after
that james crawling your way back to the
hospital in bolton
was james conceived in a hospital
yeah that was it yeah it was
inappropriate that they were doing that
um they sort of if they go too far
upstream they lose the smell
and they have to go back downstream pick
up the smell again
and then try and what it's like that
game sort of
warmer warmer colder colder you know
they they and then eventually this
matters strong enough they find exactly
the tributary off
the main river but they also need um
what this is one of the big arguments
against reintroduction of beavers you
know that's the latest
great controversy in this country and
beavers that's the main one actually at
the moment
i would say beaver's first covered
second brexit third
yeah um how much oxygen to put in the
waterfall
gotta bump that up uh so beavers make
dams and so then salmon have to jump
over those dams
and you i didn't realize there's an
exact equation
for how deep the plunge pool in front of
a dam has to be
for a salmon to make it over the height
of it
so you need a sort of a run-up just like
you do then a thing they need to run up
from a great depth to propel themselves
out with water and over it
and it needs to be exactly 1.25 or more
1.25 times the height of the dam that's
how deep it has to be
okay and yeah at the moment they're sort
of thinking reintroducing beavers in
chalk streams where the plunge balls
won't be that deep and we'll just have
lots of sort of
dead salmon i suppose caught in the dams
yeah yeah caught in the dam and how will
we know that they're dead because
they're still swimming
there's no way to tell i think salmons
might be as good at flying as ducks are
at swimming
well what's that sport at the olympics
where you have to jump over the bars as
you go down the hundred meters
hurdles hurdles if they've got this damn
jumping all sorted
yeah really good at hurdles in water are
they going along a dry track
den or are they in water with hurdles in
the steeplechase they have one water
jump which they would absolutely nail
but all of the other ones they would
really struggle
my team's going to suck at this olympics
he's entered the salmon into the hurdles
dan's team of the animal kingdom walking
around
after all of the different countries
have gone past
the animal kingdom flag with a trout
flopping along beyond it
well at least they can train on all
those treadmills before they get there
that's true
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
james okay my fact this week is that
when the berlin wall fell
one of the results was an 18 million the
car traffic jam
crazy 18 million oh my days
that is a lot how many cars were there
in germany well did everyone in germany
get in their cars and say we got to go
and see this
no longer existing wall everyone in east
germany pretty much did do that
so i read an interview with some people
who were in east germany at the time and
they said
that like everyone else as soon as the
wall fell they got in their car
and they decided that they were going to
go to berlin they said that the car
radio traffic police told them whatever
you are planning do not try to drive to
berlin in the border
there are a million cars on the road you
will never make it
people did sort of they just wanted to
go and check it out didn't they so it
wasn't just people in east berlin
just desperate to get to west berlin or
vice versa
people were desperate to go with one
exception
you know with lots of exceptions but one
famous exception so
angela merkel was having a sauna when
the wall came down
yeah she said she knew it was gonna
happen she said the atmosphere had been
very tense for days
i thought something was gonna happen i
heard the announcement the borders were
open
you know wool was coming down but it was
thursday and thursday's my sauna day so
that's where i went
that is iron commitment to the sauna
that's incredible
wow wow dan don't you own a bit of the
berlin wall
i do yeah i think i i definitely have a
bit of a berlin wall
um like you haven't for a minute you
only have a piece of concrete yeah yeah
yeah
james and i when we were touring uh fish
in berlin we went to see the wall so
it's really interesting what is and
isn't a bit of the wall because it turns
out there's one man who's basically
cornered the market
really he yeah he's called volca
pavlovsky i think he
was east german and when the wall came
down
he collected about 300 meters of it
well mine's definitely fake then andy
because a woman sold me mine
okay he doesn't sell every individual
pebble but he basically you can tell
there
so if it's fake you can crumble it with
your fingers um
because of the particular concrete they
used i think but he does he has admitted
uh
pavlovsky he spray paints the bits he
sells which are authentic and he has
sold three tons of them
uh and he says it matches the he wants
it to match the graffiti that was on the
western side of the wall
and he says packaging is everything
pavlovsky so he's patented his own
method
of attaching the bottom wall a bit of it
to a plastic globe and putting it in a
postcard so dan did you get that was it
it's on a plastic hold and mine is
graffitied to sort of multiple colors so
it sounds like you've got a sort of
original bit of slightly retouched but
basically yeah dan's actually says i
love one direction
in the graffiti
when the violin will fell there was a
lot of problems like for the people in
east germany because
everyone kind of thinks of it as okay
they were living in some
you know terrible place and it was
opened up and then suddenly they got all
the advantages of the west
which kind of was true but the problem
is they weren't used to that
and so all of their culture was suddenly
taken over by this kind of european
western european culture
and a lot of the east germans felt
really overwhelmed like massively
overwhelmed so
they didn't know how to pronounce the
food in mcdonald's they didn't know how
supermarket trolleys worked they felt
like
this was their country but they didn't
know how to live in it
i mean no one knows how supermarket
trolleys work
just spin round and round on the spot
and then you crash it into someone it's
physics can't explain it no one told
them that you weren't supposed to know
how they work
right oh no so sad i know um and so
what happened was they kind of they the
people in west germany thought the east
germans were quite ungrateful
because they were getting a lot of money
and a lot of aid from the west
but they were kind of not really loving
it very much
and so the west germans called the east
germans
yamarosus meaning moaning easterners
were like oh these guys are moaning and
the east germans called the west germans
bess of isis meaning know it all
westerners
and so there was like basically it took
a lot of time for it all to become
homogenized so that everyone was kind of
knew what was going on
yeah i found that really interesting
really it is really interesting but yeah
traffic jams
they're fun aren't they mm-hmm not
really
and there's one in um indonesia that's
quite famous
uh it's kind of not so bad now because
they fixed the road uh but it was on the
one of the main motorways and it was the
exit for the city of brevis
and so locals called it the brexit uh
and apparently this is where they had
the worst traffic in the whole of
indonesia
uh over the last few years wait was it
called the brexit before
we had a brexit i think it was named
after that i think they saw that the
english brexit
oh we can name our massive traffic jam
after that
our catastrophic pilot when no one knows
where they're going or what they're
doing
oh great so nice to know we're still
influencing global culture
there was a traffic jam in the dartford
tunnel
in 2006 where a lorry driver
hit a ventilation fan because he wasn't
in the right
part of the lane and that is known by
motoring organizations as
the pratt they always what do you mean
it was like a move
no it's like a really famous old traffic
jam and whenever you're talking whenever
you're reminiscing about the olden days
and the traffic jams
and one of the worst ones that they ever
had in london was this one and it's
known as the pratt
why didn't they call it the [ __ ] because
that would have been the [ __ ] hitting
the fan
i feel so right they needed you on
branding
it's all about branding and i think my
favorite traffic jam that i've read of
and it feels
like this is feels potentially
apocryphal but in
august of 1991 there was a two mile
traffic jam at the entrance of the
dartford tunnel
and it was caused because drivers
weren't unable to go on due to laughter
and what had happened was people were
listening to
that people had heard andy's joke about
the [ __ ] hitting the button
so august 1991 there was a qriket match
on
and uh ian botham had leapt over the
wickets
and he caught the bales and they went
off and he was out
and it led to jonathan agnew agars
saying what has become one of the great
cricket commentary moments of he
couldn't get his leg over he didn't
quite get his leg over was the line
and to begin with there's no laughter
but the two of the
commentators just start pissing himself
really hard and i listened to it the
other day and you do laugh
you laugh a lot when you listen to it as
well so supposedly around the country
people were finding it so funny that
they had to pull over in their car as
they had to stop
and at the the dartford um tunnel this
guy
was unable to pay the toll because he
just couldn't stop laughing at this
thing and it ended up with a two mile
long
traffic jam is that why they've now
taken away the toll barriers in the
darfur tunnel and replaced them with
nothing so you don't know there's any
dart charge
until you're hit with a fine two weeks
later um wow i think the podcast
just a funny qriket anecdote suddenly
turned into a
look it's a political rich i mean there
are lots of signs everywhere telling you
how to pay it but yeah okay we are going
to have this debate later there are not
and anyway good story about qriket dan
cause i've been waiting to get this
complaint about the dartford tunnel in
for like two years
and finally had the chance
for international listeners by the way
the leg over thing is a sexual innuendo
in the in britain and cricket is a game
between two teams of 11 players
yeah and dartford is a place where anna
shall not be visiting again
unless they sort themselves out
[Music]
okay it's time for our final fact of the
show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that there's a
stone marker in wisconsin
that commemorates the spot where elvis
presley once successfully stopped a
fight
by jumping out of his limo pulling some
karate moves and threatening to kick
everyone's ass so this
it's this beautiful little marker it's
on the corner of highway 51 in east
washington avenue
and this happened on june the 24th 1977
at about 1am
he was riding in one of the two
limousines that he and his
posse travel in and they saw these guys
just fighting on the outside and
elvis is um a i believe he was eighth
dan
black belt uh karate um student who
so he knew his moves he loved karate and
he thought i want to stop this fight
um but he wanted to stop it by fighting
them himself so he jumped out
and he engaged all the people in the
fight with a sentence saying i'll take
you on
and then showed some karate moves they
all recognized it was him
and thought oh my god it's our chance to
meet elvis so they stopped fighting and
came over and said hi
and um this was you know 52 days later
he he died
elvis unfortunately not because he's one
of the last no
not connected to this no he wasn't um
yeah he wasn't chased down
he didn't die after 52 days of constant
fighting
so it's really a toss-up isn't it
between whether the fight was stopped by
him pulling his awesome karate moves or
the fact that he was elvis presley
it's definitely obvious it's definitely
that he was elvis
um but yeah i mean he was he was mad
into karate a lot of people
think that that side of elvis was token
kind of
oh let's give him black belts because
he's shown up for one lesson
sort of honorary stuff he was really
dedicated to it he started it when he
was stationed in the war in germany
and that was 1958 and it was his
obsession all the way through
to his death it got to the point where
he was actually training
kids to learn karate as well so he
became a karate instructor himself
look all you have to do kids is become
elvis presley and you will win any fight
so this um this stone marker um
it was put up on the 30-year anniversary
of this historic event
and when they put it up the local tv
station reenacted the fight
as part of the ceremony that's pretty
cool
and it was outside a gas station which
they hoped
using this marker might bring some
custom but it closed yeah
closed and demolished about two years
later oh
that doesn't really work yeah yeah yeah
not a perfect ending
he loved defending himself with guns
though we should say as well as liking
karate
elvis was also a gun maniac he would
carry up to three guns on him
at all times so there was there were one
or two shows where a handgun would just
fall
out of his boot on stage and i think
because he was very worried about his
safety because you know a lot of guns in
america and he was
would have been a big target so he i
think he carried the gun
on stage for that reason but obviously
the idea
that he would ever get the chance to use
it successfully during a show
or to return fire if he was being shot
at would have been a very
foolish thing to do well there is that
why he sung don't step on my blue suede
shoes because that's
that's a genuine warning presumably
i've got a live gun in there yeah he
turned up at the white house once
wanting to meet richard nixon didn't he
um and in fact there's a famous photo of
their meeting
because it was obviously a huge
encounter um
i think the photo was something like the
most requested from
whichever institution storing it
something like the national library of
congress where
which is elvis and nixon standing next
to each other it's the most requested
they've
they've ever had in their archives but
he wanted a drug enforcement
badge from the bureau of narcotics and
dangerous drugs
according to his daughter is because he
believed that if he had the badge he
could turn up in any country both
wearing guns and carrying drugs and that
would be fine
he turned up with a with a gun to give
richard nixon and he had to be kind of
gently told
we don't really let people just come
along and say even if they're elvis
even if they're obviously they're not
people with guns just walk up to the
president and say
i've got this for you he um when he was
in that fight he was wearing a dea
kind of tracksuit that's how that's how
much he loved the
drug enforcement agency he like
cosplayed them
all the time and so yeah yeah no
honestly yeah
it's honestly like well i can't think of
an equivalent it's like stormzy
wanting to work for the home office i'm
just wearing a like a suit and a
free face um some stuff on plaques
oh yeah yeah and stuff and markers uh
the blue plaque
so we have blue plaques all over london
and you get them all over the world i
think
um they were conceived in 1863 by a guy
called william
hewitt uh and he himself has a blue
plaque which is quite nice
um it's on hampton library and it says
john beard singer
and william ewetz promoter of public
sorry john beard
singer and william ewits promoter of
public libraries lived here
um so he has to share it with another
guy who lived in the place at the same
time i read about that i thought that
was
that was rubbish for paul williams they
should say
william invented this thing yeah
or whatever yeah put it slightly better
than that maybe he'll get a second one
they want to put it in the spot where he
had the idea for the blue plaques as
they often do it was here
they had the id yeah like it's here
where penicillin was first
you know that kind of stuff yeah well
they've taken a long time that's their
plan it has taken them for a while
and they still haven't quite got around
to it have you heard of um
sydney lewis he's got a blue plaque and
he is not very well known but i just so
i
also read through this big long list of
people with blacks sydney lewis was the
youngest british soldier in the first
world war
guess how old he was when he signed up
fourteen
okay he was twelve he was at four
dan he was
three four year olds in a large trench
coat
they passed for 12 which happily you
could get into the war at 12.
four years old no he signed a page
twelve he fought for six weeks
uh at the som pretty serious stuff he
got he got sent home
um after his mum sent a copy of his
birth certificate to the war office and
said
that is my 12 year old son fighting in
the war
please send him home pretty embarrassing
for sydney anyway he then rejoined
in 1918 while the war was still going on
as far as i can tell he cannot have been
older than
15 the second time he signed up for the
first world war yeah by this stage he
has experience as well though doesn't he
you know yeah that's true
[Laughter]
[Music]
anyway he was he then was in the second
world war in bomb disposal and then he
owned a pub
what a life what age did he on the pub
15 yeah
wow are you guys familiar with the
website plaque to the future
no no this is
there's a woman in philadelphia who set
it up and
the essence behind it is that to get a
blue plaque it's actually quite
difficult you have to jump through quite
a lot of hoops to prove that it's
necessary and you're famous enough
and so she has designed these waterproof
blue stickers which look
almost exactly like blue plaques but if
you go to the website
plaque to the future you can just write
your own memory
and say where you want it put and you'll
appear as a blue plaque
and so in philadelphia there's for
instance you've got a blue plaque
on a telephone pole and the inscription
reads
derek b was walking along dickinson
street on july 2017 when he saw a woman
open her door overhand throw a
two-thirds eaten hot dog into this
telephone pole
and close her door again derek has so
many questions
that's great that's really good
there's another one i find this one
really questionable so this one
is uh in a park and the headline is
ex-girlfriend spotted ptm saw his
ex-girlfriend here
he felt weird about it she felt weird
about it he asked her about her
jewellery business and it was obvious he
didn't really care
he now avoids this intersection now
that's a slam because it's petey who's
put the blue black there
do you know that for sure yes because it
says he avoids this intersection
she might hang around the intersection
all the time that's the only reason she
knows that he avoids it these days
it might be written from her point of
view and she was saying he clearly
didn't care about my jewellery business
well but then the headline is
ex-girlfriend spotters but you're right
maybe she was writing sort of from his
perspective but
it could have been one really nosy dog
walker who was kind of walking past both
of them
and heard this story happening that's a
very good point that's a really good
point yeah
there's a cool one in the 70s a plaque
was laid down in a rail station in
castle in germany
and it had on it on the 23rd of march
1994
from three to four pm dieter mayer will
stand on this plaque
and this was set down by this artist and
swiss
he was a swiss musician and artist and
so this was 1972
and all those years later 22 years later
there he was
standing on the plaque from three to
four p.m
uh just as part of this yeah instead of
just installation it was the artist who
yeah it was the guy predicting someone
else would turn up and stand up no
no no i mean that would have been way
cooler but so did a load of people kind
of turn up like probably hundreds of
thousands of people were there to see
this momentous thing happening
or did one or two losers kind of
i can't believe i missed it i know you
had to get tickets so fast
that would be a hard thing to just to
remember to do
if i said i'll do something in 22 years
like he must have felt
he must have had to buy a diary for 22
years from now i don't know how far
advanced they print diaries i think if
you've gone to the effort of
printing a plaque cementing it to the
ground
at a specific train station yeah it's
probably going to stick in your head a
bit more than just saying it out loud
do you reckon like whenever he was
someone said oh i've got a party coming
up soon and he's like oh can i just
check it's not in 20 years six months in
three days
because i have this thing i really can't
do and then what if
like that week he got given jury duty or
something like that that would have been
awkward wouldn't it yeah
can you get out of jury duty with that
excuse because there are some loopholes
you know if you're a doctor or a lawyer
i don't know if it can be i've got to
stand on my own plaque thing
i don't know if that passes i mean there
are lots
like if you're building up to that for
22 years which i imagine he was because
he probably didn't have much else on
then look like the couple of weeks
before that is quite
high stakes yeah that is high stakes
yeah yeah like he must have just stayed
in the house for that whole time
in case something happened god if you
were his friend wouldn't you
book your wedding or something for that
day
just really test him
speaking of famous people who do
martial arts and commemorations they're
the first ever statue of bruce lee was
in mostar
in bosnia and he was chosen because he
was the only person that all the
countries serbs croats and bosniaks all
liked so they just couldn't decide on
anyone else to put
but they thought bruce lee we all like
him he can go
in our place and it was put up on
november 26 2005
uh one day before the famous statue in
hong kong went up
which really yeah i don't know they must
have heard that this one in hong kong
was happening on um
bruce lee's birthday and thought we'd
better get in there one day earlier
and they said oh the one thing we all
have in common is bruce lee and then
they did that
but then both the bosnians and the
croats complained about it because he
was doing like a karate move
but he was doing it in the direction of
the area where all those people lived
and they thought that it was an act of
aggression by the serbs that they were
making bruce lee kind of fight in their
direction
so they should put it on a rotating um
base that's a really good idea
that's a great idea i might put that
forward actually was bruce lee alive to
see that happen
no no no no no he was dead i don't know
when he died
yeah it would have been his 65th
birthday but he died probably
he died in the 80s i think oh did he
okay okay um
1973 he died sorry 73. sorry i was just
out by about 30 years okay cool
um richard nixon has a plaque on the
moon
let's see does it yeah it's yeah in fact
it's also got um neil armstrong uh buzz
aldrin
and uh michael collins yeah
yeah um but also it has nixon because it
was the the first moon landing so
there's a plaque which says here men
from the planet earth first set foot
upon the moon
and nixon's signature is on there as
well and it's such a melody
that's a trick isn't it i mean it's bad
enough if you say here are some people
on earth went on the moon
one of them's michael collins well first
of all it wasn't he was just
in the kind of space capsule but nixon
never even left the earth
nixon never went to the moon i know it's
unfair and also well not only is it
a cheat because he didn't go to the moon
but he had only been president for about
six months
i mean it was complete you know he he
wasn't really
a major move against the space program
he was still
the president of the united how how long
do you have to serve before he was
eligible in your mind
that was all set up by kenneth kennedy
kennedy yeah
yeah yeah the more i hear about this
richard nixon
yeah it would be like if if you sacked
me from the podcast and got richard
nixon
instead and then you won a major award i
would feel pretty miffed because i feel
i feel like i've done more of this blade
work than next
thank yeah thank you james and shame on
you dan and anna if not
absolutely i was trying trying to work
out on what level that analogy
function although actually when we went
to washington we stayed in the watergate
hotel which was
made famous by nixon and that actually
added quite a lot to my experience of
that so he did do quite a lot of
podcast i kind of feel it's 50 50
between richard and andy isn't it
yeah okay great i wonder what analogy
nixon would have come up with
[Music]
if only um just i've got a slightly
weird one
but it's one of those weird ones where i
don't know if it make it into the show
i'll i'll say it stop me if you think
it's if it's i won't stop for you today
i'll be rude so
um in 2002 no 2002
stop bruce lee wasn't even alive
uh 2002 um james earl jones was invited
to lauderhill florida to uh be the
keynote speaker from martin luther king
day
and in order to commemorate it they made
a plaque
that said uh you know um
james earl jones thank you for keeping
the dream alive
unfortunately at the place where they
were making the plaque
they got it wrong and what the plaque
ended up saying was not
james earl jones thank you for keeping
the dream alive but
it instead said james earl ray the man
who assassinated
martin luther king so they managed to
catch this just before it was unveiled
but the story went around
and the company that designed the plaque
tried to come up with all these excuses
they said that a lot of people working
on it didn't speak english
so there must have been a
miscommunication they also said that
there was a plaque designed just before
that one
that was made out to ray johnson and
they think the ray
somehow made it onto the next template
when they were doing the james earl
jones one
um but yeah wow what a mess up that's
someone's typed into google martin
luther king james earl
and they've seen ray and they thought it
must be this one last damn you are told
that's amazing yeah
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening if you
would like to get in contact with any of
us about the things that we have said

=341
hi everyone welcome to this week's no
such thing as a fish
uh andrew hunter murray is off on his
holly bobs this week and so
we have been joined by the absolutely
brilliant hilarious kiwi actor and
comedian
rhys darby we were lucky enough to get
him because he is currently
in quarantine in a hotel somewhere in
new zealand and frankly didn't have
a lot more to do with his time now you
might know rhys
from flight of the concorde you might
know him from jumanji
and in podcast terms you might know him
from the cryptid factor
which is his podcast all about the
mysteries of the world
which he does with a certain daniel
schreiber
as well as another guy called buttons
who i'll be honest is
really the genius behind the whole thing
but we've got recent dan on this week
anyway
i really hope you enjoyed the show we
had a whole lot of fun making it
do check out the cryptid factory and for
now on with the podcast
[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four
undisclosed locations three in the uk
and one in new zealand
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with james harkin
anna tschinsky and rhys darby and once
again we have gathered round our
microphones with our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order
here we go starting with you reese
in 1943 a spy who topped the gestapo's
most wanted list
was new zealander nancy wake who once
judo chopped a nazi to death
i didn't even think that was possible i
don't know is it possible i suppose you
can
if you can chop a brick in half you can
chop a nazi in half can't you
i suppose i don't i don't think she
chopped him in half all right
let me just check my notes yes in half
wow i mean those are strong hands guys
um so tell us more about her well she
was
the and still is i believe the most
decorated uh
female of any war so she's a kiwi
uh she became a spy now
she actually left home at the age of 16.
i'm going to do the whole bio now
take me 20 minutes she
she left home at 16 with 200 pounds in
her pocket and went to london
uh and self-taught herself journalism
and then
uh she ended up in france uh
and she was there during all the uh the
nazi build-up watching uh
hitler's uh uh horrific actions in the
early days and decided she entered she
interviewed hitler didn't she or at
least she was sent to interview him i
i couldn't find out if she actually got
the interview ah i couldn't find that
maybe she didn't quite get through the
crowds
yeah but then
she's missing opportunity if she has the
karate skills
you know to have got him early right
it's weird because it would look like an
erratic sig hile wouldn't it it looked
like come on just keep it firming up and
she's
busy and the full extension of the heil
and then come whacking down i mean that
could be what she did but
i don't think she did in fact i think
the whole judo thing might have just
been a little bit of a kind of um
fluff it may not have been knowing her
uh not that i do but knowing um the way
she was trained being ex-military myself
uh a little bit of disclosure there i
using my bare hands it was years ago now
i was you know
18 at the time but it's more of a
breaking of the neck from behind
i'm assuming that's what she did nice
but hey you know judo sounds cooler
but yeah there we go it sounds a bit
like judo
have you actually been taught how to
come up behind someone and kill them to
death
with a neck chop kill them to death uh
kill them to death
it's not really a thing i always thought
there was a minute that people told each
other in the playground when they were
12.
no no it's it's you you learn unarmed
combat i was in the regular force cadets
uh in the new zealand army so it was
kind of an elite training school
and then once i was i didn't actually do
the the full-on hand-to-hand combat
until i was a signaler
uh two years later and i remember doing
it in hobsonville air force base and we
were doing unarmed training
and it was about yeah there's a certain
way you can kill someone in
under five seconds basically i don't
want to divulge too much information no
it's a bit gross but yeah you know i was
trained if anyone ever goes to one of
reese's gigs do not heckle him that's
what we're saying
well oddly enough they don't i think the
word got out because
once someone did here coleman i went
excuse me come here come here
and they went no play no please actually
turn around
and he was never seen again she was
pretty um
she was pretty badass wasn't she nancy
wake in terms of
you know i feel like if it hasn't been
published yet a little book of quotes
would be
a really enjoyable read because she did
do bad stuff to
people like you know you chop someone to
death and she said
uh i was not a very nice person and it
didn't put me off my breakfast
and i just loved that little extra like
she was like i had to do what i had to
do
isn't it it's quite like you know from a
action movie the kind of thing someone
would say
yeah exactly and and there's a sort of
famous story about the fact that when
she went to help
out so she eventually helped out with
the french resistance and
there's a story involving the fact that
she was married to a frenchman she had
to leave to london but then she came
back into france to help out
and um she parachuted back into the
country
and when she parachuted in she landed in
a tree
and that's where she was caught up and
eventually her french contact
found her um hanging into this tree and
um
you can guess her response then so the
man who eventually finds her the
frenchman
says i hope that all the trees in france
bear such beautiful fruits this year oh
she's yeah and she said she looked down
at her
[Laughter]
she won't don't give me that french [ __ ]
and that's just again
just wonderful badass well this is
interesting
she was she was gorgeous and she this is
part of her charm
so as a uh resistance fighter
uh you know she used to get through the
guards by
actually using flirtatious behavior and
saying would you like to search me and
she used her womanly charms
but also she had more balls than any man
so she's an inspiration and coming from
a country
that she comes from that i come from new
zealand with a strong
uh feminist background we were the first
to give women the vote
1893 we have a very strong female leader
right now that uh the world is
in or off and i just feel it's kind of a
this is a a great
person to talk about um because
yeah she's she's she's uh uh
a force to be reckoned with and i wish
she was alive today because she could uh
she could turn a few heads i don't know
i mean she'd just be chopping people to
death i think
i i think i quite i mean i think one of
the
very few areas where women get off
better than men is that in stories like
this
you're badass if you're a woman but if
you're a man you're really mean
i mean she was um she was vicious right
she
the time that she said that she sort of
had to be but apparently she didn't she
had a very bad temper
and she didn't survive very well in the
post-war world because her
predilections were more for sort of um
going around
upsetting people and killing people but
when she said she wasn't put off her
breakfast that was when she'd
interrogated these french women and she
decided that one of them was definitely
a spy and so put her to death by firing
squad
and then was like yeah didn't put me off
my breakfast yeah she
she was badass but i think yeah she's
struggled in peacetime
too i i believe that you know
people are born for their time in some
in some ways
and when the war finished she felt lost
she felt like the action had stopped and
she didn't know what to do after that
because her purpose was
doing what she did and she did it so
well and and i think there's a lot of
people that fit into that
same bracket yeah she did say when you
were saying that she was
quite attractive um i think she did she
wore chanel lipstick everywhere i think
she was never traveling without her
chanel lipstick her face cream and
apparently her favorite red satin
cushion
which seems like quite a convincing
thing to carry around with you when
you're supposed to be
a spy she probably used it to asphyxiate
people to death i would say that satin
cushion
that yeah when the chop didn't work
apparently she once fled a car that was
under fire that was actually about to
explode
and then she ran back in order to
collect a saucepan a jar of face cream
a packet of tea and her red satin
cushion
after which the car immediately exploded
i mean that's a weird behavior
but she said that she never had any
affairs didn't she during the
war uh and the reason being because she
was so attractive she said if i had
accommodated one man
the world the word would have spread
around and i would have had to
accommodate the whole damn lot
so if she'd have started shagging she
would have never got anything else done
that's what she said you roll reverse
you roll reverse that one and it just
doesn't work exactly
exactly um it does seem surprising that
there hasn't been
a big sort of film made of her life
maybe there has
maybe this is there's a kiwi film out
there well i think there's one in the
making right now
and of course they say the movie
charlotte gray which was a book as well
is partly uh inspired by her
but i've got another quote here because
in the end of her
near the end of her days she ended up
back in in london
and living in the uh the stafford hotel
uh
by the way so you guys have been there
the american bar which is
which is in that hotel is where she
would even in her
80s would uh get up in the morning and
have a gin
she's always a good drinker live to 98
by the way so that makes me feel good
about my drinking you know
it doesn't affect you at all um and now
here's a quote so
she said in the end because she actually
sold her medals uh
these all these medals she got she sold
them she says look i'll probably
go to hell anyway and that only melt
isn't that great that's so good
yeah she this hotel that she lived in um
she was given a complete um everything
was paid for
and i it's a concept i love the idea of
i think every hotel should have a
resident
badass or just someone with a history
that you can find at the bar
and just go and get their story and they
live there completely free
and so glad to know that that existed
for her i think that's really wonderful
you're thinking of the major in faulty
towers basically
it's a stafford hotel exactly that's
what i won
i was actually thinking when i when i
found that fact out as well
that uh i was thinking to myself in my
older days i'm gonna end up
in some cool hotel and i'm gonna be the
guy there that gets free drinks i'm just
gonna have to achieve a few more
things but that is a great way to end
your days
i don't know you can either do more
impressive things or you can set your
sights on a less impressive hotel
so i think that maybe that's what the
major did like the major
kind of didn't do quite so well in the
world so we had to go to faulty towers
maybe
yeah if you if you just go for a travel
lodge you could probably do that right
now really yeah
i could do that right yeah your premier
level
whichever you want the joke's on all of
you because i'm already in a hotel
okay i'm in an isolation hotel at the
christchurch airport and i'm never
leaving here
i get three meals a day they knock on
the door they deliver it in a bag i
don't have to do [ __ ]
it's living the dream living the dream
we should say that rhys isn't in prison
or anything he's just in quarantine it's
not
sort of that's very nice of you but
there is a small courtyard
where we are allowed to do a little bit
of a run around once a day if you like
i went out there yesterday and there was
a guy out there having a smoke going
uh how you going dubs here you've come
back from l.a korea's not going too well
yeah i understand you know the old
covert and all that
um so a part of what um nancy was doing
was smuggling people out of france this
is what a lot of people's roles was
uh this time and to smuggle them to
safety
and do you know so a lot of resistance
fighters would smuggle children over the
border to safety
and they'd have to smuggle them out with
their id cards and it became
policy amongst the resistance to smuggle
children's id cards inside their
sandwiches
because apparently one resistance
fighter realized that the nazis
never searched the sandwiches that had
mayonnaise on them because it might
dirty their uniforms
and that's actually why they called it
um
back in the it was called mayai as in to
inspect the
sandwich and then they changed it over
time to mayo
that's an amazing fact dan you have had
your
place taken as the center of dubious
facts
yeah that night i knew
the french resistance um is there's so
many interesting stories
of amazing characters some quite
well-known names one famous
uh person who became famous later in
life but was part of the french
resistance was
the great mime act marcel marceau
and yeah and it's really a sweet he must
have been
he must have been a signal man as well i
reckon like rhys
he'd be able to get anything across
what's that marcel it's windy
you're stuck in a box hang on he's
pulling on a rope here he's put he needs
a rope does he know he's already got one
what's
he's doing some extravagant mine here
which you won't be able to feel the
benefit of at home
but i was just audio only is that i was
told this was a visual
i'm more of a physical comedian
you can see why you're such a successful
podcaster
um yeah he uh he had been studying
marcel nasser had been studying
mime already at that point and they
snuck out a lot of
children um across the border and
part of the problem is you know children
kind of don't get it
it's really hard to get children to
understand the concept of you have to be
absolutely quiet
and and so on and so marcel used to do
my max to them
and using his mime and sort of
entertaining them sort of
as it were tricked them into going
silent so that they were part of this
act he rescued over 70 children and his
brother
over 350 children and i believe his
brother
was involved in doing the mayonnaise
trick as well with the id cards
they used to do things where they um i
think it was his brother
still running with it
but they did stuff like they'd go near
the border and they would throw a stick
over
and then get the kid to chase it and the
kid would go pick it up but then they'd
be over the border
and then they were fine and they had
their id card in their mayonnaise
sandwich so they could just get on with
life
um they were dogs we say children we
mean dogs
yeah they were smuggling dogs out chase
the stick mate
it was a ball come on dan it was a ball
they weren't throwing sticks for
children
sticks balls all sorts of things
but he was i think it was marcelo's
maybe his cousin george louise maybe his
cousin his cousin and brother but um his
cousin george
sort of led a lot of these efforts and
he died in 2018 age 108
so maybe the key to longevity is gin in
the morning and
just saving loads of kids lives yeah
well we're halfway there
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hi everyone we'd like to let you know
that we are sponsored this week by
bubble yes babel is a brilliant language
app that allows you
to learn up to 14 languages you can be
multilingual
using a single thing on your phone i
reckon start with one
oh yeah because you know what it's
really it's really impressive when
people can speak a language
do you remember dan when we were in
boston
and we were in a chinese restaurant and
you were speaking mandarin to
the owner yes and for all i know you
might have been talking complete
nonsense
and she might have been replying i don't
understand what you're saying but from
where i was sat it was really impressive
yeah no um i'm glad i'm glad it looked
like it made sense
um but it's true language language is a
wonderful thing i'm currently learning
to speak english
um i am learning russian and i use
babble to help me to learn russian
because it is extremely good for
vocabulary it's quite good for grammar i
must say and especially in russian
grammar is very very difficult
but really good for vocabulary so the
way that babel works is there's loads of
call and repeat there's loads of little
games it's a really fun way of learning
things
and so you can just go through them and
learn all the words for drinks for
colors
for animals all that kind of stuff which
really is one of the big problems when
you're learning a new language
that's right and the whole thing is
created by language experts they have
over 100 language experts who've been
doing these translations using their
skills from how they teach
to bring it to a condensed and
accessible form so this really is the
ultimate app
that's right so go to babble.co.uk
play and use the promo code fish and
you'll
get six months free on your six month
subscription that's right that's babble
that's b a
b b e l dot co dot uk forward slash
play use the promo fish and you can
actually purchase a six month
subscription and they'll give you
six months three along with that if you
were to do it in russian instead of
writing fish you might write
reba which is the russian for fish
what's the what's the
mandarin for fish then sorry sorry my
wife's just asking me to
do not i don't have time actually james
so sorry um no fun i'll be there in a
sec
yeah um okay uh on with the podcast yeah
let's do the podcast um quick go
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
james okay my fact this week is that
john cleese's
silly walk is exactly 6.7 times sillier
than a normal walk
of course it is okay so first of all
for anyone who's young listening to this
this is
a sketch from monty python uh and for
anyone
you should not have to say that come on
young please i know but you've got
you're young
and you and you didn't know that ask
yourself a question
why don't you know that wow that's a
real slam see that's the kind of comedy
slam you'd get
from watching the comedy grapes so there
was a couple of scientists called
nathaniel domini and erin butler who
happened to be married and they are both
at dartmouth college in new hampshire
and they looked at how
john cleese's knees flex when he was
walking doing his silly walk
and they found that occasionally his
knees bent around 110 degrees when he
walked when in a normal person they
would bend around
20 degrees and they kind of put in that
and a whole load of other parameters and
they worked out that
his walk is exact on the show is exactly
6.7 times more variable
than a normal walk although when he did
the live performance in 1980 it was only
4.7 times more variable so they thought
maybe
as he was getting older he was getting a
bit less silly so
amazing but but it sounds to me like
you're using well they are at least uh
and you're reiterating
the the scientific mathematical elements
um
how does that adjoin to use a a knee
term
uh with silliness per se
feel like after the ted talk on a
subject i don't understand
but i'll answer that question anyway um
they had to work out what silly meant
and they decided that
silliness was just basically variability
and they kind of
put the two together and said the more
variable that you are the more silly you
are
um and in the sketch for the young
people who who don't know monty python
um john cleese kind of sees another guy
called mr pooty
and he says that his walk is 3.3 times
and sorry and they've said that his walk
is 3.3 times more variable
so it's not quite as silly which is what
john cleese actually says in the sketch
as well he's like oh it's not quite a
silly walk but
this is actually a point that the
scientists were trying to make about
funding
right and they're saying that often when
you're a scientist you have to go
through this really
difficult peer review process to get
your funding normally
but what if you just had one person like
john cleese
just assessing you when you walked in
and seeing how silly you are or how good
your science is
maybe that would be a better way of
doing it than just this massive
complicated peer review system so
they're trying to they say they're
trying to make an
important point when actually just
looking at the silly walk
right wait so they think you should just
have one bloke read
read what you've written and say yeah
it's good to go that's what they were
suggesting yeah
so did they find a is there did they
look at any
actual walks of people being silly in
real life and go
do we have a measurement thing now where
we can tell if people have a 10
times sillier walk well they you could
use their system for sure but they
didn't do that with other walks but
there was another paper a few years ago
in the proceedings of the royal society
a mathematical and physical engineering
sciences
which did a 19-page study on silly walks
all the different silly walks they could
think of and they analyzed them all and
they worked out if there was any way
of a silly walk being better than a
normal walk
and they said that basically there is no
there is no silly walk which is more
efficient
than a normal walk they all waste more
calories
and so there's no point having a
ministry of silly walks at all
they say that they should cut off all
funding and there's no point in making
a ministry of silly runs either because
they're not better
but reece i don't think you agree but
that and its fact
is silly because for a start it's 19
pages long which is just
silly and and also
the fact that a walk is going to burn
particularly with the silly nature more
calories that's
wonderful because you want to get more
fit in other ways
you're going to hurt your joints and
let's move on to the fact that john
uh hated that sketch wished he'd never
done it really
it is everywhere he would go because it
was it's
phenomenal it's an amazing piece of work
and people would say every time
do the silly walk do the silly walk you
know and of course the older he got he
couldn't
he couldn't do it and he for a start
didn't want to have to do that crazy
walk
um because it it it's you know it it
starts to hurt your limbs this is also
coming from me a physical comedian
uh who sort of you know obviously very
very much inspired by john
over my tenure of uh which happened to
be ten years
of uh it's actually more like twenty
but uh what's what's half a career
between friends
um i ended up hurting my joints and at
the moment
i mean the last couple years i haven't
been able to do the physical comedy i
once did
but i never not liked it but i don't
like it now and i see why he
uh started to regret it yeah and also
he's he's had
hip transplants his his knees are shot
to death and people still ask him to do
it and so yeah
if you look at that walk it does seem
that maybe that's the reason he's had to
have a lot of
knees and joints replaced i mean that's
gonna
crack you crack your knees like that's a
hard one to
to emulate i don't know if anyone's
tried to
do it as well i mean a lot of it is the
the fact that he's so lanky
yeah uh back in the day and he he had
such
uh great um extensions and control over
those would
ridiculous limbs yeah i like extensions
as if he had sort of some robotic
additions
to his own body but he was inspired by
a guy called max wall who was a musical
and kind of
panto entertainer guy who was big in the
20s and the 30s and he
played a character called professor
warlowski who did this really really
stupid walk it's very similar if you
watch it
and oh wow still very funny and he
played a pianist who also did this
stupid walk
but um he was a great character max wool
so he married a woman called marion
and he's called max and they had five
children they called the first michael
and then they thought oh wow we've done
the 3ms thing and so they went on to
have four more children and called them
melvin martin meredith and maxine
so they were all i have the same thing
in my family um mike and maxine and they
started calling their kids all m's as
well
i'd love to tell you their names but
they're cousins uh
this is so bizarre yeah they they've i
i should find out while you're um while
you guys are rambling on with your facts
uh about i'll find out what my cousin's
are thank you back to you i think the
listeners are really on tenterhooks at
the moment to know what your
households are called it's annoying
though because whatever we say now all
the fascinating stuff no one's listening
mike are you there what's what's your
kids names i'm just
on a um an audio podcast yeah
no it's yeah it's a it's a bit dull it's
all facts and figures but
they i want to yeah they need to know
your kids names right so you've got
oh right matthew
mint no i'm just making these up now
you couldn't even think no i'm gonna
leave it craig yeah i knew there was one
with a seat
good luck on the farm
[Applause]
[Laughter]
your family doesn't listen to this
podcast because they're never going to
speak to you again if they do
there's a place in new zealand called
john cleese isn't there
what uh yes there is it is the
tip uh in palmerston north
because he famously visited palmerston
north and he said this place
is a dump uh so they named the city dump
after him yeah that's so funny
has he been because he's done tours of
new zealand eric idle has been when john
cleese and eric idol did a tour
i think john cleese stayed in the hotel
and eric idle went for a walk up the um
up the dump that's so good
[Laughter]
idled up the cleese yeah the bbc didn't
love monty python did they despite
commissioning it
yeah what was commissioned by david
attenborough wasn't it oh was he
who was the original david attenborough
used to be the channel head
for bbc2 who's i think he was the
original channel head
and i remember reading years ago
and i can't find it since so this is
i i want this to be true but i'm not
sure that it is
he didn't he wasn't on top of everything
that was going out
um and python was on quite late at night
and it was very cult and it started
getting this following which
they didn't expect for something in that
kind of late night slot
and the story that i read is that
attenborough saw what this show was
someone showed it to him eventually and
he went this is
terrible and he wanted to decommission
it but they said
the numbers are so high that would be a
stupid thing to do so he let it go on
now that's like as i say i've i've read
that years and years ago and i can't
find where i've where i read that
maybe because atom is trying to bury
that if that's true but um
but he is responsible for it exists the
one tarnish on his career
and there's one tarnish on my career
and if i look back i was a great excuse
for me to do the voice that everyone
literally everyone can do i've got three
i've got that
sorry this is back on me again is it
yeah go for it absolutely it's been at
least 30 seconds
[Music]
[Laughter]
i can do him john wayne and
frank spencer those are the only three
and you know i i took those to hollywood
with me
and of course the only one i thought i
might have a better chance with was john
wayne
and they said no we're not i mean it's
not bad but we're not gonna need it i
mean
he's long gone now and yeah you know if
we do a biopic i don't think it's going
to be you dabs
well i think you should i think you
should buy me
no biopic of frank spencer and they
often in hollywood is that
i wish it would be i mean why wouldn't
it be
i was in condor man did you know that he
was in
a big disney american film michael
crawford was he
uh who was still with us thank god
called condor man now i've always wanted
to remake that so if there's any
listeners out there
um and i know there's not any visual
people
but if there's any audio wallabies
i think i think we've lost most of the
listeners have dropped off at this point
[Laughter]
remake condor man and put me in it
that's all i'm saying
if there's one thing i want to get out
tonight it's that
and yeah just just try and get some
visuals happening with this show those
are the two
main points what are you talking about
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
anna my fact is that in 1814
there were days of rioting in dublin
because a dog who was supposed to be
starring in a play
failed to show up on stage
why did he not turn up on stage what was
well he was actually demanding better
pay
which the dogs had a very strong union
in the early 19th century
uh the dog actors union how talented was
this dog could it talk
it couldn't it well it could talk in dog
it could bark
uh yeah dogs could understand it but
well
how's your treatment rough rough that's
rough
wow my dad literally told me that joke
when i was five
and even then whether you got it we're
still rocking it i rolled my eyes
yeah so this was
a play that was very famous at the time
actually it's called the forest of bondi
and it was based on a play called the uh
dog of montage which was written in
france in 1814 and it was
a phenomenon it was so popular that it
was immediately adapted into english
and played around britain and ireland
and
yeah though it was being put on and
there was a big hoo-ha about it being
put on in dublin
but the dog's owner thought that the dog
was not being reimbursed adequately
given his extreme talent and people
turned up at the theater
and they thought they were going to see
this play with a live dog in it which
they were very excited about
and a different place started because
they hadn't been able to secure the dog
and they lost it and there was writing
and so like chandeliers were broken
the whole orchestra fled so all the
instruments were destroyed
boxes were pulled down doors were flung
off their hinges
and this just went on so the following
night the audience returned
thinking surely they'll give us the dog
tonight same thing
tried to put on a different play same
riot
and it went on for days hang on the
whole place was destroyed and they
turned up the next night going well i'm
sure it's reopened
i'm sure i did i was a bit confusing to
me too because they did seem to be
smashing the place to shreds every night
but then the next night would come back
and it would be miraculously
they must be they must have had like um
a joinery company who would come in
every day and fix everything
and then they're getting a phone call
the next morning going dave you won't
believe what's happened again
yeah are we up again are we we're in
okay all right guys we're back in there
fix those instruments get those walls
plastered
anyway um so the place kept being
destroyed and then rebuilt in the night
apparently
and eventually the deputy manager of the
theatre came on stage to apologize but
was sort of booed off and had to flee
because projectiles were being thrown at
him
and the theater manager just resigned
that was it he resigned
a letter to the paper saying he was
emigrating that was that
i'm literally leaving the country
leaving the country
wow wow that's amazing
the play itself is um as you say it was
it was extremely popular and it was
based on a legend that was written by
julius caesar
skelliger the idea was that it was based
on a real court case so
there was a french courtier um to king
charles v who was murdered
and so they found the murderer and the
only
witness to the murder was the dog of
this courtier
and the dog recognized this murderer and
so there was this
weird thing whereby they made the dog
and
this murderer go into arm-to-arm combat
they sort of like
put them together to have a fight and
the guy was given like a little club or
something to fight against the dog and
they had this big
battle and the dog won and then the guy
once he was defeated confessed to the
murder
and then he was himself executed and
that's the sort of
the basis of the story and it took place
in this town that you mentioned
anna which was uh montagey
yeah montagi and there's actually a
statue there of the event of the dog
and the man fighting uh which you can go
and visit if you go to this place
i like the way you say it's based on a
myth uh by julia caesar
as it's hoping that people will just
think julius caesar wrote the myth when
actually it's
completely unknown author from the 1500s
it's called
yeah julius caesar skalaga wasn't it or
gallagher
yeah skelogerous gallery yeah not
excalibur not julius caesar excalibur
it was that's not a name to live up to
isn't it so
it's a big one yeah what's your name
mate julius caesar
excalibur okay all right well i'll get
you just to do the mopping up at this
stage
and we'll um make sure you get darby a
drink at some point weren't yeah it's
uh excalibur uh yeah
so this this is a big deal this play
yeah what's the big deal when it was
played
um at the court of grand duke charles
augustus in the weimar court
um goethe was like you can't put a dog
on a stage
like the stage is for humans for actors
you can't put a dog on there
and they went no we're going to do it
anyway and he's like well if you do it
then i'm going to resign
and by the way i'm gerta so really
you've got to hear what i say
and they said no we're going to put it
on and so he resigned and he was
dismissed from the
um grand duke's theater just because he
didn't want to have this dog on the
stage it's amazing wow
but goethe just had a thing against dogs
because i was like
why is he making such a fuss about this
play
just let it go gerta but it sounds like
i mean
obviously there's faust where actually
appears as a poodle at one point um so
that's bad you know he's like a demon
but then in goethe's
semi-autobiographical novel
there's a play that's disrupted by
irresponsible dog owners
in another play there's a couple of
women who [ __ ]
about how they dislike dogs so much he
hated he had a thing against dogs
uh is this is this done after this him
being fired
has he is this revenge he and the duke
basically
the duke loved dogs and gerta hated dogs
and their whole relationship was them
just arguing about whether dogs are
awesome or really [ __ ]
it was like that's all they ever talked
about wow because they were very close
it was like the only
it was like a marriage where there's
just one thing that wedged that's driven
between you at all times wasn't it
and that was the dogs dogs can be hard
to work with and i come from
experience i have worked with a dog
i've worked with a few animals over the
years uh
but on a show called wrecked where i i
played an elderly man
um i said to them look i'm not gonna
play an older guy can i play a young
handsome guy
and they they said all right but we're
gonna give you a dog
so it was a payoff anyway i'm not a dog
person
i've said this many times over the years
uh but they like you guys
didn't listen and so i got a massive dog
they gave me
a great dane like it's the heaviest dog
you can imagine and this is in fiji
we're shooting it
and they said oh yeah these are all
trained dogs they're not they're just
not wild dogs
okay so they don't have acting dogs in
fiji so when they say trained they mean
you know they know where their bowlers
and this got their name on the bowl
that's about it so i've got this
ginormous dog sitting on me and i'm
supposed to he's like he's meant to be
my support dog
well anyway we're on a plane uh not a
real one it's an acting plane
and this dog is on my lap and it's it's
200 pounds
and i am is squashing my kahunes and it
was wanting to go away all the time
and the only reason i would be staying
on me is that i had to keep feeding at
tiny sausages
[Laughter]
anyway push comes to shove which i did
do by the way
and episode two i said to the team look
either the dog goes
or i go and the guy gave me a ticket for
the plane
and i called my lawyers who were also my
agents
and the dog was out on its beautiful
hind ass
really is that a dog's feet yeah
gone of course what would you rather
have me
or a massive dog don't make people
answer that
yeah unfortunately unfortunately the dog
was busy today
[Laughter]
we also worked with ducks but that's
another story
oh yeah are they better to work with
they don't crush your balls so badly i
guess i didn't
crush my balls so we got along quite
nicely actually pierre and if you watch
the movie it's called love birds
i actually fall in love with the duck it
crash lands on my roof
and um yeah we sort of we hang out
there's also a a female i'm in love with
but the duck does come between us
and uh eventually i don't want to spoil
it but i've got to let the duck go
oh i gotta let the duck go
oh that's that's really sad you know
what you were saying about how they
didn't
like they didn't bring in a professional
dog for your
to sit on your lap and eat your tiny
sausage like that is one of the main
problems that they have
uh in hollywood so there's a guy called
bill berlony
who runs a company called theatrical
animals and they
have dogs and other animals which are
specifically trained to be in movies
as in they know how to work on movies
how to work with the lights and the
cameras and stuff
and they say that 80 of the calls they
get is where people have decided to put
on a show and just use someone's pet
or used like a trade animal rather than
a properly trained animal and they've
decided after about two days this is not
going to work at all
but it's a huge union you have to use
the
the acting dogs the acting animals you
know there's a massive industry
and if you don't use them then they'll
be hell to play
um i actually did just on stage dogs so
dog
and back to the 19th century dog drama
was
a really popular thing but especially
between the 18 20s and 1860s
in the uk then there were usually short
quite bad plays but people
loved them because they just went to see
the dogs perform and they were well
trained dogs
we're not talking any fidget and
[ __ ] here they
were so they were trained to do one
particular move which was called taking
the seas
and this meant basically as an actor you
had to have a string of sausages
concealed around your neck in a scarf
and at one point in the plate the dog
would always the dog would always be
trained to leap up to your neck
and maul away at the sausages to try and
get to them and then you're taken down
to the ground and it looks like the dog
is tearing away at your neck oh yeah
right
very famous move it was it was used in a
very popular play at the time dog hamlet
amazing the superior version of hamlet
which apparently according to the owner
of the most famous dog hamlet actor who
was called devil's hoof that was the
name of the dog
uh his owner said dog hamlet was
conceived by mistake when
hamlet was being played on stage and
this dog was in the wings
and when he saw the wrestling between
claudius and hamlet at the end
the dog galloped onto stage and sort of
got involved in the fighting
and the audience loved it and they
weren't well we've got to make this a
thing
and so dog hamlet became a thing and the
plot of dog hamlet was basically
the same as the plot of hamlet except
there was also always a dog on stage
accompanying hamlet the whole time
and then the final in the final scene he
got to pin claudius down
while hamlet killed him it sounds great
i don't know why it doesn't get
uh get played at the national world one
of the reasons that these dog dramas
were so popular is because of the
licensing act of 1737
which basically meant that whenever you
wrote a play you had to give it to
the lord chamberlain and they had and he
had to check through it and make sure
that there was nothing bad in there
and it was a real arse of a hoop to get
through
but luckily a dog drama didn't really
have any lines apart from bark bark bark
or something you know they were
melodramas there was hardly any lines in
there at all
and so they were really easy for people
to write and get past the lord
chamberlain
nice yes
the just one last thing is uh i've found
a quite nice thing which is
that animals used to in hollywood
be acknowledged for their contribution
to
film and tv and there used to be an
award ceremony that took place called
the patsy
and the patsy stood for picture animal
top star of the year and it ran for a
number of years and the the very first
one was hosted by ronald reagan
in 1951 and it's great it's just nice to
look through the list to sort of
acknowledge all these incredible animals
so in the first year
animals that were acknowledged were
francis the talking mule
black diamond the horse lassie the dog
lassie
gets its first mention there wow um but
yeah the patsy and they stopped doing it
and that's a shame because
there are a lot of animals in movies
that are still
given their all that's interesting to me
that they
stop that because they're held in such
regard especially in the states
uh you know the these acting animals so
i wonder why
yeah absolutely i wonder why
they stopped the award ceremony maybe
because
the animals don't realize they're
getting awards yeah
i'm not sure probably um
i mean the animals don't even realize
they're acting
why are they healthy that's the big
question yeah
it is the big question do some of them
do they because you look at the such the
uh
like lassie for example uh or the the
other famous one i
can't recall the name but the dog that
was in uh frasier do you remember that
little audi
he definitely knew what he was doing and
the owners
and the trainers will tell you they'll
come off and they'll uh they'll look at
you and they'll be sort of like how'd i
do how'd i do
i know i want to do another um
absolutely because they they know
they've got to run on i've got to do a
certain thing and they have to do it in
a certain way and then they'll come back
and they'll get a treat or whatever
but they know um they know that this
camera is there and especially if
they're doing it for years
so you know even though i took the
mickey out of the
the the dog as i've been working i have
had experience with it um i do
uh acknowledge the work that goes into
it do you ever
see those guys like the duck do you ever
see the duck in like social settings
anymore
no sadly i have not visited the duck um
is that because the doc's too busy or
you're too busy is did one of your
careers really take off
look it's it's an actor's thing we when
we leave the film we leave each other
that's what you do
it doesn't matter whether you're human
or animal
um and you might see each other at the
awards uh you know
not so much now if there's no animal
awards but uh
you know the agency christmas do you
mind
do you get do you get occasional calls
from it going reese i see you've been
cast in jumanji
lots of lots of animal roles in that
yeah slip a word in
here i'd love to work with you but as
you know these days a lot of them are
computer generated okay so you real life
animals just of you know you're
you're a bit of maintenance aren't ya
wow how rude
[Music]
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that while filming
return of the jedi
in the forests of california the actor
who played chewbacca
had to be accompanied by crew members in
brightly colored vests
so that he wasn't shot by bigfoot
hunters
wow so amazing yeah and this is um for a
long time this was a sort of a
legend of the behind the scenes filming
that no one had properly verified but
peter mayhew who sadly passed away last
year uh who played chewbacca
in all of the movies that's mayhew not
may i isn't it
[Laughter]
so yeah so he played chewbacca in all
the movies including the force awakens
he sadly passed away and actually um he
was unable to do
the one after the force awakens what was
that one called the last jedi
i think it's called no one cares anymore
wasn't it yeah that might be it
uh he um but he's still consulted he's
in the credits as chewbacca consultant
and um he was on a reddit ama where he
was asked the question and he confirmed
that this was the case
they were in these forests of california
which is a big
bigfoot hunting territory it is where
all the most famous encounters of
bigfoot
happened in the californian forest
bluffs creek is where the most famous
footage that we know of the patterson
gimlin if you
picture bigfoot in your head that's the
footage you're thinking of that happened
in a californian forest
so you can see that there would be
slight concern of a giant
chewbacca-like character walking around
that he might be hunted down so yeah
it's uh it's what happened also probably
grizzly bears do they have them there
like
they might shoot him because they think
he's a grizzly bear rather than
something that doesn't exist
okay so two points there no
okay there's no grizzlies in that
territory and they do exist
clearly okay in fact i've got many facts
here how long have you got
to prove to you guys that they
there's an estimated number between two
and six thousand
of these creatures that's one bit of
evidence in north america
okay they have extreme elusiveness they
have fear of humans
they nocturnally feed and they have no
medicine
okay that is basically they in their
groups they migrate they move on the
move all the time
more than 10 000 people in the u.s have
described encounters with bigfoot over
the last
50 years and a third of all bigfoot
sightings
are recorded in the state of oregon
reese i do see that you're reading this
but um
what where did you get these facts from
i was just wondering these are out of my
07 notepad prepared leon kirkbit got me
for my birthday
okay so your sources yourself
what else is that i've written they're
handwritten by me
these are facts written by me
last year 2019 scientists unearthed
new evidence of the original bigfoot uh
what do you think that is
oh the giant hominid thing is it like
chinese ten foot tall ape
um gigantopithecus
which they believe is related to the
modern day urangutang
um it's interesting that's you know
obviously uh there are more people who
disbelieve
in bigfoot than there are people who
believe in it but the people who do
believe that he
she might exist uh it's quite it's quite
interesting people like david
attenborough has always said he thinks
that the yeti for example
could be a real thing he's he's
if you look at his career with all that
monty python stuff
that guy he was tarnished a long time
ago you're right
yeah the only second tarnish that he has
that he's been trying to dust under the
couch
for a long time is his bigfoot belief
and here i can't believe i'm saying it
but
bigfoot is real um on chewbacca
okay yeah there is a star wars comic
from 2004
an official star wars comic called into
the great unknown
that says the millennium falcon crashed
it landed into the earth in the
in the pacific northwest before the area
was colonized by people
and that chewbacca survives he kind of
is immortal or something
and he became the mythical bigfoot so
maybe chewbacca is bigfoot
i love this theory um it's also a comic
i believe
but because it makes total sense
and you know now he would have to have
mated uh but then a population can grow
and also it counts for the
uh spaceship situation ancient
astronauts for example
so therefore um extraterrestrials have
landed here which
you know we all know is true as well so
it does tie in with the bigfoot and ufo
um factor which which i find fascinating
and that's why star wars is such a
popular documentary
exactly well everything's based on fact
and that is that is a derby quote
[Laughter]
it's in the book it's in your double
seven book it's in here i wrote it it's
on page four everything
have you guys uh recent dan ever been to
willow creek or are you familiar with
willow creek which i think is sort of
the home of bigfoot isn't it in
california
it's one of them uh familiar with it yes
have not been no
because it's kind of amazing how well
they do like the the willow creek museum
apparently rakes in 500 a day which for
a microscopic museum in a microscopic
place in the middle of nowhere
is a lot of money a lot of people seem
to go to this place the entry fee is 500
right it's amazing and it's you every
day isn't it
there's another museum there's a
sasquatch museum in georgia
in cherrylog georgia and they it's
called expedition bigfoot and one of
their main things they have is a
buttocks
imprint of the sasquatch
so apparently the sasquatch oh do you
okay
well i don't i mean it's a it's a class
plaster cast isn't it uh
yeah so it it they left an apple out and
the sasquatch came in the middle of the
night and it
uh because they're nocturnal and it went
to grab the apple but it didn't go right
up to it because it's so it's sort of
actually lent down and on its on its
buttocks on the on them on the
unfortunately i think it was muddy
ground and reached over and got it and
took off and left an imprint yeah and
they've got that whole cast and they did
the cast yeah the famous one and
according to jeff
moldrum professor of anthropology at the
university of idaho
it has obviously prominent buttocks that
are well muscled
and the hair streams downwards and
inwards towards the natal cleft
if anyone wants to know what a big foot
butt looks like yeah
and i've got a tattoo of an um natal
cleft
on my right shoulder blade so delighted
this isn't a visual medium
and underneath it it says everything's
based on fact
[Laughter]
so this this um podcast is obviously
broken now
but um the very famous footage that i
was mentioning before
that we all know the patterson gimlin
footage um yeah
those guys those guys are very
interesting so bob gimlin is the
surviving one of the two
um he's in his eighties and
you've met him reese which is so
interesting because he wasn't a bigfoot
hunter he was uh
he was basically a um daredevil
to an extent he used to ride man
yeah he was a stunt man and he used to
write carts through the canyons
he was courted by evil knievel to be
part of his daredevil team
and that was going to be his whole
career and then he was filming this
thing with paterson where they were
actually filming a movie about someone
else's account about these eight men
in california when they suddenly found
bigfoot and took this footage
and for 35 odd years afterwards gimlin's
life was effectively ruined because
no one believed them what they were
saying his wife used to get
teased at her workplace and constantly
people would be revving up to their
house saying let's go
bigfoot you know drunk people and then i
think it was in the early 2000s he
decided to show up to a conference
where suddenly he was met as if he were
a god and it was only then that his life
turned around and it's interesting that
just in those 35 years
he didn't break him down the sort of the
what it did to his life that he sort of
admitted it to being a hoax he's always
stuck by his guns
yeah oh that's nice he found his people
yeah absolutely
because when when they got the footage
um patterson was a bit of a showman and
took it around everywhere but gimlin
didn't really want to
have anything to do with that he just
wanted to look after his horses and
stuff
and so paterson hired someone to pretend
he was bob gimlin
no not really and they massively fell
out i mean this is what i read i don't
reese might know this but like yeah they
massively fell out and it was only
towards the end of patterson's life that
they kind of made up
um in fact when patterson went around
with his cousin i think who's called the
atlee they were making so much money
that they did the classic thing
of at the end of each night they would
go back to the hotel room and have money
fights where they threw money at each
other because they were making
so much from this yeah the flip side to
that is while patterson is having these
money parties throwing him around the
room
um gimlin sold the rights to the footage
to a fellow bigfoot researcher for 10
american dollars
wow that's yeah that's all the crazy
story you've got to get that in tiny
denominations to make a good money
i was um reading about um what
scientists thought of this
film uh there's a guy called john napier
who's like a big big foot
uh scientist and i think kind of kind of
fair on both sides
as far as i was reading it anyway and he
thought that he was quite struck by the
way that the bigfoot walks in a really
exaggerated way
and he says why ruin a good hoax by
ordering an actor to walk in such an
artificial way
sorry how how many times more silly is
the bigfoot walk
there was an anthropologist called
daniel schmidt who said on this he said
either this is a person
trying to walk funny or bigfoot walks in
a manner that is more or less identical
to a person walking funny
and let's not forget it has breasts
let's not forget that
yeah because why would you put a put
breasts on a on a fake bigfoot suit it
would give you that extra
moment of difficulty to to get that
accurate in terms of its movement and
you know go to those troubles
there's there's you know i'm not here to
to scientifically
prove and argue this case but you know
there's if you do want to dive into it
listeners
uh please cross over live now to
my podcast the cryptid factor which
you'll absolutely enjoy it's also it's
visual it's not just
audio although we're not we haven't got
the visuals up yet
but uh it's like this is less facts um
i can't believe our podcast has been one
long advert for the cryptid factor
we're not putting this out we need
listeners
can i ask and i can't even believe i'm
going down this road what am i doing
uh i hate myself but um if that
presumably there are male big feet
as well uh because if it's just female
how are they breeding or do the males
also have breasts
uh how is that working yeah it's this
male and there's female
and there's youth and people have seen
all three
okay so it's not just females but the
people it just so happens in this
footage
uh bigfoot in this footage is actually
called patty
just a little nugget there um patty the
bigfoot
is the name that's given to her the
bigfoot research organization go out and
they do expeditions every year
maybe four times a year and you can sign
up if you go on the bfro website
you can be part of an expedition to try
and find these things and quite often
almost every time they will at least
hear the howls
in the forest and you know it's it's
it's well worth your time well i mean
that's a matter of
look you can either do that or go and
watch dogs on stage it's absolutely good
can i just i know it seems totally
unrelated but can i say something about
the yeti which i found really amazing
very related yeah
well you know i don't know if the big
fans hate yetis or whatever but
so the yeti is obviously this of
nepalese equivalent of bigfoot
so it's yeti and abominable snowman are
himalayas bigfoot sasquatch
they're north america and a yeti finger
was once smuggled out of nepal by
my personal favorite actor jimmy stewart
where did he smuggle it what where did
he put it where did he put this finger
[Laughter]
see that would have worked so much
better if you guys had video because
can i just say i put a finger right up
we used to have our own tv show and
every time you say this would work well
in video it's a dagger to our hearts
oh i'm so sorry and also if there are
any bbc commissioners listening they're
going thank god we definitely did the
right thing
yeah you're here next week okay you've
you guys you've got the visual show but
you're gonna have to have rhys darby
that's that's that's gonna be about
bigfoot
no we got decommissioned by attenborough
interestingly yeah he came back
just for a one-off decommission
i can't believe that guy i know so many
cock-ups in that career
anna can i ask what happened with um do
you say jimmy stewart what happened with
his um with his yeti finger where is it
now and the finger well thank you for
asking james so
this basically started when there was a
yeti hand
apparently that was in a nepalese
monastery in the 1950s
and basically there was a guy he had a
great name of this huge oil magnate
called tom slick
very cool name for someone who's made
wealthy from oil
and he organized this expedition of
scientists to go and basically get the
yeti hand
and so this guy was sent out to get it
he was called peter byrne he was an
explorer
and a british scientist had given him a
human finger
to swap with the yeti finger with one of
the yeti fingers on this hand so he got
into this monastery
it's a bit up in the air whether he got
permission from the monks or whether he
just stole it but essentially he hacked
off the yeti finger
replaced it with this human finger wow
stop stop we're falling on the side of
stolen
um but then it happened that he was
mates with james stewart and james
stewart's wife gloria who happened to be
in the area and so he said i'm so sorry
guys would you buy heard you're going to
the uk would you mind taking this yeti
finger back with you
and they did and they they smuggled it
out in gloria
jimmy stewart's wife's lingerie case
which i actually didn't even know that
was a thing
but apparently yeah no one searches
lingerie cases in fact they asked at
customs at the other end in britain you
know did what did you open the lingerie
case and the customs official said no of
course not
we'd never open a ladies lingerie case
so
i should say that they have done
analysis on this finger which was kept
in the hunter
museum they've done some analysis
recently and it is in fact just a human
finger
it turns out okay he swapped it back
there's always there's always a response
isn't that that's the good thing about
this kind of thing because
yes because now jimmy stewart or
tom slick has the actual yeti hand and
of course if you've got that that finger
you're not going to divulge that
information that's up in your in your
glass
cabinet up on the third floor near the
landing
by your bigfoot books
in the notebook guys i love how
respectful james and anna are vague to
you reese if i said this i'd get [ __ ]

hey everyone welcome to this week's
episode of fish i just want to let you
know that the episode you're about to
listen to was recorded live
at the london podcast festival at king's
place
and that it was recorded just a few
weeks ago
that's right we actually managed to do a
live gig in the year 2020
it was such a fun night it was actually
the first time that the four of us had
been in a room together since this whole
pandemic kicked off it's about seven
months
so that was incredibly fun it was
amazing to see some of the fish
listeners sitting out there in the
audience all sitting there with their
masks on
spread out around the auditorium so that
we can make sure everyone was nicely
socially distanced from each other
and um so big thank you to them big
thank you to everyone who joined us
online to watch it as it streamed it was
our first ever global gig as a result
and most importantly a big thank you to
the staff at king's place who made sure
everyone felt safe going ahead
with this gig so yeah we hope you enjoy
it it's our first gig of the year
possibly our last hopefully not
but um here it is live in london in the
year 2020
[Music]
enjoy
[Applause]
[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
this week coming to you live from the
london podcast festival
[Applause]
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
here with anna tashinsky
andrew hunt of murray and james harkin
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order
here we go starting with my fact this
week
my fact is that theodore roosevelt once
was shot in the chest
but survived thanks to a 50 page long
speech
tucked into his coat pocket he delivered
the speech
reading from pages that now had two
massive bullet holes in them
wow and he did a speech which lasted
about 19 minutes
and that's where the idea of bullet
points came from isn't it
come on it's been seven months
[Applause]
yeah this happened in 1912 he was in
milwaukee he was on his way to the
milwaukee auditorium
and he was in an open top car and as he
was standing up to wave
a gunman who was called john shrank shot
him in the chest basically at
point-blank range
and the bullet still went into his body
and was
lodged inside his body but rather than
go to the hospital he said i'll just
quickly do my 90-minute speech
and you can actually see if you go
online they have in a museum
the pages of this speech and when i say
massive bullet holes they are ginormous
these two ginormous bullet holes
but yeah he was a badass like that he
was a badass like to make sure that it
hadn't penetrated his lungs he coughed
into his hand
three times and checked for blood to
make sure that he didn't have to go to
hospital that's a pretty hard car isn't
it
all of his aides were um sort of
standing around because they were quite
nervous about this they thought he
should go to hospital
lots of the crowd he announced right at
the start he said
friends i shall ask you to be as quiet
as possible i don't know whether you
fully understand that i have just been
shot and so people were standing right
so ready to catch him at the side of the
stage basically and he kept glaring at
them
and he refused to even cut it short did
he not have to miss out the odd word
that
the bullet holes had gone through it
actually didn't make any sense at all
it kind of came out as like a redacted
speech that he wasn't
giving us all the info on did you guys
see this this allegedly happened when he
announced by the way i've just been shot
right at the top before he got into the
actual stuff that was on his pages
apparently when he said that someone in
the crowd shouted fake
whoa i think that donald trump was alive
back then
supposedly he stepped forward and said
no no it's real here's my bleeding shirt
the guy had to come up and put his
finger in the hole
[Music]
they left the bullet in didn't they
forever never i think because it was too
dangerous to extract it so
just kept it in forever but he sent a
telegram to his wife i think straight
after giving the speech he dictated a
telegram to her when he was on his way
to hospital saying
he was in excellent shape and he just
had a little injury no more serious than
one of the trivial injuries their kids
were always getting
[Laughter]
children were neglected is what i've
read into that
it is one of those things that makes you
understand why there are generations who
say no they don't make the might that
used to
you can't imagine the you know our
snowflakes standing there and delivering
a 90-minute podcast with bullet holes
through our chests
i wouldn't do it i'm not gonna lie
yeah it's very weird i mean he was what
was interesting about him was he was
very much into
physical exertion he was in pushing his
body all the time to sort of be the
strongest he can be there's accounts of
him where
he would hang a wire over a river and it
would be a fast-flowing very dangerous
river with currents and he would just
hang
on the rope just to bring his body
strength better but like the risk of if
he'd
fallen into the water would be possible
drowning and
he was just like always on the edge well
do you know that's because he was
brought up that way his parents were
something called
uh muscular christians what
that sounds so cool well it sounds half
cool doesn't it
[Laughter]
they worship at the church of our
blessed lady of the six-pack don't they
yeah i do yeah yeah what is a muscular
christian it's pretty much exactly what
it sounds like so the idea was to be a
good christian you had to kind of look
after your body and be really muscular
it was quite i would say misogynistic
but it was of its time
like it was basically men should be
strong and they should look after the
women kind of thing
and it was quite popular in america at
the time and according to wikipedia i
read this verbatim it said muscular
christianity spread to other countries
in the 19th century
it was well entrenched in australian
society by 1860
though not always with much recognition
of the religious elements
[Laughter]
that explains quite a lot doesn't yeah
but he was quite a wimp
initially wasn't he teddy in his
childhood he was well a wimp is hard she
had asthma
um so actually that tells you a lot
about allah in the school yeah
i had a very specific role in the
playground
no he had a really difficult childhood
he had a really bad asper and he was he
described himself as quite sickly and
quite weak
and he got beaten up as a teenager and
found he couldn't defend himself
and so he demanded boxing lessons from
his dad and got them and he devoted
himself completely to becoming someone
who was able to beat the bullies in the
future
yeah and yeah it was hardcore there's
lots of sources that say he was the
first american to get a brown belt in
judo
uh which like a lot of his biographies
claim he was certainly very good at judo
what's brown definitely is below black
below black yeah that's not
like the greatest boast it's the one
below black
okay just because brown's a bit of a
yucky color no it's just but then black
just has like these extra like first and
second out like black goes on
it's fine we'll talk later yeah okay you
come back to me when you've got a black
belt in judo
i have one in taekwondo i'll have you
know second dan
[Laughter]
there were two dans in the class
[Laughter]
he i i think as well i think he had mega
anger issues as well because
he wouldn't let something go there was a
story that happened in
1886 are we still second-downing is that
what's going on sorry
i'm just laughing at my own joke
so good to see you again um
yeah so 1886 roosevelt
his boat was stolen by these two thieves
and they took the boat and they started
riding it away and
rather than letting it go he was like no
i'm going to chase them
and i'm going to get it back and he knew
that they had such a head start that
would take days and so he was like screw
it i'm doing it anyway so he decided to
do it and this is how prepared he was
he took food that he wanted to take in
pursuit he also took a copy of anna
karenina
because he thought to protect him from
the next bullet
yeah no i think it was down time he was
like just going to bring a book
that's tolstoy isn't it yeah yeah so so
he was effectively a cowboy for some of
his
pre-presidency life and he i think this
may have been the same incident but he
he was chasing outlaws i don't know if
he was kind of a deputy
sheriff or a deputy martial something
like that uh he was chasing three
outlaws at one point he caught them
he then had to watch them for 40 hours
when he was sort of bringing them in
and he kept himself awake by reading
tolstoy yeah that was it he was reading
it and he was holding his
shotgun over the kind of bad guys no he
was reading
no way and he finished anna karenina
halfway through the
40 hours and he was like well what am i
going to do now and one of the outlaws
had a book and he said give me your book
and he started reading his book
oh what's so funny did he read it to
them
was it like theodore roosevelt's uh
lethal
audiobook time or was it yeah
she loses her head either metaphorically
or literally we won't specify which
but it involves a train there is no one
there is no one listening to our podcast
that has not read alex
i actually can't believe you just did
that i think we've just lost all the
online listeners
some people at the back have walked out
and also i don't think she's not leaning
over to vomit on the railway the train
doesn't knock her head off as far as i
remember
it's just a full-on death by trade if we
are really revealing the ending
i think we've committed now so yeah go
for it i think it's amazing it's a thing
that
sort of not attached to 19th century
outlaw folk tales that there's always a
sort of break to read a book
during a chase always carry a book
everyone's got a book on them how cool
is that
the outlaw code yeah i just wonder what
the outlaws book was because it can't
have been more tolstoy
what are the other of them having
[Laughter]
he had cowboy practice actually when he
was a kid his parents used to
stick him on a horse or in a carriage
just behind a horse and make the horse
gallop at breakneck speed as fast as it
possibly could
with his mouth open not the horse teddy
with his mouth open
because well they thought that would
cure his asthma no
it doesn't feel like that would work
well
thomas jefferson tried to and i think
thought he successfully cured his
diarrhea by
horseback riding that feels like that
would cure your constipation rather than
your diarrhea
yeah you would think right yeah maybe it
floods it out yeah
but you put asthma sufferers on the
carriage behind him and that's true
i just love all these old horse
prescriptions get on a horse and
yeah theodore roosevelt kind of invented
piranhas
so interesting he
and i stamped i stand by this so wait i
know what's happened andy
you've got my notes sorry no he did he
genuinely did so he wrote a book
i think was in about 1913 so he'd
already been president by this point and
he'd been shot and everything but he was
he did lots of
expeditions and big game hunting and all
of this he wrote this book
through the brazilian wilderness and in
it he has this long bit describing
these ferocious piranhas that you get in
the amazon and how they can
strip a cow's flesh from its bones in a
few minutes
and he said that they will snap a finger
off a hand
in cautiously trailed in the water i
never witnessed an exhibition of such
impotent savage fury so that's all it's
basically all thanks to him but the
reason
uh i mean piranhas don't do that unless
they're really
you know unless it's really dry and
they're really crammed in together and
it's yeah and they're really really
hungry
uh some of them are vegetarian for
example but um
the ethical piranhas there are more and
more of them
but they reckon that maybe this is just
a theory that when he was visiting the
area where he saw this kind of
exhibition display of piranha activity
it's because his hosts had blocked off a
bit of the river chucked a load of
piranhas in there
let it dry out not fed them at all and
so by the time the roosevelt arrived
they were really really really ready to
eat
and that's what made it like that and
are you saying he invented the piranha
because he sort of invented
our idea of the piranha as a very
vicious animal yeah i
see it's half her yeah
he was a tough boss given that he was a
tough man he kind of expected the same
from his cabinet for instance he had
this thing called the tennis cabinet
which was initially started as a way of
him exercising with all his kind of
younger employees
and so his younger ministers would go
out and play tennis with him and he
thought tennis actually was really dull
because you didn't really get to fight
each other hand to hand
and so what the tennis cabinet became
was
every day they had to get together and
they picked a target on a map
and without checking any of the terrain
whether it was full of rivers or
mountains or piranhas
they had to just walk to that target
without stopping and without diverting
from a straight course
and so they ended up doing things like
at one point they were all made to swim
through a half frozen river and um yeah
when he was president yeah wow yeah it's
his cabinet
well then he's have these big boxing
fights in the white house didn't he
where he invited professional boxers to
come and
really fight him yeah you were asked to
come and beat up the president imagine
if the current president offered that
imagine the queue
um um we're gonna have to move on very
shortly well we have to talk about the
most hardcore member of the roosevelt
family which is his daughter alice
she was amazing yeah she basically was
such a handful
at one stage roosevelt said um she kind
of interrupted when he was doing
something he said i can either run the
country
or i can attend to alice but i cannot
possibly do both
wow and she was totally hardcore i mean
to be fair it sounds like he was
basically running a fight club
instead of being president
she was wild because he um she had a bit
of a traumatizing upbringing because so
his wife and mother died on the same day
and he was very upset about that
understandably and he refused to ever
speak his wife's
name again but awkwardly his wife's name
was alice as was his daughters
and so he never he refused to ever say
his daughter's name
so she was a bit messed up about that
and then they sort of
made friends again a bit but she used to
do crazy stuff
like she smoked publicly on the roof of
the white house
she played poker she partied all night
she kept so she had she carried bag
around with her all the time in which
she just kept a dagger
her pet snake who was called emily
spinach
and a copy of the constitution sorry
the snake was called what oh emily
spinach emily spinach great
and a copy of the coffee the
constitution the u.s constitution was
that a tip from her dad in case you got
an assassination it was yeah
folded up the reason that she smokes on
top of the white house roof was because
he said
um he forbade her from smoking
cigarettes under my roof
and so she's like [ __ ] it i'll go on the
roof there
what good dick that's so wonderful and
then once um
once roosevelt left and the next guy
came in who was taft and then
uh woodrow wilson afterwards she was
banned from the white house wasn't she
oh yeah was that when she buried a
voodoo doll of someone under the in the
ground
under the grounds before she left and
then she made some kind of rybald joke
about woodrow wilson that no matter how
much you google you could never find
this joke
believe me that's how i spent the last
five days trying to find this joke
but yeah everyone hated her who came
after her and they wouldn't let her in
the white house at all
wow the woman who made a joke that's too
rude for the internet

leaving your house for 270 days
[Laughter]
they don't even have netflix james they
don't they don't have anything
it's um so yeah and they um they they
slow down so much that their hearts beat
twice a minute when they're in this sort
of deep deep chill state
they can stop breathing for for several
minutes at a time when they're in this
state
and most of their body gets down to
almost minus three degrees celsius
it's incredibly cold we don't know how
they do it but they don't
freeze as in ice crystals don't form
throughout them they have some way of
stopping levelized crystals forming and
so because that would kill them
obviously but they aren't that cold and
they just look like little stones on the
ground basically yeah so if you got a
bottle of water and you can kind of
make it go really really really cold but
then there's nothing for the ice to form
around then it won't freeze
and it's the same with these squirrels
but what that means is if you pick up
one of these squirrels that's
hibernating and shake it it will die
[Applause]
so don't do that would it freeze at the
same time as you would
shake it and then it would like smash it
twice wouldn't you yeah it'd be like a
frozen squirrel and is that because is
that because shaking it you get a bit of
debris
and as soon as you get a tiny particle
into their body presumably it gets into
their blood and exactly
even just like by shaking it a little
bit of carbon dioxide inside the blood
might just come
free and then that with everything with
nuclear around that but they do have
these periodic wake ups don't they yes
where they sort of we and actually don't
do much else really in fact i think
like largely they don't even urinate
they just wake up in order to go to
sleep
so which is amazing right yeah i just
thought hibernation was sleep but no
it's
yeah it sounds snackering yeah it's
absolutely exhausting so they've got
this
store of fat between their shoulders
which apparently acts as a sword of
thermostat it's the only bit of them
that's staying functional
when they hibernate and when they get a
bit too cold they shiver themselves
awake and if you watch a video of them
it is very sweet the little ball that
starts shivering until the little ball
of fat pumps blood around
and it's just so that they can wake up
out of hibernation
in order to have eight hours good sleep
and go into their rem cycles have some
dreams
and then otherwise they get sleep
deprived in hibernation i don't know if
you guys read this
because you said they had dreams um i
read one article and it was from brian
barnes who is like the main guy on this
subject
and he said that they take a lot of
magic mushrooms just before hibernation
and nobody knows why they do it well
they're trying to get as much fat as
possible so they're trying to eat as
much as possible
but it just so happens that the thing
that they eat are these mushrooms which
are
hallucinogenic and we don't know whether
it gives them crazy dreams for the 270
days
or whether the liver might be able to
detoxify it or something so we don't
really know but it could be that for
that whole 270 days they're just
thinking of dogs with nine legs
[Music]
[Laughter]
that's so cool um they do they're quite
um chemically altered in lots of ways
because i
don't know that but i the other thing
they do to survive is that they produce
steroids in their body massive massive
levels of steroids uh during the summer
months when they're building up and they
build their muscles by a third
in size they increase by a third in just
a few weeks and now
normally that would lead to what we call
roid
rage um you know extra aggressive
behavior
real fury tiny testicles tiny testicles
and a deep urge to spread christianity
of course yes
[Laughter]
but they don't for some reason they
don't go into a rage so they can survive
the the testosterone coursing around
them and the males
have to stop when they when they do
hibernate and then
this is a bit weird but their testicles
shrink a lot so we we see that but then
when they wake up
their testicles swell hugely and they
get a massive extra rush of testosterone
when they wake up the next time around
and they basically go through puberty
again they basically do this every year
that's rough yeah that is rough and the
males live way shorter than
females do they live about six years and
when they wake up they do actually go
into
a sort of fighting frenzy with other
males and then they have puberty and
then they hope to mate and then
i think the reason they live shorter is
because they have to go through puberty
six times
in their life and it's too embarrassing
the voice drop it where it's a bit
wobbly yeah the acne again
[Laughter]
they are awake for longer than the
females though aren't they they go to
sleep a bit later
than the ladies they sort of store food
in a little cash
whereas the ladies just fall asleep and
they wake up earlier
in order to kind of get start getting
ready for mating
and essentially the females wake up
about three weeks after the males
and their entire waking life is
waking up immediately being mated with
within 12 hours of waking up
by a male being pregnant just dating for
25 days
caring for the young for 10 weeks going
back to sleep
that's their lives they probably need a
lot of sleep after all that though don't
they
they do fairness they have very weird
borough systems
or very very clever borough systems
actually so they have three different
kinds of house
they don't just have one basic burrow
the way they know that is because when
you're researching
arctic ground squirrels when researchers
are researching them they have to make
really detailed maps of where all the
borough entrances and exits are
so that if you take one away to study
them when you put them back you put them
at the right door like you don't put
them in someone else's house
so they don't notice when they wake up
they have no idea someone's been in
rearrange the house basically i guess so
yeah they don't wake up and go where am
i
that's not my picture um but they have
you could put them the other way around
when they're hibernating just to freak
them out
so they think oh lovely i'll go to sleep
facing my favorite nut or whatever yeah
but they wake up facing their their
second favorite nut
that's like my wife she goes sleep
facing her first favor
and she uh she wakes up with a second
down
[Laughter]
i mean it did sound like you're gonna
say facing her first favorite
[Music]
just to stay away for a second but in
hibernation i was reading a blog about
hibernating hedgehogs and there was this
wonderful thing where a person says a
way that you can tell
that a hedgehog is hibernating is
because they look like they're dead
basically if you go up to them they're
in the ball all you need to do is go
right up to one
put your ear next to one and you know
it's hibernating because you can hear it
snoring
isn't that sweet a little of a hedgehog
and they snore when they hibernate not
all of them sometimes and
um possibly not even then but it's yeah
it's it's just from a blog but that's
really sweet
um i have a fact about squirrels other
squirrels
californian ground squirrels oh yeah
slightly different kind of ground
squirrel
so in 1918 california basically decided
to wage war on the squirrels and they
had something called squirrel week
where posters were put up all over the
state encouraging the children of
california
to kill as many squirrels as they could
and there were posters just aimed at
children saying um
things like slay the mother squirrel
during breeding season march to may
and because because they were quite
invasive and they ate a lot of crops and
they carried bubonic plague which is a
bad thing so there were like there were
reasons for it
but i mean it was pretty dark so one
there was a pamphlet which advised how
you could hook up your exhaust pipe to a
squirrel burrow jesus
and wipe out a whole batch of them like
and they were depicted with little
german soldier helmets because the first
world war was still going on it was
saying this is
you know we might be fighting germany
but we're also fighting the squirrels
in squirrel week the children of
california killed 104
000 squirrels just in that week oh
and there were prizes for the schools
that did best yeah wasn't wasn't there
one girl who had like a kill list of
over three thousand
alone yeah she was like the head of the
the top of the pack
she went on to single-handedly defeat
the nazis
[Laughter]
the cape ground squirrel is an
interesting ground squirrel
and that's because they can self-relate
and not only can they do they do so
[Laughter]
you would it's not like you and me just
telling people we can do
they prove it prove it
for god's sake don't prove it
not before you showed me your favorite
nuts right
can i get on about this yes itself of
course self-masturbating
squirrel you know self-masturbating is
the only kind of masturbating james
well
go on if i do the fact that some of it
might get in the podcast
because if i because if i masturbate a
pig for
the i don't think you're masturbating it
i think you're just
you're giving it handy yeah no no no no
because
there's a breeding program for pigs i'm
not just i'm not sorry just to
to address the scene i think i would be
masturbating that pig i think
technically that's probably not true
really i'm saying i think well i've got
to go and refill in all the forms now
[Laughter]
gonna rename the blog
so yeah the squirrels yeah um they
they do it supposedly as a form of
self-medication
okay and the idea is that if they clean
their genitals
it might stop them from getting an sti
okay and the best way for them to do
that
is to masturbate right however they live
in the desert and they can't afford to
lose
any water no and so they need to get the
water back into their body
and so they clean their genitals and
they
take in their um fluids
it's base two and base three is what
you're saying
base five um
golly oh gosh wow whatever works that's
because you've had this podcast you've
always learned something you didn't know
before yeah
but yeah right well let's yeah
we've actually got to move on guys um
we don't actually need to but i really
think we should um
i have one more thing about um this was
about going to the loo in the middle of
the night oh yeah
so victorian tourists i i mean 19th
century tourists what you would do if
you were a tourist in france because
lots of um
you know accommodation would not have
much in the way of sanitation
women would purchase an object which was
sold called the inodorous
standard pale okay and pale as in bucket
and it had a mahogany
rim and a hermetically closing cover and
it was basically a
what are we calling it kind of chamber
pod but the brilliant thing was
it was disguised as a hat box so you
could carry it around without
embarrassment
but you definitely don't want to put
your hats in it because if someone asks
can i borrow your hat books i've got a
spare hat i need to carry
what is the excuse the recommended
excuse you're supposed to
but it is a good excuse if you
accidentally piss in someone's hat box
[Laughter]
we need to move on to our next fact
okay it is time for fact number three
and that
is james okay my fact this week is that
in 1385 a four year court case began
after two nights embarrassingly turned
up to a battle
wearing the same coat of arms
how embarrassing yeah were they
completely mortified did someone go home
did they both fight the battle
they both fought the battle it was a bit
later that the court case happened
so this was during the hundred years war
with france
uh in 1385 and scotland had signed a
pact with france
and some french soldiers had arrived
north of the border
and so richard ii just come of age
trying to kind of show that he meant
business
he decided he was going to invade
scotland and so they all went over this
big army to invade scotland
and when they did there was a guy called
richard's group
um spelled scroll but pronounced group
he was the first baron of bolton
and so robert grosner of cheshire and
they both turned up
and they realized that they had the
exact same coat of arms which was
an azure with a bend or that's a blue
background with a
gold sash and everyone felt very awkward
the court case sounds amazing the court
case really was
it was the who's who of the 14th century
yeah really well it was a bit of a i
think it was a bit of a fix this court
case so it was it was
who did you say it was scoop of bolton
against uh grozner
but it was it was held i think in york
minster and in york minster the
coat of arms was all over the place so
it's kind of subtle branding for this
group side yeah i should say it's not
the good bolton in lancashire it's the
ship bolton in yorkshire
that makes more sense actually i was
wondering about that yeah but then it
turned out later on after this court
case was over there was a third family
also using the same coat of arms but
they were in cornwall and everyone said
oh well it's cornwall you know it's a
they said basically they said well it's
a different country so the rules are
different there as at the time it was
well also the guy in cornwall who
claimed that his crest was the same was
a guy called karma now and he claimed
that his
crest had been given by king arthur
which was quite impressive considering
he didn't exist
we didn't definitively not exist what
yeah king arthur didn't definitively not
exist there are later reports of a
character called arthur anyway we don't
but he's not an absolute he's not like
peter pan
well it's a good job you weren't in
charge of this court case
[Laughter]
wow so there's maybe a king arthur but
he didn't do any of the stuff
well that sucks yeah that's just a guy
called arthur
it's kind of like robin hood there's
someone with the name but none of the
rest of it's true so it's not even worth
it
oh okay who was who of the 14th century
i want to know what a court case of the
houston of the 14th century they were a
single person from the 14th century they
were that
what was that jeffrey charcer yes
exactly
what was that john of gaunt owen glen
dower
yes him as well that really is a who's
anyone i've heard of in the 14th century
was in this
cart cake was this the most exciting
court case of the era
doesn't sound like a big deal it really
wasn't it was quite dull
and it was just basically everyone came
in and so let's say john of gaunt turned
up
john of gaunt would go in and he would
say i once saw this guy with this coat
of arms on this date and i saw this guy
with a coat of arms on this date and i
saw this on this day and then they got
all of the evidence together and they
worked out who
had the best claim on it yeah precedence
wasn't it exactly yeah it was
first so but this was a um in the court
of chivalry
and the court of chivalry is an exciting
thing because this is a real court that
exists and it hasn't sat since 1954
okay the team really is dead isn't it
it's well it might
it might be coming back wait a minute
but what were the knights of armor in
1954
oh the in the 1954 case was a dispute
between manchester corporation and
manchester
palace of varieties over unlicensed use
of the manchester coat of arms
that is dull but before that so
okay there is a chance that the court of
chivalry is going to have to sit
sometime soon because of weatherspoons
okay this is so exciting
so last year last year barry
town council in wales uh i thought that
was his name
what an unfortunate sunday night no he
he invented the town council
it's very impressive yeah what a guy um
sorry yeah barry town council of wales
um
they were furious with weatherspoons
because weatherspoons in barry
had put the coat of arms of barry
the barry coat of arms on a carpet in
their pub
barry town council said hang on a second
you've got people walking
on the bury coat of arms maybe they're
going to the bar maybe they're going to
the toilet
we don't know where they're going you
know maybe they've got a dog with them i
mean
they just said it was very disrespectful
tim martin the boss of weatherspoons
refused to remove the carpet he said
it's a perfectly good carpet
we paid a lot of money for it just let
it wear out and we'll replace it in 10
years or so whatever
so they may yet go to the court of
chivalry if anyone can be bothered
yeah and they'll have to resurrect the
entire accord and do you think it will
be a who's who of the 21st century with
sort of
george clooney barack obama
have you ever met barry town council
i've met barry's council
yeah i love the the rules of chivalry
the whole chivalry thing i i didn't
quite know what goes into becoming a
knight when you were made and you were
kind of trained
in order to become one but it was more
than battle it was
it was all these things like you had to
learn how to box wrestle run
you had to read write you had to play
the harp and sing that was part of
becoming
a knight yeah which is really sweet you
also you have to be a very good work
that was part of the code of chivalry
was you had to devotedly woo
one woman and it didn't the woman could
be married that was fine
lancelot i think was constantly wearing
a married woman again
possibly didn't exist or not yeah yeah
he was a figure of uh shavarik mythology
but you know he was like a being to
emulate he was wearing guinevere wasn't
he
yeah i thought he went for he went to
top trumps
martha's wife you can't all hope for
gwynevere but also
also i think the figure of cheval rick
myth so not real
so all of these people are setting the
standard that you're supposed to imitate
and the reason it all came in the
chivalric codes was because knights were
so badly behaved they were just like
around rampant around the countryside
so there were lots of books written
about how to correct
knight's behavior and so there were all
these courtesy books written in the sort
of 12th century and 13th century
there was one called the book of the
civilized man directed at knights and
it just had sort of a bullet-pointed
list
of rules so don't spit don't talk with
your mouth full
don't take huge helpings don't blow your
nose on the tablecloth
all things uh today that we would agree
with one cough a pig
[Laughter]
so maybe thirsty but the bars over there
there was a don't defecate well uh sorry
there was
you were allowed to defecate you weren't
allowed to attack your enemy while he
was defecating
on chivalrous yeah unless unless he's
riding a horse to cure his diarrhea in
which case
he's on a horse wow have you heard of
the um the scottish court and what they
do to badly behaving nights no
they will destroy your arms i presume
your coat of arms
[Laughter]
will be very mean they will break your
stained glass windows which have got
your coat of arms in them
they will smash any unwarranted seals
again seals
um but then they will issue a letter of
horning
okay of what's happening
they do a letter which denounces you as
an outlaw and then they have three
blasts of
horn and that means you have technically
been put to the horn
pretty exciting stuff yeah and wait what
does that mean to have been put aside
from about you do three bars of a horn
but what's
i don't know if you know what the
ramifications you're not a knight
anymore right you're in there yeah
you're not a
do you know why they're called coats of
arms it's because you used to have a
coat that you wore
over your arms your armor and that's
where the word comes from really
amazing yeah but everyone was hoping
that it was a coat made of arms so
yeah that's the dream but you used to
have your armor and you
would always wear a cloak over him the
reason being that if you're fighting
somewhere hot
then um wearing armor is pretty bad like
you're basically going to cook in there
and so if you wore a cloak then it could
stop you from getting from the sun's
rays from cooking you
so you would always have to wear this
cloak and on the back of the cloak it
would have your
arms your coat of arms and so that's
where the word came from
wow superman basically like the original
yeah saying who you are your logo on
your back that's so cool
and the idea was you wanted people to
know who you are because if you're an
important person in a battle
you don't want to be killed you want to
be captured well you don't want to be
captured you want to win
but if you're your second best if you
don't win
is to not die the team talk like this
the halfway mark right we've given up on
a on a win but we are going for being
captured all of us
um so yeah so you wanted to be captured
and so you would have this kind of coat
of armor so that people would see you
on battle and not kill you they think oh
well he's worth something i'm going to
take him instead of killing him and then
i'll be able to get some money like
catching someone else's
shiny pog is it yeah yep that was a very
specific
sort of 1994 kids there
jeff bezos has a coat of arms see yeah
it's got two tortoises and a rocket
a rocket is it i'm just imagining a [ __ ]
and bulls formation
you know what i haven't seen it i
presume it is
it's jeff bezos absolutely you can just
you can just get them made though
because there's the college of arms in
the uk except scotland
do you know what the blue mantle per
sweevent at the college of arms gets
paid each year
i didn't know what most of those words
are not the same there's a lot of kind
of cod latin and comprehension stuff no
blue mantle per suite
or per second is a junior possession at
the college of arms guess what he gets
paid
uh a ten or a year old seven shillings
and six points and half a crown
three sticks and a dead porcupine okay
lovely
and pogs pogs
uh anna was closest it's thirteen
ninety-five yeah
for the ceremony where he was invested
in his role he had to buy a pair of silk
tights which cost
double his annual salary and is that
taxpayer funded for god's sake
do you know what the uh or you know all
those weird words you just said uh all
that language you know what it's called
it's called blazon
so in heraldry the weird language of
heraldry uh which is a lot of stuff that
we don't understand it's called blazon
and all the vocab and it's also related
to the
the habits of heraldry so all the
traditions so for instance there's a
difference between english and scottish
heraldry in blazen and that
is how you erase a bear's head and so
this is you know
if you see a coat of arms then you'll
sometimes have an animal like a lion or
a bear on it
and if you've got a raised head what
that means is a head that's been
decapitated from her body or it looks
like it's been torn off from a body so
it's got sort of ragged edges
in the neck you will have seen it a lot
but the way you tell the difference
between an english coat of arms and a
scottish coat of arms is
a bear's head and english heraldry is
erased horizontally under the neck
and so it goes across and you get some
neck in whereas in scotland
it's erased vertically and you cut the
neck off
so if you imagine a vertical line going
down yeah so if a bear's got neck
english no neck scottish
we've been doing this podcast for six
and a half years now and i think that is
the least useful piece of information
ever so if you are galloping into battle
against the scots
which may well happen in the near future
you're gonna need to know

[Music]
um we need to move on to our final fact
of the show it is time for our final
fact of the show
and that is anna
my fact this week is that the audubon
bird protection society has warned its
members against
bird splaining and
so mansplaining is when a man annoyingly
so but if if mansplaining is what a man
is awkwardly explaining something which
he doesn't need to is birdsplaining when
a bird explains something to you
we don't call them birds these day we
call them women
i've been asleep for 270 days
and my testicles are so sore
it's not and you're right it's an
incorrect use of the splaining uh
etymology because it's not like when a
pigeon gets really patronizing
it's basically this is in an article on
the alderman website which is
sort of like the authority on birds and
as a bird writer becca heisman
she was sort of inspired by bird
watchers who do things like get
extremely agitated
if people refer to a canadian goose as
opposed to a canada goose
or a seagull bird watchers hate people
calling it a seagull because there's no
such thing as a seagull there are gulls
a lot of them don't live by the sea a
seagull apparently is a nonsense term
her warning to bird watchers is and i'm
repeating it now
that it can put people off if as soon as
you casually mention a seagull in
conversation someone says well actually
there's no such thing as a seagull so
you're not making any sense
and um that's the official word
of the bird watching society that's my
life with you three
yeah sorry about that um but yeah bird
watchers are they're a pedantic
breed they can be and just to clarify
yeah a canadian goose should be a canada
goose
and um goals lots of lots of different
11 different types of girl in the uk
and there is actually an account a
twitter account called at no such
gull uh which is about and the name is
no such thing as a girl
and it's kind of about how girls
seagulls don't exist
and so i don't really want to slag off
people who are really pedantic about it
because they do actually follow qi and
retweeted us very recently
in fact yesterday i think the most
fascinating thing about that fact is
you were on twitter yeah
[Applause]
i only go on for bird watching updates
it can be hard though being a bird
watcher i think we should cut them some
slack yeah in um 2013
they found this amazing rare bird on the
island of harris it was a white throated
needle
tail normally you'd only find it in asia
or in australia
um but it was on the island of harris
probably got caught on a draft of wind
or something
and so everyone suddenly got a message
on their phones or on their twitter
account saying
guys there is a white throated needle
tail on harris and loads of people went
up there
to the island all the way up in the
north of scotland to see this bird
which was then hit by a wind turbine
no in front of all these bird watchers
oh that's what i was going i've got an
amazing updraft here
wow this that doesn't it does happen so
i think there was a story that someone
there was a is it a faralope there's a
boat called a faralop i think anyone
know
actually again i think it was something
like a gray pharaoh and i'm going off
memory so i really can't remember it but
it was
these bird watchers had got to it and
they were so excited about seeing it
very rare
in the area where they were and then
they saw a buzzard just arrive
and land and eat it right in front of
them but then they did say although the
buzzards actually
they're very rarely feed on that kind of
prey so kind of two birds with one stone
to be honest
they use that phrase they use that
phrase genuinely yeah well they're funny
guys
have you heard of other uh bird watching
slang oh yeah this gets used in the
in the bird watching community do you
want to have a guess at what a not a
bird is
is this something that's not a bird
something that's not a bird uh
it's something that looks like a bird
from a distance but once binoculars or a
spotting scope is used turns out not to
be a bird is it
is it something that's either a plane or
superman that's right
have you heard of a pseudo bird pseudo
bird sounds like it's also a not a bird
yeah well a pseudo bird is something
that looks like a bird and perhaps even
moves like a bird
until it is examined through binoculars
or a spotting scope
and found to be something completely
different
what is an example of a pseudo bird like
a bag of crisps bag of crisps
very good wow you know it caused the
tree
this very much feels like sort of class
one of ornithology doesn't it
are you struggling to identify a bird
yeah
do you know what more slang do you know
what jizz is in it
yes yeah let's move on i see i see you
read my blog
[Laughter]
jizz is the sort of when you can't quite
see what the bird is
and you talk about the vibe of the bird
like it's giving off this vibe so it
must be
this kind of so it kind of it moves a
bit like a black bird and it's kind of
blackish
and you think that probably is a black
bird is that what it is i think so it's
basically the whole demeanor isn't it
that buzz jizz is well it's tall it's
fat uh it's brown
it's tall it's fat it's yellow i'm
watching sesame street it's been in use
for a long time though i
i think it even predates jizz as we know
it today but
yeah there are rumors that it stands for
general impression size and shape which
was a military term in the second world
war but it actually comes from before
that from 1922
and it now is spread to like all
biologists so you'll talk about plants
jizz
as well which i like one etymology i
don't know if this is true either but
people say
it just is what is that bird oh just it
just is
yeah jizz feels to me like it comes from
gist hey what's the gist
that's better isn't it yeah do you know
what um gripping someone off is in bird
watching
[Music]
well it can't get very exciting you've
got to do something to pass to the hours
while waiting for the white-tailed
needle thing but um
gripping someone off is a bad thing to
do in bird watching it's where you
see a bird that someone else has missed
out on and then you tell them
about the bird that you've seen so
you'll sort of you're sort of bragging
to them and you know that they've missed
the opportunity to see this bird oh
really
yeah yeah it's and if someone's not
noticed it maybe they were looking at in
the wrong place or whatever so
that's a bad thing to do don't uh don't
grip off if you do go bird watching so
you're just not allowed to share
if you see something cool you're not
allowed you have to keep a secret okay
someone gets upset they didn't see it
you're supposed to share but some
[ __ ] bird watchers
grip people off and they're like oh yeah
i saw it last week you're too late i
could have told you but i didn't
right right just as it's disappearing
down the buzzard's gullet you say
i've just seen a feral lobe or whatever
yeah
this fact was about the audubon uh
society right the bird society and
he actually is an incredible character
from history who was the first person
to put together a sort of great
collection of paintings
published in a book of the birds of
america
and it's one of those rare books now
that it basically outsells any book
in terms of price value at an auction so
a copy went
a while ago for about 11 million uh 11
million
yeah it's we've got one in our house no
an original
oh i don't know okay so it's not all of
them going for that
no no your kindle pdf is not going to be
sold at sotheby's
have you noticed that every branch of
waterstones has a massive safe in the
middle of the shop floor that's where
they keep that book
i was this close to standing up and
walking off the podcast
thank you guys
bye sorry so some
some versions are very expensive yeah
this is um so it's an amazing book and
he used to paint these birds and
it used to be a bit more of a vicious
bird spotting thing these days the idea
i think of hurting a bird in any way
would be horrible back then in order to
paint the bird and spot them you
actually had to kill them so
he used to go around and he would shoot
birds and then what he would do is he
would put
sort of wires onto them and pose them as
if they were mid-flight so that he could
capture them
as if they were in the nature and they
were alive which is very different to
any kind of drawing at that time it was
usually very posed and very still
so he kind of he did that brilliantly
but the other amazing thing is this book
the original books how tall is your book
it's about this big yes it's big it's
it's a big book in the original the idea
was he wanted to capture the birds in
their full size
so when you saw it it was almost as if
you were in front of one wow
yeah but what's really wonderful is he
slightly miscalculated the size of some
of the birds
so in some of them they've had to be
contorted to sort of fit
to the page like squished down with
wings and stuff yeah
but yeah really fascinating character he
was do you know how he made his living
before he got into the bird drawing
business
or in fact as like you know while he was
drawing birds as a hobby he made his
money as a deathbed artist
so that's someone who if someone you
love dies
you go oh my god we forgot to get a
portrait of them we'd better get one now
and you went and you would paint a
portrait of a dead person of the corpse
and it would be
lying in repose with maybe a bunch of
flowers or photograph or something
but would he would he pose them like he
later did the birds as in with
with wires and with absolutely yeah
doing the high jump
or however you wanted it
have you guys heard of um phoebe
schnetzinger
so she in 1981 was diagnosed with
terminal cancer
and decided that instead of going into a
home and just
kind of succumbing to it she decided
well i've not got much time left so i'm
gonna go and look for birds
okay and she took a trip to alaska to
look for birds
and she kept looking for birds and kept
looking for birds and luckily
enough got into remission and kept
looking for birds and she was the first
person to see more than 8
000 species of birds ever and when she
died
uh eventually she'd seen 8 398 birds
which was 85
of the known species in the world
isn't that amazing wow so good um we're
gonna we're gonna have to wrap up soon
guys
yeah but we are you haven't but we are
no yes
but i haven't told you about graham moss
yet
right you've hugged me go for it
this is a bird watching story from this
year and it's just a rather rather nice
one it's doncaster baby owl webcam
banned by facebook over sex and nudity
rule
so this summer a man in doncaster called
graham moss
uh he set up a very sweet webcam of some
baby owls in their nest and just
so were you looking at moss news
this is a complete coincidence although
there is a book about bird watching by
someone called stephen moss
right you've been looking at martinez
and fortunately it's coincided with the
research for today
but you got lucky um but it got his
webcam was taken down twice because it
breached the community guidelines on
adult nudity and sexual activity but
what was happening nothing nothing was
happening it was just some baby owls but
either algorithmically it's sort of
almost likely
there we go no one's no one's seen this
outside this room
um but yeah he thinks he was pranked but
i think it's possible algorithmically
someone would see
some sort of you know writhing flesh in
a nest i think that looks that looks
rude
were they featherless baby else so
i think they've probably been very
feathered yeah you can get in trouble
with things like that the
um christmas island tourist board um
went on to facebook to advertise the
island's annual
burden nature week with the headline
some gorgeous shots here of some
juvenile boobies
oh no and facebook for some reason took
them down
[Laughter]
and they appealed to facebook saying
surely some mistake we're just talking
about this bird which is called a booby
and face but went
nope that's kind of i read there was an
interview uh birdwatch ireland
uh there was a member called niall hatch
and
the the person interviewing just got so
excited that he was called hatch that he
derailed the conversation in order to
say that's funny isn't it
and then he turned out he said it's
actually not as
uh sort of uncommon to have a
bird-related name for members
of the birdwatch in ireland it's it's a
bit more common so he then listed off a
bunch of people that were past and
present
people as part of it so we had donald
finch
aisling talon stephen wing dave bird
bit up bit on the nose dave
that is that is so a fake name isn't it
miss talon over here she's picked a part
of the bird
dave bird yeah anyone else
there's uh mark robbins see mark's
picked a species of birds
not like you dave olivia crowe
um and yeah mark robert do you think
some sometimes people in bird running
societies go
mark robins just saying look robins
do you think they go dave bird
um i've got one last thing just on the
subject of being pedantic and
birdsplaining we've actually had i've
been sent
a um a whatsapp message by alex bell who
is one of the fish team
uh he just wants me to pass this on to
anna anna's gold twitter thing is at
no such seagull not at no such girl
and i think we now know who runs that
account
[Laughter]
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening
if you'd like to get in contact with any
of us about the things that we have said
over the course of this podcast
we can be found on our twitter accounts
and someone on their blog
i'm on at tribal and andy at andrew
hunter m
or at porky's big adventure
james james harkin
and adam you can email podcast.qi.com
we can get us on our group count which
is at no such thing or you can go to our
website no such thing as a fish.com we
have all of our previous episodes up
there
um so uh just quickly before we end just
a huge thank you to the london podcast
festival and to king's place
it's truly awesome that the arts are
trying to get through this and we feel
so
lucky to be able to do this in front of
you guys today and i hope you had a fun
time
and um so that's it we'll be back again
next week we'll see you then
[Applause]
[Music]
goodbye
[Applause]

=343
hi guys just before we start this show
we wanted to let you know that
we at qi have a brand new book out
that we have devoted our that was a nice
little whoop
james is very excited about it was that
down it was actually that was a dan loop
i can't i'm very
down i'm very insulted you can't tell
james from medan
[Laughter]
i think we can all agree that it wasn't
an andrew hunter murray whoop
we know that much um yeah we're really
excited about this book
it's called funny you should ask and
it's basically all the questions that
pop into your head
that you always wanted the answers to
they're in this book so
here's a question anna yo if spiders can
walk on the ceiling why can't they get
out of the bath
james that is a fantastic question and
it's funny you should ask
because it happens to come up in our
brand new book funny you should ask
and i'm not going to tell you because
it's a spoiler go and buy it
okay i got a question that made didn't
make it into the book
um where's the book of the year 2020
come on dan we're not talking about that
we're pretending 2020 hasn't happened i
thought we were all in cahoots here
around the world yeah because then don't
forget the book of the year was an a to
z
of the world's news and i reckon once
you get to c for covid that was going to
be most of the book wasn't
that's true that's true it hasn't been a
year
um okay why do i have so many odd socks
better
better question because you're very
disorganized okay who was that guy my
wife was having dinner with last night
some of these are questions in the book
and some of them aren't and
we have all of the elves have got
together and we've written the answers
to these questions and as many
interesting weird amazing little facts
nuggets that we could squeeze in
as well so yes there is not a book of
the year 2020 this year i'm afraid
because we are all
in denial about 2020 but there is this
hopefully distracting
and interesting book for you to get now
that's right it's called
funny you should ask and it's available
in all good places where you buy books
classic james whoop i'm not sure about
that okay i'm with the podcast
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four undisclosed
locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with james harkin
andrew hunter murray and anna tashinsky
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones of our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in a particular order here we go
starting with you
anna my fact this week is that during
out-of-hours periods
hospital ct scanners are sometimes used
to scan
egyptian mummies wow that's so cool
it's so weird this is um because
mummies need scanning sometimes to find
out what's inside them
so it's much less invasive as you can
imagine than actually unwrapping a mummy
which can sort of cause the mummies to
disintegrate as you do it
and you want to know what jewels they've
got in them or what
state their bones are in stuff like that
and
about well actually almost since the
dawn of x-rays they realize this would
be really useful for scanning mummies
and since the year 2000 apparently it's
been a routine
use for hospital ct scanners
is to use them on mummies there are
various hospitals in the uk that do it i
think
manchester children's hospital does a
very strong line in loaning its ct
scanners out
i think it was lee's hospital i can't
remember exactly but i read one of them
saying that they
did it in the night or out of hours
because they didn't want to scare the
patients which i think makes sense
doesn't it i love the idea of seeing the
previous
patient coming out and they've been
desiccated
i'm not going in there
i think it looks a bit late for that one
to be honest so the scans necessary
so this one was in spain right the
specific story um that you sent around
to us
because i found this very specific one
very fascinating um
the fact that this was a project that
was done between the spanish national
museum of archaeology and one of the
university hospitals
and they wanted to scan three of the
mummies that they had trying to identify
who they were
and really cool thing about it is that
they had to map out a specific
route from the museum to the hospital
so that they went on roads that had no
bumps on them so that they didn't damage
the mummy you know you don't want to hit
a speed bump and break your mummy in
half on the way that's pretty sweet
i once um broke a rib and i got a taxi
home because i didn't realize i've
broken my rib
and it's the most pain that i've ever
been in because the speed bumps
everywhere in london isn't there
yeah and taxi drivers don't seem to care
about them and it was just
every time you went over one it killed
and then i read a bit later that they
thought they might use um speed bumps
as a way of telling if you've got
appendicitis
so it's a really good way of telling
because
the speed bumps hurt you so much if
you've got something like appendicitis
that
it's almost as good a way of diagnosing
it as almost any other non-invasive way
it's pretty wow i think these are great
though we should release these as part
of gps sort of
like egyptologists should release the
roots that have no bumps
so that like not just people with broken
ribs but mummies
to be you know pregnant women they can't
go overboard as well
you know we should be using this for an
advantage well no i mean it's not good
for you it's not good for you to go
but it's so funny because you've got a
bump and yet you can't go over a bump
the bump is
in within you already that is funny you
should only have one
one bump should never meet another
that's the rule
the spanish ones are really cool because
they there were some
egyptian mummies and there were some
guanchi mummies which
are ancient people from tenerife and i
didn't know that people from tenerife
got turned into members they were buried
in caves and the naturally
dry air desiccated them and dried them
out so uh
yeah yeah and the egyptian one they got
when they scanned they discovered that
it was um the pharaoh imhotep's
high priest like what a score what a
that's like to me that's like panini
stickers like you're like oh yes
it's like a chinese priest yeah exactly
it's a shiny
how did they tell that from a scan was
he wearing a badge he was actually
like weirdly he was wearing a lot of um
amulets and there were lots of
adornments where they could piece
together
who he was uh from what he was wearing
okay make sense because yeah they're
often
wrapped up with you know possessions
like rubies and jewels and
sapphires and things like that aren't
they so the scan actually serves two
purposes with the mummy
you can see what they were buried with
and so learn a lot about the rituals
and then you can see into their bones
and see kind of what injuries they had
and so what sort of lives they led
and also quite often you can see what it
actually
is so it turns out when things are
mummified and we find them
we don't always know even whether it's a
human or an animal they brought one into
the kent institute of medicine and
surgery in 2018
which they all thought was a mummified
bird and put it through the scanner and
it turned out that it was a miscarried
baby
but that actually makes it the youngest
mummy ever to be
discovered that's amazing so it tells
you a lot
have you heard about the crocodile
shaped mummy that they found no
no this was brought in and it was i mean
it was very clearly the shape
of a crocodile it couldn't it was if it
was a christmas present
under the tree you would think oh i'm
getting a crocodile basically
but they looked into it they scanned it
right in the ct scanner
and they discovered that it was not a
crocodile can you guess what it was
oh an alligator no um a
human sticking their arms out in a
crocodile
mouth fashion oh yeah like a normal baby
baby shark
kind of like a baby shark impersonation
yes yeah
it was actually eight crocodiles
it was eight small crocodiles which have
been mummified in the shape of a big
crocodile
and i think this is where we get the
cultural trope of the like three small
people in an overcoat
yeah they're trying to get into an adult
crocodile movie
crocodiles were hunted to be mummified
as well weren't they which we didn't
realize we kind of thought that they
just mummified dead crocodiles as and
when
they came upon them uh but they've
realized
from ct scanning the mummified crocs
they've realized that
you had you must have had crocodile
hunters who would have to go out and
beat crocodiles to death
and they smashed it the ct scan shows
that their skulls have been smashed in
and then rebuilt so you kill it by
smashing its skull but then you kind of
need to make it look like a proper skull
again
it's not surprising they went for eight
baby crocodiles and they just came back
saying oh yeah got another crocodile
here i've actually pre-mummified it so
there's no need
to examine
[Laughter]
very good um so ct scanners
the the object themselves um a british
invention at least half so
uh from a guy called godfrey n
hounsfield
who in the 70s was awarded a nobel prize
for it and emi were the people who
developed
the ct scanner and emi is the very same
emi
that is the music company and when they
yeah when they were developing this they
needed more money to sort of help the
company to do this stuff and
it just so happened that in 1957 emi
acquired
capital records which allowed them to
distribute british music
into america and it's 1957 the beatles
are about to arrive in 1962 a few years
later and that is
that helped raise the money for ct
scanners so the beatles
are partially responsible for the reason
that we have ct's
i've read quite a few places saying
that's a myth um
and there's a paper which is called do
we really need to thank the beatles for
financing the development
of the computer tomography scanner
um i don't know if that's the kind of
tone that they had in mind when they
wrote the title
but they say um that emi only paid about
a hundred thousand pounds
into the um into the development of the
ct scanner
whereas the government paid in a lot
more than that and so they say
accordingly british taxpayers and
officials of the british dhss are to be
thanked for the ct scanner
the beatles input into the world's
culture is valuable
but it does not require decoration by
non-existent connection
to the development of ct okay
here we go who was paying a lot of tax
due to very very high government tax
rates in the 1960s and 70s
the beatles right the right stones all
they went to france it was the beatles
i've got to say i do i do agree with dan
that i think these guys are being a
little bit uppity and i think that the
beatles
you know it's 100 000 pounds and it was
at the start as well they gave
hounsfield the money
at the top and then the government came
in and gave him a lot more money later
so
i think it's kind of fair that the
beatles had something to say but but
sorry why was the record label investing
in ct scanners well because
emi stands for electric and music
industries
and they're originally an electrical and
music company so they made electrics and
they made music
and so this was like the electrical side
of their brand
and they also did music stuff as well
okay
sounds legit yeah it sounds almost it's
still loose i reckon but yeah good on
them thank you beatles
for saving so many lives rockets get ct
scanned and that's to
check that all their stuff is working so
nasa
and the navy use this system called
actis systems which are special
rocket ct scanners and they are
especially rigged up to spot flaws in
like the engine parts
and stuff like that and they doubled up
as whale scanners very cool this guy
called ted
cranford who's a whale expert and he
became obsessed with the idea that he
really wanted to ct scan a whale and
both whales don't fit into most
conventional ct scanners and
you could get six tiny whales and put
them in a big whale suit
doesn't make any sense you've got to go
the other way around
chop a whale into six parts anyway so
first of all he needed to get hold of a
whale so apparently his mates knew that
he was looking for a big old whale head
to scan
and they found a dead sperm whale on a
california beach
and so these two friends of his borrowed
a front-end loader like one of those
trucks
from a construction company nearby cut
the head of this whale
carried it to a massive freezer
somewhere in a marine laboratory in
california
called ted it was like well look we've
got your whale head what now
and then ted was like okay cool we need
to find a ct scanner
and he convinced the navy to loan him
their
massive rocket scanner wow it's revealed
lots of cool stuff so the whole point is
to find out about whale vocalization
so sperm whale clicks are incredibly
loud so he wants to look at how they
make them
and then how they hear and yeah now he
just shoves marine animals through ct
scanners all the time
he said that um i was reading an
interview with him and he was saying he
once was trying to dissect a dolphin
head and
he had to do it in a deep freezer so he
has to wear freezer gear and go into the
deep freezer
to dissect this head uh but at the time
the deep freeze was being shared by a
giant skewer
a sort of swan sized bird from
antarctica
captain
[Laughter]
this massive bird from the antarctic
that just kept attacking him and
vomiting on him for four days as he
tried to dissect this
oh it was alive was it live in the
freezer well
it's from antarctic it's used yeah
exactly
it wouldn't like it in the oven
but what it was okay the dolphin's dead
i thought the dolphin was alive the
dolphin no dolphin's dead
and it's not in water it's not you've
got it the wrong way around dolphin is
dead in the freezer
if you put a dolphin in the freezer it
will die if it's not already uh yeah
skewer's life yeah but yeah
was the skewer kind of tied up do you
think it must have been right that can't
of just been what kind of
sick messed up scientist ties up a
skewer in a freezer
i was thinking you know what i was
waving this through what i was thinking
is and this won't go in but
do you remember on your stag do when we
did the escape room with the zombie who
was tied up
i was just thinking that as well yes
with the chain in here
so far i can imagine it even more
exciting if it was a skewer
yeah yeah and then if the key is hidden
inside the head of a dead dolphin
but you have to get it into a ct scanner
to see where it is
hi guys just wanted to let you know that
we're sponsored this week by hellofresh
and stop the podcast oh sorry
i knew there was something but yes yes
we are we are sponsored by hellofresh
and hellofresh are the recipe box
company that said delicious meals all
the way to your very door they do
and there are so many advantages to
using hellofresh we all
use it so it saves lots of time you can
even select recipes that take 20 minutes
or less to cook
and they really do only take that amount
of time you don't have to go out to the
supermarket
you don't have to you know interact with
someone
uh at the till all of those terrible
things associated with shopping
you don't have to do them anymore and
the meals they are really really
delicious aren't they anna can you give
us can you give us some examples
uh well so this week i'm going to be
having a pulled chicken burger and i
didn't even know
that you could pull chicken and ginger
beef noodles
or you can toggle to vegetarian menus if
you want it sounds amazing
well you can get 50 off your first hello
fresh box
and 35 of your next three by using the
code a
fish at checkout that is correct it
really is a good
value and then you can get a further 50
off your first box and thirty five
percent off your next three
if you go to hellofresh dot co dot uk
and use the code
a fish when you check out oh yeah you
also have to go i forgot to say that you
have to go to hellofresh.com.uk
to use that code a fish we're doing
everything in the wrong order today anna
this has been a shambles listen to this
advert backwards and you'll understand
exactly what we're trying to tell you
on with the podcast just putting that in
there for the out of order sequence
um but i also want to say that we are
also sponsored this week by
harry's yes harry's the razor company
and
just as hellofresh send food to your
very da harry's
send amazing razors to your very door
that's right so you can shave your face
and your potatoes if the order arrives
at the same time
they did something really interesting
which is they realize that if they want
to sell blades to people and they want
to ensure quality they have to buy their
own factory
so they did they went to germany found
one that's been making blades for 100
years
and just bought it nice we should have
done that with the podcast we should
have just bought an existing podcast
factory
one that's been going for a hundred
years yep yep podcasts have been going
longer than we realised they're very
forward in germany um
harry's is a brilliant company it does
send you extraordinary stuff in one box
it means that you can get a full
classy shave in one go you get a
weighted ergonomic handle
you get their five blade razor cartridge
there's a rich lathering shave
gel there's a travel blade cover so you
can protect your blade while you're on
the move
uh and that's and that's just part of
the trial set isn't it which only cost
three pound 95 and you can get that if
you go to harry's.com
that's right so to get all of that
amazing package for just three pounds 95
head to harrys.com fish and claim that
trial set
okay stop the podcast wait on with the
show
[Music]
okay it's time for fact number two and
that is my fact
my fact this week is that in 1973
british rail successfully designed and
patented
a flying saucer
that sounds awesome so um this was uh
the late 1960s british rail commissioned
an engineer who was called charles
osmond frederick
and they just they commissioned him to
design a lifting platform
uh for use and he took some time to
develop it
and then he came back to them he lifted
things too far
exactly in 1973 he came back with what
he claimed was a fully functional flying
fusion-powered spinning flying saucer so
it's uh it was a very exciting thing he
handed it in
and not only did they not send him away
and say he was crazy but they submitted
it to be
patented and the government granted it
it was successfully
patented and it was given a number and
everything and
it should still in theory be uh patented
but they
they overran on the on the license and
they didn't renew
um so unfortunately why not would you
not renew uh
a patent for a nuclear fusion-powered
flying saucer
yeah can i just when you say he they
wanted a lifting platform
what did that mean i think you know when
when you see construction
workers outside and they go on that
little platform that looks like a cross
ladder that raises up and up i think
it's like one of those
they they obviously had a need for it
somewhere in what they do
got it and he decided a fusion pack
because it's fusion pad wasn't it which
is
yeah fascinatingly ambitious given that
what humans have been trying to do for
almost a century
is create something that can be powered
by fusion-based energy
yeah he just sold it i reckon i'm on to
it to be honest
i mean it was it was fusion powered
right
it was ignited by laser beams uh
and the lasers were energized by a
homopolar generator
and it kind of feels like he's just been
reading a load of science fiction books
and picked up a few words and god oh
you know that's a kind of thing isn't it
why don't we say that i mean
well it was incredibly detailed i think
he i think he thought
he knew that the science didn't exist i
think he was trying to predict
the future of where science would go and
the idea i think british rail saw this
this was a time when
there was a lot of interest in space and
they thought maybe
let's get ahead of the game here and
make sure if if we suddenly discover all
the things that he's
predicted sorry not predicted but needs
that are not yet around if they suddenly
come too
this might actually work it feels a bit
like patent trolling doesn't it because
if i tomorrow managed to come up with a
way of
making nuclear fusion work so it can
power things
i don't want to have to pay 20 to
british rail because they speculatively
said that oh we invented this thing
that is going to be in the future james
if you do that and i am not saying you
will i'm saying in fact that you won't
but if you did do that
you infused like 100 years from now
sorry to cross your dreams
i feel like you should believe in me
okay look as a physics graduate i'm
saying you are the most likely of the
four of us to produce nuclear fusion
however
but if you did do that in a podcast 100
years from now they would be able to say
did you know that actually we have
british rail to thank for
nuclear fusion it would be like emi and
the ct scale all over again
yes they're the beatles yeah or would we
be saying it's thanks to a podcast wait
a minute are we the beatles
in this case i think british rail is
british rail is the beatles and we're
sort of
einstein and people are going did you
know
it's not actually james harkin who we
have to thank for fusion
it's british rail
yeah one of the reasons that we didn't
know this until quite recently so it was
some like patent fans found it didn't
they
yeah but one of the reasons that we
didn't find it is because it contained
the word nuclear
in the patent and when you put the word
nuclear in your patent
it kind of often gets given a secrecy
order and so you need to go through an
extra hoop
to look at those pages really yeah it
looked really cool though um if you look
at the drawings on the patent it does
look like a proper
flying saucer and there's drawings on
the inside there's not proper
descriptions
of what the inside um how it would fully
function it was more trying to focus on
the engineering side of it
but it looks to some people who've sort
of analyzed what
were drawn it looks like it could carry
60 people inside it
the way that it looked like they would
be inside it is that
if you picture like when you go to a
fairground and there's that gravity
tunnel thing where you will stand
against the wall
and as it spins you get sucked to the
wall it's sort of like that the ceiling
the seats are arranged around the edge
of the inside
that's a circular saucer that's an
uncomfortable way to travel if you're
going by british rail and you have to be
stuck up against the site how are you
going to get to the buffet car
exactly also they don't work on me
genuinely
it doesn't work on me genuinely doesn't
work on me i've been on
i've been on them twice and i wouldn't
go on again because everyone had to hold
my hand as i slid down the wall
and everyone else is stuck up there i
was just i just stayed on the floor
this is an even bigger claim than james
saying he's going to invent nuclear
duties
so the coolest british rail invention
that i came across
was uh did you guys know about the pop
cars
no uh i know so this is in 1949 british
rail decided to launch carriages that
were pubs and they were properly decked
out like
well they went for mock tudor design
lovely and
the outside of the carriage was all fake
brick so it looked like
an idyllic village bricked up tudor pub
where they put pub signs up
i think uh there are a few of them made
and they have names like the white horse
the jolly tar
the green man thomas the tanked engine
would be an awesome name for one
very nice very good very strong very
very good but
yeah this happened you could go board
your train and
sit down that was insane
it was discontinued because everyone
thought it was really tacky oh they're
wrong
i went to um i went to universal studios
in america right which is like a theme
park isn't it and they have the harry
potter world
there and you can get on there um
is it called the hogwarts the hogwarts
express uh
and you can pretend that you're going
across the scottish
countryside to get to hogwarts okay um
but first of all you have to queue up in
an exact replica
of king's cross and then um they have a
shop which is supposed to be exactly the
same as
a uk railway shop and they're so
accurate they sold cans of strongbow
[Laughter]
isn't that amazing they have loads of
like british brands of like i don't know
what british brands are but like
candies and stuff like that round trees
but they had tons of strong bow
i was like i've never felt so at home in
my life
drunk eight-year-olds everywhere yeah
running desperately at platform nine and
three
quarters so many concussed children
since you mentioned harry potter i just
want to say something about king's cross
station because you know platform nine
and three-quarters the thing that really
pisses off harry potter fans about it
when you go to kings cross where is it
it's between platforms eight and nine
so basically jk rowling goes stations
confused she meant houston she said
kings cross
and so they couldn't actually put
platform nine and three quarters between
platforms nine and ten
so it's between eight and nine and a
harry potter fan goes to king's crosses
like oh my god this doesn't make any
sense
it's not eight and three quarters wow
king's cross could resolve this quite
pressing a problem because they have
13 platforms they've got but they've got
they've got 13 platforms but their
platforms only go up to 11.
so one of them is nine and three
quarters which is like a fake one but
the other one
they needed to add an extra platform a
few years ago and they needed to add it
to the left hand side to the opposite
side of platform one
and they didn't want to call it platform
12 because they thought that'll confuse
people because it's at the opposite end
like platform 10 11 et cetera so they
called it platform zero
right so what kings cross can do is they
rename platform zero platform one yeah
as you would reading platform one
platform two et cetera et cetera et
cetera
you get to platform eight and nine and
suddenly a platform nine and three
quarters is in the right place
it's a great idea i mean you only have
one week probably of people wanting to
go to
luton and ending up get on the in foot
but then once that's happened a few
times people will get wise to it to be
honest what's one week
more of lost economic activity for the
uk at this point
exactly should we talk about ufos um
let's do it they're illegal in chateau
nerf de papa
you have right the grapes don't they
they um
actually exactly why it is oh really
really well
kind of yes so shut enough to
it's um a town uh in southeast france
and they obviously make very good red
wine and all the wine makers are
quite protective of their brand and then
in the 1950s there was a
load of reports in france of these what
they called
cigar valance which means flying cigars
and there were these kind of ufos going
around and people saying that they'd
seen martians and stuff like that it's
just like one of these normal
mass hysteria things where everyone
thought they saw ufos
but when that happened all the wine
growers were like well we can't have
ufos around here
so they made a law saying that no ufo
is allowed to land in chateau nerf de
pap and they're not even allowed to fly
over and if any alien lands
then they will be arrested immediately
and actually
only a few years ago the mayor of
chatham after pap said that they will
keep the law on the books so it
definitely does exist
he said that they want to keep it
because it kind of gives them a little
bit of publicity and stuff and it gets
them in the news every now and again
when people
realize that this is a thing but yes
if you're an alien then you like your
wine you can't go to chat on after pack
do you think do you think there are
aliens in alien air traffic control
somewhere going oh we really need to
land in the sort of south of france
region
oh but we remember we can't do it in the
pap
area because of course interplanetary
law i don't know how much they respect
interplanetary law i think it's a french
law as well
question is have you ever heard of a ufo
landing there anna that is a good
question and i haven't done
quite proven point proven they respect
it greatly
um do you guys know that a decline in
christianity
is directly responsible for a massive
rise in flying
sources in quite an interesting way
um so this is because
in the 1940s there's a there was a
belgian company called
belgica and it made communion wafers
for church and a declining christianity
meant that there was suddenly a lot less
demand for communion wafers
and so they were like what do we do
we've got this technology but people
aren't really buying it anymore
and then what they realized was they
could take that edible paper
in communion wafers sandwich some
sherbet in between two bits of it
oh you've got there it's a flying saucer
no the confectionery so
so flying saucers are made from
communion wafer same stuff
originate yeah yeah that was amazing and
i've got to say the church is really
missing out on a way of getting the
youth in isn't it
if those wafers exploded in your mouth
in the same way that flying saucers do
i might convert that is cool
[Applause]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
andy my fact is that in 2017 the u.s
defense secretary had a light
installed in his bathroom which would
turn on if north korea launched a
nuclear missile
no how stressful wow how stressful
who was it that was jane when james
mattis that's right
jim mattis and this was at the time when
north korea was launching
it was the big sort of north korean
missile hoo-ha of 2017
and it needed urgent response obviously
if they launched another missile if they
were detected doing another nuclear test
and this light was installed in his
bathroom uh
so he could see it from the shower if he
was having a shower he would be able to
immediately jump out of the shower go
downstairs get in the car
and go did he always have to shower in
the dark so that he'd be able to see
this like
[Laughter]
i don't know what he had basically his
whole home was rigged up like this huge
korean missile booby trap
so there was a bell in his kitchen there
was one in his bedroom
and um i should say this is all from a
new book uh
called rage by bob woodward who is an
incredible veteran
u.s reporter um and these
these bells went off on more than one
occasion
and um he had a car which had to be
followed by an suv
and inside the suv there was a team
plotting the flight path of any
potential incoming nuclear missile
and this was just his life he had a very
very stressful life
and he slept he slept in his gym clothes
didn't he he had just had to be at the
ready
yeah well surely he should have showered
in his clothes as well otherwise
was he how often did he end up naked in
the emergency vehicle
um just on on missiles uh generally
it's astonishing when you look into the
history of missile and missile alerts
in the last 70 years and you realize
how many times we've come to the brink
of essentially nuclear war
based on a what should have been a minor
cock-up isn't it so there have just been
so many false
missile alarms and i think my favorite
ones
are well one of them was in 1960
when there was uh so mid-cold war
everyone is very tense to be fair
there was radar u.s radar in greenland
which suddenly reported that there were
dozens of soviet missiles coming over
the horizon exactly where they'd be
expected to be coming from
and they were attacking and so the u.s
defense command went into maximum
alert um you know things were they were
getting ready to retaliate
and it turned out to be the moon so
it was all right it was the moon rise
over norway
which happened that the moon reflected
back the radar
uh in the same way the missile attack
might have wow
and it came back with 99.9 percent
certainty that they were under soviet
attack
and so that's poor programming isn't it
it's because you would think that the
moon sometimes rises over norway and
you'd think
there would be some kind of anti-moon
protocol built into this program yeah
there was another one in
1979 where they believed that they were
on the brink of
of death as well and it was um
this one guy who was the national
security adviser to president carter so
this is in america
where this happened um he woke up with
the phone call saying that the soviets
had just launched 250
missiles and it was headed straight for
them and
he had this weird reaction where he was
in a house full of his family and he
didn't bother to wake his wife up
because
he assumed that there was no point in
troubling her with the fear they were
all going to be dead
in the next half hour or so so just
leave them
and um he sort of casually just accepted
that death was coming
and then just waited and all the systems
again
sort of showed that this was a big
mistake and they couldn't work out what
it was
turns out it was a video game that had
been put
accidentally into the system at norad
and
they were doing a simulation of what it
would be like if they were attacked but
the system thought it was real
and it was just a complete cock-up yes
so this war game was playing out and
they all thought this was a real thing
and
they eventually worked that out and
carter never found out until years
or at least months down the line uh that
this had in fact happened
i can't imagine not waking up one spouse
in
at the time when you think nuclear war
is coming well that's just
your typical selfish attitude isn't it
you're something you want her to suffer
to
i mean i want to be screening with
someone
i guess he had a job to do though right
like he had he was the guy who was meant
to check in on this
you wouldn't want your whole family
screaming around you go
as you try to remain calm one of the
really scary things
is that one of the things he thought to
do in that moment was
and this was um supposedly the quote i
want to make sure that we'd have company
and the idea was he wanted to press a
button of retaliation on the soviets
before they all died so that that was
wiped out as well so
like like this misfire thing that could
have led to something real
as well well that's why there's a lot of
controversy still
um about the fact that we still have all
those cold war
things in place which means that they
can retaliate within minutes
and but i think the terrifying thing
about that one dan was that it must have
seemed so
perfect right because the the tape i
think was a technician accidentally put
this tape
into one of the um machines at norad
which is
um the north american aerospace defense
command
and it the whole point of the simulation
was to make it seem like the soviets had
launched the worst
possible attack you know every single
nuclear facility was targeted everything
must i was targeted
so it must have been like wow they've
really got us this time
yeah yeah they do have um it's not just
one person presses the button and then
the missile goes they have a few
safeguards
so at any time in america they have 90
what are called missileers
who are sitting on alert somewhere in
the desert wow they're all
underground kind of in these silo places
and um they work in teams of two and
they
each sit together in um like on the wall
it says
a no loan zone as in you're not allowed
to be alone because if you're on your
own you might accidentally start world
war three
without someone telling you not to yeah
and you set two of you in a room
and there's an a side and a b side and
you each have a code which you're
supposed to put in
and if your codes match then um that
sets off the bomb
but also i think five of the people in
the whole
thing need to do at the same time in
order for them to go off
uh and there's 90 of them and in the u.s
military it's mostly
men who are obviously in the in the
military
um but in that particular one there's a
disproportionately high number of women
in that role
and the us air force um did a big sort
of press release in march 2016 because
they had the first time that it was an
all-female alert so all 90 people who
were
like in charge of whether america sends
missiles to its enemies were women and
that was the first time
all 90 yeah wow so they have it all
together they have a team of quite a few
hundred
um and so normally it would be a mix but
on this particular occasion they had the
first ever
all-female team yes obviously you
wouldn't want nuclear war to happen ever
but it does happen then it would be a
nice win for equality
some naysayers would say that if the one
time
when we actually started a nuclear war
was the first time it was all women
working
that's a very good point it would i
think it would set back the cause of
women
working in missile silos across the
world
well fortunately there would be no
humans around to uh have that problem
if there would be some man that was some
man would pop up saying uh
if you remember we did try this yes some
male cockroach
there's that really sweet story which i
think is quite famous i didn't actually
know it so i
feel like i should mention it but before
norad was called norad it was called
konad
and konad was the continental air
defense command
and one day the air force colonel
harry shoop sitting in his office and he
gets a phone call which is on a line
which basically suggests that the
russians are attacking if this phone
rings the russians are attacking
and at the end of the line which he
grabs it up nervously expecting the
worst he hears a tiny little voice which
says
is this santa claus and he thinks what
what the hell's going on here
and he barks into the phone back at them
saying what's going on and
the voice is crying he's going is this
one of santa's elves and
what had happened was there was a huge
mistake there was
an advert that was placed in sears
catalogue the sears advert
which gave out the number to call santa
claus but they'd put the wrong number in
there and the number they ended up
giving was this classified
line that was dedicated to a russian
missile attack and
it'd be so funny it's extraordinary that
that happens
what were the chances it's not just a
random person in america
yeah and what's wonderful about it
though is that they decided to embrace
it
and that is a thing now that you can
call norad
and ask them to track where santa is oh
i see in the period
so you're gonna say you can ask them to
drop a bomb anywhere you like
before christmas that's what you want
have you been good yes

is brought to you by babel
yep that's right babel is the language
learning app and

all right on with the show on the booker
[Music]
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that
is james my fact this week is that
fashion historian hillary davidson has
invented the bill and ted test
which judges the historical accuracy of
movie costumes
by comparing them against the
surprisingly accurate movie
bill and ted's excellent adventure
so i did wonder why everyone in pride
and prejudice is wearing backwards caps
well this is really interesting because
um this historian
um hillary davidson she was actually
writing a book
about dress in the age of jane austen
and when she was writing it there's a
lot of quite boring bits that you have
to do of copy editing and indexing and
stuff like that
and when she was doing her copy editing
of the index as it happens
um she was watching movies at the same
time because it's just such a boring
tedious job
uh and so she was watching bill and ted
and she got to the bit where they
kidnapped beethoven
and they she kind of looked at the
extras and thought
wow they are actually really good they
look
just like they're supposed to look and
so she thought well that's it i'm a
fashion historian i need a benchmark
i need to decide what's good and what's
bad so this is my benchmark
if you're making a proper regency
production and you can't get it as good
as bill and ted
then there's something wrong and so now
on twitter she has
at bill and ted test um where whenever
she sees a new movie she rates it
against
bill and ted and sees whether it passes
or fails are there films which
uh you know have failed the bill and ted
test oh i didn't write them down
um i'm starving i can't remember
that was but basically she
she says there's a few things you need
to look for the fabric for instance so
if they're wearing something that's
obviously polyester or something like
that
um then it just looks wrong and you can
tell but the other thing is the hair
so if your hair is um down and you're
an adult woman then unless you are
unmarried and a virgin or you're a
prostitute or you're mad
then you would not have your hair down
as a woman in that kind of period that's
a big risk in a singles bar isn't it
i mean i think she's unmarried and a
virgin
but it's possible she's a mad prostitute
yeah and she wants to she does say in
this interview in slate she
she's stressing that she's not saying
everyone has to be completely
historically accurate for everything
um but sometimes it can if you're a
expert it can put you off a little bit
by seeing you know someone wearing a
like you say a baseball cap in the
middle of
pride and prejudice yeah it might be
worth saying for the one person who is
not totally familiar with bill and ted
that the reason that
it's a good benchmark is because they
travel in time right a lot of good
points yes
um yeah lots of different time periods
where they're wearing
the clothes of that period is that right
they're not wearing the clothes of that
period they stay in their own mufti
throughout but they go and visit people
like beethoven and socrates and
napoleon yeah they must really stand out
yeah
they do that's kind of where some of the
comedy comes in yeah
i mean it is one of the greatest movies
ever made in my opinion and it's one of
the
probably half a dozen films before 2010
that i've actually seen
i think that might be why you think it's
one of the greatest movies i've ever
made
with the overall number of movies made
it's but they do spend a portion of the
movie
in the future is that why you've allowed
that to be part of the movies you can
watch james
yes exactly i love that we have to thank
for giving us bill and ted the thriller
post-apocalyptic author richard matheson
uh so if you don't know richard matheson
he is the author of i am legend he is an
author who stephen king said is the
greatest influence
that stephen king has had by another
author that is richard matheson he's
he's the master and i'm sorry and if you
don't know what i am legend is it's
basically
2020 in a book
it's basically a worldwide apocalypse
due to disease
isn't it yeah yeah exactly it's exactly
that and so
uh richard matheson happens to be the
father of chris matheson who is the
co-writer and co-creator along with
his partner solomon of bill and ted and
bill and ted was meant to be just a
throwaway sketch they had this idea
they were going to play the characters
live on stage and they happened to just
mention it
to richard matheson saying this is the
idea that we have for this sketch and he
said i actually think there's a whole
movie in this
and they thought oh god okay that's
interesting never thought to do that
and they wrote up the movie and that's
why we have the most excellent and box
adventures
wasn't it wasn't it almost the most
excellent in burgers adventures um or
the most excellent adventures of bill
ted and bob
because initially in their improv group
and the whole it was like constant
improvise wasn't it and uh there were
three of them but the character who was
playing bob
sort of lost interest in the whole
concept and disappeared and so it ended
up just being
the two of them but it sounds like they
were committed to the bill and ted
conceit
for years before it materialized into a
film they sort of
used to like always like keep the
emperor of going they would write
letters to each other in the characters
of bill and ted
i don't know if that was a standard
improv behavior andy it's not
okay i'm not constantly writing regency
themed letters to my buddies in the
group
that's a shame a lot of the things with
bill and ted how it's come
into um the culture is obviously through
its language right so
um anna if you haven't seen it they
speak in this real kind of surfer-ish
slang of saying like
bodacious and triumphant and stuff like
that
um and i looked in the oxford english
dictionary and they're referenced about
a dozen times
uh in the oxford english dictionary so
they're referenced for
um the phrase yes way as in the opposite
of no way
yes way they're referenced in dude
in the entry for dude and also in the
entry for second base
and they're not first citations they're
just kind of examples but they are the
first citation of party on
so we don't know anyone else who said
party on before villain ted did
and they're the first citation outside
of dictionaries of the word dickweed
um so it's it was mentioned outside
dictionaries did yeah
so sometimes did a lexicographer invent
the word dickweed
sneak it in hope it would take off and
then
sometimes the oed takes like words from
slang dictionaries and puts it into the
oed but they didn't have the citation
from there
but they do have the citation from bill
and ted which is the first one where um
bill says
you killed ted you medieval dickweed
so bill and ted is back in the cinemas
uh right now
as we speak face the music the third and
i thought there'd been this ginormous
gap between the last movie and now
that's all the bill and ted that we have
but it turns out
underneath there's been so much there
was an animated series which had keanu
and alex winter and george carlin
voicing it can i just say that was one
of the best cartoons i used to love
it as a kid i used to love that so much
that know it existed that's the
only version of villain ted that i've
seen has occasionally worked really
yeah wow it had an amazing theme tune as
well you got to find the theme tune
did you see the live series then there
was an action series live action series
and they cast people who when you look
at the pictures look exactly like the
guys
but they also went into theater there
was bill and ted's excellent halloween
adventure and musical adventure
there were board games there was the
excellent board game and riff in time
riff riff in time um and then there was
a whole comic book series that has been
run for years which were written and
drawn by a guy called evan
dorkan really yeah nice
and i basically just said all of that so
that i could say the word evan
i was thinking these are standard brand
extensions i don't know where dan's
i did find one fact about the comic book
which is that because they use a time
travelling phone booth which people
might think is a bit
a bit of a rip-off from doctor who they
use the comic book to explain that
actually
due to the way time travel works doctor
who ripped off bill and ted
despite having started in 1960 something
that's a brilliant way to get around the
patents problem we had earlier on in the
episode absolutely yeah
but doctor who is also a time traveller
and i would say i'm more a depth time
traveler than bill and ted though i
haven't seen it but he is very good at
it so i would imagine he can always have
claimed to have gone back he's been to
the beginning of the universe
yes you know one place that doctor who's
never been because he's an alien shadow
nerve to pap
yes i want to see the episode of doctor
who where he lands in shattered after
pap and gets immediately arrested
i read such an endearing interview with
um
keanu reeves which actually just came
out recently but was an interview that
he did in 1987 which is when they were
making bill and ted but i think no one
knew who he was then
and then the film got delayed so the
interview was never released at the time
and uh it was for the rap and he
admitted that he wasn't a good actor in
fact
in it he said uh so i think the
interviewer who steve
steve pond asked him how long have you
been acting and keanu reeve said
i don't really know if i'm acting now
i'm pretty bad
i mean i hate acting most of the time i
do it's a god-awful job
just on old awesome movies um
this isn't to do with bill and ted um
but our friend
are you just using the word awesome as a
connective link here
it kind of is but you'll see where i'm
going because they're kind of the same
um in the same genre-ish so um our
friend
justin gainer sent me an article which
i'd missed from the guardian which a few
people have seen about cool runnings
then you have to see this article it's
absolutely brilliant it was an interview
with
a few people including john turtle tab
who was the director
and he gave some bits of trivia about
cool runnings which are amazing so
it was translated around the world and
in norway it was translated as cold
buttocks
[Music]
and he said that after school runnings
he got sent lots of similar kind of
screenplays about sports
uh and they were all kind of almost
identical
and he said it got so bad that at one
point i received a script called amanda
without reading a word i picked up the
phone and said to my agent what kind of
animal is it and what's wrong with the
[Music]
kid
was a long pause before the reply came
it's a horse
and a brain tumor
[Music]
okay that's it that's all of our facts
thank you so much for listening if you

[Music]

[Music]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
is dan schreiber i am sitting here with
andrew hunter murray
james harkin and anna tashinsky and once
again we have gathered around the
microphones with our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order
here we go starting with fact number one
and that's anna my fact this week is
that in
india you automatically get a government
job
if you qualify for the olympics and if
you win a medal
you get a promotion wow
does the size of the promotion depend on
the size of the medal
the size of the metal the material from
which the metal metal is made
um yeah you don't get sort of giant gold
medals do you um
it does yeah essentially i i think the
level of promotion depends on how well
you do generally and it's not just at
the olympics it's in various other
sporting competitions
so this is a system which seems to exist
state to state they have various
different policies from one state to the
next and
it seems to also exist at a federal
level and
the truth is that to train to qualify
for the olympics is basically a
full-time
job and a lot of people can't afford to
take time out of work like where do you
find the money to support that
the athletes diet can be very expensive
and so the way the indian government and
state governments
encourage their citizens to you know get
get sporty
is to give them government jobs which is
like monthly salary
you can't be fired you get medical care
you get a pension
but they do actually have to turn up to
work so this is
yeah if you are the government jobs you
get related to the sport that you do
so if you're a really good high jumper
do they sometimes give you a job like
turning on
light switches on very big walls oh yeah
those really high light switches that
are purposely
behind today i guess the reason they put
them there in the first place is because
they were installed by high jumpers
exactly yeah it's a vicious circle it's
the whole thing is i mean is it like
that
it's not though is it no it is the
answer it's exactly like that yeah it's
a very good question they almost don't
work for the railways don't they or a
lot of them yeah
police force as well the biggest
employers are the railway the police
force the army
um but various government departments so
there's an
air rifle world record holder called
summa shiro
and she got a job on the railway for
instance and she had to turn up to work
sort of not i don't think every day but
quite regularly and just did data entry
and literally sitting at a computer
doing data entry in order to claim her
government salary
what did she do from a digital from a
computer which was 10 meters away from
her
because she's so good at air rifle well
she was shooting it like she has to
shoot each key
there was an old game called duck hunts
which came out before any of you guys
were born which probably would be quite
useful for that
exactly yeah that's okay that's how she
trained i think i'd stretch this beyond
the point
but it seems like in some cases that um
the athletes the other way around
they became athletes and tried to get
into competitions just to secure a
lifetime government job
wow so because you get as anna said the
pensions you get medical you get
lifetime job basically but that would be
easier to just get the job than become
an elite athlete considering how
difficult it is to become a
you know you have to get to the olympics
that's pretty hard it must be easier
some people are very bad at data entry
james and but naturally quite
fit and it's amazing how badly india
does at the olympics relative to the
population size
so they've won 28 medals total at the
olympics
uh which is the same as michael phelps
has won
wow now it's obviously michael phelps is
very very good at the olympics but india
has roughly a billion people
and in 2008 they won one medal per
383 million of their population
so that's a it's a low hit rate
basically
that's what people say isn't it like
it's not really fair the olympics
because
you know you might say well it's not
fair that you know some countries
uh in the eastern bloc might have used
drugs or whatever but also it's not
really fair that the rich countries just
get
to do way better because we have way
better diets we have better
um facilities we have better everything
in the western world so
yeah it's pretty hard to be just a lowly
born
indian person and get into the olympics
and that's a huge
amount of the population are basically
excluded yeah because of
for financial reasons from even ever
having this as an option in their life
so it's not really a billion people who
are
you know in the pool to be selected but
they do there's a stat that i read in
an article talking about this where they
said that there's more than 100
billionaires
in india that's a lot of that's a lot of
billionaires which mean there must be a
lot of millionaires which must mean
there must be a middle class that
is good at sport and have the facilities
and have the training that's true
they just don't do it for some reason
well there's a saying
there's a popular hindi saying and this
is the translation of it it's if you
study hard you will live like a king but
if you play sports you will ruin your
life
so it might be a cultural thing as well
i think there's there's a bit of a
disadvantage as well to the people who
have grown up wanting to work and get
high up in the railway
services you know imagine you're like i
want to kick ass and be at the height of
this job
and then you've suddenly got this
olympian who's won a silver medal
getting promoted over you
because yeah that's part of the like
there's a guy called sandeep sejwal who
he competed in breaststroke at the 2008
beijing olympics
and he's never been to the office
because he's always training but he's
got this full-time job
and he says if you swim continuously and
win a medal at the nationals
or just represent the indian railways at
the national level you can get promoted
so i'm going to file for a promotion
hopefully i get it and then i'll be the
boss
he might be the boss of
some guy who's worked his whole life to
get up the railway it's it's mad the
system's crazy
i think we'll know when the indian
entire indian railway infrastructure
falls apart
it's because of this breaststroke
professionalism who's
risen to the top and ruined it yeah but
it's good for the state departments
because what they get in return is pr
right so it's sort of seen as them
representing the police or the army or
the railways when they go and compete
yeah that's what they get in return also
the indian railway competes in national
championships of things
so like you might have american colleges
competing
or at least like on a semi-professional
level they play but the indian railway
has like
teams that are in all of these different
spots so it does
give them you know like anna says a lot
of good pr
um have you guys heard of abinav bindra
no
he's great he is an air rifle
champ india's actually really good at
the air rifle for some reason that you
know countries just have a thing that
they're really good at
so when he won his training was amazing
for it so he ordered
10 000 um specially chinese-made air
rifle pellets right
and he weighed every single one of them
on the super sensitive scale and he
looked at each one under a magnifying
glass
and if there was any irregularity in it
it went in the bin
wow you see that's where the admin
skills come in isn't it
right that's data entry and you've got a
spreadsheet with 10 000
pellets in it
is india's only gold medalist isn't he
he's the only individual to win
an individual right yeah so they won
basically
india's won a a very large number of
gold medals in hockey
to be fair to them uh they did really
dominate 1920 to 1980 they won
11 medals in 12 olympics in hockey and
eight of them were gold
and the highlight was 1948 then this
really must have felt good
1948 so immediately after independence
for india
when the final or the silver gold you
know
showdown however the olympics works it
was against britain and they beat
britain four nil
that must have been fun well they had
that golden period um
where they were winning golds it was
1928 1932 1936
they they won the golds and they had
this one amazing guy called richard
allen
who was the goalkeeper for the team and
in that time in those three olympics he
only conceded
three goals one of them was in 1932
when they were playing in la they beat
america
they beat the usa 24-1
and the only reason they scored the goal
was because richard allen
was off field signing autographs for
fads no
he just sort of went off the side yeah
and that's the only time that they got a
goal
i would say that's bad goalkeeping
that's amazing
at the 1948 one the hockey team when
they won would have got their gold
medals
but no ribbons because this was the
austerity olympics so this was held in
britain
and was you know rationing was still
happening everyone was bit poor there
was that whole war thing that just
happened
and so was the austerity olympics medals
were given without ribbons
i can't believe that they made the
saving on the ribbon i can't believe
they looked at the big gold medal at
ribbon
but you you can't just give people a
ribbon
no so this rule in india um they've
changed it slightly
this year so there's more sports that
you can do
which will allow you to get your
government job so
if you are in the tug of war you can get
it now
if you play roll ball or if you play
malaca
so those are the three main new sports
that have come in
um two of them are traditional well two
of them are indian sports roll ball
isn't traditional indian that was
invented quite recently and that's kind
of
it's like basketball on roller skates uh
and malacana
is a traditional indian sport and there
was a malacanang team
who have already got olympic medals so
malacanam
is a sport where you get a big huge pole
and you have to balance on top of it
while doing yoga moves
okay so this is a really awesome spot in
india
and in 1936 there was a malacana group
who went to
germany and they showed off their skills
and adolf hitler was so impressed that
he gave them all olympic medals
wow wow i've read a tiny bit about
malacanang
is it true that the pole in malacanang
represents the phallus
of hanuman the hindu monkey god and did
hitler know that when he gave out
think probably yeah i do know you have
to lubricate it before you get on it
so that you do so you don't get any um
any wood burns
um wow that's fast but a lubricated
pole would not be a very stable yes slip
wouldn't you
that's a sport then yeah right yeah
there's a difference
there's different levels of lubrications
i suppose you can have like
just covered in butter or you can have
it just slightly smooth so you don't
like get any splinters and i think it's
closer to the second one
is it are they doing the yoga moves on
top of the pot
yeah they're kind of balancing so
imagine a yoga move where you're on one
foot
and then your other foot is kind of
wrapped around your head or something
well you're doing that but your foot on
the ground isn't on the ground it's on
top of a massive pole
and is there on the top of the pole is
there a little platform you can squeeze
your foot on it
it's the end of a pole it's the end of a
pole but it's good
that's very difficult well that's that's
the least spot for you
that's yeah i i guess
i think it's probably easier to just do
the uh exam to get into the government
job but
yeah i'll stick to data entry it feels
like there's a time with the pole vault
that they should be able to do
as then you start doing the pole vault
but of the way on when you get right to
the top you just stay there
oh you're down with dogs yeah that
occasionally does happen with
with pole vault where they kind of get
to the top and they run out of momentum
and they
almost you it looks like they're just
going to stay there and then what
happens is the weight of the person kind
of bends the pole down and
they get sprung off like a cartoon that
does happen on occasions
they never get stuck at the top
eventually the olympics just goes home
somebody please
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hi everyone we'd like to let you know
that this week we are sponsored by
express
vpn and andrew do you know what a vpn is
i do but i'd like to hear from you
well just off the top of my head a vpn
or virtual private network
extends a private network across a
public network and enables users to send
and receive data
across shared or public networks as if
their computing devices were directly
connected to the private network
well i think that's cleared that up
that's exactly what it is basically uh a
vpn it gives you online privacy and
anonymity it creates a private network
and it has this has various effects it
means that for example
you can access streaming services in one
country that are only available
in that country even if you're not there
you can seem like you are
which is useful in lots of ways it's
good for privacy is good for keeping
your information secure
it's very useful indeed yes and like
andrew says
applications running across a vpn may
therefore benefit from functionality
security and management of the private
network
encryption is a common although not
inherent part of a vpn connection
james your relentlessly slangy language
is not helping anyone let's try and
stick to the facts can we
um if you do want to use expressvpn you
can go to expressvpn.com
and if you do that you'll get an extra
three months free on a one year package
that's absolutely right so if you want
to keep your information secure
if you want to access material from
other regions that's normally blocked
then go to expressvpn.com fish
and get an extra three months free on
your one year package
okay on with the podcast on with the
show
[Music]
okay it's time for fact number two and
that is my fact
my fact this week is that the photo of
the wright brothers first flight
was taken by a man who had never used
the camera before
so we're lucky it's not just a picture
of someone's feet
lucky he didn't have it on selfie mode
or something
his first ever photo his first ever
photo i read
he'd never seen a camera before yeah it
was nothing
exactly like every imagine the day for
that guy
he's seeing a camera he's seeing a photo
a plane's flying
this this is magic yeah so this is a guy
called john t
daniels and he was working at the
life-saving station
at kill devils hill which is where the
first flight took place on december 17th
1903 and he was positioned with the
camera
by the by the wright brothers who were
obsessed with cameras they told him
everything he needed to do
and there's there's really a lot of risk
when you think about it as well because
they needed to position the camera at a
place where they believed the plane was
going to take off having never
took off before on a plane they needed
to tell him the exact moment
for him to press this button that would
allow them to capture the perfect shot
and they were giving it to a man who as
we said not only has not seen a camera
before but was about to witness flight
man powered flight and so there was a
genuine moment where he almost forgot to
press it because he was so in awe
of the historical thing that he was
seeing and at the last second kind of
shook himself in
and took the photo and by some
insane magic we have the perfect shot it
developed perfectly it caught it
perfectly in flight
and it's it's an amazing photo it's a
cool thing to reflect
actually when you look at that picture
which i guess people have probably seen
before to think how unlikely that was so
that was actually going to work i mean
how did they pick the exact spot
because you can't swivel it round can
you no exactly i don't think they had a
turn
if they even if they did the guy
wouldn't have known what to do yeah
and from the account of it he was also
that day involved in the first ever
plane crash
yes so because after they landed it
after their flight it it blew away
because it was
really light it was basically a glider
with a little bit of an engine and he
got tangled up in it he tried to grab it
as it blew away like just tried to stop
it from
plug away and he got sort of caught up
in it and had to be
helped out and he was he was injured
yeah yeah when he flipped over he was
holding onto a strut
and all the others let go but he
desperately didn't want this thing to
break and so he flipped over with it
and he was a bit mangled but he was fine
but he they let him keep the strut that
he was holding on to which he kept
forever for the rest of his life and he
would carry it around with him and every
time he told this story this amazing
story of being the first
person to be in a plane crash he would
take out a pen knife
and he as he was telling it he would
shave off a little bit of the strut and
he would give it to the person he was
telling the story to yeah
you've got to limit the number of times
you tell that story towards the end of
your life
i'm really sorry i can't tell it today
i've just got a bit of sawdust left to
be honest
another piece of wood exactly it must be
like um the crucifixion
you know the the true cross yeah relics
there's there's a billion
wright brothers planes worth of strut
shavings out there now
um but you say so he thought he was
witnessing this incredible
historic moment which he did and i think
there were sort of four or five people
there who did think that
but i hadn't quite realized that the
rest of the world
a's thought it was nothing what happened
and b didn't believe it
so they were completely ignored by the
press for five years after 1903 that
first flight
newspapers and journalists just didn't
believe them they told newspapers
on the day that this is what they were
trying to do and they basically thought
these guys were crazy
crackpots it's such a slam to say not
only did nothing happen we don't even
believe that nothing happened i know
i know uh the quite nicely the only
paper that did report on them in that on
that first date was a paper called the
virginia pilot
by chance but um the way they got the
story
was the wright brothers once they'd
achieved flight they um telegraphed
their families to be like hey mom hey
dad we've flown
and so the telegraph operator said oh i
couldn't help but notice that message
you just left
your mum and dad do you mind if i tell
the press and they said no
don't want me to tell the press because
they wanted the press in ohio where they
were from to get the story first
and the telegraph operator ignored that
told the virginia pilot but virginia
pilot knew nothing about it so they
completely made up
what had happened and so they had them
flying for sort of three miles you know
i think we said before they only flew
for about 100 feet
120 feet they were like they flew for
three miles they were 60
foot in the air when actually they were
12 foot above the ground or something
um they said wilbur was flying the plane
when it was orville and so the first
account of the wright brothers flight
was
total fiction from the virginia lesson i
thought it was in a
bee magazine that they oh yeah it was
reported in
gleanings and bee culture so that i
think those are the later
yeah because they they kept flying i
don't know if you guys know that but
they actually did more flights after
their first ones
and um the i say quit while you're ahead
completely yeah yeah but this they were
doing these flights um
oh where exactly was it i can't remember
still it killed me in dayton now
okay yeah and this was in 1904 and 1905
when they were making flights
up to 40 minutes long and nobody paid
any attention it was amazing i mean it
doesn't
but this guy amos ives root he had
kind of heard about it and he saw them
flying
um because they were out in the sticks
they weren't near a major population
center
and he wrote a scientific american and
scientific american didn't reply
so he wrote it in gleanings in bee
culture um
along articles which are things like
beekeeping in the southwest and
midwinter flights of salad bees and it's
just mixed in with that yeah do you
think they got complaint letters from
bee
fans saying i couldn't really see what
relevance your article about the first
ever powered flight had
amazon's route was so cool so he owned
the first ever bicycle in ohio
that makes him cool
definitely yeah he was friends with them
wasn't he and he had
i think he just had his own kind of
comment
page in gleanings of bee culture where
he was allowed to write about whatever
he wanted
even if it wasn't about bees that's so
cool
um the first lot what was the hill
called dad it was called
kill devil killed so kill devil hill and
that was in kitty hawk wasn't it
that's where they where they did it and
the reason that they went there is
wilbert
well when you're flying you need like um
some wind coming straight towards you it
helps you to take off right
and he wanted to find out where the best
place in the us
to go for that was so he wrote to the
u.s weather bureau
who sent him data on the wind velocity
in more than 100 places around
america and he settled on this place
where he knew there was a hill he knew
that they had really good
steady wind always coming in their favor
uh and then he went to kitty hawk
because it was just like a bit of
nothing kind of marsh not marsh ground
but kind of wilderness ground there was
nothing there
um there was like 50 households they
were all descended from
sailors who'd been shipwrecked there
over the years so they were all like it
was like a sailing community
and the richest person that lived in
that town was a guy called doc
cogswell and he was the richest because
his brother owed him fifteen thousand
dollars
[Laughter]
that's the worst kind of wealth yeah i'm
broke but i mowed it
it sounds miserable when their
conditions when they were
living there because they had to dig for
water they had to catch their own fish
uh one of them said that there were so
many mosquitoes they almost darkened the
sun
whoa i know it just sounds like really
unpleasant living conditions but they
went out there for weeks and weeks on
end
yeah yeah and it's got such an ominous
name if i were trying to fly for the
first time ever
i would ask not to fly a place called
kill devil i don't want either of those
words in the place i'm attempting to fly
it's true and they um it was a
it was a thing wasn't it that people not
only didn't believe it but they didn't
think it was possible that we
could fly and there's a few you got some
famous quotes from
that period before they went up of
people saying uh this will never happen
there was one
bishop who was asked uh if he thought
that flying would ever happen
and he said what a nonsensical idea
flight is reserved for the birds and the
angels
um and that bishop was called bishop
wright and that was the father
of the wrath brothers really yeah
who absolutely thought there was no way
and and once they did it and
after the years of them doing it he
actually loved it he used to go up with
the brothers
um separately he had a rule they
couldn't fly together he didn't want to
lose them
both in a crash um but he would fly with
one of them and he'd go higher higher
get me higher i think he went up just
once didn't want it
the one day he allowed the brothers to
fly together uh in 1910
it was that day once you've done that
yeah it wasn't they didn't all go up in
the same plane though
no that would have been really all eggs
in one basket
you just got mum left not the bishop
they wouldn't have but it wouldn't have
been it wouldn't have been just one left
because there were two other wright
brothers
yeah yeah and that's the right sister
and yes they had more weird names the
brothers
the other brothers were called ruthlin
roichlen
[Music]
they just worked as bookkeepers and they
appear to have had no interest in flight
whereas the right sister is the reason
that we kind of
accept the wright brothers as the first
flyers today because
the uh smithsonian they thought that the
first person to fly was a guy called
samuel langley
which he did on in 1903 nine days before
the wright brothers
um but what he actually did was fly his
plane
for about maybe about half a meter
before it smashed straight into a
lake or something right um and but they
said they didn't believe that wright
brothers at all and so
they decided that this guy langley was
the first person but then
for years and years catherine wright who
was the sister it was her life's job
to try and make sure that people
believed that the wright brothers were
the first people to do it
and she was super famous in her day
wasn't she catherine right
yeah she it was pretty much the three of
them who were equally famous it seemed
because the wright brothers were
bad for with the press i think they were
not good media personalities
they were very shy whereas catherine
wright was very gregarious and so she
was like the front facing
right and so she like met the king of
spain and the prince of prussia and
spoke with him at events
she got the french legion donna which
they gave the wright brothers and
catherine at the same time the highest
order of merit you can get in france
and yeah she was great and she was the
first woman ever to attend the aero club
de france
because basically when they went to
france which was when they became
massive really because in america
they were kind of ignored especially
they tried to sell the plane to the
military and the military work just
weren't having it so they said it
we'll go to france instead
but the french they love kind of
aerospace they loved
the balloons they loved their new
gliders things like that and so when
they saw the wright brothers they
absolutely loved it
and catherine was the main face for that
like honestly that's cool
she had kind of a sad end so they were
incredibly close and they seemed to have
had a pact uh
wilbur orville and catherine that none
of them would ever marry
um i think we'd think that's what
happened and they made this pack very
very early on
and she stuck to it she was incredibly
close to orville so wilbur died in 1912
i think but awful long time
very close to him but eventually 1926
age 51
she decided she wanted to marry her
childhood sweetheart and
orville completely stopped speaking to
her that is mean just
that is very harsh
childhood sweetheart if you've waited
about 45 years to marry someone
it is harsh because they seem to have
had that pact where none of them will
marry
but for avalon wilbur it seemed to be
quite an easy thing to keep because
they were they weren't particularly good
with the press but they just weren't
good in social situations at all were
they whereas
like catherine she was just everywhere
she was so was it were there were the
two
brothers of just not sort of romantic
people at all and they've got this mega
babe sister but they keep saying
no no we made a pact when we were all
nine
nobody will ever get married the
brothers they lived together worked
together eight together and they even
shared the joint bank account of
wilbur really they so yeah that was kind
of easy and then catherine went on to
become
a suffragist didn't she uh yeah and
also the vicar went on the match with
her not the vicar what was he called
the bishop the bishop yeah the bishop
sorry and the bishop went on the march
with her
so um he kind of in his and that was
when he was in his 80s so he was kind of
like joining him with all of the kids
stuff when he got better
that's really fun it really embraces
kids hobbies what amazing 80s he must
have had just being a bishop your whole
life and then you get to kind of play
you got to go in march
that's really cool and that thing about
how they only became successful when
they got to paris
so in paris uh will i think wilbur was
the one who went to paris and all will
stayed
in the usa and wilbur was a bit more of
a showman he was um
he was better with the president over
really was quite reclusive and shy
wilbur was put up in the hotel maurice
have you heard of this place
no oh my god it's amazing i got in a
complete distraction
about this amazing hotel he was put up
in so it was
it's very very classy it still exists
today uh the lift was a copy of mary
antoinette's sedan chair
that's how sort of lush uh this hotel
was
everyone has stayed there awesome wells
rugged kipling picasso's wedding
meal was there salvador dali stayed for
one month every year
uh and he once ordered a flock of sheep
to be delivered to his room so he could
fire his pistol at them
right blanks it was blanks um
even and someone asked for that and told
me why they wanted it i think i wouldn't
do it
i'd at least call my manager and say i'm
not comfortable doing this
he might have asked he might have given
you the other task which was he asked
staff to go to the tuileries garden and
catch flies
for him for five francs per fly
you see i mean when i used to work when
i used to work in a hotel they
used to say to you you have to say yes
to everything
basically unless it's illegal or immoral
or whatever if they ask you for
something you always immediately have to
say yes i can do that
but it might cost a lot of money you
know you have to agree to everything
wow um and just hope dali doesn't check
in
you see the handlebars coming
[Laughter]
there's one other thing about this hotel
which is that is where the decision was
made
not to blow up paris so in the war
hitler um hitler really kind of went off
the deep end towards the end i would say
and
he as the retreat was being sounded he
ordered
lots of key bits of paris you know the
louvre eiffel tower the bridges over the
sun
he ordered them to be wired up with
explosives which they were
and general von choltez or
uh cultits was in the hotel
and it's there that he made the decision
he was either persuaded
we think there are various different
versions of events or he was trying to
save his own skin and
that's the hotel where he said actually
maybe there's a lot let's not blow up
the most beautiful city in europe let's
just
leave that is interesting and um but
there is one other thing about the hotel
maurice
um that you might be interested in andy
uh because we have mentioned it before
quite recently
and that is because they had 148
pneumatic clocks
in their hotel one in each room
oh they were attached to that air system
in paris
of course oh i'd forgotten that that's
so cool of course they did
i really hope that when darley did group
service he would save the crazy request
right to the end so the person would
think they were getting away with it
what could i get you mr daley oh it's
just eggs benedict this morning
um an orange juice please and
is that it one more thing
[Laughter]
seven thousand sheep
and a gun
[Music]
okay it's time for fact number three and
that is
james okay my fact this week is that on
the french island
of il de rey the donkeys wear trousers
it sounds like it's kind of a kid's book
doesn't it do they wear the trousers
what do you mean like do they wear the
trousers oh i see
i said are they in charge well i would
say with a donkey basically the donkey
always wears the trousers don't they
they don't do what you tell them to very
wise not really but um
these are these are originally working
donkeys
uh on this island they used to work in
the salt marshes
and in the salt marshes there are lots
of mosquitoes
maybe not enough to block out the sun
but there's definitely a lot of them
and so to stop their legs from getting
bitten these particular donkeys
their owners would put little kind of
trousers on and they look a bit like
you know really old-fashioned pajama
bottoms
um which they would tie around the
bottom part of their legs and their butt
is still exposed so it's like
like pajama bottoms with a with a flap
allowing your buttocks to kind of hang
out
and so these days they still wear the
trousers even though they don't work in
the salt marshes uh
but they just give rides to children
around the local park
which no matter what you think about um
donkeys giving children rides whether
that's
fair play or not uh definitely better
than working in the salt marshes
donkeys around the world they do seem to
have a very two-track career path either
it's
horrible back-breaking work and they get
really mistreated all over the world or
it's working at the seaside taking the
children out for a bit
yeah they are quite these ones are
amazingly big
aren't they yeah before you start
feeling too sorry for them having
children on their back i didn't realize
that donkey could even qualify as a
donkey at this size so they're um
border de poitu uh is what they're
called i think
they can be 16 hands which is that's
like a
big horse that's a horse that you feel
really high up when you're sitting on it
16 hands is a big horse i think i might
have met some of these donkeys
because they have them in the new forest
do they they yeah they do they have a
few of them in the new forest was it
really fluffy
like they're quite flat they've got long
shaggy hair like it was very shady
we met one right up close although it
wasn't 16 hand size maybe it was a
younger one
and presumably without the trousers on
it had no trousers on
not by the time no
don't go there
um that's really cool because they're
very rare you've seen a
you've seen an endangered species there
i may have just seen a normal donkey i
already regret you may have seen a sheep
it's possible
but um they're they're less rather they
used to be aren't they
um they went really really rare in the
70s and 80s
um so much so that there were only you
know a dozen or so of them left
uh that could reproduce um but now
they're thanks to
some kind of bits of conservation
there's a lot more of them in france
and they're starting to send them to
other places like the new foreign state
[Laughter]
i think there's about about a thousand
isn't there maybe just under a thousand
in the world and you should look them up
they do look bizarre they look a bit
like
um you know if you have an old english
sheepdog they're really shaggy dogs but
they've got quite a irresponsible owner
who doesn't look after their coat and it
really dreadlocks
it's like that isn't it they've got long
dreadlocks
yeah exactly okay what would you replace
a donkey with on a beach
if you had to i reckon like for one
maybe seven
ducks and they have like a little
carriage underneath them that the child
can sit at
and then fly around you know i'm
thinking right brother z kind of
flight is the future i mean that is nice
that's i'd go to that beach
it's dangerous it's never going to pass
sorry
in 2016 torbay council replaced their
donkeys with three small trampolines and
there was outrage
because it wasn't as much fun they said
this is just not as good for children
all for the donkeys
the donkey keepers were furious well
they don't do the kids have to haul the
trampolines along the beach then
if you want to ride along the beach the
trampoline's not going to cut it yeah
you could jump from one to the other but
i think if there are only three three
small trampolines it's quite a short
ride
it's a quick ride yes it's not getting
far in iceland when i went to iceland
every small town has like a massive
trampoline in the middle of it
it's so weird yeah it's like you know
how
in most in like towns you might have a
park that kids play on with swings and
slides and stuff
in iceland they just had these massive
kind of plastic
kind of tarpaulin things um that
appeared to be filled with air i don't
know what they were filming because i
never jumped on them much to my shame
but they were like yeah just everywhere
you went it seemed like kids could play
on these bouncy things like bouncy
castles
so bouncy castle right off james is it
true i think i've read that they were
initially for defense as in
you'd have to have someone guarding
constantly jumping up and down looking
out for
an invading army
yeah i was you know what at the start of
that sentence i genuinely thought that
you were about to say something
realistic
i saw you going along with it
so donkeys eh donkeys donkeys are cool
the word donkey used to rhyme with
monkey
donkey thank you used to be donkey yeah
and um it didn't really exist until the
start of the 17th century you would
always say ass
or arse instead of donkey um so in
shakespeare there won't be any donkeys
they'll all be asses
and in the kings bible was it because
that was it was also rude and an insult
that they kind of botherized it there is
one thought that that's it um
it the word probably comes from done
meaning brown or gray
um but it i think that's why that the
word donkey became more
commonly known is because of the
association with bums
like rooster because in america they
didn't want to say so they said
rooster instead
or man chicken man chicken sounds more
rude actually
yeah so the the donkeys
dog is in the uk um they are
they are big on the beaches obviously
there are still lots of donkey rides um
so you know the donkey sanctuary that's
the one of the major donkey charities in
the uk
um and they have i'm gonna say secret
agents
um who travel around the uk checking up
on donkey abuse
and um making sure that they're not
being badly treated or that
you know their backs are being strained
at the beach and they can turn up and
they can i think they have the power of
they know the power of arrest but they
do have the power to take your donkeys
away
so is that if you're doing donkey rides
on the beach and someone who looks
suspiciously like an adult but is
dressing up as a child
and claiming they want a donkey ride
turns up but how sort of a notepad
they're trying to hide
that's probably your guy yeah they go
undercover they're like i think they do
go undercover because
if they phone ahead and say i'm ringing
from the donkey police then
you'll just get out the nice donkey
whereas if you if they turn up incognito
they see you've got your ratty old
donkey and you're beating it then um
bella davey
yeah wow good doing great work
it might be quite fun to be a donkey in
uh in the u.s
if you're specifically if you're pack
borough racing in
colorado which is a sort of ancient
historic colorado sport and it's
it's in honor of miners who used to go
gold mining with donkeys
and the rule with pac-berry racing is
that a donkey can't carry a person
but a person can carry a donkey it needs
to be
in it and you basically have to run
along with your donkey
uh right okay is it one one man one
donkey one man on donkey okay
how often does anyone actually carry the
donkey though because
they're pretty heavy they're heavy i i
did
i was reading one person's account of
his pap bro race where he should have
carried the donkey and didn't so i think
they must be too heavy this is a guy
called
curtis emery who's a veteran borough
racer and he was near
really near the end of a 15-mile race
and suddenly his donkey called jackson
uh had to cross a wooden bridge and as
donkeys i want to do he'd cross the
bridge countless times before
suddenly stopped for like not doing that
that's stubborn and
he and right at the end of the race and
he had to tie jackson to the bridge
walk into town and return with a
winch-equipped jeep
to pull the donkey over the bridge at
which point i don't think he'd won the
race anymore that's
amazing but yeah they do they do freeze
donkeys that's the weird thing about
them i hadn't probably realized that's
what they're doing
like horses if you scare them bolt a
donkey
goes stock still turns to stone yeah
right
well this is why people think that they
are stubborn
and this is uh some some study done by
the donkey sanctuary
in the uk which is about people's
perception of the donkey um
which incidentally found that britain's
second favorite farm animal
pretty good oh can we guess the favorite
after
gotta be cow gotta be sheep
no no one's no one said the right answer
yet uh chicken
horse man chicken no anna's got it right
it's a horse
everyone loves a horse anyway i'm sorry
that's good
how does it come into the top two yeah
no one likes cows
oh my god a minute donkey is number two
yeah because i think if you are a kid
and you have like uh
a set of all your familiar animals very
rare is there a donkey in there is it or
certainly cows and sheep come in first
are you guys suggesting that this
study conducted on behalf of the
dominant sanctuary is in
any way improperly done no
but basically people you know i just
want to carry on talking about this
what they've done is they thought right
we need to make it seem like it's the
best animal
but no one's going to believe us if we
say that the donkey is the most popular
five yard animal so we're gonna have to
put it in second place
that's what they thought isn't it it's
like when you know um kim jong-un gets
97.9 percent of the election it's like
right
no one will believe 100 so i have to go
down a bit
yeah but 55 of people do think they're
stubborn and the
donkey sanctuary explained that they're
not stubborn they
they're just freezing yeah one in three
people think they're affectionate and
only 18
of people think they are charismatic yet
they rank number two
this doesn't add up

all right on with the show on with the
show
[Music]
okay it's time for our final fact of the
show and that is
andy my fact is that in the late 1960s
the cia
considered assassinating people using
lightning
wow is that you bringing back your old
nickname and
admitting that you were part of the cia
i'm very glad that you've mentioned my
old nickname being lightning because i'm
determined that it's going to make a
comeback
so this is something there's a great
article
on forbes about this a journalist called
david hambling i found it
and it was a proposal in 1967 that was
made seriously
um but it wasn't carried out um but the
idea was developed
uh they thought well lightning lightning
is pretty powerful isn't it
and if there was a way of directing
lightning um
then you could get it they used a real
euphemism they said
it would produce effects favorable to
our purposes
i don't think you you don't have to read
too much between the lines to realize
that
[Laughter]
um and yeah the pla the plan was
basically to get a a very very thin wire
which would be only a fraction of a
millimeter wide but several miles long
to effectively drop this from an
aircraft or
um to use a kind of parachute to keep it
up there for a long time
and then if there was a storm happening
above the person you wanted to
assassinate
it didn't rely on that that was the flaw
in the planet the person had to be in a
lightning storm
but it wasn't also a flawed they had to
somehow get this wire next to them so
like you run over someone say
oh just hold this wire will you exactly
um so it was it those were the
disadvantages there were advantages
obviously
like cheap because you're you're not
being getting an electricity bill for
this
and also it would leave no evidence you
know yeah but you can always have
incredible advantages to something
impossible
that's true i think we should go ahead
with the impossible thing because the
advantages are just so good
yeah that was i mean the disadvantages
were big as well yeah
i think there's contextual evidence i
think that if fidel castro had suddenly
been struck by
lightning around that period it would
have been very suspicious
well if all the cia's enemies suddenly
got hit by lightning i think you can do
it
twice i had a good look at to see if all
that there's a list of wikipedia people
who are killed by lightning to see if
any of them were possibly enemies of
america at this time yeah
i couldn't find any i'm afraid few
sports people
one person from the american war who was
guy who invented the
phrase no uh taxation without
what's that one no taxes it was
he was killed you're not a true believer
in democracy really are you
what's the thing that we need for them
to taxes i don't really give a
uh yeah so no no unfortunately yeah
that's a shame was that so they those
were the most notable people
on the list there wasn't really anyone
there was a few people from the
you know from ancient times who were
killed by lightning not that many famous
people are killed by lightning it turns
out it feels like if the cia
had time travel and this thing yeah
they probably still wouldn't use it just
think of the advantages of time travel
though
like i know it's impossible but just
think of the advantages
let's just do it why aren't we doing it
i can see
uh you know anti-universal suffrage
campaigner
politician not liking the no taxation
without representation guy i think
there's the kernel of a conspiracy
theory there that he was assassinated
yeah i was aiming for a conspiracy
theory and i was aiming a bit higher
than this to be honest
i was hoping that an actual you know
dictator from the
from the soviet times had died but no
shame
they came up with some pretty wacky
plans didn't they yeah
um there was there's there was sort of a
massive
dump on all of us which you might
remember 2017.
we all got some strange that's a strange
weapon isn't it yeah
they just came up to me in the streets
and said hold this wire and then before
i do it i was covered in
in 2017 the cia sort of dumped 13
million pages of documents on us by
putting them online
and that was 800 000 declassified files
which useful journalists went cone
through
and found the insane plans they had like
i think
it came out that they interviewed yuri
geller that's one of my favorites in the
1970s
they uh took an interest in spoonbender
yuri geller
and according to him when he was asked
about it he said they were afraid that
there were people like him in russia
who i guess would pose a threat by
bending cutlery in the soviet union
somehow
and the way they tested geller to test
his skills was they shot him in a room
and then the cia taped uh to the wall
outside his room
a picture of something and the way they
chose the picture was they opened a
dictionary they got a word
so they chose the word for instance
bunch and then they drew
what first came to their mind a bunch
and then they asked yuri on the other
side of the wall to draw what he sensed
the picture was
is that a bunch of grapes well exactly
he drew
24 purple grapes to be fair there were
24 so that's kind of impressive
but basically the cia's conclusion was
he has demonstrated his paranormal
perceptual ability in a convincing and
unambiguous manner
which i would say he hadn't you hear
brothers you think grapes
but they didn't did they tell him the
word bunch yeah they said bunch
oh my god they said we've picked the
word bunch out of the dictionary
draw what you draw the first thing that
comes to mind but he did draw
24 grapes and they had 24 grapes in
their picture
yeah but i have to specify they did this
on him dozens of times
and he only got a few of them right and
that was one of them i would have drawn
some flowers
yeah yeah bunch of flowers i
deliberately went with grapes thinking
it was the wrong answer as well because
i was thinking it would be flowers
james you are the new yuri gala what
what's more
impressive is if you say that you've
picked the word giraffe
and it's actually a dump truck and he
draws a dump truck that's
you know yeah that's true that's when
you know you've got someone dangerous
the most impressive thing that yuri
gellar did and the most controversial
actually was in euro 96 he was flying
over
wembley stadium in a helicopter i think
and gary mcallister was taking a penalty
for scotland which would have
put them level with england in the game
and if you watch the video back
the ball moves about one inch just
before he kicks the ball
and he misses the penalty and then gaza
goes up the other end and scores
and yuri gellar claims that he made that
ball move
no but he doesn't claim it was the
downdraft of the helicopter
because it was his magic powers but i
thought you're going to say he dropped a
bent spoon on his head
which is slightly concussive weirdly i
read a thing just this morning about
yuri geller which is that
in 1974 he was um a paternity suit was
filed against him by a young mom in
sweden
she didn't claim that he was the dad
what she claimed was is that his magical
bending powers had altered her
contraception coil
and it became inoperable and she got
pregnant as a result
and as a result he should pay for that
because he's the sort of pseudo father
well that's that's a really difficult
position to put him in because on the
one hand he really wants to admit to
having those powers
it was the same with the football thing
because he wants to claim that they
he moved this football but actually he
had 11 000
hate letters from scottish people after
the game
saying how could you scupper our chances
in the european championships
wow hey i read a really cool invention
by the cia
which was used it's called the sky hook
and the sky hook was basically a way of
extracting
cia operatives or anyone that was in
need of help who was involved in the
military in some way
from a location without having to get on
the ground
to pick them up so what it was is that
they would drop a package
over to where they believe the operative
was and the opera
the package had a little description on
it and in it
they had a helium balloon that would
lift the cable 500 foot
into the air and then the operative
would strap themselves to a harness that
was connected
to the other end of that cable that went
up with the balloon and they would sit
and wait until a very slow flying plane
would fly to where the hill the helium
balloon was
and it would hook its nose of the plane
around
the hook that had been sent up and it
would carry the guy off into the air and
back to safety
i mean if you timed it right you could
say just so you know all this time i've
been working
for the cia and then bang
if you get that even slightly wrong then
you're just immediately arrested
yeah or if a lightning storm comes over
and it attaches itself to the 500 foot
wire he told us he was working with the
cia and then he just exploded
really weird yeah i can see why they
didn't go with that
or sort of any of their math plans i'd i
wish someone one day had turned around
at the cia in
1950 just early on and said you know
these crazy ideas we keep having that
never come to fruition
you know the ones that always work
they're the ones where we just shoot
someone in the head
from now on there was a guy uh called
edward geary
lansdale and he was with the cia and he
was requested
by the president of the philippines to
come over there was a united states
military assistance group
to come up with ideas to fight the
communist hokbalahap
which was a regime that was threatening
the the philippines at the time
and he came up with this idea of
convincing them that there were vampires
out in the woods
and the way that he actually tried to
convince him that this was really
happening is they captured an enemy
soldier
and they drained the blood from his body
and left him making it look as if he was
trying to flee and got caught by one of
these vampires
so when they found him they believed the
myth was real
bizarre these were tricks who benefits
from who benefits from this
well i suppose if you've got an enemy
believing that there's something
paranormal going on as well as an enemy
who are
physically real that just keeps you on
edge it keeps you
psychologically all over the shop
because you remember that fact that you
and i both found dan about um
in japan they were gonna capture some
foxes
and then paint them in luminous paints
and then release them into the japanese
countryside so that people would see
these glowing foxes and think that they
were some mysterious kind of
um apparition yeah that's right they
they would believe and there was a thing
where one was connected to
some balloons the idea was that there's
a floating
score yeah like you just you just see
the balloons wouldn't you
not at night and you would just see the
illuminated
figure of floating fox and fox and again
is the idea that you sort of make them
all a bit edgy
because there are these scary foxes
around oh that everyone thinks it's a
pokemon and chase is after it
[Laughter]
[Music]
again there's just always you know
killjoy barry in the corner of the
meeting there going guys shall we just
shoot them in the head i'm really sorry
it's a great idea one cia agent maybe
the most surprising one
uh i found out about was the dalai lama
oh yeah yeah in the 1960s his group was
being given
over a million dollars a year by the cia
and they did deny that the dalai lama
was on a personal retainer of a hundred
and eighty thousand dollars a year
the his organization had denied that but
that's because uh the cia were paying
for
uh gerry geriatric operations against
china when china invaded tibet
and so the dalai lama was an important
part of that resistance so we don't know
what his kill total is
yeah that's a great series of novels to
be written
the secret cia adventures of the dalai
lama
but that's another one where barry never
gets what he wants because if you do
shoot the dalai lama in the head he just
comes back
that's so frustrating isn't it
it's just a pointless assassination he's
on your side you wouldn't shoot your own
agency
maybe if you're playing a double bluff
maybe it's the jason bourne but think of
it the dalai lama can get to anybody
there's no one can refuse a meeting with
the dalai lama on security grounds
no that's true yeah yeah true true a lot
of the people in the cia just massive
nerds right
they're kind of our people so like when
wikileaks um
exposed a lot of stuff that the cia was
doing in its hacking program
we managed to see a lot of what the
tools were called and what the programs
were called
and they're all named after memes or
references to pop culture there's one of
them named after a world of warcraft
trading card
and there's another one that's named
after some characters from talladega
nights which is the will ferrell movie
and there was another document where a
guy just listed a load of awesome tool
names he wanted to use at some stage
including awesome mctool name and
starving weasel
and the the second of those is a weird
al yankovic song
and they're just like we've got to
invent something so that we can give it
this really nerdy name
yes yeah somewhere there's a dangerous
sniper ci agent who's just heard james
call him a nerd
[Laughter]
what's that red dot that's just appeared
on my head
actually that's a myth isn't it about
the red dot because lasers go in a
straight line whereas bullets don't go
in a straight line so there's no point
having a red dot aiming at someone's
head
because it's pointing straight from the
gun you need to be aiming slightly above
the person's head if you're a sniper so
in the film it should be there's a red
dot slightly above you on the wall
exactly that's when you know you're in
danger and if there's a red dot on your
head you think oh phew i'm sorry no you
don't you think oh they're gonna
shoot me in the balls
[Laughter]
okay that's it that is all of our facts

[Music]
hello and welcome to a special halloween
edition of no such thing as a fish a
weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
is
[Music]
[Music]
[Laughter]
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with james harkin
anna toshinsky and andrew hunter murray
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in a particular order here we go
starting with fact number one and that
is anna my fact this week is that
in the 1930s the ghost of a swearing
mongoose
led the bbc to revise its working
conditions
this is quite a story uh so settle in
um right so there was this guy called
rex
lambert and he worked the bbc he was the
editor of the bbc magazine
the listener and he got interested in a
story
of a talking mongoose who lived at that
time
on the isle of man so he went to the
isle of man
investigated this talking mongoose and
wrote kind of kind of published a book
about it
anyway he had a rival a career rival
who sat on the board of the bfi with him
but she was also on
who decided to use this to bring him
down so accuse rex of being
a crazy crazy man because he believed in
this talking mongoose
and essentially rex sued this other guy
for slander
and he won and that whole case kind of
drew into sharp relief the fact that the
bbc wasn't treating its employees very
well because the bbc was a little bit
and lord wreath were a little bit like
yeah this rex guy you're right he does
sound like a bit of a loon
and so after that then the government
got involved and was like look bbc
you've got to start treating your staff
better
even if they do believe in talking
mongease and
sought your act out and they did it
changed their rules and policies
i feel a bit sorry for rex lambert
because whenever you look
him up on the internet all you can find
is one that he believed in talking
mongooses
two that he once said in his magazine
the listener
television won't matter in your lifetime
or mine
yeah that's the only two things he's
remembered for
but he did die two weeks after saying
that and he was speaking to the world's
oldest man at the time so actually
and the batteries had gone in that guy's
remote haven't they yeah
hey um we're being a bit rude here this
mongoose has a name anna
sorry yeah the mongoose has her name is
called jeff
jeff the talking mongoose spelled g-e-f
i've read that he also may not have
completely been a mongoose i mean for
one thing he was a ghost
so to ghost have a species and secondly
he was also described as a man weasel
which is even spookier really he kind of
sometimes claimed to be a mongoose he
sometimes claimed to be an
extra clever mongoose and then sometimes
he claimed to be
part of the fifth dimension and then
sometimes claimed to be the eighth
wonder of the world
so you know yeah he used to say i'm a
freak i have hands and i have feet and
if you saw me you'd faint you'd be
petrified mummified
turned into stone or a pillar of salt
that was kind of like his catchphrase
sounds like a rapper
yeah why are you talking like he was
eminem to be honest the bit whereas
you'd be petrified mummified it starts
sounds like it's going to end with
what might be grease lightning
yeah he had a bit of an identity crisis
jeff he he changed from one moment to
the next
we should probably mention that he we're
just going to talk about jeff presumably
rather than bbc working conditions
he was a mongoose who appeared first in
the isle of man in 1931 i think in the
house of a guy called james irving and
his family
and first he was described as a yellow
and brown
rat like animal with a long bushy tail
and he was a bit of a sensation he
became quite famous
throughout the country for a while did
he ever appear to anyone outside
the house of james irving some people
heard him certainly
yeah their good friend heard him sort of
talking
outside the porch although
coincidentally it happened that their
daughter vori
was known to be a skilled ventriloquist
and also was very good at impersonating
animals was she drinking a glass of
water at the time
that sets
brought back gossip about the neighbors
yeah yeah really he sometimes used to
live
underneath the floorboards of the bus
company so that he could listen to what
the bus drivers were saying oh wow
wait is this true are you guys just
making this so right basically all of
this is false right is this
this is kind of this is um this is a
ghost
that was claimed by this family and
became famous for a little while but we
are all four of us on the side of it not
existing seriously guys i go away for
one week you have rhys derby on when i
come back
all of you are paid out members of
spooky club
i mean his his story has holes in it
doesn't it he claims that he was born in
delhi
in 1852 so that he was 80 years at the
time when he first appeared
no no backstory of how he made it to the
isle of man
no big trip sort of revealed in
had brought in some mongooses from um
outside of the isle of man to kind of
chase after
vermin and jeff was one and jeff was one
of them yeah
jeff the classic delhi name
he spelled it himself you know when they
asked him what's your name they
originally called him jack
and they said okay what's your name and
he said oh it's jeff g-e-f
so he's he gave the name himself he did
although he wasn't very good at
speaking any indian language um
so they talked about him like he was a
great linguist he was fluent in english
and he did seem to pick up other
languages very quickly as well
but he only knew sort of i think he knew
the word hindu
and he knew of one or two other words
that everyone would have known at the
time
it's not enough to get by it's not
enough to get by in india he didn't know
how to say bottle of beer
for instance that was one that he really
struggled with
[Laughter]
when this was investigated more fully
the
the hairs of the ghost mongoose were
found out to be the hairs of a dog
and the imprints of jeff's paws had been
made with a stick
it turned out so yeah yeah but they did
this is how
sort of not seriously people were taking
it but how much it caught on in the news
i think it was just silly new season
because they sent them to the british
museum didn't they the british museum
analyzed the
the footprints well it's the 1930s
wasn't it yeah it feels like it was a
bit of a whole
silly season the 1930s apart from the
great depression and the
rise of fascism yeah apart from that
there was a
chance to have a bit of a breather after
the first world war
yeah when the um reporter from the daily
dispatch
went over to see this um supposed
mongoose
again didn't see it but heard it talking
apparently the mongoose gave him a tip
for the grand national
which is kind of good on another
occasion he
sang three verses of the monks national
anthem
then two verses of the spanish national
anthem followed by one verse of the
welsh national anthem
well they're all very well known in
india so that must be where he picked
those up
it's so weird in an attempt to inject a
bit of realism into it at one point
james irving said yeah he is very good
at languages
and he actually can speak in fluent
flemish
but he's not infallible because he
thinks it's german
so jeff spoke flemish but believing it
was german
so he this lambert guy who went over the
person he took over with him to
investigate was harry price
who is one of the great ghost hunters
of the the sort of that boom of ghost
hunting like hans holzer who
ghostbusters was based on
they were the first people who went to
all these locations wrote these big
books and
he had his um his ghost hunting kit with
him because there used to be goggles
that they would wear that they could
claim would help you to see spirits
arthur coden doyle
famously owned a pair as well he used to
go ghost hunting of course
every single time we talk about anything
dubious that anyone ever believes
we are the conan doors in there
somewhere he's just getting involved
something that's definitely not true
yeah i'll stick my own that's
great it's true but so he would have
cameras that the idea would be is the
camera would have trigger weights and a
trigger
thermograph on it so if the temperature
suddenly changed drastically
in a room it would trigger the camera to
take a photo and he used to have a
sort of matches with him and the matches
were not only to help him see
in the dark but they were also to entice
a ghost
to respond if the ghost used to be a
smoker so you'd pull out the matches
and think that maybe the ghost would be
like oh thank you a light yes please
oh just a cigarette suddenly appears
floating in the air yeah
floats towards your mat hey have you
guys heard of the ick
newman the wasp no it's
so there is the wasp but there's a
mythological mongoose
known as the ignemon and it used to
exist back in the day
so this is another sort of fabled
mongoose but it used to slay dragons
that was the
belief of wow yeah so this is not a
gigantic mongoose this was a regular
size
mongoose weasel there's debate about um
what this fake thing was
um so what it used to do is that it used
to cover itself in mud
and then it used to enter the nostrils
of
the dragon and then it would burrow out
through the dragon
and that's how it would kill how it
would slay the dragons okay
and in egypt the ichnamen was i think
seen as a real thing so there was a sort
of weasel
mongoosey type animal that used to chase
rats and so on
and you can read about it in history so
pliny the elder wrote about it
leonardo da vinci wrote about it and i
found in the 18th century an english
poet called christopher smart wrote
about it in his
poem called jubilate agno he mentions
the ichnamen
but the ignoman's killed by a cat
the name of that cat is jeff
well well that was done that was a long
way rounds to an extremely
dubious piece of coincidence wasn't it
this whole fact has been dubious
of course the thought that kind of stuff
doesn't come on that's amazing i think
that's a beautiful coincidence that
there have been two spoons it is not one
called jeff
and one the thing that called it was
called jeff that's yeah there's some
reincarnation happening
yeah called jeffrey of jeffrey jeffrey
yeah jeffrey
i've i've i've given him a nickname with
the jail with the g
with a j okay without but without an e
at the end so there's a lot of weird
anomalies going on in their names
j-e-o-f-f-r-y
that's a bit like joffrey who was in
game of thrones
and what do they have in game of thrones
but dragons mongooses
oh boy there's been a lot of thought in
history that mongooses
can kind of attack and kill other things
they go after
snakes for instance um and in real life
that does happen that mongooses and
snakes attack each other especially
cobras
and the mongooses are highly resistant
to cobra venom
and often if you put a mongoose in the
cobra against each other then the
mongoose will come out on top
so people use the mongoose as kind of
protection
against cobras and knowing this there's
a really popular
indian beer called cobra beer and
there was a rival who brought out a new
beer and they called it mongoose because
they wanted to beat
the um cobra and so whenever i have the
choice between a cobra beer or a
mongoose beer in an indian restaurant i
always choose the mongoose one because
that's the one that beats the cobra
and i think i'm the only person in the
world that that marketing has ever
worked on
hang on isn't there also a kingfisher
beer yes there is where does that fit
into the rock paper scissors world
of the cobra and the mongoose kingfish
is for james's wife who's sitting there
going look i'll just get a kingfisher
that my husband just gave you the royal
navy used to have
uh you know they used to have ships cats
ships to catch uh
catch rats and things um lots of ships
had ships mongooses
which were very effective at catching
rats and cockroaches
and that was a thing but what we've
learned from dan presumably is that you
don't want to have a ship's cut and
ships mongoose because the cat will just
eat the mongoose
got to be very careful there right did
we learn that well didn't wasn't it jeff
the cat who killed
the mongoose yes sorry it's all right
andy i
i drifted off halfway through that story
as well
this is there's going to be a quiz at
the end of this section for which facts
were fake and which facts were real it's
quite hard to keep
up but on on real mongooses still just
for a moment they are quite
vicious aren't they and they can kill
each other
and for that reason they all give birth
in synchrony
because if they didn't give birth on the
same day then their offspring would be
killed
so the only way you can stop other
mothers from killing your children
is if they don't know whose children are
whose and the only way you can guarantee
that is if all the children appear at
once that's so stressful so as a kid as
a mongoose kid you have to call ever on
mum
so they think that you're their child
that's useful if you're in school and
you accidentally call
your teacher mum like like some people
i've heard have done in the past
it was twice it was literally just twice
and you say no no i did it so that that
people didn't eat me
oh i wish i were a mongoose just one
more thing about mongoose specifically
their their anuses
are quite cool so they have anal glands
where they from which they plant their
scent and
one of their tricks is to do a handstand
scent and so
they'll they'll mark they're sent to
mark their territory or sometimes
they'll mark scent on a potential mate
to
warn off other mates to warn off rivals
and the handstand sent what they do is
what it sounds like they flip over
upside down onto their hands
so they can get their anus up as high as
possible and then mark their scent as
high up as possible
because that means that a rival can tell
that you're quite tall
so a rival will then smell your scent on
the person they want to mate with and be
like wow you've managed to reach her
head with your anus
you must be really tall i'm not gonna
get involved here
i don't know if and then if he
like walks past the tree and smells the
scent does he think
that this is a mongoose with an anus
where my head is and so he must be like
10 times bigger than me is that the idea
of it
it's like it's it's as if no other
mongoose knows about headstands
it's like one mongoose has worked this
out yeah and
i think i think they all know about
maybe they all know about headstands but
like the taller person is still going to
get it higher up on a headstand so if
you're short maybe you wouldn't do the
headstand thing because that's
going to advertise that you're sure is
it like giving your
um wife a basketball to carry around and
everyone who sees her will think oh she
must be going out with a really tall guy
it's exactly like that right but the
idea is that all of us give our partners
a basketball
the only advantages to the first person
who does it yeah so
james cut this bit out because i'm going
to start i'm going to start doing that
i'm going to get my wife to walk around
with a pole vault pole
and people will think wow she has to
pole vault just to kiss him in the
body
[Laughter]
i'm going to stick to the anus secretion
um i just have one more haunting thing
girlfriend there is a sweet shop in
great yarmouth which is explicitly
not haunted it's the seems to be the
only sweet shop in the uk which
goes out of his way to say this is not
haunted there are no ghosts here
wow is that a lady who does protest too
much kind of
it's owned by a man called nigel parrot
who
is a very devout christian and he
put the sign in this window a few years
ago saying to all my wonderful customers
this shop is definitely
not haunted even though the town ghost
walks appear to think it is but it gets
more interesting a sign because he goes
on
all demonic paraphernalia has been
destroyed
what was going on and then
he gets into the details he says jesus
christ died so we could be free from all
other spirits and negativity he is alive
today and his
is the only spirit in this place but so
apparently there is a spirit yeah he's
haunted by jesus
i know that's cool the bbc interviewed
him and he said this place might have
at some time in the past been haunted
but if jesus is alive and with me
then this shop is no longer haunted wow
did you see the bbc followed that up
with some research they looked into this
nigel character and it turns out he died
in 1673
[Laughter]

[Music]
okay it's time for fact number two and
that is
james my fact this week is that famous
occultist
alistair crowley used to make a curry so
hot that he only served it on glaciers
so the diners could use the snow to cool
their mouth down
afterwards wow
isn't that amazing yeah but i mean
this is not like he would invite you for
dinner and then you'd get a
location delivered to you which was in a
different land
like he was mountaineering wasn't he he
was mountaineering
he would make this curry they had no
kingfisher or
mongoose cobra to wash it down with and
it was so hot that people would run
outside and they would kind of stuff
snow into their mouths
uh and in his uh autobiography the
confessions of aleister crowley
he said that some people said he should
make it in london but he said he would
refuse to do it because there's no
glacier
or glacier there to um to help people
so um that's the thing it's a real
chicken or egg isn't it like did he go
to the glacier because he wanted to make
the curry or did he make the curry
because he found himself on this glacier
and we'll probably never know we'll
probably never know um probably it was
just he happens to be on a glacier he
happened to make some curry
and that's it but yeah he wasn't a
cultist but before he became an
occultist he was really a mountaineer
uh aleister crowley he was known as the
wickedest
man in the world by the uh british press
because of various things that he did um
at one stage he set up an
abbey in sicily and lots of crazy stuff
was happening there to do with
sex and pornography and drugs and all
that kind of stuff and he got kicked out
of um italy by mussolini and that made
the news
and people started calling him the
wickedest man in the world but he
he was basically kind of a devil
worshiper
satanist occultist kind of guy who yeah
was just famous for doing crazy stuff it
does feel like the
wickedest man in the world bar was much
lower
uh again pre-hitler uh it feels like he
sneaked in and got the nickname at a
time when the currency was a little bit
weaker you're right yeah
mind you if if mussolini's calling you a
bad guy then you do have that's true
yeah that's true yeah the signs were
there even in his mountaineering career
so he tried he attempted the second
highest mountain in the world and the
third highest didn't he i think and
failed at both
but he tried k2 in 1902 and then kanjin
junga in 1905
which is the third highest mountain in
the world and he went up there with a
group who
didn't get along with him after a while
and tried to depose him
as their group leader and then there was
a big fight
and a few of his co-walkers said they
were going to turn back
and go back down the mountain and so he
went to bed in his tent
and he heard them going back down the
mountain and they caused an avalanche
and there was lots of screaming and
shouting and cries for help and he heard
all of this
four of them were killed he just sat in
his tent and what he did was he sat in
his tent listening to the screams while
everyone else in this party went to help
them
and he wrote a letter to a local paper
about how he has no sympathy for people
who get involved in mountain accidents
because they should be more responsible
yeah and there was a thing about that
being because he was really wicked but
on the other hand
it kind of felt like he was just being
really stubborn in that case because
they'd had that argument and they said
right we're going back down he's like no
look there's going to be an avalanche i
can see there's going to be an avalanche
so whatever you do
maybe go down tomorrow like but just
don't go down now and they went down
and they got stuck in the avalanche and
you can almost imagine him in his tent
going
see told them yeah that was gonna happen
i think he was going
more curry for me
[Laughter]
if you have a row and you hear someone
falling down the stairs immediately
afterwards
you're gonna that's a result for you
that's the universe telling you you're
right about the argument
in a way yeah oh well so who's the
alistair curry of this podcast
but there was a huge like storm about it
afterwards there's a massive um stuff in
the press about it and that's kind of
when he gave up mountaineering that was
um after that catching chunga incident
and k2 i believe it was k2 he never
reached the top of
not because they couldn't make it up
there but because of differences within
the team again he fell
out with the team he pulled a revolver
on one of the members and they
the guy he pulled the gun at guy knowles
was his name uh kicked him in the groin
it will cause some tension in a group
when you pull a revolver on somebody
yeah um but i actually one of the things
i love about kanchenjunga the third
highest mountain
is that no one's ever got to the top of
it and lots of people have got to 10
meters below the top
and this is because local tradition has
it that
it so it's in the himalayas a local
tradition has it that spirits live at
the top and you can't disturb them
and so everyone who's ever climbed it
every mountaineering expedition that's
been up there which is a couple of
hundred people i think
out of respect for the spirit at the top
they stopped just beneath it
that's very respectful it is but you
can't imagine that crowley would have
done that
he probably would have he would have got
to the top and done like a macarena on
top or a little jig or something
yeah he would have spoken to the spirit
if crowley had known about the
chillingham cattle
he would have been up there and touching
them all over like nobody's
episode pull business to a hundred
episodes ago oh my god
that was i think it's more like 300
episodes
that's amazing these are some cows who
live in a field that james wants to
touch
anyway um oh i see what you're trying to
do here is deflect who's the crowley of
the group
yeah absolutely yeah um
one one thing he climbed which i think
is more impressive than
k2 is beachy head he climbed the cliffs
at beachy head from the bottom to the
top
but he was a massive boaster about the
things he did he wrote
the general opinion was that no one had
ever climbed it
there was however a legend that it had
once been done i settled the point
by walking up smoking a pipe with my dog
and then he put in brackets i had no
woman available
in nine and a half minutes nice
i mean i was that [ __ ] he had a couple
of weeks ago and i'd struggle to climb
it and so would my dog
how did he get the dog together i don't
know he might have had a dog papoose
there is an argument that a lot of the
stuff in his autobiography
might have been a bit maybe uppy yeah
that's true might have been a very
a bit talking perhaps
he claimed that it was his idea for
churchill to give the v
sign um he said according to some
uh people like rabalay and some earlier
writers the v sign was a good way of
fighting
against the swastika according to kind
of
ancient eastern rituals and so
he claimed that he also claimed that it
was down to him that stamford bridge
football ground was aligned in the way
that it's aligned
and that he gave chelsea football club
its team colours of blue
that was all down to him that's what he
claimed wow
very cool once once you've defeated the
nazis what are you gonna do next
i guess pick the team colors for a
premiership team
this sounds like obviously [ __ ] that
he was claiming all these things but he
was quite an influential
character back in the day particularly
with counter culture america so
aldous huxley was a big fan of his um
he he very much set up a lot of ideas
that got carried forward about
free thinking um his religion that he
started which
is thelma was an idea that you do stuff
for you
rather than you do on behalf of the
community which suddenly was this new
idea that hadn't really been explored
too much in the past
there's a great story about how he set
up uh thelema
which was it was his wife who claimed
that he was going to be dictated this
message
by a guardian angel who called iwas
and she she said that he's got all these
messages for you and he didn't believe
it
so he took her to a museum
in cairo to say you've got to show me
who horus is
and she didn't know when they got there
they passed a huge horror statue and he
went okay so this is
this is nonsense she doesn't know but
she kept walking on
and she found this um this thing at the
end which horus appeared on
and she went that's the guy there and he
went oh my god that's horus and he
looked up the catalog number
of this particular piece and the number
was 666
in the catalogue and so he thought this
is a sign the synchronicity of this
means that she's right
and then he went into a room for three
days and he was dictated to by this
guardian angel
a book which is still in publication
today and is the basis of his whole
religion
thelma well his wife was called um
louise wasn't she
and the book was called shalamar and
louise
and um it got adapted didn't it
his wife was called rose and the sad
thing is that basically
within a year of her doing all of this
stuff with him and kind of coming up
with this religion
he'd dumped her and he'd found this
other lady called leila waddell
and layla waddell was a violinist
apparently not particularly good one but
an okay violinist
and he decided that he was gonna form a
band like a girl group like little mix
but she was gonna be the main person
this violinist
they were called the ragged ragtime
girls and apparently they were amazing
they played in london and they
absolutely pulled the house down
is it called pulled the house down is
that what they brought the house down
yeah they didn't pull the house down
they brought the house down and everyone
loved them and it looked like they were
gonna go on a massive tour around europe
but instead crowley decided that he was
going to go on a tour of some random
parts of russia
instead so they could have sold out
every single theater in the uk for
instance but he decided he was going to
go to russia and they were going to tour
there instead
and they went there and they were quite
successful in russia but the reason that
they went there we think
is because he might have been a spy for
the british government
and at that time rasputin was kind of
getting his claws
into um the uh cesarovich uh
in russia and maybe he was there to kind
of look after
and see what was going on with rasputin
and that's why this quite good
girl group never made it because they
had to go to russia with him on this
trip a tragedy a great loss to music
crowley used to live on the banks of the
loch ness
um and often tried to summon the loch
ness monster up at certain points
but he that's where he did all of his
biggest um
achievements in the early days of
spreading the the magic that he was
that he was claiming he could do so he
was trying to summon up demons
and battle them in order to make the
world a better place
you wouldn't summon them to battle them
just send them away surely
well you need to battle them to make
sure they don't come back yeah it's like
buffy the vampire slayer
she does not summon demons well someone
does definitely
someone does yeah
um that house on the is it bowl skin
house bowl sky and bowl skin isn't that
what they make
books out of that's good
um that has burned down twice in five
years
i know and then the owners started
selling the rubble uh dan you're
interested in buying um
i'd see i'd be so keen on buying rubble
you can get a whole bag of it for just
50 quid
you're kidding no are you serious i
don't know if it's still being solved
but
you better get on it don't come on dan's
wife and children have to put up with so
many of his dodgy purchases
what are you doing i wouldn't be allowed
i've genuinely been told by finnella i'm
not allowed to bring aleister crowley's
book into the house
she thinks um yeah cause like she's
scared that it has
powers with it and also we're in
lockdown so
we'd be around these spirits a lot i've
got quite a few of his books here and i
don't think we've had any problems here
so far
i don't i don't think spirits have much
respect for government guidelines about
covered safety
i think if they want to go out they're
going to go out they're not going to be
trapped there with you
but it's interesting i mean it's it's a
historical house not just if you're a
crowley fan but if you're
a music fan led zeppelin's jimmy page
bought that house many years ago
and he was very obsessed with aleister
crowley as
um as a lot of zeppelin fans will know
he's
very much into black magic but he didn't
really ever live there he he lent it
to a guy called malcolm dent who looked
after it and had his kids there and so
on and he claims that there were a lot
of spooky happenings
while he was living there um that his
wife was sort of
um attacked by a big beast
[Laughter]
um just one other prominent thelobyte
who is quite surprising was jack parsons
who was another leading telemite who
crowley installed and he was the father
of the us space program
which is kind of concerning actually
when you reflect on it
so he's a rocket scientist in the 30s he
invented things like jet engines and jet
fuel
needed for space flight and he also
believed in a lot of this
occult stuff wasn't he the one who l ron
hubbard kind of got in with his life and
started living with him and his wife and
then just ran off with his wife or
something
ran off with his wife that's right yes
yeah he did ran off
i think ran off with he ended up having
a fulsome with his wife and a 17 year
old girl
who then married l ron hubbard and they
founded scientology
and parsons went on to try and conjure
up a new lover
when she abandoned him for elrond
hubbard and he did that by masturbating
onto magical tablets to the background
sound of
this is nicholas parsons did you say
[Laughter]
this is the person who went on to found
america's space program
so you're not allowed hesitation
deviation or masturbation
[Music]
okay it's time for fact number three and
that is my fact
my fact this week is that japan's yakuza
have been told they are no longer
allowed to join in
trick-or-treating the yakuza uh
is japan's mafia for anyone who doesn't
know that and they're a big syndicate of
lots of different little groups
this is one particular group that has
been told this year
that no more trick-or-treating allowed
even though
everyone loves it when the yakuza do
trick-or-treating
um it's it's quite funny they've done
this in the past for many years it
started when some kids accidentally came
up to their offices
and they uh knocked on the door and a
very startled yakuza member
didn't know what to do and sort of
fanned them off with money and
then they suddenly realized hang on if
we can get kids to come and get candy
off us they might see us as good people
and that's really good for recruitment
because the yakuza have a very big
problem with recruitment a lot of their
members are mid 50s now and they
have trouble bringing in the youngins i
don't think it's great for your pr if
you're wanting to come across as a good
guy
to as an elderly gentleman start luring
children to you with sweets
okay so so they're not trick-or-treating
they're sort of
being the recipients of trick or treats
they invite children and they put up
decorations and
they put up inflatable ghosts and they
tell people to take pictures
and about i mean the last few times
they've done it about 800
parents and children have shown up so
it's quite
it is really popular the security was
impeccable
they get a lot of really good reviews
yes one local woman said
not only were the decorations great and
the gift bags full of tasty stuff
there were two big lines for cotton
candy and the gangsters were super nice
so they're right shame about the massive
blood bath
living room but once little danny got
over that we had a great time
um they do have a lot of social outreach
missions in the uk
so um this year when the coronavirus
thing was just
beginning um they offered to disinfect
the
diamond princess cruise ship which had
been impounded in yokohama
and they they said yeah we'll do it
we're you know we're gangsters we're
meant to be doing the the difficult
tricky jobs that no one else is doing
they gave out masks they gave out toilet
paper so
they have a lot of kind of soft power
that they're using yeah they do
they are we should say sort of not
necessarily good guys
um not necessarily because i read i read
a piece in the guardian about how they
are really struggling
and it did feel a bit like god this poor
organization is really on its last legs
here
but they do do some weird stuff uh one
of which is often
sort of killing people another is the
habit they have of cutting off their
fingers so that's
the probably most well-known yakuza
tradition is that if you're a member of
the yakuza
and you do something wrong you have to
cut off your
finger and apparently one of the ways
you can now tell
that they are losing their membership is
that prosthetics makers
are doing really well so there are a
couple of interviews there was one with
someone called shintaro hayashi in 2013
who said he's noticed he's getting loads
more calls from people who want
prosthetic pinky fingers
and that's because people have chopped
off their pinkies because they're in the
yakuza
then they've decided i think i might go
for another job and it looks bad if
you've got no little finger
and so they go for the fake finger wow
that's that's a sign and apparently a
lot of the gangsters who are higher up
they have different fingers for
different seasons
a finger to match every occasion so they
go for a tanned finger
oh i see yeah not a kind of a pumpkin
spice finger for autumn
i was thinking like a finger that can
hook apples off trees for the autumn
maybe
that's so good a really long one that's
like a
um ski pole for winter brilliant
but a glittering so it's tinsel nice
christmas finger yeah
yeah that would be nice who wouldn't
like a christmas finger
in spring you could call it a springer
stunning brilliant and you could
i don't know what you'd have on your
spring finger but maybe a
sort of spike so you could plant seeds
in the ground ah
great idea i think the spike is suddenly
bad for pr again
if you impale everyone you shake hands
with yeah maybe you're not gonna get
that job
so when they're um like the prosthetic
makers
are giving them um new fingers i wonder
if there might also be a thing
about uh tattoo removal because they're
quite famous for
their tattoos aren't they yakuzas there
was a book that came out uh last year
called i give you my life
which was photographs of the wives of
yakuza members
because actually it's kind of
interesting the way that the women are
in this society because they're not
considered members of the yakuza
um but they are not in the way that you
might think
of like mafia wives and stuff kind of
clueless of everything that's happening
especially the wives of the top level
people they kind of know everything
that's going on
and their tattoos kind of tell you a lot
about their history and stuff like that
which i found really interesting um but
i looked into the history of the
tattoos in japan and it goes all the way
back to the fifth century
and the japanese government used tattoos
to punish their criminals
and that's why the yakuzas are so
tattoos now it kind of goes all the way
back to that
and if you ever did anything bad you'd
get a line across your forehead
and then the second one they would put
an arch over the line
and the third one they would put one
extra kind of line and that
did the symbol the kanji for dog and it
would like you would have the word it's
like almost like if you did a crime here
and the first time they put a d on your
forehead
second time an o and the last time they
[Laughter]
that's what i was thinking it'd be great
if that's what they drew the hangman
and then if they complete the thing they
hang you right oh wow yeah
oh that's very punitive but that is wow
yeah yeah
it takes a lot of goes to get there but
there's always that debate you know do
you draw that extra beam
between do you give the guy arms
so you could say i'm going to give you
one extra crossbeam because you know
you've shown repentance
yeah yeah suck if the last detail on
that drawing was to draw the fingers on
the person but you'd already lost seven
of them
so japan only started doing
trick-or-treating and halloween
generally in 1997
and this was as a result of disneyland
in tokyo
and they had their first ever disney
happy halloween event
and everyone loved it and it was sort of
come here and experience this western
thing that they do
so everyone started doing it and it
spread to different amusement parks so
universal studios started doing it and
they had their hollywood halloween
got bigger and bigger and so it's a
proper thing there now and they have one
extra element to it that none of us as
far as i know do
which is they have a post halloween
cleanup on november the 1st
where everyone goes back out into the
streets the next day
still in costume and they clean up all
the rubble and debris from
the night's parties like people could
clean the feces off my front door that
get there
[Laughter]
it's not just halloween no but at least
it gets cleaned once a year
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast hey
everybody this week's episode of fish is
sponsored by hellofresh
yes we are hello fresh is the recipe box
service that delivers delicious meals in
ingredient form
directly to your door complete with
lovely easy instructions of how to make
those meals
yeah it's a really incredible service
that we all use on fish it particularly
works for me as someone who has no idea
how to cook
but also doubles up on a number of
things that i hate doing i hate standing
in a supermarket
queue that's done don't need to do it
anymore i hate not knowing
what goes into the pot at what point and
how much of it needs to go in and for
what time
it's like it's an ikea kit but it makes
sense
you've got to stop cooking with just one
pot dan um
no it is really good it's really
convenient there's much less food waste
because they're sending you exact
quantities
and there are so many recipes to choose
from each week so you have a pretty
broad range of things to choose
that's right so if you'd like to take
advantage of this and get 50
off your first hellofresh box and 35
off your subsequent three boxes all you
need to do
is go to hellofresh.com.uk and use the
code
a fish that's right just go to
hellofresh.co.uk
and put in a fish and you'll get 50 of
your first box and 35
of the following three all right on with
the show
on the show
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that
is andy my fact is that ghost
crabs use teeth in their stomachs to
growl at their enemies so are these
ghost crabs are real crabs called ghost
crabs these are not ghost crabs called
jeff who live i love man to see yeah
exactly
so the ghost crab is a real thing um
it's it's sort of small and pale and
looks a bit ghostly hence the
that's the kind of common name for it
lives in the atlantic and
beaches of the usa that kind of place uh
the guardian says they're named for
their sand pale bodies and
nocturnal antics um so
i guess yeah active at night as well
also ghostly um
and these scientists at the scripps
institution of oceanography were looking
at them
um because they noticed they could hear
the crabs making a noise but the crabs
weren't doing anything
to to make a noise as it were and then
they weren't
almost like they were they were doing
ventriloquism like
fiery from the isle of man exactly
that was exactly like that um and so
they they thought well this curious
we're going to investigate
uh this is a scientist called jennifer
r.a taylor who led this research
and they tried a couple of things they
put an endoscope into the crab's mouth a
tiny endoscope
uh and it immediately just bit it and
crushed it obviously um
so then they used a thing called uh
laser doppler vibrometry
and they bounced a laser off a crab
basically and various different bits of
its interior
and they found out that it has this
feature inside it called a gastric
mill which is something it uses to grind
up food internally it's got a kind of
extra mincing layer inside it ah
yeah and when they provoked a crap by
you know presenting it with a
hand or a model of another crab or
whatever it would make this growling
noise
just by rubbing together its internal
teeth in its stomach
so cool so we can do it on command like
yeah have you listened to the video
of them growling andy yeah yeah because
it's not we should say
it's not like a kind of like like a dog
growl it's quite a high pitch like a can
you use
kind of noise yeah can we can we hear
exactly what it sounds like then can you
do a good impression uh it was like
[Laughter]
yeah terrifying terrifying growl yeah
uh yeah but they that's so cool it's a
massive like i have a macerator toilet
downstairs in my house um
which is when you have a yeah no but i
just like that's what i relate that to
it's is that the night it makes this
yeah
what's your diet mate what's going on
what's a what's a macerated toilet
it has it sort of grinds it all up in a
tank behind it right we've got one of my
parents house as well it's incredibly
annoying because it does make that
rumbling growling sound throughout the
night it growls
yeah it growls as you flush the toilet
um yeah
you should just install a big old ghost
crab and [ __ ] in its mouth
well use nature use what it gave us
uh and the idea is i believe just to get
back to the ghost crap
in real life is um if you're if you're
fighting
if you're a ghost crab but you want to
tell someone to [ __ ] off at the same
time
and you don't have a voice box you can't
like click
your claws because you're using your
claws to fight with um but if you do it
with your stomach then it frees up your
hands to do some fighting
exactly it's hands-free technology but
for crabs
it's amazing well if you're fighting and
also eating
what have you got then i think you've
got yourself you've got yourself to
blame
good point don't eat and fight
they're very fast aren't they these
these crabs they are
known to be the fastest crustaceans that
we have and they can reach
up to 3.4 miles a second um
[Laughter]
3.4 miles per second there i think if
someone's about if someone's about to
[ __ ] in your mouth you'd go away that
fast as well
sorry okay got it that's incredible so
they can cross the atlantic in an hour
or so
it's amazing it's widespread yeah yeah
they're the fastest crustaceans
that's why they're called the ghosts you
you say it's there you turn around
to tell someone and it's not there
anymore so sorry how fast can they go
can we they can uh they can run up to 10
miles per hour
is what i read okay um or three meters
per second
in fact uh yeah that sounds
more legitimate than what i said before
and that is still fast but now it sounds
really crap given how fast everyone
thought they were going
one reason we know how they're so fast
um is that they did put ghost crabs on a
treadmill
which as we all know they've put all
animals on the treadmill
but i can say and i did look really hard
for this i've never found a study which
put a mongoose on a treadmill
um so that should have been my fact here
but yeah there was a study in 1990
by wj van art in south africa where he
put ghost
crabs on a treadmill and found that they
could run for two hours before getting
tired
whoa that's amazing did he have a
question did he put them on the
treadmill
did he put the treadmill sideways well
no
it doesn't really matter which direction
that yeah
no no but you have to move sideways yeah
yeah but just put the crab on sideways
you wouldn't change the direction of
your treadmill would you
that's just a matter of perspective if
you wanted to do sideways running in a
gym you wouldn't have to go to the
person at the desk and say sorry can you
turn this
treadmill round do some sideways running
i'm banned from all the gyms in south
london dragging the equipment around
i'm surprised they work on treadmills
because don't they run in a weird way
where they
sprint really fast and then they stop
and then they sprint and then they stop
and i think
they think that's about um that lactic
acid builds up if you sprint as we
remember from biology and to get rid of
that waste product
you stop and then your body disposes of
it so i would have thought on a
treadmill they're going to go flying off
the back you're also moving sideways
that's the problem
is that you go from side to side across
the trip hill
they're like that okay go video
no the um the thing which they do with
stopping occasionally that is when
they're being pursued by a predator
um they use that trick so yeah
i think clearing do we know how they're
clearing a lactic acid or does it just
naturally dissipate if they stop for a
bit
i think that's it yeah same with us as
soon as you stop then you repay your
oxygen debt or whatever don't you
wow it's amazing anything can catch them
really at the speeds we know they can go
now
i didn't even know if red melts could go
that way
have you guys just uh on crabs in
general
okay uh have you heard of mitten crabs
these are a huge problem
half remember them but i don't yeah so
this is the thing they're also called
the shanghai hairy crab
and uh basically they've they look like
they're wearing mittens they've got
these huge um
hairy claws at their front and uh they
are a traditional food in china they get
eaten a lot but they are also
unbelievably successful around the world
they're in the world's top 100 most
invasive
species they're so popular in china
there are vending machines sometimes
with live crabs inside them
that you can i know you can just buy um
china even has a museum shaped like a
giant hairy crab
i'm trying to sort of imagine how a crab
works in a vending machine
because do they have to hang from those
bits that the chocolate bars hang from
i sound i think they're wrapped i think
they're wrapped up that's how you
transport them traditionally is you bind
their claws up and things
i think it's like the chocolate bar
thing isn't it but you have to turn the
entire vending machine
around 90 degrees so that they can come
out sideways
you'd be so annoyed if your crab was
it's just stuck out of claw and got
hanging off the edge and then you did
that again and again and again
and every crab did a little crab conker
it would be good to have
you know those claw machines that kind
of pick up things to have one of those
picking up crabs
yes because they'd think it was sort of
a giant crab god coming to pick them up
and take them off to
[Laughter]
um i have some more spooky crabs you can
have
yeti crabs vampire crabs zombie crabs
cannibal crabs or wizard crabs
which um
okay so this is a crab um that has
the latin name harry plax severus
okay it's quite a nice story actually so
it's you would think that that was named
after
um harry potter right because you've got
severus and you've got harry potter
um but actually they were discovered by
a guy called harry conley
hence the harry and um the word severus
comes from the latin for rigorous
because he was an
amateur collector of um crabs and he
spent his whole life really rigorously
kind of going through these kind of
piles of rubble looking for crabs
they've he found it and it was only
found to be a new species 20 years after
he died but they named it after him
and the person who named it did admit
that they did very much like harry
potter
and there was a double meaning but at
the same time
it was named after this harry and the
severus meaning rigorous so
and then are they they called wizard
crabs because of the harry potter thing
or was this guy actually called
wizard junior and he was a satanist he
he was a black magician
i'll be honest that was my
calling them wizard crabs they're not
actually called they're not coded
they're kind of wizardy crabs aren't
they because they're kind of like harry
potter yeah absolutely definitely
definitely if they don't have a common
name yet you can give them a common name
well i didn't realize that we we had
that kind of power i think we did
very exciting i think we could try it
out we could push the
push the envelope so do any of these
crabs have the actual common name that
you've given them or were
you just bluffing us with your zombie
crabs and your vampire crabs um yeti
cubs
and vampire crabs are real okay um
zombie crabs are crabs that are
turned into zombies and cannibal crabs
are crabs that eat other crabs
what do you mean crabs that have turned
into zombies yeah so there is a barnacle
called loxothylacus panopayi
um otherwise known as luxo and they will
find a recently malted female crab
and they'll go into her undercarriage
and lay their eggs in there and they'll
turn them into a zombie
so all they'll do is look after these
baby barnacles
and the worst thing is that if there's
two of these um
crabs in a couple they'll take the male
and also infect the male
and change his anatomy so he looks a bit
like a female
and acts like a female and the male and
the female both of whom now
look and act like females all just look
after these baby barnacles
because they're like zombies that's all
they can do and they just sit there
while these baby barnacles are just
eating off them and being born off them
yeah yeah so the crab is oh yeah the
crab is the zombie i guess and the
barnacle is the wiz
the guy in charge it's the wizard
yeah i can only think of the word wizard
now that's the only piece of vocabulary
i have the barnacle is like the um
the zombie plague that turns everything
into zombies
yeah right um yeti crabs are quite cool
they were only discovered in 2005 and
they really are called yesterday crabs
um and they found their own food on
their arms
so they're really cute actually they
look like a
cuddly toy because they've got these
really hairy shaggy arms
a bit like the crab that andy was
describing earlier and huge colonies of
bacteria live there in their hairs
because it's such a nice
wet hairy environment to live in and
then they just spend their days eating
the bacteria
it's quite nice although probably not if
you met a human who
kind of farmed bacteria on their arms
and they lived off eating that probably
you wouldn't
nice wouldn't be the adjectives really
what student hasn't sort of licked their
armpits for sustenance
particularly low day come on
so vampire crabs are kind of they're
quite beautiful crabs they've got
glowing eyes they're really
lots of amazing colors are often quite
dark purple a bit kind of draculary
uh and they're quite become quite
popular pets quite recently
and the thing is that you can't really
breed crabs because they're all
cannibals like i said they kind of eat
each other
and so um the only way to get these
vampire crabs is to go
and find them at source so there's
people in southeast asia who will go
down
search for these crabs and they'll bring
them back and then sell them onto
dealers
now a lot of them are very like
interesting colors that are really good
for pets
and if you know where to find a
particularly nice purpley one with
bright green eyes then you're not going
to tell anyone else where that is right
because you want to have your stash
and so people have been doing that and
they found
that some of the species are quite
popular
for pet owners are actually brand new
species that have never been described
ever before
and they can't find out where they're
from because the dealers won't tell me
where they found them
right that's that very cool i'm out of
spooky
i've got i've got a um the orangutan
crab
oh yeah which if a crab was going to a
halloween party might
dress up as an orangutan like that's the
only connection i could make really
the halloween thing um but it's really
beautiful to look at it looks like an
orangutan it's it's
ginger red brown hair all over and
uh the hair catches the debris of of
animals coming by so it traps itself in
its hair so it can just eat
the food that's stuck in its arms and so
on nice
but it's good for camouflage as well i
think isn't it doesn't it sort of
suck it's good as it goes so you can't
see it actually speaking of camouflage
the ghost crabs that we talked about at
the start
they are kind of some of them are quite
sandy colored
in the light sand as in um dry sand and
some of the quite sandy colored in a
dark sand which is like wet sand and
what they do
is they know what color they are and
they'll run to the area which is most
like whatever their color is
desperate to match but they can i think
change can't they but it's not as quick
as like a chameleon
so i think they lifted up the
light-colored ones living in light sand
plop them in dark sand and they can
camouflage themselves and turn
themselves the color of the dark sound
but it takes about a month
so if that month they're sitting there
in the dark sun really flashing like a
beacon
then eventually if they survive that
they've turned the right color
yeah and it's shore crabs they can
camouflage themselves too but
when noisy ships sail nearby it takes
them way longer to change
they can't do it as quickly and this is
a problem because if they're not
changing color then they're much likely
to be preyed on
and it's basically because they're
stressed they're stressed by the noise
of the sea
and that's a bit like those of us who
can't really work to music
it's more life and death than not being
able to work to music but yeah if you
like
my job is my life actually
[Laughter]
but then some of us work better to music
i work better having a load of crazy
j-pop going in my ears when i'm working
so
are there some kind of um are there's
some craps that just love
ships going back i think they're just
like oh yeah that's fine i can get
everything done i can
collect a load of crustaceans today
and usually it's better for exercise so
anytime a crabs on a treadmill
you know appreciate the music
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening

hi guys andy here just before we start
this week's show we wanted to say that
we have a special
guest on it is none other than major
tim peake soldier pilot astronaut
absolutely everything he is the first
british astronaut to go into space with
the european space agency
he has done so many amazing things in
his life
and part of the reason he's on is that
he's got a new book out it's his
autobiography it's called
limitless i've just finished it it is so
amazing the stuff he's done
he spent years flying helicopters being
a helicopter test pilot
uh he was in the army he talks about get
a sandhurst
he's done all these incredible things
the number of adventures in the book
basically every single page has a new
exciting weird thing he's done
it he lived under water for a while that
didn't even make it into the podcast we
didn't even mention the fact that he
lived
under water that's how many interesting
things he has to say
about his life so far so uh we hope you
like the episode and if you do you
should give his book a look it is called
limitless and it is out now from all
bookshops even if the bookshops aren't
actually open
it can be ordered okay on with the
podcast
[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with andrew hunter murray
anna toshinski and special guest it's
britain's first ever
and currently only ever space walking
astronaut major tim peake
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four favorite
banks from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with you major tim well my fact
of the week is that when you do a space
walk you have to wear
16 layers of clothing and a nappy
was that definitely not a prank from the
other astronauts
i thought it might be you know when you
get told the fancy dress party and you
turn up and everyone's wearing normal
clothes
no so the nappy is very very but we
don't call it a nappy we call it a mag a
maximum
absorbency garment um so that we don't
have to go around calling it a diaper or
a nappy
but it's a nap it's an adult nappy and
that gives us
an ease of mind to know that at any
point during spacewalk if you need to go
for our weed
you can just let it go and is it like a
standard
snappy just sort of a big woolly mess on
your bum i don't have children i think
but i think that's what
he basically is isn't it
it's no it's a standard adult
incontinence pad
nappy you see so you put it on you got
two velcro type straps on the left and
on the right
and you just you know tighten yourself
up and then we wear
some long jumps uh over the top of that
and so that's layer number two long
johnson a kind of long sleeve
top uh layer number three is what's
called an lcvg
a liquid cooling ventilation garment and
that's pretty cool actually it's a it's
a onesie
that has got about almost a kilometers
worth of
piping thin rubber piping going through
it
and that's where the water flows through
and that's what regulates our
temperature
out on the space walk and then it's into
the spacesuit and that's where the other
14
layers
[Laughter]
i was reading about the procurement
procedure behind these garments
maximum absorption garments so
apparently they were made by a firm
called absorbencies
and they've gone bust but nasa bought so
many
they bought 3200 of these in the late
90s
and they've still got some of them
knocking around but it seems like they
must be running short by now
you would say you don't need many do you
you don't need it
i i read that astronauts are only really
given three
one for takeoff one for re-entry and
if you're going on a space walk there's
your third
houston we have this big old swimming
pool the mutual buoyancy laboratory and
we wear them there as well because we
train exactly as we would do a spacewalk
and so although we're only in the water
for six hours um we still wear them so
that we know
what it feels like and in fact the
advice was because going through
training you never need to go
um but the advice from some flown
astronauts was tim at least once
just have a wee in your space because
because
he says you don't want to do anything
for the first time on a space walk
you know you want to have tried
everything so you know what it feels
like you know
it works at least at least do it once
during training
and did you have to do it on the space
walk i didn't i
no actually i was i was very fortunate i
perhaps should have probably tells you
that i was very dehydrated
um because we put that thing on we
start getting dressed at seven o'clock
in the morning on space walk day you're
up around 6 30 and
and then you do your medical you put a
chest harness on which has got
uh monitors your heart rate and
breathing rate and then you
you're into your spacesuit quite soon so
you end up spending
somewhere about you know 10 to 12 hours
in that spacesuit
um but no thankfully i didn't need to
use it yeah you've got to start drinking
more yeah
yeah that is a long time
okay i read something that i really
wanted to check because um
i don't think you mentioned this work
but it might be sort of a previous
astronaut procedure which is that
sometimes you would have to spend the
night before you do your space walk in a
cupboard
wearing your spacesuit what and that's
so
so that you can get all the nitrogen out
of your blood
so you don't suffer you know you don't
get bubbles forming at this kind of
thing very dangerous yeah
yeah actually andy you're partly right
there because what we used to do
they used to scamp out in the airlock
and
um so it wasn't this a cupboard they
would actually kind of take their
sleeping bags in there
and they would be breathing oxygen at a
lower
pressure in the airlock all night long
and that was flushing the nitrogen
out of their system but it was not
comfortable and it was you know people
were getting up very tired on spacewalk
morning
and we've gradually we've become more
and more comfortable
with actually reducing that period of
time but
it's just the same as a diver trying to
prevent themselves from getting the
bends
because inside the spacesuit we take the
pressure down
to about 4.3 psi so
less than a third of the atmosphere it's
slightly higher than mount everest the
equivalent pressure
which is pretty low actually and so you
don't want to go into that low pressure
environment
with a whole stack of nitrogen in your
bloodstream wow
and then when you're out there i was
reading to be fair quite old article
from 1984 when the first woman did a
space walk
i think it was lana savitzkaya and she
was
a cosmonaut and she went out to like do
some welding
and the article about that said that and
i don't think i can believe this
that they're so kind of uncomfortable
and inelastic back then
that you could lose up to three
kilograms as in almost half a stone in
the course of the spacewalk
which wow i think that's impossible i
think dieters would be doing this left
right incentive
possible let's do the space walk diet
yeah
very expensive but yeah it'd be
uncomfortable and heavy
it is uncomfortable and it's hard work
you you are
really really working hard because
although it's a very very low pressure
compared to the vacuum outside you feel
like you know mitchell man in this this
blown up tire
and bending of fingers moving your arms
is is exhausting
and and just moving around in space is
exhausting
so you do come back physically
absolutely exhausted but
three kilograms three kilograms sounds
like an awful lot
and i i tended to not believe the
article the moment you said welding
because
you know we take risks on this facebook
but i don't think
we'd go out there welding just in case
you know
the seats sound pretty amazing i was
reading that the gloves have
a inbuilt heater system you know like
when you sit in a car
and someone presses that button you know
the driver presses the button and
the back of your seat something gets hot
you're like what they have that
on the spacesuits uh just above the
fingernails on the gloves with an on off
button
on the wrist i believe so is that right
that's so cool that's absolutely right
there yeah yeah
so the little it's a little tab that you
pull on the top of your
wrist and when we're going into night
actually we get mission control call up
and they just say guys you know you're
25 seconds away from from nighttime uh
helmets
gloves and visors and so what they want
there is helmet lights switch them on
uh visors because we'll often have the
gold visor down
in the daytime for sun protection so
gold vises up
and then gloves switch them on so your
fingers stay nice and warm
and that is actually that's the only
source of heat
other than body heat to keep us warm on
a spacewalk i guess that just goes to
show how effective the suit is
at protecting us against the cold from
space because it's only our own
body generated heat that keeps us warm
other than the electrical
fingertips wow how cold i mean what's
what's the temperature
out there if we're in the shade or at
night time
it's just a few degrees i mean space is
a few degrees above
absolute zero and uh the things we're
touching will be down at minus 100
celsius
but in the sunshine metal panels can be
as hot as
plus 260 celsius so even when you're
working in the sun this you know
you might have one hand you know on one
side of the solar panel in the sun and
the other in the shade
and your spacesuit is having to cope
with this massive
massive thermal thermal differentiation
between
between the two so it's doing a
remarkable job that's like canada i
believe
uh i'm led to inform they send
astronauts to canada
[Laughter]
training i'm sure does it feel i mean
how odd does it feel when you step out
of the airlock
it's brilliant i mean it does feel odd
because you just you suddenly
feel the the exposure and you know
you're aware that
the danger is kind of palpable in that
respect like okay this is it i mean the
vacuum of space just a
suit and a thin visor but you soon get
comfortable and you get comfortable with
the view as well and and you know you
let go you know you're not going
anywhere
so as long as you're tethered onto the
space station
um but sometimes the vertigo just
catches you out
unexpectedly and it happens for me once
i was coming back towards the airlock
along this thin pole
it's like a shortcut and so i was not
surrounded by a
structure at all and i was kind of like
hanging on to this pole but i looked
down and
suddenly got this massive wave of
vertigo seeing west of australia down
below below
my face what a stupid time to look down
oh my god you know one thing as you're
looking down
if you are taken in by the absolute
beauty of what you're seeing
one thing you can't do in your spacesuit
is go
yes yeah whistling yeah in space
well it's no i i mean it's really weird
in that low pressure environment
um whistling is really really hard and
your voice
tends to kind of drop an octave which
for me is quite good because i've got a
high voice anyway but
be great for david beckham um so yeah
it's it's one of those environments
where you know you'd seen that low
pressure just weird
things happen so no whistling is really
hard wow i didn't know that about the
voice that's
i want to try that that's i'm put off by
the lack of whistling because my mum
always said you can't be unhappy when
you're whistling
um but i quite like the idea of the
voice
going down an octave kind of sexy and
sultry yeah
sexy astronauts that's the only version
that we have
yeah it's funny when you say it's about
sexy asteroids one of the things that
came up
why i came up with the fact is from
gravity and and sandra bullock
you know coming in from her space walk
and taking it off and there she is all
she's wearing is hot pants underneath
her spacing
so that's why i thought i've got a bit
of myth busting here
i can't believe that was your chief
problem with the science of film gravity
oh everything else everything else is
perfectly accurate
we fly around on fire extinguishers all
the time you do see
george clooney's ghost when you're up
there everyone sees george clooney
um when you're inside the iss the
clothes that you're wearing obviously
quite different more comfortable
hopefully
but when you have to take them off is it
the case that
i think i was listening to the nasa
podcast and they were saying that um
dead skin is a real problem so when
you're taking up your socks
particularly dead skin comes off a lot
and you have to take your socks off next
to a sort of suction vent or something
right
it's gross yes yeah i mean there's some
things about the human body you just
don't want to really see
and and and we don't get to see on earth
how much we shed
each day really it's kind of hidden from
us but up there yeah you take your socks
off them
and in weightlessness anything that's
inside your socks will just come flying
out
and your feet because you're not walking
on them all of the hard and dead skin
that's accumulated all of our lives
it's just after about a month or two
it's shedding off
so big big horrible flakes of skin
coming off your feet i mean you you have
to do it next to the
egg return grid because it's the the
cleanest way
of doing it just take your socks off are
they reusable for anything in the way
that
i know that like urine is being turned
back into water
to drink that's a good point no we
haven't we haven't become that quite
ingenious as to how to reuse dead skin
um one thing i really found interesting
was
what you described so you um captured a
cargo vehicle when you're up there not
what captured you know it was it you
it was scheduled to come in it's not
like you were just doing space piracy or
whatever
but um the method by which you gauge
how close it is as because you're using
a robotic arm aren't you too
exactly the right moment and obviously
it's rolling you're rolling there's lots
of picture in your
but the method is so um it's antiquated
it is
it's it's unbelievable and i you know
when i was first told this is how you do
it
i couldn't quite believe it i thought
hang on a second you know where's the
laser rangefinder where's the
image tracker you know we're coming from
a background flying
all these sophisticated aircraft with
these tracking systems and lock-on
systems and guidance systems
you've got two old hand controllers and
what your crewmates
to do is print off some sheets of paper
with pictures
of how big the cargo vehicle looks at
different ranges
so when he sees it this big he's loads
it's five meters then four meters then
three meters
i thought they're having a joke but that
is that is how we do it
and you just have to drive in this
robotic arm
um from the cupola window looking at
some old screens and just um
hoping it all goes to plan it's it's by
far and above it's the highest pressure
moment for any astronaut is capturing a
cargo vehicle more so than the space
wall without a doubt
and if you missed it is there a sort of
second chance
they're stuck in space now forever it
depends how badly you screw up really if
you
if you just miss it you can have a
second chance
if you haven't knocked it but if you
knock it and it you know
you can cause some damage or even cause
it to go off tumbling
into space then then that could be
really bad um
so yeah the pressure is definitely on
there so in the way that you
train underwater for the space walk do
you also go to sort of amusement parks
and play that claw game where you have
to catch your soft toy
i have never won at that law game it's
the most
depressing thing in the world years of
training
years of academy training wasted
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hey everyone this week's episode of fish
is sponsored by beer 52
yes beer 52 now they are a company that
will send you
a case of award-winning beer every month
if you pay for it and if you don't want
to pay for it they'll send you a free
case
if you're listening to fish yeah that's
right that's that's quite
quick to get to the call to action but
yeah
everyone knows what berries don't they
done they do but hey this is the awesome
thing about this beer
every single case i've got beer 52 i
have not heard of a single beer that's
arrived
it's like mysterious beers from around
the world that are not famous and taste
incredibly good and give you a sort of
sense of what's going on out there in
the world in beer making so it turns you
into a bit of a connoisseur
it does indeed and um this month it was
oktoberfest wasn't it in germany
and they sent us some dunkle
and some shrimps which were both
extremely delicious and very german
sounding yeah
the abk brewery ones are very dark and
very yummy
i had to actually take one back off a
guest uh who's at my house
so that i could finish it uh because you
know when am i gonna have it again
i have to get another case when you're
gonna have guests again exactly
yeah um so dan you know that uh offer i
was talking about right at the top of
the advert oh yeah very exciting
beer 52 will send you a free case of
award-winning beer
and all you have to do is go to
beer52.com fish and cover the 595
postage and they'll send it right to
your door that's right so go to
beer 52 it's five two dot com slash fish
to claim your free case which is eight
craft beers you also get a nice magazine
and a free snack
um and it will only cost you 5.95 for
the postage
and guys once you've cracked into your
beers
what do you want to do you want to read
a book but you actually sometimes want
to read a book
really fast and that is where blinkist
comes in because we are also sponsored
this week
by blinkist yes that's right blinkist is
an app and it condenses
best-selling non-fiction books down to
their key takeaways so that you can
read them or listen to them in just 15
minutes
it's so good if you're busy you want to
understand the main points of a book
quickly without going
cover to cover uh you can do blinkist
that's right and it does have all the
main non-fiction titles that you've
always wanted to read so
things like how to fail by elizabeth day
is brilliant book
the spy and the traitor by ben mcintyre
absolutely fantastic book
so good uh bill bryson's short history
of nearly everything it's now an even
shorter history of
even more nearly everything there's so
much on there and stephen hawking's a
brief history of time is now an even
briefer history
of a very short period of time so that's
right and if you go to
blinkist.com fish you can get a free
seven-day trial and 25 off a blinkist
premium membership
that's right that's blinkist spelled a
i s b-l-i-n-k-i-s-t blinkist dot com
slash
fish and you'll get 25 off on a seven
day free trial
right now okay on with the show on with
the show
okay it is time for fact number two and
that
is anna my fact this week is that
visitors to the sarawak cave in borneo
don't report feeling claustrophobic they
report feeling agrophobic
riddle me that
what is going on is it huge
it's big it's big it's the biggest cave
chamber in the world
so this is inside a cave system called
the good luck cave
and it would fit and it took me a long
time
to do this calculation because it's a
while since i worked out volumes
but it would fit roughly 10 wembley
stadiums inside it
i think based on google maps measuring
of the wembley stadium
which is large uh very tall very wide
very long it was discovered in 1981 and
when the first people went in they
didn't know they were in
a big cave at all they thought they were
in a little tunnel and so they were just
feeling
their way along the sides and they
followed the wall for
ages it was sort of bending around and
when they'd almost come back
done full circle they were like hang on
is this just empty in the middle are we
in a giant stadium
and they walk through the middle of it
and realized that wow that
must have been incredible i can imagine
that that feeling of agriphobe actually
get to the middle of that stadium
and switch the lights off i mean you'd
think you're just floating in space it
just i mean
incredible yeah i do the other thing
having done some gaming as well
and the the fear of getting lost because
of course caving is all about following
known features and and finding your way
back
in the middle of that thing you know how
do you how do you work out which way
which way you're going to go
i wanted that yeah just wandering around
it forever
because you kind of forget when you see
pictures of caves they're obviously very
well photographed and you do forget that
you are in pitch darkness basically all
the time on you except for a tiny light
in front of your face
yeah but why is there no why has no
one's set up some sort of
breadcrumbs system whereby you can
follow you know
luminous breadcrumbs or glow sticks
hansel aggressors yeah what's going on
like i'm sure there are
directions aren't there maybe directions
you've got to come up with
a compass yeah if the rocks aren't you
know
uh if there's not too much metal content
iron content the rocks i guess you could
you could try a compass
or just have a little bit of a bit of
string
use the cave diver method yes we
mentioned the
sun doom cave in vietnam ages ago as an
example of another
extremely big cave but i didn't i think
we said that it has
clouds that form in it that's how tall
it is but
i didn't know this um it's got a jungle
in it
it's got proper sort of you know virgin
jungle 600 feet below the surface of the
earth
uh and it's also this jungle i read is
home to the only
underground monkeys on the planet
they're the only monkeys in the world
that
live their lives underground which i
really hope is true well where have you
read
i mean i don't i read it in a reliable
source i
i hope it's true as well you've just
said it yeah that is unbelievably good
i guess they've evolved to suit their
habitat so i wonder what
how different they are to uh you know
other monkeys
in the region that are outside the cave
it feels like a really good backup
for all life forms on earth as in
if we all if we all go to some accident
nuclear or something
at least those monkeys will probably be
fine yes yes
but it's got a big gaping hole at the
top right
as in it's not they're not they're not
underground
underground monkeys they're just
subterranean
yeah for the trees to yeah for the
jungle to
to survive yeah so nice you do often get
actually in these massive caves
birds you get little swiftlets so
this is in the biggest cave by volume
which is actually in
china uh so the other one is the biggest
cave by area
and um the swiftlets are the birds out
of which you make birdness soup
in china and so that's why a lot of
people go caving in there to collect
that
although i think they've commercialized
bird in their soup and they've just
started farming them
these days but it sounds really sweet i
was reading about someone who went to
stay in that cave for a couple of months
and said that you'd lie down on the
ground and the swiftlets will just land
on your chest and let themselves be
petted
wow
that's great when they make their nests
out of saliva don't they it's all saliva
bird's nest
basically i think it's strands of the
whole bird nest
is this white these white threads oh i
thought it was twigs held together with
saliva
i think it's pretty much all saliva
glands with a little bit of
paraphernalia
you've never been tempted to try
something though
it's some of the best it's quite a high
price to pay
something that's apparently tasteless
okay if you if you're trapped down there
and hungry i think
i'd give it a go definitely yeah you
definitely will actually you're right
just let the birds land on you build
their nest on you
and then keep eating it it's so
frustrating for the bird
what's happened for one second
um caves are quite important for
training
for things like space actually aren't
they and training for how humans are
gonna survive in isolation
i think so quite a lot of people do this
weird thing where they experiment on
themselves by going deep into caves
and staying there for ages and i think
the king of that is this amazing guy
called michelle
who's this sort of geologist who's
basically been bedding down
deep in caves for over 50 years for
various long amounts of time
and the first time he did it he was 1972
and he spent
six months 440 foot
inside a texas cave in fact so maybe
just avoiding the heat
and they learned so many interesting
things but the weirdest thing is the
sleep cycle and how our sleep cycle
changes
so he would fall asleep for 30 hours and
think he just had
a short nap and so one day he had lasted
52 hours
on his 63rd day inside as in the 63rd
time he'd woken up
77 days had passed above ground
so it seems like our day is really
lengthened when we're underground
but it sounds awful i don't know why he
kept doing it he said he was so lonely
he contemplated suicide and this is the
first time he's done it like seven times
since
there's an awful story in his diary
where he's just staying alone he writes
a diary every night
and when he first went down he killed a
bunch of mice who were infesting his
little chamber
and then after a few weeks he realized
he really wanted a friend
and he saw a mouse and he thought oh my
god that's my friend
he's going to keep me company through
these awful months and he spread some
jam on the floor
and then put a little pea next to it to
lure this mask in
and he slammed a bowl down over it to
catch it
and he crossed the mouth no it just
sounds like surely the worst moment of
his life what a shiny name
oh cause i imagine in his head this was
the hollywood moment where
a man on the ground with a mouse for a
best friend you know like
but then he learned it totally ruined it
yeah
there's actually a woman called josie
law who's the woman who spent the most
time alone in a cave and she did
successfully befriend a white mouse
oh that's something yeah that's
something yeah i read that account of um
the supra and his his mouse he i think
he said later on that he didn't remember
it because obviously you forget
time when it's all you know similar
monotonous yeah but he did keep a diary
so he
he wrote in the diary i i killed the
mouse i'd love to know
what he felt when he came out okay with
that kind of sensory
overload have been deprived of all those
senses for so long
yeah because i mean when i came out
after just seven days
it was as if somebody had turned
contrast up on the telly to fall
the sky was this brilliant blue and you
could smell
smell the moss under the trees and and
everything was just loaded it only
lasted for about 30 minutes but
it kind of made me realize that we get
so used to
our limited senses and other animals you
know have
these incredible senses that it would be
wonderful i'd love to be able to smell
like a dog or a polar bear and just to
explore their world and
you know or have the uh you know the
eyesight of a house and be able to see
what they see at nighttime so
i think you've been underground uh that
was in a sardinia in a cave complex in
sardinia there's about 15 kilometers of
unexplored cave
and that was fascinating anna about the
time because we were actually
deprived of sleep down there that was
part of the exercise they took our
watches away
so we had no idea no concept of time and
we'd be woken up after about two hours
and told that we'd had eight hours sleep
so now crack on with your next day's
work
which we julie did feeling a little
tired come the third or fourth day
thinking why am i so exhausted
and of course of course you're only
getting two hours sleep a night without
thinking you're getting a good eight
hours
and then you get told after you you wake
up on the seventh morning
thinking okay i'm leaving the cave today
i think no no no no
you've got another three days to go
so that was not allowing us to get into
our natural cycles it's fascinating to
think the body actually goes the other
way in a cave and you actually
lengthen your days and lengthen the
amount of time you sleep yeah were you
angry when you sort of woke up and they
were like
ah punked you you've been getting two
hours
yeah but that's that was the whole point
they were trying to make us angry
through the whole exercise it was all
about
trying to push you to you know so that
there'd be conflict between you as a
team they
they wanted you to to learn how to deal
with
um the pressure of being cold wet tired
and hungry and
and if they could instigate a little bit
of um conflict amongst you as a team of
course then
you're able to explore those
psychological aspects as well it's all i
mean it was all really beneficial
training for
for the space station but um i'm not
sure i would voluntarily spend
six months down the camera and that's an
awful long time and
did was there conflict is there a dead
rival somewhere deep within
someone who never made it yeah
is it like the experience of coming out
where you describe this incredible
sensory overload and you know you can
smell the moss and the sunlight has
never been brighter
is it like having been to the cinema in
the daytime because
for me that's i think as close as i'll
ever get in my life yeah
yeah yeah i fell to my knees i kissed
the uh
all of it you know brian blessed says
that when he came down from
mount everest there was so much sensory
overload for him that he could see the
molecular makeup
of flowers when he looked at them you
could see the
cells of his hand yeah that's he said
his eyes were so
heightened in their their clarity
degrade
the quality of truth you're getting from
tim here
with your brian blessed [ __ ] back to
andy's side is it like when you come out
of ikea after shopping
keep it observational yeah
um there's a great word that i love
which is associated
with caves which is baron schliff
and this is a word that means the smooth
polished surfaces
of a cave wall caused by the fur of a
passing cave bear
this is the story it's believed that
cave bears they wallow in mud
and they do that so they can loosen
parasites that are on their fur
and the solids that are contained in the
mud in connection with the
hair that they have as they pass wool
acts like a sandpaper
so after time and time and time again it
smooths the rock wall
into this polished surface and it's a
surface that you can only get polished
if done by the specific method of a bear
doing it so yeah
buried in schlichter wow yeah and when
did brian blessed tell you that
oh that's so cool that sounds like a
german thing it sounds like yeah it
sounds like an obscure
german gentleman yeah
there's a cage in slovenia which has a
train insider which is so much fun
the postogna cave and it was designed to
replace the sedan chairs which were the
original means of getting around the
cave
they were for royals obviously only but
um when these caves were discovered it
was the mid 19th century and you know
millions and millions of years have
passed in the cave when they were
unknown
and so yeah they then got saddam dance
then they got a train which was
hand pulled so victorian tourists would
visit and just be pulled along by
laborers and then eventually because
it's so horizontal in the cave they've
built a
little mini disneyland inside it
caving was a different experience wasn't
it to having read some of the quite
hardcore experiences of cavers today
getting carried down in a sedan chair
did not feature anywhere
no i'd be up for it it did it it does
sound quite
dangerous andy evis i think is sort of
this he's the greatest legendary yeah
he's the great
spelunker of our age and he was the
first person to explore this good luck
cave actually
and he just such mad stuff happened like
at one point there was a huge flood
and they got trapped deep inside a cave
and one of the people on their team had
to do this extremely long free dive
which they call a self-rescue where you
know you just have to swim
down under the flood and swim and swim
and hope that you get out
and i think a photographer split his
thigh open and they had to trek
overnight
through the rainforest when the doctor
arrived to fix his leg a tree
fell through the roof of their camp just
and landed just next to him
had they all got fever from rat poison i
think is that was that the thing tim
they warned you about apparently
everyone's feet get eaten away by
gross bacteria man your feet have taken
a beating tip
between space and cage that's yeah
that's why the skin falls off there's
nothing to do with the
yeah the pedicure you get from space
it's the raptors
yeah we thankfully didn't come across
any any bears or rats
on our caving expedition um
absolutely yeah yeah you did have that
didn't you where you went through
somewhere on an early caving
adventure you went through a narrow
tunnel and
then you read the directions yeah just
later on
this was back in the highly
irresponsible days um
of my twenties when we were just uh we
were actually rock climbing and ab
sailing a lot and kayaking at the
weekends in wales and we saw a couple of
people just pop out the side
of the the rock face and stop speaking
to them they said this area
is riddled with caves and so that's it
next next weekend we'll do some gaming
then
and literally kind of had a couple of
maglites each and
um and a kitkat and i got off we went
into this cave complex with uh a rough
sketch of of what it was a
literally a photocopied couple of pages
out of the guidebook
and um and it wasn't until we were about
two hours into the the cave
having gone through these very very
narrow presses
that dave my friend read the second page
of the guide and said if there was a
noticeable
flow of water through this thing called
the pebble flow you should abandon the
cave immediately because it's prone to
flooding
and it had been pouring with rain
outside and the pebble crawl was about
45 minutes back from where we'd come and
the water had been
up to our elbows as we went through this
thing so
we suddenly realized we uh we were
needed to get out of this thing in a
hurry and by the time we got
back to the pebble floor we had about
three inches
of where we could breathe along this 20
foot
kind of tunnel so we were going through
there with our chins tilted upwards
and we were so close to being trapped
down there
quite how irresponsible we've being
after that and
we treated that environment with a bit
more care and respect and
came back the following weekend a bit
better prepared but
uh that was a good lesson that was a
good lesson and it's reading page two of
the instructions that seems to be a big
thing
it is kind of like when you get to the
end of cooking something and it says
serve with the pre-prepared grilled
vegetables from page
72. yeah i think what
[Laughter]
yeah or leave to set in the fridge for
48 hours yeah
yeah yes we're arriving in 10 minutes
basically there's nothing
that exciting that you can tell tim that
we can't compare it to something much
more boring
[Laughter]
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that
is andy my fact is that chicago has an
alcoholic spirit which tastes
so bad that its own founder used to
boast that only one in 49
men liked it
and who was who was the one yeah
it was so this is a thing called jetsons
malort
founded by a man called carl jepson and
uh it's a kind of spiced liqueur which
is flavored with wormwood
and yeah mostly mostly known in chicago
but it's drunk in a few other places
but i've tried it and it is really
really an acquired taste and the back of
the bottle had this label which
said most first-time drinkers of jepson
malort reject
our liquor um during almost 60 years of
american distribution
we found only one out of 49 men would
drink it
it is rugged and unrelenting even brutal
to the palette
the whole label is just trying to say
you're not gonna like this yeah
wow i'm amazed that you've tried it andy
you're a man who
has an extra squeeze of lime in his soda
water on a wild night out
yeah i've actually tried it as well
i have you yep i tried it on the last
night of our us tour for fish
when we were in washington washington i
couldn't remember it yeah yeah yeah
remember if we both had it on the same
night yes yeah it was
right the way we tried together with
each other well this is i mean this is
how pungent and painful it was
i don't remember andy being there when i
tried it and he clearly doesn't remember
um it's horrific i i mean it's utterly
disgusting i am one of the 48
and i agree with tim i want to know who
this one guy is actually i know who this
one guy is
one guy that we know who drinks it is a
comedian who's been on our show
john hodgman who has it as his preferred
drink really because i read a quote from
john saying it tastes like pencil
shavings and heartbreak so
that is a bizarre preference for him to
have
but he just loves that i think it's such
a wonderful description
pencil shavings
how would you describe it i would just
say it's overwhelmingly better
but they've asked more eloquent people
than me
so they they don't have many employees
it's quite a small firm jackson's malort
but they have in the past they've asked
the public for slogans
and the slogans that have come back have
been things like malort
what soap washes its mouth out with um
malort kick your mouth in the balls and
my favorite these pants aren't going to
[ __ ] themselves
stunning we've got to employ that person
for our pr yeah
so it's got wormwood in it right yeah
similar to
absinthe and which has a bad reputation
wormwood and maybe unjustifiably
do you remember when we were all younger
and everyone claimed
that absinthe was illegal was the first
claim and the second claim was that
the wormwood in it that's now illegal
makes you hallucinate and sends you mad
mm-hmm does everyone have fun yeah dimly
yeah
but none of it's not true no although it
was banned for
years because people thought it was true
so it was absence was what you know all
your
van goghs and all your crazy artists and
writers of the 19th century were
drinking especially in france
and it was thought to be responsible for
the degeneration of french
society i think and it
was it was banned in france and the
justification was that worm would send
you mad and gives you hallucinations
and it was only in the 1970s that we
showed
that it's in such tiny amounts it can't
do you any harm
in it and it's just the fact that
absinthe is [ __ ] strong
and full of alcohol but the us didn't
lift the ban until 2007.
wow um do you know what the russian for
wormwood
is it's chernobyl
so chernobyl was named after the
wormwood fields
the the town and the nuclear plant were
named after the wormwood fields around
it that is the russian word for one word
yeah oh so if you were to do this
podcast in russia
and say wormwood doesn't do you any harm
then
that's not the truth and you'd have to
be very careful with the translation
tim you're a cocktail mixer once right
uh yo
a long time ago i wish i'd come across
my lord then
because i think it would be hilarious to
have so fast for the customers
were you a mix what's the word were you
a um
what's tom cruise
yeah it was an ordinary pub it was
called the mag's head in genesis it was
already pub
but come thursday through saturday it
was just heaving it was a great
sort of young person's place to go and
drink and
we turned it into a cocktail bar for
those nights and and uh olivier
barbadette was at the french head
barman and um it was all yeah we're
proper there black tie waist black
waistcoats kind of thing so quite a sort
of french influence to it
and it was all flat ending and we would
be spinning bottles we'll be throwing
glasses
catching ice cubes down there it was
just brilliant
so much fun um we'd practice for hours
outside with empty bottles smashing them
all over the place and having to
sweep up all the all the debris before
opening hours and then then off we'd go
so it was a huge amount of fun but um
they've never come in handy just did
that training ever sort of
later on the iss was there a moment i've
tried i'm trying to think
i'd love to say yes but i honestly can't
but though in terms of coming in useful
it's got absolutely no
no use whatsoever i guess if you throw a
bottle of water over your head on the
iss it just keeps going in the opposite
direction
yeah you just lost your water yeah
exactly hey do you know who the first
ever
tender was as far as we know a sort of
documented case of it
um is it a famous person who we would
have heard of absolutely not
no right okay yeah this will be a
tougher guess
all right so let's start starting the
alphabet a aaron
no head down towards jay and you'll be
more there
jerry the professor thomas and
he was an american bartender and he
wrote what was the first ever
book of fancy drinks basically it was
called
the bartender's guide a complete
encyclopedia of plain and fancy drinks
and he used to go around to different
bars all over america
and he was the first to do tricks with
spinning of the metal
canisters that you would mix a drink in
and and he would set them a light and he
would transfer the flame into another
glass and
but yeah so um we know who kind of the
first person was and one of the
things that he put into his cocktail
book was the tom collins
which i didn't realize was there's this
hoax in america
called the tom collins hoax have you
guys heard of that it used to be a game
where
you used to say in a bar if the four of
us were in the bar i'd say andy have you
heard that guy tom collins who's been
talking smack about you
and you'd say like what everyone be like
yeah tom collins said this thing and the
idea was it was a hoax where you
convinced someone
that tom collins was talking about you
and spreading rumors
making you furious and that's what
pranks used to be back in the day
so it's like it's like stripey paint
isn't that sending someone off the
stripy paint
it's kind of like that is that a thing
yeah because it should be obvious
it's no it's not a thing dad there's no
action
dan's getting up to get something you
get stripy toothpaste why don't we get
straight
surely you know that it's actually an
unknown argument that's a really really
good thought
he's out wishes what do you guys think
is the most popular spirit or the most
commonly drunk spirit
on earth or in the universe
i love that we have to specify on
earthquakes
we do i don't know which one it is
i don't know um gin is fairly
i'll popular whiskey uh lots of big
whiskey fans out there
nice i mean you're not gonna get it
don't think i'm dumb i get it it's
baiju which is a chinese liquor
which basically is not drunk outside of
china but is the most commonly drunk
spirit in the world is that by the
jewels
are you saying like it's a joke and
alcohol and by being white
the word yes but it's a it's a spirit
it's a spirit yeah
yeah it's distilled yeah have you tried
it i think i have yeah i can't
i it sounds familiar enough that i feel
like i must have it sounds i texted my
friend yesterday who lives in china and
says it's
resembles paint stripper but it's very
popular but it sells more than whiskey
vodka and rum
combined worldwide and
it sounds great there's a museum in
china uh how do you pronounce it dan
china [ __ ] you
[Laughter]
bye joe guide you there's a fine jewel
museum
in china which shows a reenactment video
of when
it was when it went global which i think
it's question
question mark over whether it's gone
global but apparently it went to the
world fair in san francisco in 1915 and
all the americans were sneering at it
and this weird
earthenware jar filled with this chinese
drink and it made the chinese delegate
so nervous it was smashed all over the
floor
and then the scent of it was so seduced
everyone that it won the prize that year
and has gone down in history as
everyone's favorite spirit oh wow
yeah we've all got our bottles right
here haven't we
yeah um have you heard of the six
o'clock swirl
this is a thing heard of it no no so
this was a thing that happened in
australia okay um and we i think
australians are sort of a kind of big
drinking country you know they
they like their drink there was a rule
in place of law in australia and new
zealand
um that you had to finish your drinks
last orders was 6 p.m pretty much every
day as far as i could tell
and this lasted from 1916 when there
were restrictions because of the war
until 1967 all licensed establishments
had to stop serving
at 6pm incredibly early so the 6 o'clock
swill was the final hour of
legal drinking in australia between 5
and 6 pm
everyone would leave their work and
immediately go to the bar
and start getting drinks in hand over
fist drinking as much as they could
until 6 p.m and then bang the bell rang
and that was the cut-off
yeah and it was mayhem what year was
that yeah
it ended in different regions of
different years in australia but the
final one
to scrap it scrapped it in 1967.
yeah quite late my parents might
remember it then well actually so my
my parents would have been my dad would
have been 10 roughly at that time
so he remembers it very well um
weirdly the last time i was in australia
i was talking to my grandfather who was
there
in that period he's austrian but he'd
moved over at that point and
he was telling me exactly about this
thing and the problem was is everyone
after 6 p.m had to drive home and they
all did it drunk as hell
and because you'd had to drink so quick
that you felt really ill
and he said many many days would he stop
at a traffic light it was just people
including him
rolling down their window vomiting out
the window at a traffic light
and then continuing on to drive home so
yeah it was definitely
definitely a thing and
we we are gonna have to move on in a sec
i've just got one more drink yeah
uh have you heard of whiz key
okay this is a drink that was invented
by a british entrepreneur in uh
2010 he's called james gilpin and wizki
is whiskey made using
the sugar rich urine of diabetes
patients so
if you have diabetes you you have a lot
of sugar in your urine sometimes
and um he gilpin has diabetes himself
but he
he contacted various elderly volunteers
including his own grandmother and
extracted
the sugar molecules from the urine added
them to the mash stock to accelerate the
fermentation he didn't
sell it he said this was illegal
but he said he was trying to make you
know be thought-provoking about how we
use
the resources we have and that actually
as obviously on the iss
everything is recycled to become clean
drinking water i thought it's not as
silly an idea but maybe it might be as
well
yeah we we certainly don't uh go making
whiskey up there but um
you're yeah you are reminded every day
of course that you're
drinking your crewmates urine that's
been that's been recycled in about 24
hours
um yeah turn around
if it was yeah did your mind ever play
with you tim where you think
you can like you can taste something
that's not there like you're like is
this definitely
filtered i i just never drank pure water
it was i always
mixed it with something it was either a
tea cup of tea or it was a fruit juice
or something because
to drink the pure water was it was a
little bit too close to the bone
this is why you didn't need to go to the
liver in your entire space because
you're refusing to drink
six months
you need more diabetics up there yeah
clearly get diabetic
sweeten the urine you don't even need to
put sugar in the tea
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hi everybody just wanted to let you know

go to thegreatcoursesplus.com
okay on with the podcast on with the
show
[Music]
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that land rover
once released a manual which was edible
so if you got lost in the desert you
could eat it
to survive this was
uh 2012 they published this they
published in dubai
it's called the land rovers edible
survival guide and
the idea was is if you got lost out in
the desert this manual could tell you
things like how to build a shelter
how you could signal for help but then
it became more practical as well
the metal wiring on the inside could be
removed and you could use it as a
cooking skewer
it had reflective packaging around it as
well so that you could use that to make
signals so that people could see you
but the greatest thing of all is that on
the front it says in case of emergency
eat this book and if you did eat it
according to the people who made it the
ink and paper
which was both edible had the
nutritional value of a cheeseburger
so you were actually getting a good meal
out of it yeah
right so you need to have read it all
first
yeah you've got to be so careful do you
think which bits are you not going to
need yes you don't need to know about
the air conditioning system that can
that can go that's a snack
brilliant but such a clever idea such a
i love survival guides and
an edible ones is the most practical of
them all
if um if you're desperate it is if only
you'd had that inside your cave tim you
could have lasted
hours more absolutely i know it reminds
me in the army we used to get given uh
these survival kits as well
and they had tallow candles um so it's
edible candle wax and it was a similar
similar thing but if push came to shaft
and you were starving and you decided
that
warmth and light and heat wasn't
essential you could just
start munching your way through this
tallow candle
instead i tried some
and it was just disgusting i mean you
just chew
on this candle for ages and it wouldn't
i mean no matter how much saliva you
could generate
it wouldn't go into a nice voicemail it
was just horrible
horrible wow is it just kind of fat talo
it is isn't it is it animal fat
yeah i think it is yes yeah but they did
what was the wick made of in the candle
was that licorice or something so you
could
no i think that was i think that was the
one that you weren't supposed to eat
it's got to be practical as well yeah
you've got to light it
also apparently sometimes it's a bad
idea to eat if you're lost in the desert
because that's the process of digesting
food actually uses up a lot of water
so if you're really lost the idea is
that maybe you should
limit yourself to drinking and also
a page a day yeah exactly a line of text
every few hours
but also you shouldn't drink in small
sips
which i think is quite useful because if
i were stranded in the desert i think i
would be really conservative and i only
have a few sips of water at a time
but apparently that means that your body
doesn't it doesn't launch the body's
process that causes it to store the
water
so it just loses it straight away so the
recommendation
is that if you're lost in the desert you
drink water maybe three to four times a
day in a big batch
and that's the way that it'll store it
and then you know
actually yeah yeah didn't know that yeah
that's very useful
they didn't teach us that you're in
survival training there you go
[Laughter]
um slightly less useful survival tip
possibly is that
you know how so this fact is about
something that's normally not edible but
that turns out to be edible
here's a fact about something edible
that you can use for non-edible purposes
which is that you can use doritos to
build a fire what
they're so covered in the sort of cheesy
flammable
dust that they go up quite easily
it's short-term fire it's fire lighters
rather than you wouldn't have an entire
farm
exactly could you clarify that because
we're gonna get very angry emails from
dubai yeah yeah
my dorito fire went out in two seconds
i mean a lot of things can set on fire
can't they yeah true
yeah but i thought for a second maybe
you could start a fight with doritos by
rubbing one against them so that is
genuinely good sometimes if you open a
packet of doritos
have you noticed that there's nothing
but ash in the bottom of it
um do you guys know the us military's
universal edibility test i don't know if
the british military has an equivalent
but no well this did they ever teach you
tim like if if you're stranded anywhere
how to identify stuff that's poisonous
or not
oh well they told us you know put a bit
on your lip for 10 minutes
and then if your lips not tingling and
numb then go under the tongue
for 20 minutes and you do this
incremental process and
and eventually there's small quantities
you get stomach ache and eventually you
can work out whether
your body can tolerate it or not bang on
they've nicked it off the bricks yeah
yeah so you do get taught that it's a
very long process isn't it it's a stop
it's very long yeah especially the bit
that's like swallow a tiny bit wait for
eight hours
[Laughter]
between yeah yeah um i think the italian
army is the only
modern one which gives out alcohol in
its standard military rations
to its troops the guardian ran a huge
piece about
you know all sorts of different
countries and the sometimes
very stereotypical things they have so
the french army they get deer pate
cassoulet with duck confit uh small
caramel pudding
mini baguette um they go
super french um but the italian army i
think
is the only one out of the ones they
tried which gives you a shot of alcohol
uh 40 just to keep your spirits up i
guess fantastic
i know the french fashions they used to
give out a small one of those kind of
airline bottles of red wine
they probably stopped doing that now but
i just
put in comparison the british you know
when we get biscuits a b
i have no idea what the a b stands for
but they're just is it is the rations
are just dreadful designed
to bung you up to stop you having the
need
to go to the loo so frequently when
you're on exercise or digging trenches
or
things like that so did you get um did
you get mini tobasco
with your russians yes yeah the us
ration packs there yes mres meals ready
to eat um and they've got these
brilliant
uh chemical heaters um so you know the
bridge rations we're still on uh
lighting your your solid fuel tablets
and you have a little stove to warm up
the water
but uh no america you just you rub the
chemicals together break the package
packages and uh heats up chemically uh
and it gets really really hot
so it's a fantastic way of having a meal
ready to go and they
give you a little uh tabasco sachet in
there or bot small bottle of tabasco
that's so sweet well they're not telling
you is they're all told to keep a dorito
in their back pocket
that's the key um my favorite survival
meal
that i learned about was one that
shackleton had which i'd never read
about on his
antarctic expedition um the endurance
expedition he his crew at one point and
this was like well into it when they
were like we're gonna die now we are
stranded and lost
they were attacked by a leopard seal
which very occasionally do
attack humans and in fact i think did
kill someone a while back
um so they were attacked by a leopard
seal and one of the crew managed to
shoot it
not only that when they split it open
its stomach was absolutely packed with
completely undigested fish
oh wow so there's got a suitcase of fish
it's like a pinata
a stinking pinata
i found um there's a classic survival
guide book
which is the sas survival guide and it
was written in 1987 by a guy called john
lofty wiseman and this has sold millions
and millions of copies and
he's quite an amazing character
generally to read into his story he's
the guy who helped set up the sas
counter-terrorist team
and they were the ones that went into
the iranian embassy
when when that big incident happened so
he was he was part of the people that
set that up and he wrote this book
which is just packed with very good
useful advice
but also strays into territories where
you think when is this ever going to be
a part of my life for example how to
kill an octopus
is a section and he gives you three
options of how to kill the octopus and
a couple of them are quite normal sort
of using a knife stab it between the
eyes or bang it against the rock
but one of the options is to thrust your
hand
inside of the octopus into its flesh
hood
and pull by its innards and flip it
inside out like you would
like a washing club you know like a
marigold
i read in the article being pulled the
other way out
that's that's one of his sort of basic
options for you to
to kill an octopus so and then it has
you know lots of like basic stuff about
how to lure animals and pray in and get
water and so on but yeah
pretty spectacular it must have been
absolutely terrifying at children's
parties
turning up with his octopus club puppet
it's amazing he said that i've actually
got that book on my bookshelf because
i think i was about 13 or 14 and it was
given as a present i
loved it i absolutely loved the sas but
you're absolutely right and i remember
as well
and i haven't read this you know for 30
plus years
but there there was a bit in there that
said about how to stop a car
if you're going down a hill the brakes
fail and the handbrake fails
you could use a wall and just scrape the
car along the side of the wall just laid
down
and i was thinking when am i ever going
to need it but
it's something i've remembered i
remembered all of my life and i'm 48 and
i haven't yet been going down a hill of
all the brakes affair but i'm waiting
for that moment when i can
i can scrape my car along the wall and
think
thank you lofty thank you for saving the
day
fingers crossed you are you're gonna
trust a guy whose name is lofty wiseman
aren't you yeah
i'll do anything he tells me that's very
good
um we should probably wrap up in a sec
guys um
sure um this is slightly off the topic
of survival but it's just one more thing
about food
and sort of food for survival and
food preservation um so the first ever
tin cans of food
they were invented in the early 19th
century and get this
every single one of them had spent a
month at a temperature of at least
90 degrees celsius before being sold a
solid month
why 90 degrees that's going to be
overcooked i i think they would have
been quite overcooked yeah i don't think
there were delicacies inside they were
made by a man called brian duncan
who was a northumbrian engineer and that
was the quality control
for it to spend a month at about 190 to
100 degrees celsius
really i just find that amazing i can't
imagine
just to cook everything out of it that
could do you any harm what's the yeah
the canning process i i learned a bit
about that when we were looking at the
food for
going up into space and we ran it as a
competition to kind of design a meal for
the day with all the right nutrients and
minerals and
um and vitamins and then the winners of
the competition got to cook it with
heston blumenthal
and he didn't want to tin the the food
because it's just from a chef's point of
view it just destroys it this whole
canning process um yeah like you said
you have to have it at this
really really high temperatures but we
ended up having to having to put a lot
of it into cans anyway
um he went through 25 different types of
bread
before he found the the ideal bread that
could make a bacon sandwich
and you could pop the tin after you know
18 months and it would still
be fresh buttery nice and warm and
tastes like a good
bacon sandwich but the bacon looked
disgusting
because it and you know everything
everything in the whole canning process
is just uh cooked to oblivion to
enable it to last so long but the other
of course the other one is the
is the irradiation from the the foil
pouches that we have
and that all gets um you know put
through this process but
again for long-term preservation so it
doesn't really matter what you do none
of the food is
is going to come out of a packet or a
tin
tasting particularly good hence the
tabasco yeah pest and bloom and salt
would
not survive long on the iss if he's
refusing to touch anything that has to
be tinned
and is it true tim that doritos are not
actually allowed on the iss because
it's effectively a small bomb as a fire
hazard
well they they were but after listening
to these podcasts they're probably going
to get removed from the list
so we'll have a lot of angry astronauts
now
who won't be about their doritos in
space
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening

=347
[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four undisclosed
locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with anna tashinsky
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again we have
gathered around the microphones with our
four favorite facts from the last seven
days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with fact number one and that
is james
okay my fact this week is that in 1978
chess player victor kochney accused
anatoly karpov
of cheating using an elaborate
yogurt-based code
[Laughter]
was it an elaborate yoga or an elaborate
coat um
i actually added that word elaborate to
kind of make it feel a bit better than
it actually is
um no it's it is an elaborate yogurt it
was blueberry wasn't it
how basic are the yogurts that you're
using today you think blueberries
elaborate
the only thing about standard greek is
elaborate i've read some places that
it's blueberry but some places that it
might be even more elaborate bilberry
yogurt okay that actually that really is
yeah
but basically what had happened was um
we'll get on to
everything that was happening around
there at the time because it was an
extremely controversial match
um but kapov was just playing chess and
then suddenly someone brought him a yoga
and no one knew that they were gonna
bring a yogurt normally you would have
your
snacks at very specific times but
suddenly they just brought him this
blueberry or bilberry yogurt and then he
made a really good move
and coach knight who for various reasons
was quite suspicious
thought that this must have been a code
and whatever the flavor of the yogurt
was going to be
that was telling him what kind of move
he had to make
and then coach knight later on he did
say that it was a joke and he was trying
to
um sort of parody the fact that people
are always blaming each other of
cheating
but the truth is that he definitely did
make the accusation the officials took
it seriously
and they changed the rules to say that
everyone had to decide what snacks they
were gonna have before the
game started and they had to have them
at certain times so
so it's not the idea that maybe he wrote
something in the yogurt
in in billboard oh if you drizzle it in
honey
so basically this was 1978 this guy
coach know he's a great
great chess player possibly the best
chess player never to become
world champion but he had defected from
the soviet union
and the reason he defected is because
the soviets had decided to
give other people a chance as their main
challenges and not let him do it so he
decided this i'm getting out of
there
and so he went to live in europe
eventually in switzerland
but because he was so good he was still
like the main challenger to kappa
and so they had this game but the
soviets were trying every trick in the
book
to stop him from winning so at first
they said that it wasn't allowed to take
place because he didn't have a state
as in he wasn't soviet anymore he wasn't
swiss yet
he didn't have a country and then when
um eventually the chess authority said
well
you know he has he's the best he's just
beaten a guy called petrossian
who was previously thought to be the
best so they thought okay well he's got
to take part
but the moscow newspapers refused to
name him they just called him the
opponent or the challenger
they wouldn't say what he was called and
his family was still in the soviet union
and the soviet authorities refused to
let them leave so they kind of kept them
hostage
because they were so upset about this
guy who defected and was
possibly about to become the world
champion wow god
so with the family pissed off when he
was just lounging around eating
blueberry yogurt mid-match
that's a bit casual for someone whose
family's got a gun held at them
yeah no i see that point i see that
point but um
he thought that possibly i think that by
becoming the world champion
they wouldn't be able to get at him
because he'd be world famous you know
yes there were other the match had other
accusations as well didn't it so
courtship brought his own personal chair
which he'd like to play chess in
fair enough you're sitting down for
several hours you want to be comfortable
but karpov's team they were the ones who
were suspicious now and they requested
the chair be dismantled and x-rayed
wow really yeah what were they expecting
to find in there
you wonder an extra chest piece oh it
doesn't work like monopoly does it you
can't just bring an extra bishop
theoretically if no one noticed you
could accidentally
drop an extra bishop on there wait i'm
sure it took both your bishops no you're
misremembering it
yeah but this one is
it's a different design to the other
bishops
well it looks like a bit of a chair leg
[Laughter]
the paranoia looking into this of chess
players of what they must go through i
mean
if you were playing a game it feels like
half the game is just looking out for
ways in which the other player is
cheating there's a yogurt there's a man
standing over there there's a chair
like you know which one of these are
giving him the details
the man standing over there is a really
good one are you talking about the
french team
in 2012 yes that's right yeah so in 2012
there's an olympiad in russia and there
were accusations that the french team
were managing to get the messages to the
actual player
and by standing in pre-arranged spots
behind the board
so i'm not sure of the exact code but if
i'm standing over here
then use your knight or if i'm standing
over here if there's a great move that
you can't see
whatever did they not all stand in the
exact order of which the chess pieces
are on the board
yeah one of them had a little miter that
would be really fun
why is your manager only walking
diagonally what's going on
why is there queen here
and they never proved that did they they
often don't sort of prove it
so that's still an accusation we should
say i don't think the french team were
found
guilty of doing that but it does make
you think is it not
after a point easier to just play the
game well
than to memorize this very presumably
quite complicated
code with standing formations the
problem is that computers are better
than humans now
right and so if you can somehow get a
computer to tell you what to do then
you're going to be able to be even the
best human
and so that's why cheating now is even
more of a problem than it ever has been
before
although i listened to a more or less
podcast the radio 4 show more or less
and they interviewed the
head of research at chess.com who was
saying it's so it's quite interesting
now
spotting cheaters who are cheating with
computers because
computers play in a completely different
way to people so he was acting like
anyone could tell the difference
straight away which i imagine we
couldn't but he was there you know you
can tell after a few moves if someone is
suddenly using a computer
and the key difference is that computers
don't
plan they don't have a memory of the
move that proceeded
and they don't have a long term strategy
and so
they when it comes to a move they act
like they've never ever seen the board
before and they just do what's the
exactly perfect move for that moment
whereas human beings
we have a plan and then we want to stick
to it even if sometimes circumstances
happen that mess with the plan
so for instance it's very unusual for a
human to willingly take back
a move in chess because if you've made a
move you don't want to attract it
a computer got no compunction about that
just do it when
when it wants to when it sees it's the
best move the thing about retracting
your moves
um with computers that's like where you
almost
go back to your previous position right
because
the retracting moves that you or i might
have a problem with if we were playing
chess
would be if i moved my knight to a place
and then
i took my finger off it and then i go no
no i'm going to take that back
right and that actually did happen with
the
one of the greatest chess players of all
time which was kasparov gary kasparov
when he was playing against a woman
called judith polgar
and she is probably the greatest female
she almost definitely is the greatest
female chess player that's ever played
and if she'd have beaten kasparov in
this game it would have been the first
time
that a woman had ever beaten a world
champion in a game of chess
uh and he moved his knight into what
would be a bad position
and then he took his finger off it and
he went no no i didn't take my finger
off it and he put it back
and then he ended up i'm not sure if he
won or tied the game
eventually she carried on she became the
tenth uh best player in the entire world
anyway
but that could have been such a big
moment of the first woman beating the
grand master
but yeah did you guys read about her
cheetah pogah she's
amazing so no she was her father was
called lashlow polgar
and he had three daughters and he
trained them all to be
chess players and it's one of those
stories which kind of
half sounds a little bit like you know
he's really forcing them to do this and
it's quite bad but then on the other
hand
they all loved it and whenever you
interview them they were all like oh
this is what brought our family together
we all absolutely loved it
and so his daughters um souza sofia
and judith all became grandmasters
eventually judith could beat her father
by the time she was five years old
at 15 she was the youngest person male
or female to be awarded a grand master
title
uh and then eventually she played
against caspar off and should have
beaten him but
wasn't allowed to because of that and
there was a great interview with um
souza when they asked her about playing
against men and she said that she'd won
loads of matches but she'd never won
against a healthy man
after every game there was always an
excuse i had a headache
i had a stomach ache there was always
something
well i think that's a bit eggs in one
basket training all three daughters to
play chess
if it was up to me i would train want to
play chess one to play
drafts and one to play snakes and
ladders and i would hope that
one of them in the field would become
the world champion yeah
the problem with stakes and letters is
it is literally all down to
look of the dice isn't it there's
there's literally no strategy there at
all a lot of a lot of people say that
it's just luck and there's no strategy
but i would say
actually i do remember when i played
against you as that guy stood in the
corner with a ladder in front of it
do you say that about snakes and ladders
i was reading this article that
really annoyed me because of what you've
said so about cheating and games it was
in the la times it was about whether you
should let your kids cheat in board
games
and it was written by this guy whose
four-year-old daughter
cheats at snakes and ladders by like
climbing up the snakes or jumping
forward to the ladder
wow and the gist of the article was you
should let kids cheat because
um they don't really get a sense of
fairness and ethics so they're seven
or eight and before that they're just
developing their creativity
but the question was framed at the top
as you know you're playing snakes and
ladders
she's cheating do you insist that your
children play by the rules
and then trounce them every single time
or do you let them cheat
and i was like snake's nadas is the one
game where a five-year-old does have a
chance of beating you
well it sounds like the dad is cheating
all the time that's why i never let my
little sister play me at snakes and that
is because she would have a chance of
beating me
actually i'm like no we're going bowling
so we're doing the intestinal strength
machine again
that was until she was about seven years
old yeah
um chess.com they have chess detectives
which i love
so they've got six chess detectives and
i didn't realize how big chess.com is i
mean it's absolutely massive this global
site
since march the number of accounts they
have closed for
cheating specifically is 85 000.
now obviously that might be some people
setting up new accounts after they get
busted the first time but that is a lot
of people
cheating around the world well
apparently it's 30
of chess masters such as blasters again
according to this guy exactly the people
you thought should really be a profit
but they quite often play matches on
there for money or tournaments
and 30 of them he says he's had to give
a warning to
and he says there's a system where you
give them one warning and you say
our computers have seen that you're
cheating and using a computer
and then he says the vast majority of
them don't do it again
but she said as though they're really
being noble and realizing they've done
wrong but presumably they just think oh
they've got detectives on this one in
2013 there was a bulgarian player called
bereslav ivanov and he was forced into
retirement
um due to a scandal he walked into the
arena and they wanted to search him for
an electronic device
and they said can you take off your
shoes and he said no my socks are too
smelly
so i refused to take off my shoes and
they said right okay well you're
disqualified and basically you won't be
able to play in any international
competitions anymore
wow jesus has he stuck with that has he
just said yeah he doesn't like
chess anyway yeah he doesn't play
anymore and that's maybe because he has
such smelly feet
it's possible that he has such love you
know he also i think in that same
tournament
though he had a few suspicious moments
and another one was where a competitor
spotted a suspicious bump
under his shirt and grabbed it which
seems like an incredibly awkward moment
if you've got that wrong
but said it was indeed an oblong object
similar to an mp3 player but then
somehow didn't catch it
i don't know if you ran away into the
crowd or something my torso he said is
so smelly
well that does that story in 1993 at the
world open where there was a guy called
john von neumann and he came in
and he was playing he was an unrated
newcomer and he was wearing headphones
the whole time
suspicious already and he drew with a
grand master in this tournament
this is an unrated player um and
everyone kept pointing out that he had a
suspicious bulge in one of his pockets
which appeared
to make soft humming noises and buzzing
sounds at real pivotal points in the
match
and so they got him afterwards and said
listen we think there's a bit something
dodgy going on here and
one of the tournament directors quizzed
him about chess
and it turns out he didn't even have the
basic
fundamental knowledge of how to play
chess when asked the basic questions
[Laughter]
i want to see the michael spicer the man
in the other room
you tit
stop the stop the podcast
hi everybody just to let you know we are
sponsored this week by hello
fresh yes hello fresh
is the meal delivery service that will
send you a box of
food to your door along with recipes
that will allow you to transform that
food
into something edible and not only that
but blooming delicious
i couldn't think of something that
wasn't a swear word then and i came up
with blooming and i thought that was
okay
lemon it is blooming delicious uh and
it's also blim inconvenient
it saves you time shopping saves you
time staring
at the cupboards thinking what am i

good one of them was a mexican tacos
thing and it had
chicken that's not made out of real
chicken and it was an absolute
revelation

a
fish okay on with the show on with the
show
okay it's time for fact number two and
that is
andy my fact is that imitators of harry
houdini
included howdini boudini
houdini howdini dini
hardini houdini bernardi
and cunning the jailbreaker
oh my goodness yeah there's a footballer
called tridini i wonder if he was
originally a houdini
probably probably it'd be very good in
the box that's a houdini joke about him
there we go um so this is
this is from a great article on genie
magazine which is a kind of magic
wikipedia
a wikipedia about magic that is and it's
just about all the people who didn't was
so successful
that just everyone started imitating him
um there was another guy called kola who
obviously didn't get into the main fact
because it doesn't sound enough like
houdini but his his catchphrase was
give my regards to the chief of police
which is just
such a great thing to shout as you're
escaping yeah
and often these people would advertise
in a way that you would definitely think
it was houdini right
yeah so like there was a guy who was
called the great alexander
that you would think well that sounds
like we like houdini he's fine right
but then i saw on wildabouthoudini.com
which is like a blog all about houdini
there was a flyer from this guy called
the great alexander and it just said in
massive letters
houdini and you would think by walking
past that houdini would be there but
actually if you read the small prince it
said houdini the great escape artist
would be outdone by the great alexander
we i think we should give a shout out to
wildabouthoudini.com
because it is unbelievable it's made by
this guy called john cox and he's
collated i think it must be every single
primary source about houdini ever like
every newspaper clipping every diary
entry of everyone who ever met him
it's so good you can just disappear into
it what's really nice isn't it because
you get the article and often you then
have to do extra digging but he's
he's put the picture of the newspaper
where it was originally
mentioned like for example houdini
didn't start off as houdini when he got
into the world of of
performance he was originally a trapeze
artist and he was billed as eric
prince of the air and you read that but
next to it he's tracked down the
original citation for it in an advert in
a newspaper to show that this existed is
a real thing
so he's really done his research for the
website yeah
he's got the houdini source of why he
left one of his very first jobs as
project the wild man of mexico
or prohea maybe which i think we've
mentioned before that he
played this role and his job was to
snarl
madly as raw meat was thrown at him and
so this is one of his early performance
acts
and he quit when he ended up being hit
in the eye with a slab of meat
and indeed he recalls this himself
there's a 1902
newspaper article what's also great
about him is that he wrote prolifically
columns for newspapers uh and he was
writing while he was in berlin for
oktoberfest in fact
and he said i couldn't look at my
trainer for three weeks because my eyes
were closed that caused me to become
tame because of this meat
he had his own magazine who did houdini
houdini had his own magazine called
kundera's monthly magazine
and it wasn't explicitly his magazine
but if you read
any single edition of it you would
notice that it was plugging houdini
it was writing malicious gossip about
other magicians
and criticizing all the people imitating
him it only lasts for about a year but
yeah
he did like to sort of have a go at
other magicians because he did find
himself constantly having his ideas and
his invention stolen
and he desperately wanted to make sure
that people couldn't use them but that
was really hard because if you were to
patent your invention
as part of the patent you would need to
reveal what the trick was so he could
never do that
he did get around it slightly there was
one loophole that he managed to find
which was
he had the chinese water torture cell
and
that was one that he prized a lot and
what he did was he put on a play
where that was in the play this act that
you would escape but he only put the
play
on to one person sitting in the audience
and then
he was able to copyright the act as
opposed to patent it so that no one
could then do it because it was
copyrighted as a play
that's so clever when he died he gave
his uh tricks to his brother didn't he
so his brother was also
a magician or an escape artist which i
didn't know
um he was called theo but he went under
the name hardine which is almost like
one of these
rip-off names isn't it yeah in fact it's
just about the only sound that is not
made by
those imitators and when theo died
in 1945 the props went up for sale and
they were eventually bought by david
copperfield
and they're currently in storage in las
vegas
and the way to get through them they're
in a big room
that's next door to a sex shop and you
have to go through the sex shop to get
to the warehouse
and there was an interview with hugh
jackman who went to see them and he said
that the way you get to this warehouse
is that there's a mannequin in the sex
shop and you have to press the nipple on
the mannequin
and when you press the nipple a special
door opens so you can go in and see all
of houdini's tricks
that is so good would it be about that
those tricks should never uh they
shouldn't exist really still should they
because
when houdini died he gave them to his
brother uh
to hardin and the stipulation was that
once his brother had died
that all of his stuff all of his magical
uh
effects and and physical things had to
be burnt and destroyed
so that's how that was meant to end
however jardine sold a lot of it
during his lifetime in the 40s to a guy
who was a houdini enthusiast called
sydney hollis ratner
and radner then put it in a magical
museum
the houdini magical hall of fame at
niagara falls
now in 1995 a fire broke out in the
museum
and completely destroyed the museum
however all of houdini stuff survived
despite the whole building going down so
it feels like
it doesn't want to disappear feels like
it wants to
continue on who really was escaping all
that time was it houdini or his
equipment
because if he escaped a fire maybe he
was a patsy to them
his tricks were quite interesting
weren't they um especially the escaping
things
he escaped from piano boxes from coffins
from ladders that he was locked to from
glass boxes he once escaped from the
belly of a whale
is that living or dead the whale it was
dead the dead okay
so good and when he was in leeds he got
into
a big barrel of beer you guys read about
this one
it's pretty cool it was at the tetley
brewery and they put him
in a massive barrel of beer and said
okay you have to
escape but houdini was t-total and he
became
overcome by the alcohol and lost
consciousness
and had to be hauled out by his
assistant
that's so good wow he used to do that by
the way
there was a level of pr about that where
the beer keg in particular would be if
it was a town that centered around
a beer industry he would use that as a
way of promoting and appealing to
everyone there
but if you're somewhere that doesn't do
beer let's say he's going to
um you know the home of melton mowbray
pork pies does he have to escape from an
enormous amount
the home of belton you mean melton
mowbry
yeah exactly i had a momentary loss of
confidence thinking is that an actual
town
but yeah imagine that because actually
the um the pastry case of a pot pie
is technically known as a coffin isn't
it so he is escaping from a coffin
and actually what you do is you put him
in the pie and you put the pie on a
conveyor belt going towards a massive
oven and if he can't escape
the pie in time he'll be cooked um
he has a connection to the first ever
episode of no such thing as a fish
can you guess what that is um okay what
did we do what did we talk about we
talked about
cern and the yeah large hadron collider
oh we talked about the um
philippa langley finding richard iii
under a car part i cannot believe you
guys have not mentioned the most likely
cards from episode one
we recorded the whole thing uh locked
inside a cage
on it yeah that's what happens
right before andy came here we had an
andrew hunter flurry
and andrew hunter murray and andrew
hunter
does he have something to do with
president garfield's anus yes
he does huh did he escape from president
garfield
no he did not he never went in in the
first place
um he was obsessed with murderers so
he bought all this paraphernalia he had
massive connection
and he was obsessed with uh john wilkes
booth who shot lincoln of course
and he was also obsessed with charles
gutto the man who killed president
garfield
he bought all of these things to do with
him like his phrenological analysis
and there was he was locked in ghitto's
death row cell
and escaped and that was one of the
famous tricks and in the process he
freed all the other prisoners on
the same death row as him well
apparently he freed them and then he
locked them up again in the wrong cells
i've one more thing about houdini's
habits at home
because he and his wife were extremely
close not as close as he was with his
mother which is another
another story for another time but when
houdini and his wife had an argument
he would leave he'd walk around the
block and then he'd come back
and he would open the door of the room
where his wife was and throw his hat
into the room right if it was thrown out
again
she was still angry and i guess he would
do it again
and if the hat remained in the room she
she'd come down
and resolve it what if the argument was
about him leaving his clothes hanging
around the house all the time
like a lot of the arguments in my house
you keep throwing your things all over
the floor
[Music]
he was actually one of the things he was
as famous for as his escaping
apparently and this is according to the
world by houdini website
was his needle trick and the east indian
needle trick involved him basically
swallowing a whole load of needles
and some thread and then he'd vomit it
all back up again but the thread would
be
threaded perfectly through all the
needles with a little knot before each
one
very impressive yadda yadda but the
weird thing about that
is uh talking of how close he was to his
wife she died
in a place called needles
[Music]
needles california that is the least
spooky thing i've ever heard it's like
i've
i've spent days searching for a houdini
based coincidence
that is the least impressive coincidence
since jeffrey the cat
at that mom goose that time
[Music]
um i have one last uh houdini imitator
to mention
uh this houdini impersonator was dubbed
harry houdini
and it was an orangutan from borneo who
lived in san diego zoo and whose real
name was ken
allen that was the name of the orangutan
his real name real name yeah
isn't it yeah his real name was thinking
a ragged language probably
it's what the zoo called him he was
called ken allen but ken allen was quite
a famous
orangutan i think very famous yeah for
the fact that he was constantly
successfully escaping from his enclosure
and no one could work out why
so he got given the name harry houdini
and they eventually had to bring in
mountaineer experts to look at the wall
to see if it was the crags in the wall
that he was
somehow gripping onto to getting out and
it turns out that that's what it was in
the end and they had to spend 40 000
eliminating all the holes in the wall so
that ken allen couldn't escape anymore
but um yeah time magazine listed in 2011
as one of the top 11
zoo escapes of all time and i refuse for
this podcast to ever end until we cover
the other ten
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
anna my fact this week is that when the
gates at summon lena prison in finland
are locked
it's to keep tourists out not to keep
prisoners in
wow this is prison
on an island just off helsinki just
really near helsinki
and it's an open prison but i was
reading an
article new statesman an article written
by helen lewis journalist who went and
visited
and she wanted to go and check out the
prison because it's quite famous
and they'd have to close the gates
because tourists keep on wandering to
the island which is a tourist
destination in its own right and trying
to get in
so prisoners allowed to wander out
people not allowed to wander in
but it's an amazing place finn is one of
these places that has lots of open
prisons so it's got 13 open prisons
i think about a third of their prisoners
are
in in these prisons and they can do
things like they have like therapy
horses and
they have saunas they have their own
little houses like
huts that are sort of like hostels that
they stay in with shared cooking
facilities
nice little sitting room with a big wide
screen tv
you can stay you can go to the mainland
if you want stay with your family
overnight if you ask for permission
it's it's a good stitch and as a result
it
has perhaps been no recidivism so
it's it's really interesting because it
seems like it's it's for people
often nearing the end of sentences where
they might have been in
high security prisons for the early part
of their sentence this is a way of
slowly acclimatizing them to life on the
outside so
so you're not just going straight from
maximum big house
you know 23 hours a day in a room to the
open world again because that's a
really juddering change um i did read
though that uh
and i'm quoting exactly here attempts to
escape are limited to a few dozen a year
which sounds like a lot to me it does
sound like a lot like an enormous amount
given that there are i think there are
only about 100 prisoners in there
there's a large percentage
yeah in 2013 um they had double the
number of
attempted prison escapes in any other
country in the world
wow but the idea is why would you try
and escape if you're getting towards the
end of your time
and you know that if you try and escape
then you're going to get put back in the
big house again
then yeah that's the idea right that's
why you would never in theory
make sense that you would never try and
escape yeah yeah
yeah yeah maybe it gets you more time
more jail time
in that same place because that sounds
like a pretty cushy deal
sadly i think you get sent back to one
of the normal prisons if you try and get
out
so it's not a good plan but i mean the
conclusion of most people
who look into it is that the
disadvantages of the odd escapes
not too dangerous prisoner are
outweighed by the advantages of the fact
that
places like finland and norway is
another one like this have a recidivism
rate of 20
so only 20 of prisoners after like i
think it's 10 years end up back in
prison
whereas here it's 75 percent and the you
in the us is 83
so it seems to be working and also
there's no challenge in an escape
because you get you literally get given
a key to yourself
yes the harry houdini of finland it's
not very impressive
[Laughter]
opens the door wanders onto the ferry
saves loads of money as well i don't
know how our prisons which are
very kind of unpleasant situations
manage to be also so expensive
but i think it costs whereas these ones
are quite cheap
so cost the equivalent of 160 euros a
day compared with
205 euros for a closed jail i guess
maybe those
those locks those locks cost money yeah
it'll be tiny things won't it remember
that fact james told us about when they
took
a single olive out of the meals on
airplanes that they saved
if you take a single bar out of a prison
uh gate
over the year that actually leads to
huge savings
um yeah yeah america used to have uh
rotating prisons which i did not know
that sounds fun and this camera is
unbelievable it's basically there's a
central pole
and there's a cylinder of cells all the
way around it and if the warden turns
the crank
i have no idea the mechanism that powers
this must have been pretty big the
prison
rotates and you get locked away you
basically don't have a door to escape
through
once the prison has been rotated oh
that's clever a bit like an assistant
it's exactly like an escape room yeah um
yeah there are only a couple left one of
them is called squirrel cage and it's in
iowa
and that was three stories tall but
that's not a functioning that's now a
sort of museum heritage thing isn't it
there are no rotating prisons currently
operating in america yeah that would be
too much like fun
because they were really dangerous the
it was too dangerous for the prisoners
as well
because let's well let's say a fire
broke out in
the prison or if the mechanism broke
down and it took ages to fix you would
have people
dehydrated not being able to eat not
being able to escape
yeah absolutely it was too chaotic so
they eventually had to abandon it i
assumed you were saying that people got
squished as the rotating happened like a
revolving door
oh no oh some your hand could be caught
as if it's suddenly if you were putting
your hand outside the bar and they
suddenly
very quickly rotated it they were saying
that hands would get lobbed off and
armed what yeah so it was it was a very
dangerous mechanism
you just need a recording that you get
at theme parks keep your hands and arms
inside the vehicle slash prison cell at
all times
and they won't get locked off wow
well that turned horrific very quickly
another very dangerous prison
that is also a kind of open prison is
this
extraordinary place san pedro prison in
bolivia
it's the largest prison in the past and
it basically is its own town
and but sort of not deliberately it's
through
corruption really so the inmates all
have jobs within the prison walls but
the only way in which it's now a prison
is that it's surrounded by guards
who won't let you out but the inmates
all have these jobs they rent
accommodation they live in there with
their families quite often
they get their money mostly from working
in the cocaine factory and size the
prison
and then they sell the cocaine to
tourists who come and visit the prison
and in the 90s i don't know if any
listeners were backpacking in the 90s
but apparently it was a backpacker hot
spot it was
this unwritten rule that if you went to
the past as a backpacker you get let
into this prison
and hang out in this really quite
dangerous
environment just lapping up the local
local culture
and the only reason they crack down is
because they used to offer tours around
the prison
and the government cracked down on this
because they thought the police would be
extorting the money from the illegal
tours
and they have politicians and stuff
inside they have elected leaders
in the prison who apparently enforce the
laws of the community mainly by stabbing
people
wow that's like a fit like only in the
hand or something you know you
you steal an apple you get stabbed in
the hand because you can't just send
someone to prison within a prison i
guess
no no okay it sounds like you're it
sounds like you're an advocate for this
place anna
there's a little bit especially when you
said that it's where you get the cocaine
and then you're like oh and this is also
the place where you lap up the
local culture which sounded like the
most obvious euphemism for
drug taking i've never heard in my life
you can lap it up you can sniff up the
local culture
rub the local culture into your gums if
you want to
it's the backpacking experience oh my
word
you guys of course know eamon de valera
the hero of
irish politics right sure but why don't
you just put the listeners at home why
didn't you quickly explain just
amy defender great hero of the irish
independence
movement he was locked up in
oh i think it was about 1917 or 18 right
um that's right
and the story he escaped right but the
story of how he escaped is absolutely
insane he was in for
possibly conspiring with germany that
was the charge so he stole a key
from the prison chaplain impressive he
got some candles
from the chapel and he pressed the key
into the candles right so now he's got
an impression of the key
but the problem is you need someone to
make the key you know you didn't have
the facility to do that you need to make
some settle to pour into the
thing right exactly so what they did was
um
he and a couple of i think fellow
prisoners they
sent the ira a christmas card on which
they had got someone to draw a cartoon
of a drunk man holding a big key
and the key that they drew on the card
was an exact copy of the impression he
had taken
from the chaplain's keep right so
basically
it was a code saying make a key that
looks like this and it'll get me out
the guards didn't notice they made the
key to the dimensions on the card they
sent it inside a cake
genuinely inside a cake christmas cake
probably probably
it got through it didn't fit the lock
they made it too small
as soon as he got out of the cake he
thought oh this doesn't fit
did they make it the size of the drawing
on the card
that's the biggest thing well they had
to do it again they had to send another
amusing cartoon this time with a kind of
celtic symbol
in the middle of which was a key i was
going to say did they have to wait till
next christmas or did they do it like
maybe as a valentine's card
or an epiphany card they were like oh in
ireland this is a thing we do big thing
yeah yeah
so then basically they had to they sent
the second cartoon they sent them back
another key
that also did not work so this time it
was too big
[Laughter]
the goldilocks the goldie unlocks key is
coming up
very nice eventually they just said so
they set a third cake to the prison and
inside that cake was just a blank
key and a set of files saying make your
own bloody key
and it worked just one weird thing on
prison like living within a prison is
that women
don't have to wear prison issue clothing
in british jails
and men do and that's been the case
since 1971
and it's because research finds that
people adhere to the rules better if
they're not actually wearing uniform
and i think the idea is that it sort of
humanizes you and so you're more willing
to obey the rules
in america famously quite strict penal
system the
inmates often do have to wear orange or
in fact when orange is the new black
came out
some prisons stopped their female
inmates from wearing orange and made
them go back to stripes because orange
had become
cool really not allowed to be cool
there is in um in norway as well at the
bastoy
rehabilitation center i don't know if
it's the pronunciation of that
it's got an o with a line through it i
think it is
they have a similar thing with the
guards don't wear uniforms
and they don't wear uniforms because
they say they don't want to create
sort of unnecessary division between
them and the
and the prisoners there who they don't
call prisoners they call um
residence because it just feels more
friendly it just feels like a cool dad
really that prison i've tried a bit too
hard
speaking of words that begin with
b-a-s-t
as we just learned
segway segway incoming the um
place in finland which is called uh
sewell menlina
is it anna how would you say yeah
that is like you said a famous tourist
attraction and it's because it's a
bastion fort
and a bastion four you guys might have
seen these it's where you have a
fortress
but instead of being a normal castle
it's in a star shape
you ever seen those you get them around
europe don't do you know why
you have star-shaped castles or why you
used to have star-shaped castles
is it something defensive is it to
confuse airplanes because they'll look
at the castle and think that that's up
because it's a star so they'll fly in
the opposite direction
brilliant that's such a good idea oh my
god that's so genius but no it was a
time before planes unfortunately
again but andy was pretty much there so
um basically it was in a time of
cannonballs
and if you fire a cannonball at a normal
castle it's gonna hit the wall and it
might make some damage
but if you fire the cannonball at a
surface which is not straight on which
is not perpendicular
it's actually slightly slanted then the
cannonball might just kind of hit the
edge of it and skin off the side of it
and so the idea was to make these
star-shaped forts
where if anyone was firing cannons at
you then it wouldn't
initially do as much damage so that's
why they haven't so
clever so clever is that the thing
called
i want to say a ravalin or it might be
connected to a ravalin i think it is
that yeah i remember reading that word
while i was
reading this fact but yeah because
there's i went to one of them in
cronberg when we were all on tour in
denmark there's castle crumbled which is
the setting for hamlet oh yeah and
they have got these star-shaped
fortifications outside and it's
it makes it yeah and that's a rambling
useless as for a javelin at a ravelin
right yeah that's the same guys
that's their catchphrase they got that
painted above the gates
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast hey
everyone this week's episode of fish is
sponsored by
babble yes babel is the language
learning company now dan i know you
already speak a few languages
but i bet you've always wanted to speak
a new language like french spanish
german italian or russian
yes all of them please well babel has
those and many many more
let me give you an example because i
have been using babble to learn russian
um what would you think if we went into
a shop
and i asked you if you wanted a sock um
oh god i don't know i i would assume it
was a sock
well you would be right it is a suck but
a stock in russian is not the same as a
stock in
english a sock in russian is some juice
so i'd be asking you if you wanted some
juice and that is one of the billions of
words you can learn
in all sorts of different languages if
you sign up to battle
that's right so if you want to sort of
travel to different countries and not
arrive as an outsider this is the
perfect tool for you to get there and
say
italy and sit at your table and say to
the waiter this pizza is blooming
brilliant

on with the show
[Music]
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show that is my fact
my fact this week is that one of
hawaii's biggest annual festivals
is devoted entirely to spam that's
uh spam the food um so
when they invite you to the spam
festival do they send you 5
000 emails telling you it's on every
year
extend your penis at the hawaii spam
festival
um yeah this i love this fact it was
given to me
uh in a conversation i had with a mutual
friend of ours jason haisley we were
chatting about it he said by the way did
you know
that they have the waikiki spam jam
which is this annual
spam festival that takes place in hawaii
and
it is a massively popular festival there
35 000 people attend according to their
website they have live bands playing
they have merch you can get spam
t-shirts shorts slippers they have craft
booths
can i just check sorry the t-shirt
shorts and slippers they're not all made
of spam
no they just feature a picture of spam
i'm guessing
right because that would be absolutely
disgusting and not survivor washed
i gotta say that when you sent round
this fact
i thought that it was a massive
exaggeration and
i've been to hawaii and they have lots
of festivals all the time
and i was like there's no way that the
spam one is one of the biggest
is which is what you say but it so is
it's
it's absolutely huge yeah and they are
obsessed hawaii
is obsessed with spam and they have spam
in places that i've never heard of or
dreamt of thinking they would appear
okay i need to get into personal details
well okay maybe i big that up too much
but you know um mcdonald's has spam
burgers and soda
burger king they have a spam burger and
yeah you can get them in all the local
dishes
everything spam is just integrated all
over hawaii
i think the most common way in hawaii
that it served is
quite nice because it's a sushi spam
and that's kind of a nod too they've got
a big japanese population
actually and also i think it's quite
nice because hawaii obviously has quite
a difficult
history with japan and now they serve
spam sushi
and it spam on top of sushi rice wrapped
in seaweed and it's called spam musubi
and that's where you'll usually see it i
think the um
the reason that spam is so popular not
just in hawaii but also throughout the
whole of the pacific
is due to the war isn't it it's due to
the second world war because
basically the japanese soldiers took
over a lot of these islands
and the people whenever they grew food
they had to give it to the japanese
soldiers and they were forced to do all
this stuff
and then when the americans came and
sort of liberated them
they didn't have any food they were just
kind of searching for any kind of food
they could eat but the american soldiers
had tons of this stuff
like they had spam coming out of their
ears the
american soldiers during the second
world war so they gave it to the
um to the locals and that's where the
kind of love of spam came from
yeah i just knew podcasts all about spam
which was great uh it's actually the
business insider podcast it's all
brought to you by
and it's about the kind of the stories
behind big old brands and anyways it was
like places that have had
a u.s military presence around that time
because spam was just kind of taking off
and places that have rice-based dishes
because apparently it goes very well
with rice
and then places with very hot climates
because it's canned and so it's like a
canned meat that you don't even need to
put in the fridge so it's like korea
guam the philippines
it's massive
um the founder was a man called hormel
and the firm that still makes it was
called hormel
um so his son took over the family found
j hormel
and he was interviewed by the new yorker
in 1945 just as the war was ending
and he said that there was a file called
the scurrilous file
which contained hundreds of letters of
abuse sent to him by soldiers all over
the world
saying i have to eat this spam and it's
disgusting
right and he said in this interview
maybe the verb
to spam will come out of this war
nothing would surprise me anymore
i.e he was saying that sending random
letters
or communications to someone who hasn't
asked for it
is to spam now that is not where the
word spam
as the for email comes from but it is an
earlier link
between the two concepts isn't that
weird it's so good that is saying we
should say what the
sort of received acknowledged fact of
where it comes from is
which is it was a monty python sketch
where
terry jones was running a restaurant
where the only thing that you could have
was spam
and would you like spam spam spams that
it just it was always difficult
and that's where the the people who gave
it its name took it from that
so but i think you're right andy i think
that's that's more of a
word yeah yeah yeah vehicle
monty python's ruined spam for a while
for a while hormel was really angry
about it
it was just getting popular again i
think people hated it in the second
world war
and then they started to enjoy it in the
40s and 50s there were these spam
girls weren't there these hormonal girls
who
the company employed and they were a
band they were this musical group
and they were worried because after
world war ii 90 of sales had been to the
army and they thought
oh my god we're going to stop selling it
and so the whole mill girls traveled
around the us
in 35 white chevys doing sort of singing
dancing
parades they had their own radio show
and
sales shot up they made spam cool they
were known as the spamets
sometimes this band
[Music]
and they were all dressed in like um
soldiers in
not soldiers uniform but like a
soldier's band
uniform weren't they and it was kind of
to remind you of the
of the wartime effort really yeah
but then also hormel sold chili con
carne
so he saw this thing with the hormel
girls working so well in america so he
thought okay i'm going to try and do it
with chili con carne
so he created a mariachi band
which went round uh mexico trying to
sell
hormel chili con carne how did that go
it sounds like it was less successful it
was less successful yeah
hormel's grandson was also in the arts
he still is
he's a guitarist and we all will have
heard his work he's called smokey hormel
and smokey is his birth name that's not
a nickname he was called smokey
sounds like the company was too used to
naming hands
and he's a he's a guitarist he plays
blues in country but he also appears on
albums by adele and by beck and
by yeah mick jagger and he's the main
guitarist on
what was johnny cash's big final major
hit
hurt the nine inch nails cover um kid
rock
joe strummer i mean he's done him all
right
mel have a new innovation they've got
a thing that they've just announced this
uh october
it's bacon-scented face masks all right
okay in a very 20 20 story they say it
has
is that to wear when you're asleep
because it's to
not like a face mask that covers your
eyes not a sleep mask i mean a
covety face mask you've been going
around in these covered times just
wearing a sleep mask
i keep walking into people how are you
supposed to keep two meters away from
people when you can't even see them
because i was thinking like a sleep mask
that smells of bacon is completely
pointless because
the smell of bacon basically wakes you
up doesn't it oh
no this is uh this is the thing they
claim it has and i'm quoting here
the latest in pork centered technology
um i don't know what the last thing in
pork centre technology was but it says
keep the delicious smell of bacon always
wrapped around your nose
not sure you can get a spammerita
along a similar vein which is a span
flavored cocktail and soho here in this
very capital
oh wow yeah get it uh jinju korean
restaurant in soho
and it's made of tequila mezcal agave
nectar pineapple and fresh lime
sounds absolutely delicious until you're
out this farm
um one more member of the hormel family
which we were talking about a few
minutes ago
is james hormel and he is the main donor
of the hormel center
of san francisco public library which
collects
all the importance of lgbtq books
from the last 20 30 40 years of american
history
and he also was the first openly gay man
to represent the us as an ambassador
so this was under clinton's
administration
and they needed a new uh ambassador for
luxembourg
and they chose this guy james hormel
obviously done a lot of philanthropy and
stuff and so he's a really good person
to
to have to do this um but the
republicans were just not having it they
were like we
cannot have an openly gay man
representing the united states as an
ambassador so there's a massive massive
argument
and to support their argument the
republicans
went to the hormel library and then
looked through all of their history
and then found a load of what they
regarded as very pornographic
things and they said look this man
supports pornography
he shouldn't be representing the united
states and it got really
really high up this argument until it
was pointed out that all of the works
that they pointed out were in his
library were also in the library of
congress
[Music]
yeah and then he became on
[Laughter]
have you heard of um mark benson
no andy you don't mean mark benson do
you i do
give it his full name mark i love spam
fenson
[Laughter]
we're going from one great
philanthropist to another hero
absolutely
absolutely and what links them a single
can of spam
[Music]
this is a spam lover called mark benson
he's from the uk
and in 2017 he and his wife went to the
festival
in t-shirts saying mr and mrs i love
spam benson
so his wife's owned it too and he's
chasing the hawaiian festival they went
to
yes they did and not only not only that
and not only has he legally changed his
middle name
to i love spam um but
i think if mark benson really likes spam
he'll change his first name to i love
spam
actually i think you can hide your
middle name can't you
that's a good point i mean he does have
a t-shirt
saying he's not going very far to hide
it
but they went to hawaii after they went
to the spam
museum which is where is that is it
minnesota it's at the
the headquarters they call it they call
it the guggenheim
very clever um but they
went to the museum they got married
there they got married at the span
museum
spam's brand manager got um got
themselves ordained in order to
officiate at this wedding
so it's the most spam themed wedding
ever
you are now spamming life
he said do you know why he said he
changed he loves spam so much
or he said he changed his name as a
tribute to spam
to his grandpa who worked in the spam
factory in liverpool
and to the war effort
okay quite right it's one way to
remember the war
i think that museum
they've got some lovely children as well
so we know at least they didn't need a
spam donor
okay i'm glad they let you talk there
[Laughter]
that museum is in austin in minnesota
and it sounds quite interesting they
have volunteer guides that are known as
ambassadors and they walk around
the spam museum with little bits of spam
on toothpicks which they call spam pulls
um did you guys hear about the 1990s
spam carving contest in seattle
no this was amazing it ran for 10 years
before being shut down
or maybe maybe people lost interest i
don't know but um
you were given two cans of spam one
plastic knife and 15 minutes
right you were allowed to bring your own
extra tools if you wanted to
but power tools and chainsaws were
explicitly banned
sorry two cans of spam and you might
want to use power tools
well you're absolutely right you would
have been you would have gone on very
well with the organizers james because
they said
that's overkill well sometimes it's hard
to open those tins isn't it so you might
need
a sort of pneumatic drill to get in
there i think they're wrinkles
aren't they uh they are wrinkles
i'm looking at them upside down
[Laughter]
there were so many good sounding winners
there was in 1994 the winner was
nude descending a staircase so i'm going
to carve that in spam in a quarter of an
hour are you sure that wasn't just
description of the person
i've not done a very good sculpture but
i am nude and i am walking down the
staircase
um other winners included jurassic park
spa spam henge very good and my favorite
a model of singer spammy winnette
singing
spanned by your man
[Music]
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening if you
would like to get in contact with any of
us about the things that we have said
over the course of this podcast
we can all be found on our twitter
account i'm on at schreiberland james
james harkin andy at andrew hunter m and
anna
you can email podcast.qi.com yep or you
can go to our group account which is at
no such thing or
our website no such thing as a fish.com
all of our previous episodes are up
there bits of merchandise are up there
as well go check it out
anyway we'll be back again next week
we'll see you then with another episode
[Music]
goodbye

=348
hi everyone james here now super quick
one before we start this week's show
and that is to remind you that the qi
elves have a new book
which is out right now called funny you
should ask
it is inspired by the why workshop the
thing that we do on radio 2
on the zoe bowles breakfast show every
week
where we answer questions that have been
sent to us by the listeners
and this book is full of amazing
questions such as
why is bacon the only meat that comes in
rashers why does orange juice taste so
awful after you brush your teeth
ah nice biscuits pronounced nice on
that that one actually works better
written down
um why don't cats and dogs have belly
buttons
uh is there a real person called gordon
bennett which way would a helium balloon
float in space
all sorts of questions that have been
bugging the listeners to zoey ball show
they sent them to us we answered them
and we have now put them in a book it's
called funny you should ask it's
available in all the places you get
books
and yeah just go and buy it okay on with
the podcast
[Music]
hello welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with anna toshinski
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones of our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order
here we go starting with you
andy my fact is that sir roger penrose
the mathematician who's just won the
nobel prize
once designed a theoretically infinite
geometrical patterns called the penrose
tiles
he then sued a toilet paper company for
stealing it and creating a theoretically
infinite toilet paper roll
[Laughter]
why would you need an infinite well i
suppose well hoarding toilet paper at
the moment aren't they
exactly one would be released yeah okay
so basically roger penrose he's a
brilliant brilliant mathematician in the
1970s he invented this thing called
penrose tiling
which basically combines two different
rhomboids
that can be repeated added to an item
never this pattern never repeats itself
it's really
amazing uh he just invented them for fun
as well he does lots of
stuff like this for fun he's fun as well
as being a mathematician
but a few years later in fact more than
20 years later actually after he
invented it
his wife was in the supermarket and she
saw some kleenex blue paper
and it looked just like his she thought
i know that pattern and
she bought some and she took it home and
the firm the phone which only that's
kimberly clark
they had come up with toilet paper which
copied it and
he sued wow he's suited successfully
well he won't talk about what happened
in court it was amicably
settled outside of court yeah the
condition was
you can't say roger penrose but they
gave you 20 million quid or whatever
whatever if he asked for like one pence
every time they used his pattern and
this is a pattern that never ever
repeats
then you could just get all the money in
the world the reason it's useful for a
toilet paper to have this pattern
is you want your toilet paper to be
quilted right
and so it's gonna have a pattern going
throughout it where you have some bits
that have got uh
indentation in some places that don't so
let's imagine
you have just a um a diamond that goes
throughout the entire row
so your diamond keeps coming up every
now and then and you have it on the
whole roll
once you wrap it around a toilet paper
holder
then the diamonds in some places are
going to be on top of each other
and so it's going to get thicker in
those places and it's going to be
thinner in other places which makes it
less efficient to package
now if you have a pattern which never
repeats then it means that you're never
going to have those kind of
indentations that kind of go over each
other so it makes it better
for a type of toilet paper if you want
quilted toilet paper
oh wow it's basically the perfect toilet
paper he invented but he didn't yeah
he didn't see it that way well that's
the thing with mathematics isn't it like
you just study maths for the sake of it
because it's beautiful and because the
numbers do amazing things
and you never know what the applications
are gonna be you never know what it's
gonna be
maybe you know infinite amounts of
energy for the entire world or just a
kind of nice bit of toilet paper yeah
because
he's denying the world the best version
of toilet paper that we could possibly
have he pretty much is
this was quite a big case at the time i
mean big big for 1997.
but the like marketing week wait what's
the case for 1997.
yeah no sorry well the court case is
famously usually very small in 1997. i
just couldn't think of much else
i couldn't think of much else that
happened tony blair came in in 1997
that's true
that's true but i remember not really
being on the front page of the
newspapers because it was all about this
toilet paper case
yeah the hong kong handover barely got
it mentioned in there okay all right
look we can all name something that
happened in 1997.
well done everybody but when it
when it happened uh there's a
publication called marketing week which
writes all about this
and they wrote this excuriating
editorial they said
and it was about quilted toilet paper
they said the decline of our island
kingdom
dates almost precisely from our ceasing
to use robust lavatory paper
shiny on one side and that on the other
and favoring scented absorbent toilet
tissue
a nation that dabs rather than stoically
abrades
its bottom has become a feat and can
never be at peace with itself
wow do you think that um do you think
the bottoms are now a bit bigger than
they used to be because they're not
slowly eroded away by thailand
100 i do think that yeah
but we don't did it say toilet paper and
turn fragrant because we don't do that
anymore
it did say scented absorbent toilet
tissue yeah you see when when was that
written
uh 97 19. there you go so those days are
gone i think the author of that would be
proud of where we've got to
because it it was a thing in the sort of
70s 80s 90s
slightly fragrant toilet paper often a
really disgusting pastel color
and we have reverted a bit to
non-smelling lu roll
in pure white so i think we're working
our way back to the splintery twigs of
the past
in our defense and these these tiles
that penrose discovered according to
our all of our good friend will bowen so
will bowen who's one of the qils
he studied mathematics at oxford and his
teacher was penrose as in pendleton he
was the head of maths when will was at
university oh my goodness uh and he says
that penrose broke his arm and that um
he was in hospital because it's quite a
bad break and it was while he was kind
of laying in hospital convalescing that
he
realized that these kind of tiles might
exist and he came up with that oh
i thought sorry pemeros broke his own
arm not wills
i thought that was a they had a big bar
bro he was a tough
tough professor but he was you know he
broke it in an infinite number of places
sorry go on penrose is lying in hospital
yeah he's lied in hospital and he just
has this kind of
idea that whoa what if what if you can
have
tessellating patterns so you can put
squares all after each other
and they'll they'll go together and
there'll be no gaps in between you can
do the same with triangles you can do
the same with lots of different shapes
but what he thought was what if you
could make things tessellate but they
never repeated and
came up with this idea of using these
kind of pentagon things
[Music]
so there are no gaps and also you only
use two shapes and they all they repeat
forever yeah usually they're shapes
known as kites and darts
because that's kind of what they look
like and you'll just
keep putting one next to the other next
to the other next to the other with no
gaps
but no matter how many millions and
millions of miles you go you'll never
have
repeating pattern and that was a
revolution in
actual floor tiling he's basically an
interior designer
a glorified interior designer actually
at the mathematical institute of oxford
um
one of the bits of paving is made of
penrose tails
he did so he wasn't the first person i
don't think to come up with the idea of
um trying to have a never repeating
pattern of titling but
uh people were doing this in the 1960s
and so people thought that in the end a
pattern of shapes that you're trying to
fit together without any gap has entire
together
the shapes will always end up eventually
repeating themselves and then
a bunch of mathematicians discovered
that there's a specific set
of 20 426 different shapes
so if you combine all of them eventually
they won't repeat
so they were like okay as long as you've
just got over 20 000 different shapes
stick them all together you'll never
have the pattern repeating
and all penrose did was took that figure
down to two
so and i don't know if he went down one
by one eradicating one shape after the
other
but yeah i tried this kites and dance
thing it's amazing that the
mathematicians were doing this kind of
thing right it's
it's a really easy to understand concept
just finding new shapes that fit
next to each other obviously quite
complicated mathematics but you always
think that mathematicians are just
working with all sorts of numbers and
symbols and stuff not shapes like that
that's why yeah have you guys ever heard
of marjorie rice
no imagine writing so there's a guy
called martin gardner you might have
heard of
and he um did like a lot of columns he
was like a popular mathematician
and he wrote once in one of his columns
that only certain types of pentagons can
perfectly tile
on a flat surface and they were all
known
so there's only a few different types of
pentagons that can tessellate
and we know what they all are and this
uh lady called marjorie rice she only
had
a high school education she's in america
and she thought
i bet there's some more and so she
started cutting things out like cutting
out these
pentagons and trying to find different
pentagons that would fit in this way
and she worked on it all the way through
her free time this was during
the 1970s all the time she had three she
would just try and come up with new ways
of working out pentagons that would be
able to tessellate
and when her husband and her children
came home she would hide them because
she was so embarrassed that this is what
she was doing
and she came up with her own notation
her own mathematics that would
describe these things and eventually she
sent the results to gardner and said
look i found all these new
pentagons which will tessellate and he's
like holy
this is like this is like new maths and
you've only got high school education
and he sent it on to some experts
and they saw her notation and they were
like oh this just looks like gibberish
but the more they looked at it the more
they realized that this was a new
type of mathematics that would tell you
these new kind of pentagons that will
tessellate
and she's discovered more than 50
pentagons that tesla wow
jesus what what do we do with that kind
of information
tiling your title but it's literally
just for tiling it's yeah cool
no it's really there's other stuff
there's really loads of things like for
instance the penrose ones
they later discovered that you can now
have crystals which have the same
non-repeating pattern and those crystals
have amazing properties like they're
amazing super conductors you can use
them to put on
like non-stick pans and stuff like that
so there's always loads of amazing
things that come out of these
things which you never think they're
going to come because it's a new
beautiful kind of maths
it's there's always something useful
those crystals they are so cool
so i think okay i'm probably going to
get the strongest quite complicated but
there was a crystallographer
called alan mckay who said that if you
put atoms at the corners of the penrose
tiles
and then you bounce x-rays off those
right the resulting
reflections form the shape of a perfect
crystal right
okay i think i understand that just
about
but that material was discovered
and called a quasi crystal so penrose
had basically
invented a new like inventing a new
species of animal or plant
and then that's discovered in the real
world exactly it's like you're um
it's like you're an author and you just
make up a new animal
and then they go around the corner it's
just there it's so
weird but i think this whole fitting
shape together thing might be the back
door into mass if anyone's looking for
an easy way to a nobel prize in math
because there's this woman who that
doesn't even have an education
even we understand fitting shapes
together penrose came up with
the basis of his idea when he was nine
he says
and you can what like what can you do
when you're nine he said that he was
having a chat with his dad
and he asked can you fit regular
hexagons together to make a sphere
as you do the standard kind of question
you ask when you're nine years old
and his dad said his dad said no you
can't fit regular hexagons together
until they make a sphere
you have to include some pentagons and
he said that was the moment he thought
that was a huge surprise to me
and that's the moment i realized i had
to go into the business of filling
shapes together
and this is another one of those weird
true things and that's the easiest way
to picture this is thinking of a
football
right you know footballs are designed
with little hexagonal shapes all over
them
but the only way you can make a football
a sphere is by having at least 12
pentagons
hidden in there somewhere so if you look
at a football each pentagon has
hexagons five hexagons around it isn't
it yeah that's a special kind of hatred
of matt parker isn't it the
mathematician yes
our friend parker yeah whenever he sees
a picture of a football
on like a signpost or something if
there's no pensacons on there
furious yeah really so yeah um
just on that we should say that it may
not be a complete backdoor to a nobel
prize because penrose's nobel prize
is for his uh work on black holes uh
where he
used maths to prove that the formation
of black holes is an inevitable
consequence of einstein's general theory
of relativity
so you can't just cut out some shapes
and then expect it
you have to prove black holes can exist
you can't just design a lure
and hopefully so roger penrose
is 89 years old and he has just won this
nobel prize
and for someone who's so incredibly
clever he was a bit
thick about understanding that there was
an award on the way
uh he got a message from his pa saying
that someone a strange person had called
up
and asked for his number and he says
later on
that's when he should have you know
smelt a fish it's his words he should
have seen someone who's coming
then someone called him up from sweden
and asked him to go on hold on the phone
so he waited and waited but then he got
bored so he hung up
so the nobel committee had to recall him
in order to get him his award
but yeah just didn't spot it coming so
funny wow wow
well there's did you guys see the video
of the people who won the nobel prize
for economics this year
no no no no it's the greatest thing to
come out of 2020 which i know is not a
difficult competition
like 1997.
[Laughter]
the nobel prize for economics went to
these two people robert wilson and paul
milgram
uh who sort of redesigned auctions which
is apparently this revolutionary
thing um and anyway usually what happens
with the nobels is they're decided in
sweden and a lot of the winners
are in america and so they call up
americans in the middle of the night
and there's often stories of them being
woken up in the middle of the night so
they called up these guys and they
called wilson
got through to him well at first they
couldn't get through because he switched
his phone off thinking it was a nobody
yeah and so they called his wife
and his wife woke up wilson said hey
it's the nobel committee i reckon i know
what it's about
so will's answer was like thanks very
much and then the nobel committee said
hey um i don't suppose you know your you
know your partner
from 30 years ago when you came up this
idea paul milgram we can't get through
to him
do you have any idea how we how we could
and wilson said well actually
we we live opposite each other um i told
me to go
not on his door and so there's cctv
footage from the door cam of paul
milgram's camera of this guy and he's in
his 80s wilson
this guy banging on his door like
ringing on the doorbell he's like
paul yep that sort of like really bad
connection
and he's just woken up in the middle of
the night like what yeah you've won the
nobel prize
yeah can you answer your phone and it's
just the most bizarre
i'm so annoyed by the way you told that
story because when you said he was
banging on the door i was just about to
jump in with
did he have no bell but then you went or
ringing the doorbell
oh no
stop the podcast hello everybody
just wanted to let you know that we are
sponsored today by expressvpn
yes expressvpn now what is a vpn
a vpn is something that sends your web
traffic
through an encrypted tunnel it is
and when you say it in that mysterious
voice it makes it sound like it's really
exciting
but actually it's more just very
convenient
so it's an app that will re-root your
internet connection through a secure
server and that means that your internet
service provider can't see any of the
sights that you're visiting
yeah like i said an encrypted tunnel
past the forest of security
and over the mountains of not knowing
which country you're in because that's
what it does isn't it it kind of
makes the internet think that you're
somewhere that you're not that is
correct
so if you want to enter this cave of
mystery
called expressvpn and keep your own

oh geez on with the show fun with the
podcast
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
anna my fact this week is that
washington state's department of
agriculture
recently lost track of the single hornet
they were trying to follow
specifically the asian giant hornet also
known as the murder hornets which
has been hanging out in japan and china
for a very long time but arrived in
america in
october this year and caused absolute
panic because
you know it's an invasive species and
also really hurts you get stung by it
and it destroys bee species so
the state department said uh we've got
to
catch one and we've got to catch one
that's going to lead us back
to the hive to the next and so they came
up with all these ideas of getting it so
they caught
they caught one hornet i think and
attempted to super glue or double-sided
sticky tape a tracking device to it but
that didn't work
and eventually they trapped one by
strapping a bit of dental floss round
its stomach
and attaching a tracking device to that
like a belt and then
chasing it um trying to face it down but
they lost it disappeared because they
fly
and they're fast and they're hard to
chase wow well they used these bluetooth
that was one way they lost it originally
yeah in an early experiment the radio
trans the transmitter they had attached
to it was a bluetooth one it only works
over a few hundred feet
so if it gets out of your range then
you're stuffed
yeah the chief entomologist did also say
it actually does fly a lot faster than
we realized we could run
and so yeah it was based on having to
keep up with this bit of signal
you need a judas insect they call it
to lead you back to the hive this is
what they they say it is
so to get your hornet in the first place
you leave out tomorrow's juice and some
rice wine which they love because it's
so sugary
and then you can trap it and that's what
it's called the judas insect
it's interesting because they come over
from is it japan or china or somewhere
from japan isn't it
so is that why they like rice wine like
because they used to in japan i
do not know whether it's japan's
specific food
i don't know whether the taste of the
insects are the same
it's good i like it i like the theory so
the big problem with these hornets right
is that the bees and so on in america
don't know how to deal with them at all
because they've not had them as part of
their
their life and the name murder hornet
is applied not because they're dangerous
to humans they are dangerous to humans
but but really it's applied
properly because of how dangerous they
are to the bees they can go into their
nests and basically just decimate within
minutes
they just rip heads off arms off
everything off
and it's a bloodbath in there they can
kill 40 european bees in a minute
like these are absolutely exact same so
people do call them
murder hornets but entomologists are
furious about that they do not like you
calling these murder hornets because
it's just
it's bad pr they're just on it they're
just animals they're doing you know
they're doing what hordes do and like
okay in america they are an invasive
species
in canada um but in japan they use them
to
work against pests as in if these pests
come into their fields they can use
these hornets to get rid of them
what kind of pets are you getting rid of
well i can only imagine it's lots of
bees because that seems to be what they
do but
um no it isn't i think hornets these um
hornets they eat all insects
so um they they do like the tasty uh
north american bees
quite a lot but if there are any other
insects there then they'll eat those as
well
so the other name you can call them i
think in america they're quite often
called
um giant asian hornets but there is a
an entomologist called akito kawahara
who says that really you shouldn't call
them that either because
asian can have meanings like asian flu
and stuff like that so you're kind of
taking a bad thing and you're giving it
that epithet so you shouldn't really do
that
so really just giant hornets or large
hornets
that's what he says just call them big
hot big old hordes
in japan they get called giant sparrow
hornets which is pretty terrifying
um but i think there's a weird thing
because the murder hornet thing
is in japan they're not called murder
hornets or rather the word that gets
applied to them
just kind of means killer hornets and
that's because in the japanese language
the word for kill
and murder are the same i think so they
don't
so the the much more pejorative version
is the one that's made its way into
um english the the much more evocative
name
and killer horn is obviously also not a
great name to have
well they kill up to 50 people every
year
like humans yeah in japan especially and
they have this sting which if you're
wearing a normal beekeeping suit
it's still strong enough to go through
the beekeepers
and it can kill you so one of the world
experts
always wears a hazmat suit instead well
i got
i was really excited to realize that
we after i found this fact i was just
looking through podcast emails to see if
anyone's ever
mentioned hornets and we very recently
got contacted by this guy called conrad
who is the guy who took out the first
hornet nest in north america when it
arrived last year
so it came to canada it was in british
columbia and so he's this expert and he
published this
paper on it and one of the things he
said is that when he's chasing them
around he wears a kevlar
vest and he wore two pairs of trousers
he wears
braces that are built to work ward
against chainsaw
injury and then he wears his beekeeping
gear he still got stung quite a bit
and he said that it was extremely
painful but he's a beekeeper so he
suspects that for normal people who
aren't used to being stung
to be real agony but isn't that cool a
podcast fan is the guy who took out the
first nest in north america
he also said incidentally um that he
would never use the m
phrase or he doesn't like to use the m
phrase the murder hornet phrase
you've got to be very politically
correct with these hornets attack
that guy did he hoover them up because
they have vacuum cleaners that they use
for insects special ones
yes yeah yeah i think this might have
been him because
was this august 2019 that they arrived
in north america he said that the
hornets were so big
that they wouldn't fit in the nozzle of
his vacuum
that is
that was in the vancouver area i think
that first one last year and they found
the first one in the united states
this year uh which was in washington and
again they used a vacuum cleaner to suck
that one away
and it was done by an entomologist
called chris looney
i hope he lived up to his name and just
went in wearing boxer shorts
but bare chested so loony said
uh because we've been talking about how
people are very scared of getting the
sting and how
how it can penetrate he's not so much
scared of the sting what he's more
petrified about is
the squirty venom that they're able to
shoot at you
and that's another thing that you need
to worry about so they
they shoot venom out at you and that can
really burn
like badly it can give nerve damage to
the eye and
so for him that's the more intimidating
thing than the sting itself that he's
looking out for
i have to say it feels like
entomologists who keep saying no they're
just large hornets
are fighting a slightly losing battle
here
do you know how you trap them if you've
got them in your home i think i would
move house
good luck in the estate agency stage
mate good luck with the viewings
um under a bowl well
you can use a bowl but the thing you
need to put in the bowl is
prawns they love prawns especially
during breeding season when they're
going for a slightly more proteiny
mix in their diet wait but they surely i
know they're big but they're not big
enough
or good enough at swimming to be hunting
prawns in the wild i think they very
rarely take down full prawns in the
world but they they do eat meat don't
they
a prawn is basically an insect of the
sea isn't it so maybe
you know it has a similar taste with sex
yeah i've
i have fatal insects but i've never
eaten prawns so i don't really know what
prawns taste like
see that is the reverse of most people's
experience of life yes
i've eaten prawns but i don't think i've
eaten insects that's one of the fly ones
on my bike but it wasn't the same
how did you get rid of that flight no we
can't go down this road
we don't have the time
um in japan where they are not
talked of as pejoratively one of the
reasons could be that the bees in japan
have evolved to deal with them much
better haven't they
so they have this amazing way of killing
them which the european bees
have not figured out so what japanese
honeybees do
is they if they see an asian giant
hornet coming towards them instead of
going out to attack it which is what the
european bees do and they get
decimated they retreat back into their
hive
the hornet comes in and then a massive
crowd of them so hundreds of beasts
swarm it and then they vibrate around it
giving this sort of giant
hug and they vibrate and vibrate and
vibrate so it raises the temperature
so much that the hornet dies and it has
to be quite specific
because a hornet dies i think at about
47.2 degrees c
and these bees will die if it gets about
one or two degrees hotter than that
oh really yeah they've got to be real
thermostats
in that situation because that's what
our theme
is about isn't it then that's right if
anyone wants to find the full version of
our theme tune called wasps that is the
that's the story in the lyrics about how
that happens
is it like a metaphor or something for
lyrics down i've realized i've heard
those lyrics obviously
hundreds of times but i've never really
thought yeah it's the idea i mean
ashgardner who wrote it will know better
but the way i always
interpret it is that you need all of
your friend fees to kill the hornet
you all need to come together and hold
on to each other in order to
get past this terrible foe and in the
same way
humans when we come together we can
achieve anything
that's what i always thought of it
that's really nice
time we get together show what we can do
you hold on to me and i'll hold on to
you
and then we'll kill this hornet
[Laughter]
um japan has an annual wasp festival
this is cool it's called the kushihara
and you have to bring a wasp nest to
the waterville so the price is for the
heaviest boss nest
but it's obviously quite hard to bring a
wasp list
so this is how you do it you have to
attach a bit of white paper to a tiny
sliver of fish
right and the wasp was above meat they
will that will swoop in and it will grab
this
bit of fish and it flies off but
you can see the paper because you've
attached the paper so you follow
this little bit of paper flying through
the air that takes you back to the nest
and then you have to
carefully dig it out feed the wasps
raw meat to grow them so that they build
a big strong nest and then you
eventually
bring out this whole nest box and you
bring it to the festival
[Music]
i think we should just say for people at
home don't go near a wasp's nest
because they are dangerous and they
wasps nests that you can get really
badly stunned yeah but if you really
want to go to this festival
i mean who's headlining the japanese
festival it could be more
it's just more giant exactly i was going
to say even bigger warning do not go to
the wasp festival certainly don't get
the train there on the day that all the
competitors are heading there as well
and answer to you and answer to your
question who's headlining the wasp
festival i think it's sting
in the medieval times a peasant
who lives near the french village of
cambray
dreamed that he got a divine
revelation from a swarm of bees entering
his anus
[Music]
[Laughter]
did he enter himself into that big wasp
competition
[Laughter]
to clarify to clarify for a second
i think he dreamed of the swarm of peaks
and
his anus and that the
bees in the dream had given him a divine
revelation about the evil clergy
i don't think
but so okay so they spoke to him from
within
his ass yes inside the dream they spoke
to him
by flying into his bottom and they told
him to find revelation
okay nobody would assume that god would
communicate with you is it but he does
he works in mystery as well very
mysterious
that i think they had to coin that
phrase just for the specific
revelation
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that
is james okay my fact this week is that
two years after the release of the first
james bond movie an actual british spy
called james bond was discovered in
poland
amazing who would have thought it was it
a response to the films was it them
saying
we're going to name all our spies james
bond oh like articus or something that
would be
exactly um there's a suggestion of that
now the thing is
this was in the cold war and we are
learning more stuff like it gets
declassified but
it's still kind of sketchy what people
knew and what people were doing and all
that kind of thing so we're kind of
piecing things together
but they found this file that the polish
security service put together during the
cold war about this guy called james
albert bond
and he went to poland and ostentatiously
started flirting with women and hanging
around nuclear
power plants and stuff like that i don't
know exactly what he did but
he was acting very very obviously like a
spy and there's a suggestion that the
british might have sent him over and
deliberately given him that name so that
the polish had to use their
resources investigating him while
perhaps some other covert stuff was
happening
we don't know that um we don't know
whether he was just on holiday in
poland who just happened to be there and
everyone's just
kind of put one and one together and got
three um his wife
seems to think that there might have
been something going on he's
unfortunately not with us anymore so we
can't ask him
so all right who knows um so many so
many james bonds
out there so there was a census there
was a survey done by
uh websites of census website uh which
found
six hundred and seventy two james bonds
in history with all sorts of jobs they
were
mostly dull um you know clarkson there
were some orchid growers though it was
fun
um and in the 1920 census there was
someone who was called
goldfinger goldy finger
finger goldie thing yeah that's
g-o-l-d-e gold
oh yeah do we know what that person did
were they a villain as a profession i
don't think so i don't have
a wikipedia page obviously if you put
james bond in and you go for the bomb
that's not the character
you get a few notable bonds and so
there's a few there's a speedway racer
there is a naval officer and there's a
few other what's interesting is
most of them at some point in the
article it says their nickname was
double07
and i think every single one of them has
the same nickname
four things for their lives if they were
after the movies but obviously the most
notable one
is the uh the bird watcher the
ornithologist james bond who
uh the character was named after yeah
indeed
um they met i think didn't they in the
end
and um the actually the james bond the
bird watcher said he loved being james
bond because apparently
it helped him get through passport
control which just made me think that
passport control in the 60s or whatever
was quite a lot more likes
if he was just saying my name's james
bond do you think he gave them the
passport and they saw the name and he
just
tapped the side of his nose and went
there they let me in guys
yeah and all the security went god this
must be a thing that they forgot to tell
me about
i'll let him through ian fleming once
wrote to the other james bond's wife
and said that um you know apologizing
that he'd stolen
the husband's name and he said perhaps
one day your husband will discover a
particularly horrible species of bird
which he would like to christen in an
insulting fashion by calling
ian fleming
there's a theory that a very new theory
that actually it wasn't based on james
bond the onlookers that was just a cover
by ian fleming to protect the person it
was based on
and this is because a new thing came to
light in 2018 a guy called stephen
phillips from swansea was looking into
his
grandfather's records and his
grandfather's called james bond
and there were documents that just been
declassified that showed that his
grandfather
was an soe a special operations
executive agent
in world war ii and he just signed the
official secrets act just before d-day
so he was clearly involved in that in
some way
and so this guy stephen phillips's
grandson reckons
it's likely ian fleming would have met
him because they were both hanging out
in the spy world around that time
and then thought james bond great name
i'd better not say i was inspired by
this spy because i don't want to
spill the beans so i'll find another
james bond to claim it was based on
instead
so that's the theory and that the real
james bond ended up working as a
lollipop man
in swansea
the obvious bridge must have been such
an exciting
crossing of pelican crossing can you
imagine
gunfire car chases the lollipop was
actually a bazooka that he would agree
um there's a guy called james bond in
walsall a council worker in walsall he
used to be called david fern uh and much
like that guy who chased his name to i
love spam the other week
i don't know if you remember him um
david fern from walsall has changed his
name to james bond
but as a middle name he's included all
the bond film titles
this was in newspapers in 2006. so if
he's ever stopped and they say what's
your name he would say
the name's bond james dr no from russia
with love goldfinger thunderball you owe
me a vote fights on my
does he have to change his name again by
default every time a new film is
released
so i think that's why they haven't
released the new one yet
wow you really choose a path of
embracing it
or really hating it don't you there was
there's actually a documentary did you
guys see there's a documentary called
the other fellow
made by this cloak called matthew bowyer
which is about other people with the
name james bond who went around the
world
interviewing them and the vast majority
basically find it incredibly annoying
there was one guy who said the most
annoying thing is that at least four
times a week people come up to him and
sing the bond theme tune
but easily half the time they attempt to
do that they sing the mission impossible
it says brilliant
there's one there was a canadian lawyer
who was quite nice he was called james
bond
and he always hated it because of all
the jokes and stuff and then
eventually he got married the year
before they made the documentary
and the guy he married said look there's
no way i'm not calling you james bond so
he always went by jim
jim bond he said there's no way i'm not
calling you james bond
and so now he embraces it and he calls
his husband money penny
and always orders the vocal martini
shaken not stirred
and i think that's the way to go so sean
connery obviously uh very sadly passed
away
recently um nice little james bond
connection from his earlier life
is that connor used to deliver milk he's
the milkman and he used to deliver milk
to betty's school
uh in the uk and that is where the
fictional james bond
went to ah that's insane
yeah he was a model for fictional james
i guess
he would have been doing it because when
was conrad 1930 he might have been doing
it at the time when
bond was at that school as in he might
have been delivering it to his fictional
self
without knowing it he has a sort of a
billion jobs didn't he
yeah yeah it kind of implied that he
couldn't stick with anything in a way
but one of the jobs that i like uh is
the fact that he works as a life drawing
model because it means that we have
an almost entirely naked picture of sean
connery in his very early days
available and bizarrely he worked as a
life drawing model and the quite famous
uh arts promoter and artist richard
demarco drew him
so you can see john connery and he's
wearing this sort of
brown willy sack like a tiny what do you
call
like a like a posing pouch a posing
pouch
yeah i mean call it a willy sack if you
like it's a woody sack
are you sure it's a willy sack and not
just he's got very very
weird genitals i couldn't say a hundred
percent i didn't zoom in closely enough
it's worth taking a look yeah that
sounds like the artist in the class just
got prudish when they got down there
oh
uh he was supposed to be gandalf wasn't
he you loved the rings
really um but he he was offered 15
of the box office receipts which would
have given him 450 million dollars
and he turned it down because he didn't
understand the script
uh and then they interviewed him later
and he said
i've read the book i read the script i
saw the movie i still don't understand
it
15 yeah instead he
instead he made the league of
extraordinary gentlemen as his last film
what a different film to go out on that
was his last film really
yeah he retired after that because it i
mean it is a bit of a honker
um yeah um he was a member of the snp
uh a sort of card-carrying member and
the membership number they gave him
double o amazing as if that wasn't used
already did they not even have seven
members
they had to kick an extremely
long-soviet loyal personnel
um margaret thatcher was offered the
passport double ism wasn't she
we might have said that before but she
said no that's silly and they gave it to
someone incredibly boring and said with
someone
like some random lollipop man in wales
[Laughter]
i mean that would make your day was it
jeff boone did you say
it was someone who's the mp who said h
double o
n that's right
he spent some time in his life sleeping
in a coffin
oh wow is that is that because he worked
didn't he work as a funeral
director or a great figure or something
no not not nearly that senior he worked
as a coffin polisher you've promoted
you've given him seven promotions
he i think he worked as a coffin
polisher because he was friends with
this guy that he did bodybuilding with
uh mr universe mr scotland archie
brennan
and he said archie brandon suggested he
get into coffin polishing to earn some
extra money
and there's an interview with someone
who is his old workmate in the warehouse
where they
where they published the coffins and
made them and there's this guy called
tommy walk who said he noticed that sean
young shawn
wasn't going home at night he was
sleeping in the coffins so he was just
having a bit of a
bit of a rough time at that period of
his life i think i'd be a bit worried
about
mr universe or mr scotland polishing the
coffins because he'd be so strong he'd
go right the way through it
i love that you just corrected me about
giving a promotion to sean connery in
that company and then immediately gave
mr scotland the mr universe title
well to sean connery scotland was the
universe dan so
i think it's what he would have wanted
me to say
[Music]
okay it's time for our final fact for
the show and that is my fact
my fact this week is in 1970 burglars
managed to successfully get past
an unpickable door lock and steal
american government documents
by tapping a note to it a few hours
beforehand that read
please don't lock this door tonight
so this came from a really really cool
book
that was published called the burglary
the discovery of j edgar hoover's
secrets by betty
medseger and the book talks about one of
the great moments
of being able to expose the fbi for some
hidden
secret operations that they were
conducting in america
by a group that were known as the
citizens commission to investigate the
fbi
random group of people who decided to
make it their mission
to infiltrate the fbi and steal these
documents but there was a whole scene
of these sort of anti-war and
anti-government activists that had been
operating in the states going around and
breaking into various buildings
and they broke into the fbi offices took
a thousand classified documents
and they sent it to all the newspapers
and the washington post were the first
to sort of publish them and show that
there was secret spying that was going
on
under j edgar hoover's government and
really kind of tore him down a lot so
yeah this this unpickable lock was just
an earlier mission
where they were trying to um get some
draft
papers for the vietnam war and steal
them so people couldn't be drafted
and did the people in the offices
explain why they had
read the note and decided that that was
a legit reason to leave the door open
because i can't think of a single
ordinary circumstance where you would
request that people don't knock a door
overnight
yes i would immediately obey the sign if
there was a sign on the door saying
please don't lock this door i think oh
well someone has a good reason
that is
was it that the cleaners maybe the
cleaners were coming around after the
office was shut
and they would normally lock up but they
thought that someone in the office had
left that note
that might be it yeah i do yeah well
they couldn't believe it worked by the
way
they they got there and they're like oh
my god and they almost
toyed with the idea of leaving a thank
you note on the door and then they
thought
that that's going too far they might
recognize the handwriting
i like those from leaving notes burglars
leaving notes generally which they do
sometimes do they sometimes leave
apology notes
it seems to be quite a common thing my
friend granny it was actually robbed
recently and they left an apology note
saying sorry for stealing your stuff
and there was one there was a really
nice story
this year in february in north carolina
where
someone who worked in a salon came to
the salon the next day and it was clear
someone had broken in but couldn't find
that anything had been taken
and then she found a note that said as i
left your salon with all the stuff
i'd stolen and then with the list of all
the stuff this person has done i had an
epiphany of how hard you work for your
business
and i returned everything i've taken
here's everything i've returned please
forgive me i'm ashamed and disgusted at
myself
and then brought it all back see that i
think it's better than leaving a note
which says
sorry for stevie stuff which i have gone
ahead and done anyway
it feels like the apology is a little
bit empty in the first one
isn't it yeah it does it absolutely does
i would even know saying sorry about the
poop but then not leave the poop
for the rest of their time
this happened a lot right apparently
someone did a yeah
they did a scientific paper on not not
leaving it as a dirty protest but
needing to have a poo
while robbing a house so there's a paper
um which i
haven't actually read i just saw it it
was called the scatological rites of
burglars
and it showed that in a lot of cases
where people were caught they
they admitted to having a poo while you
can get uh
because you're quite stressed it makes
you want to go but you can get caught by
people
finding the dna of your yeah inside your
boot don't they
yes so do flush it is what you're saying
we'll take it home
[Music]
to be truly safe um i was reading about
the hamburglar
uh in the news this year and that was a
man who stole some ham
he was called domingo infante he's 34
years old in spain
and he went into a shop and there was
massive legs of iberico ham
you know those massive like cured ham
legs
and he's whole he stole i think like
four or five of them
um but they're really heavy those things
i don't know if you've ever picked one
up
that's super heavy and so he had to drag
them home to his house
leaving the trail of fat all the way
to his front door which they just
followed
and they knocked on the door and he was
living with his parents and they said
have you got some hands here
and eventually they had to admit that
they did oh my god
that is such an example of letting the
best be the enemy of the good those
hands last for ages
because they're quite dense they're
quite densely packed don't they yeah
if you had one of them he probably would
have been fine they're expensive though
i think he probably intended to sell
them rather than eat them
i think because each of those is like
100 quid or something i reckon so
he was just getting seven of them and
then he was going to sell them down the
park that's a really good point because
cheese obviously that's why people steal
cheese from the supermarket so much
there's a relatively large amount of
money in a relatively small box yeah
yeah if you're hungry i don't think
you'd steal a giant tiberico ham
there are so many easier food stuffs to
feed from dragging a
pig down the street um
in our previous books of the year we've
often found
that american police officers like to
give their bandits nicknames
do you remember that every year whenever
there's something that happens some
crime in america
the cops always name them the something
bandit um
so i googled a few of those um in
chicago this year there was a guy called
the mummy bandits do you know why they
might have called him that
um did he wrap himself in toilet paper
pretty much yeah he wrapped himself in
gauze and scarves
um so that none of the cctv cameras
wouldn't know who he was
um the powder puff bandits do you know
what they might have done
um something to do with the cartoon the
the powder puff girls
girls no it's nothing to do with that i
think they were the powerpuff girls they
weren't just makeup artists the
adventures of
makeup a play on artists player words
they're powerful but they're also like
powder puffs what is a powder puff
a powder puff is like you know if you're
putting makeup on but it's like
you kind of pop it onto your face it's
like
it got the powder in one half without a
mirror in the other right yeah then you
have a brush and use it
did okay all right did they blow the
very fine makeup powder towards the cctv
cameras
to hide their entry great idea no
did they did they using makeup did they
paint someone else's face on their face
great it's actually the exact opposite
of that
oh they painted their own face on
someone else's face
it's not the exact opposite of that but
it's something that's
much different what they did was
uh this was in denver this guy called
hernandez and he had
extremely obvious facial tattoos and so
he would use
the foundation to cover those up um so
that they wouldn't recognize
him brilliant very clever there was a
guy called this is
quite easy to guess actually but there
was a guy in albuquerque called the
birthday suit
sign bandit you know did you hear me
yeah so something to do with
nudity right
[Music]
but then is he wearing a little sign
over his penis saying
get action here sean connery's leathery
glove no this was very simply a man
caught naked on camera stealing a biden
harris campaign sign
from a garden in albuquerque
anyway that's some of those do you know
how you'd burgle a house using a
tortoise
wow okay so very slow getaway
yes could you squeeze yourself under the
shell sort of between tildes and shells
no that's not that's a good that's a
good method this is this is a gang of
thieves in medieval arabia called the
banu
and in fact they lasted hundreds of
years it's kind of a very loose
affiliation rather than a proper gang
like they want one entity but supposedly
they would bring a crowbar a candle some
stale bread some beans
an iron spike a drill a bag of sand and
a tortoise too
i think that the drill and the iron
steak and stuff are a lot more important
than the tartars in this blow
no no way okay they do
use the spike or a crowbar to get in to
access to the property
fine but then they light the candle
which they've also brought they stick it
onto the tortoise and they send the
tortoises through the hole
that way you can see what's in there you
can see if there's any stuff worth
stealing
right then you use the bag of sand
you throw that at the windows and see if
anyone gets up and if there's no one up
then you go in right well so if you're
in the house
and you wake up and you just hear a bit
of banging outside and you kind of go
into your front room
and there's a tortoise with a candle on
its back i still think you're going to
be a bit suspicious
straight back to bed for me it's not a
burglar it's just the candle tortoise
again
also with a note on his back saying
please ignore me i'm just the
artist with a candle on my back nothing
to see here
well i know what you're thinking what
about the stale bread and the dried
beans sorry that's what i was thinking
here
so that's if you get in so operation
tortoise has worked you've seen
valuables you're in the house but then
you can hear someone moving around in a
nearby room
at that point you noisily chew on the
stale bread and the dried beans
so that people think it's just a cat
eating a mouse
right that's a really good is that a
foley sound effect trick is that how you
simulate cassie in this house
absolutely yeah still bread and dried
beans but we haven't got a cat
you might say and that's then you're in
trouble i guess
have you guys heard of george leslie
from america
okay so this is around the late 1800s
um and this is a guy who moved to new
york city
in 1869 and he was a trained architect
but he decided to go into a life of
crime
and it is said that the gang that he
created off the back of it and the
syndicate that he created
off the back of it were responsible for
nearly 80 percent of all bank robberies
in the us
at that time this one guy so what he
used to do which was really
interesting is he used to break into
banks
not to rob them but to walk around at
night on his own
and mapped them out then he would take
his designs because he's an architect
he would go back to a warehouse that he
owned and build
the bank in there so that he and his
fellow robbers
could work out the best way of getting
through certain things in certain doors
and certain escape groups so he would
recreate the entire interior of the bank
are you saying that he wrote ocean's
eleven about
about a hundred years before ocean's
eleven oh i never saw that movie but
yeah that's what they do
that's incredible yeah it's
extraordinary it is incredible apart
from the people who wrote ocean's eleven
probably just heard about this guy and
then stole it for that plot
though yes i'm saying it's more the
original guy is more impressive yes yeah
i actually wasn't saying ocean's 11 is
an incredible film i think it's decent
it's certainly better than 12. yeah
what was he called he was called george
leslie and
these were life-sized these it's not
like he did little models
of course you wouldn't use a tiny model
i mean imagine
how freaked out your gang is going to be
if they get into the vault and it's huge
they haven't trained for this
there was a burglar in 2014 who managed
to delay
783 trains as a result of his
burglary unbelievable and so he'd cut
open a curry store
um near charlton and um the police
turned up he panicked and fled and then
he
he got onto his motorbike also stolen by
the way so not even an honestly acquired
motorbike
uh that didn't start he ran off and then
he climbed up a tree
but unfortunately the tree was kind of
overhanging the railway tracks
at childhood station and he decided to
stay up there for 17 hours
despite the police being there at that
point the game is over i think you have
to come down
did the police where the police stood
under the tree at this time saying
you're gonna have to come down
eventually
pretty much yeah don't you call the fire
engine at that point yeah so we've got
we've got a cat burglar stuck up in the
trees
exactly they always find their own way
down don't worry you don't actually need
it
okay that's it that is all of our facts

[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with anna toshinski
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again
we have gathered around the microphones
with our four favorite facts from the
last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with you andy my fact is that
museums need visitors breath in order to
preserve their exhibits properly
interesting museums rely on the moisture
from our bodies
to keep their things nice because when
you breathe out
it's more moist than when you breathe in
you breathe in normal air and it takes a
bit of your internal juice and it
transports it to the outside don't say
internal juice that's horrible
sorry andy can i just ask with um at the
moment with covert happening not many
people
going to museums is there a way that we
can donate our internal juice
yeah um the british museum is taking
donations
you just say free post british museum
and you slap that on a big bag of juice
and they'll release it among them right
um yeah so this is according to a
curator at the british museum
uh which has been closed for the longest
time in its history and
normally they will get about 17 000
visitors a day and
all those people and their breath help
keep the right level of humidity in the
air because they've got so many objects
which
require certain levels of humidity um
you know
things that can dry out easily maybe
they're objects made of bone which might
crack
if it gets too low and this is a problem
objects have been at risk of cracking
out
so when we all are able to return to
museums are you suggesting maybe we
should go around spitting on the
exhibits
yeah yes yeah absolutely
we all have a lot of friends who work in
museums um so i thought i'd contact a
few of those to see if they have the
same problems in other museums
all right so um one of our friends is
paolo biscari at the
national museum of ireland and he said
that this is spot on their problem is
less with people
breathing out so much but more that when
you open the door
normally it would bring in a lot of
moisture from outside because it's
always pissing it down and doubling
and so basically you would open the door
and that would bring in moisture from
outside and no one's opening the door at
the moment so that's a problem
uh i also spoke to our friends at the
penis museum
in iceland to see if they have any
problems
with humidity at the moment and florida
wrote back to me
and said um they've not had problems
with conservation due to the lack of
humidity
um we have discontinued stuffing our
penises
because it led to considerable shrinkage
which may prove problematic when you're
in the penis business
but the few taxidermy specimens we have
have actually heard a little bit better
due to covid mainly due to the lack of
people touching them
right so people aren't touching his
penises as much and so things are a bit
better for him
wow and just a reminder for anyone who
visits the museum don't spit on them
when it's open again
can i just interject here to say how
angry i was
that you chose the one week i was away
to discuss the icelandic penis museum
mentioned that that was quite
thoughtless i discovered this week when
i was listening back
but you let sandy toxic talk about it
instead of me i'm really
sorry about that when lockdown's over
just come you can come round and we'll
get bottle of wine out we can talk about
the icelandic penis museum
honestly so much to me we didn't know
you listened to the podcast
[Laughter]
i tried to avoid it someone else had it
on in the background
but they i don't think you did mention
they've got their only human penis quite
recently
don't turn this into a penis museum
i'm getting it back to the penis museum
i will make up for that last time
uh no i just i did enjoy a quote from
the penis museum when i was looking at
how they
preserve their objects and they got
their first human penis in 2011
from the 95 year old pally harrison
who promised it i think 15 years ago i
don't i don't think you mentioned this
so
promise it 15 years ago to his friends
who's the curator lived for an extra 15
years which possibly wasn't expected
and there was an interview with the
curator uh
who was looking down at this 95 year old
man's penis which he now has preserved
and the independent reporting on it said
glancing down at the glass container
holding a grayish brown shriveled mass
he admitted that the preservation had
not been successful
oh dear i remember that i remember that
story because i think there was a race
to get the first
human penis into the penis museum and it
was between this 95 year old guy and
some
27 year old bloke and whichever of them
died first
was going to donate their people that is
a brilliant
plot for a murder novel isn't it um
right anyway anyway um so correct i've
got that out of my system now you can go
yeah
don't worry we'll we'll edit that into
the previous episode
i'd appreciate that um but it's a big
it's a huge problem and
it's not the only problem they have so
in june you remember it was very hot
summer this year
the british museum had to specifically
send in a curator because they thought
that oliver cromwell's death mask
might melt because it's made of wax and
it was so hot in the museum
and that's obviously a very rare and
precious thing but so i i assume that
even during lockdown there were one or
two caretakers that were late
able to walk around the museum because
for example with
the problem of no one breathing and
creating that humidity they do
have sensors over 700 all around the
museum that
go off when the temperatures and
humidity are not the right level
so they can adjust them they can press
buttons to make sure
that it regulates it's not entirely
reliant on human
breathing so i would have assumed there
just would have been someone there to
you know put a hat on oliver death mask
or something
i think there is there are people who
can do that they have a
few people who go in there's a brilliant
interview with uh james maclean who i
think
dan definitely knows i would say i'm not
sure if you guys know him who's the fish
curator at
the natural history museum and it's been
his job during lockdown for some of the
time to go and have a look around and
make sure that everything's okay so
he's had to look after the flesh-eating
beetles for instance
so they have these beetles there which
strip down the bones whenever you get a
new little animal you put it in the
beetles eat all the meat off it and you
come out
with a perfect bone and he's had to feed
them so that they don't go looking for
other things to eat
um so he has to give them some conga
real heads to keep them happy
oh my god and he said something else in
this this is not about conservation but
i thought it was really interesting
he says he monitors the alcohol supply
system in the natural history museum
and apparently in the natural history
museum there is a series of pipes that
go through the whole museum
that like they're powered by steam power
and they fire alcohol
through the whole museum and there are
little taps in all the rooms where you
can just get little bits of pure alcohol
if you need it if you need it for
preservation isn't that amazing wow
can you drink that or is that too no
it's pure ethanol
so i would advise against it if you ever
get stuck in the natural history museum
they're probably
you know there might be check the tap
don't check the tap go to check out the
staff
canteen if you would need some alcohol
probably yeah rather than
yes otherwise you've drunk from an
ethanol tap you're absolutely hammered
and you're in a room surrounded by
dead stuffed giant extinct animals which
sounds
like something out of a nightmare that
movie the night at the museum is very
different if you've been drinking pure
ethanol the night before
it's quite dangerous having all that
ethanol there for preservation
in the natural history museum um they
have to be careful with
bigger animals so i think they the head
of fish curation
who's called oliver crimin or he claims
to be the head but maybe your friend
is his rival they work together ollie
and james work together yeah
okay work together rivals whatever you
want to call it
they uh they stopped their largest
fish recently so they've got 900 000
dead fish in there
um and it was a blue marlin which was
four meters long it washed up in wales
in 2016.
and i just love the fact that within 24
hours oliver's there
on the beach on the pembrokeshire coast
immediately
and it needed 10 000 liters
of ethanol which is what you normally
preserve it in but that's incredibly
flammable
and very dangerous that would explode
the entire museum if
a flame got to it so they had to sort of
create this new
solution for it glycerol for 10 000
liters
yeah it's big how big is a marlin
they're much bigger than i realized they
like the size of a tuna isn't it a
marlin yeah massive
i guess i just that's amazing that is
really extraordinary
is one of them does one of them do the
heads of the fish and the other one does
the tails of the fish yeah but they flip
through it at the start of each day to
see
just back to the british museum very
quickly what do you suppose
the two most popular things in the
museum what do you think the two most
popular things are
okay and i'm getting this from a british
museum vlog from 2017
so it might have changed
the mummies i would say people always go
for the mummies don't they i'd say well
number one egyptian collection mummies
is the number one
most searched for thing on their website
that people want to find out about
so what's number two
[Music]
yeah they're cool it's actually japanese
erotica
so it's called and these are on panels
it's painting
of very erotic japanese kind of karma
sutrasque
looking drawings and there was a big
exhibition in 2014
the second most searchable thing on
their website more so than the opening
hours
it's no good knowing the opening hours
if you don't know the way
the japanese arrive
that's what you constantly see very
disappointed looking slightly horny
people at two in the morning
looking really angry outside the british
museum i didn't realize they weren't
open
yeah forty thousand annual searches for
shunga on their website
and the egyptian collection gets fifty
three thousand do we know if that's
forty thousand different people or is it
one
horny
one cool thing during this whole breath
thing one of the the collections of
the head of collections care is a woman
called sandra smith
and she said about the breath crisis at
the museum she said
it was not alarming that's a bit
scare-mongering but it's fair to say
that when we started watching the
moisture dropping
we were all holding our breath and
wanting it
[Music]
stop the vodka hi everyone this week's
episode of fish is sponsored by
harry's yes that's right harry's is the
company that sends you
reasonably priced razors that arrive to
your door with everything you need
to give yourself a lovely face glide
every morning a face glide
new word coining it trying it out
fantastic yeah i'm using it for everyone
it is the perfect equipment for the
ultimate face glide you get a weighted
ergonomic handle
you get their new five blade razor
cartridge
and then you get a travel blade cover so
you can go on the move
and shave wherever you want yes that's
right and replacement blades
cost as little as one pound 75 each
which is very reasonable
if you want to try everything that dan
just mentioned that trial set it costs
just 3.95 and all you have to do is go
to harry's
h-a-r-y-s dot com slash fish today
what or if you want to go to the proper
website add an extra r into that harry's
and you'll find it it's h-a-r-r-y-s
dot com slash fish and you can claim
your free trial set for three pounds
ninety-five there
i'm confused with the hari krishna we're
doing later in the show
what i of course meant there was go to
harry's h-a-r-r-y-s
dot com fish and you get that trial set
for just three pounds ninety-five
bring on the face glide okay on with the
[Music]
show
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
anna okay well before i say my fat this
week i just want to warn
any more squeamish listeners that it is
kind of gruesome
but i want to reassure them that it has
a happy
ending so steal yourselves
my fact this week is that in 1997 a mass
tug of war
went so badly wrong that it ripped two
of the contestants
arms off i don't know i'm sorry
i'm sure all of your faces are making me
regret this
we do what you were going to say exactly
it doesn't make it any better
every time you hear it it gets worse
actually i'm just going to say
immediately
before i go anywhere near the rest of
this that they had
some very extensive micro surgery and
their arms were reattached along with
extensive nerve grafting and they
regained their hand functions
we're okay to talk about this a tug of
war ripped
their arms off and that can happen it
was uh
it was actually meant to be a day of
celebration it was in taiwan and it was
the anniversary of the end of japanese
rule it was to celebrate
that and sixteen hundred people took
part
and people don't realize how dangerous
tug of war is so that ended up putting
eighty
thousand kilograms of force on this five
centimeter wide nylon rope
that could only bear 26 000 so it's kind
of impressive that it
it hung on that long and the rope
snapped and
the rebound force of its snapping seems
to just torn off the
left hand for two people on front of
each row
so it's kind of amazing physics i guess
yeah that massive force is sitting in
the rope when it's being pulled
yeah and as soon as the rope breaks that
force has to go somewhere that energy
goes somewhere
and so it immediately goes straight into
the body
of the person who's at the front of the
road who essentially pulls his body away
from his arm
i'm so squeamish that i actually didn't
do any further research on this specific
incident that happened and so i assumed
that it was just that they got tugged at
the wrong moment
all that like the other 3 000 people on
the other team all pulled at the same
time and only one person that turned up
for
that or whatever
it was not that it was interesting
because it was a slightly different to
the normal tug of war i think that we
have in that
there were lots of branches that came
off the ropes so it wasn't just like
let's say it was 16 000 people it wasn't
8 000 people
pulling on one end of the rope and 8 000
people on the other
all the rope had loads of kind of bits
coming off it that people would pull
on the side because that's the way
that's the way they do it in taiwan
yeah yeah depending on your level of
screenishness there is a really good
snopes article
on it um the picture in which i found
extremely confusing
so it does show a man lying on the
ground after the tug of war
next to his arm and
then the only other person in shot is a
cameraman
who's sitting there with his back to
this man pointing the camera in a
completely different direction
and what i want to know is what in god's
name is he taking a photo of
that is more interesting than that
oh man well there were two guys right
maybe it's the other guy
imagine coming around after extensive
micro surgery hearing the surgeon saying
don't worry
we have brilliant medical science these
days we've managed to reattach your arm
you don't do anything that's not my
watch
[Laughter]
this happens a lot right um and not
enough that it's a sort of public
announcement to say stop doing tug of
war but
it's these this isn't a one-off there
are cases
but sadly in these mass um tug of wars
people do lose hands in some cases sadly
some people have died
um but it's only with these mega these
mega tugger boards
i think one of the problems is that in
professional tug of war
they have rules right they have very
strict rules of what you're allowed to
do and what you're not allowed to do
if you just get a load of people like
1600 people
pulling on a bit of rope they're not
going to necessarily
follow all the health and safety things
the main problem is like when you wrap
your
wrap it around yourself to kind of pull
and yeah you know that's obviously a
problem in
a professional tug of war you're not
allowed to do that at all it's amazing
how
widespread tug of war seems to have been
throughout history and all around the
world isn't it
yeah so and um thailand
it happens at buddhist funerals i think
in thailand and burma
and it's only if you're really high up
buddhist if you're already senior monk
then there's a massive tug of war over
your corpse
not over your actual corpse okay well
it's it's over your hearse
with the corpse on it uh and this
is it sounds kind of fun it's your
body's put on a
cart and it's pulled to this field and
it's going to be cremated but first of
all
all the villagers gather around and they
pull at the cart on either side and
sometimes just goes on for days
of just pulling the cart one way and
then the rope snaps and the other team
pull it a long way the other way
and they get cheerleaders and they have
megaphones with people kind of egging
one team on
and with just with this buddhist monk's
body
rollicking around on the cart for a
while and i think
behind the idea is that it's a way of
getting all the goodness out of the monk
all the merits they call it before you
cremate him
and that sounds like an absolute laugh
i was reading about professional
tug-of-war and the world championships
and stuff like that
and um the best women's team is from
taiwan
and they are unbelievably good they've
won
every single world championship to date
right wow
but they go under the name of chinese
taipei because obviously there's
political things between china and
the taiwanese and so they they compete
under the name chinese taipei
but whenever they play china they always
want to absolutely smash them
okay i read an interview with one of the
players
um called chen lee hui and she said that
when she played against
the chinese they could have beaten them
really really quickly
and she says but instead we tortured
them slowly before making them lose
yeah i watched a professional tug of war
match uh
just this morning and it was very
different to how i pictured it would be
as in i thought you would you would have
the gun or whatever
go go off and it would be kind of just
kind of a lot of pulling a lot of
um just okay come on let's do this a lot
of time
but what happens in the one that i saw
and this was the finals and it was i
think it was um
uh it was england and someone else they
basically they started it
and they go completely rigid they put
their feet in they lock down
and they hold and they're pulling really
hard but there's no movement whatsoever
and this match lasted nine minutes long
and for the first five or so minutes
it was just them basically holding firms
i think with
with a tension that i guess it just
tires you out a bit and then you make
your move so it's a sort of it's very
boring for the first five minutes
they're just staring at people leaning
backwards it's not a good spectator
sport yeah it's just motionless
motionless motionless oh a lot of people
have fallen over
the end i read one um
article and this was in a physics uh
website so
they weren't going on the sporting side
of it but they reckon that it's just
basically about friction
it's not even about how strong you are
because if you think about it
if you're pulling on a rope which is
attached to a wall
you can pull it as hard as you want and
if you pull and pull and pull all you're
going to do is move yourself closer to
the wall you're not going to move the
wall because the wall is stuck there
and so the idea is that the other team
has got a really good face and really
stuck
on the floor with good friction with
nice solid boots and you're on ice
you could be a million times stronger
than them but all you've got to do is
pull yourself closer to them you're not
going to pull them
closer to you so yeah i read i read a
lot of the
uh tug-of-war international federation
rulebook preparation for this recording
oh my god
they're called twist for short and uh
their rules are
so good they're so interesting so there
are all kinds of
there's a whole page about doping in
together war it's not allowed
and there's not much anyway because why
would you but the rules about
because it makes you stronger surely
well but it doesn't give you more
friction
no you can't you can't take a drug
yeah it would need to be a stickiness
you want sticky feet don't you well
this is exactly this is why the shoes
section of twif rules is so
enormous and comprehensive you aren't
allowed to have shoes
that are more than 20 longer than your
feet because when you think about it
that's why the clouds won the first five
olympics didn't they
they would win wouldn't they because
they've just got so much more surface in
contact with the ground
like yeah and there are all these things
you could be banned for you could be
banned for sitting down
that's happened in when it was an
olympic sport actually the british team
one's got banter sitting it's not really
sitting down
it's um well actually the first ever
rules i read them
and explicitly it says sitting on
another member of your team is not
permitted
that is fair um but also not trying hard
enough
is a disqualifiable offense really so it
says it certainly
teams failing to actively engage in the
competitive effort during a pull
leading to a prolonged stalemate which
could bring the sport into disrepute
that's what i was saying basically what
the chinese taipei slash taiwanese team
were doing yeah right
like deliberately not trying hard to try
and make it
yeah they've got to watch out then yeah
that's very interesting
twith is a wonderful website by the way
it's i read the the latest newsletter
they've just celebrated their 60th
anniversary
as the tug of war international
federation sadly due to covet
aren't able to meet up to um to be there
with each other so they're going to do
it next year
sport is the perfect sport for keeping
people at fixed two meter intervals
yeah so um they they're going to be
meeting up next year
for their 60th plus one anniversary in
2021
and i was reading their mission
statement and the mission statement
basically is it's the main objective is
they want this to become an olympic
sport again
they're desperate to get it back in the
olympics because in the early olympics
that they were five olympics
that they were part of i think was it um
1920 i think was the last that they
did and britain the uh the holders of
the
well not necessarily britain the holders
because it's actually a very specific
bit of britain it
is the city of london police um
who are the reigning olympic champions
of tug of war uh
and yeah they're constantly trying to
get it back into the olympics but it's
not happening yet and i think it should
go back in
it's no different to the discus it's no
different to no i think it's quite yeah
but it's no different to
egg and spoon race or that race where
you run across put a different item of
clothing on each time
until you look like a farmer it requires
much much less skill than those it
requires being
fat and having spikes in your shoes no
no no no it is it's not just about
strength as we know
it's skill as well no that's that's what
i'm saying it's not about it's nothing
to do with strength it's about standing
there
and being heavy it's heavy has nothing
to do with it
i found it really interesting that
there's we've got two people me and anna
on the side of sugar
is not a skill spot and then we've got
you two on the other side
pulling
[Laughter]
because great britain did seem to
absolutely smash it because not only did
the police team
win they we were allowed to submit
various teams and i think
great britain won all three medals in
1908
as well as winning various but it wasn't
just great britain winning all three
medals it was specific police forces
from britain
winning all three so the city of london
took gold liverpool's police force won
silver
and then more other london policemen
took the bronze medal
it could not have been aborted it was
quite controversial though because the
liverpool team
there is a suggestion that they were
wearing such enormous shoes
and according to some people who wrote
about it at the time
their shoes were so heavy that they
could only just lift their feet off the
floor
when they had to leave the arena
well so if you read the latest
newsletter from the
twith website um there's an actual
breakdown of how a lot of these problems
were solved by one of the members
founding members who helped to solve it
which is when they had their first
international matches
every different country had different
rules for what they were allowed to do
different size shoes
different grips different laying down
and stuff and so
it was this guy who writes his
historical piece in the newsletter
who says that he got together with
everyone and they
they sort of internationalized the rules
for tug of war so that there's now
one solid way that you if you enter this
competition
you can uh you can only perform it i
really hope that the twif website gets a
massive spike in if you're listening to
this just
please go to the twift website because i
want whoever runs to a website to
say like phone is colleagues it's
finally happening
we're doing it twist just sounds like a
swear word you use when you've got a
toddler around
i think that there should just be the
prerequisite but if you cannot mount the
podiums to claim your medal because your
shoes are too heavy
that's automatic disqualification i'll
just chuck it down here that's fine
imagine the very start of the olympics
where they're all marching around the
stadium with a big flag
you just got the tug of 14 dragging
their feet along
oh here they come
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
james okay my fact this week is that in
medieval elections
you were supposed to object to any
suggestion that you wanted to win
when he became archbishop of canterbury
in 1093
saint anselm refused to accept the
ceremonial staff
so they had to break his fingers to
force it into his hand
come on
[Laughter]
this is uh and if you go on snopes you
can see
photographs of the hands being broken
[Laughter]
so i read this uh from bbc history
magazine
it's an article by professor bjorn vila
from aberystwyth university
and it's about medieval elections that
took place around that time
and um there were always elections for
things like bishops and
archbishops and popes and councils and
stuff like that sometimes also kings
some kings were elected which i didn't
know but the idea was
that whoever won was going to be
whatever god wanted
and you shouldn't really want to have
power over other people if you're a
wholly good person
and so you wouldn't try and go around
getting people to vote
for you or anything like that it was
really really look down on
you should just accept the nomination
accept the win
and say well i didn't really want this
but since you insist i'm going to do it
and then say anselm he got the
archbishop
of canterbury and they had to give him
the staff as part of the ceremony but he
was like no
i'm still going to pretend that i don't
want this and they had to break this
you'll have to force that ceremonial
staff into my dead
well actually probably not because he
was a saint and
if you believe all the stories about
saint anselm he was an extremely
highest man who didn't want any it's
funny because he's quite a famous saint
and he did lots of cool stuff but all
the way through it's like oh no i don't
really want anyone to know who i am oh
no
like he deliberately went to become the
number two of a very famous
monk because the other guy was so famous
he thought that will deflect all the
fame off me
he's like the two fifth curators at the
natural history museum that's what we're
saying
i i love it's such funny although he
wouldn't have been a saint at the time i
guess
oh he would have just been mr anselm so
yeah probably not mr yeah
we should just say he obviously set an
example that a lot of world leaders
follow today in his reluctance for power
i i like anselm because he was the
he's the father of scholasticism so
which was a massive deal which was
basically the biggest intellectual
movement of the late middle ages
stop laughing andy that's not why i like
him
okay so scholasticism was this very
important new wave thing which was using
logic and reason and debate to justify
religious arguments instead of just
monasticism where you bought everything
you read in the bible questioning it
anyway the reason i raise it is because
the most famous scholastic
is one of my favorite people who's peter
abelard who is the guy who is inspired
by anselm
and he was the leading philosopher of
the 12th century
really arrogant bit of a pain argue with
his teachers all the time
totally uninterested in women because
all about his study
and then suddenly decided he really
wanted to be the best producer on the
face of the earth so
fell in love with this woman called
eloise and
shagged her in the convent kitchen and
in her uncle's bedroom
and then he married her but he also
wanted to get a
religious post so he
married her in secret and her uncle
thought that he'd refused to marry her
it was all a bit of a misunderstanding
and her uncle did what any good uncle
would do and send some men around to
chop his balls off
and they're now hiding in the penis
museum in ice here we go
leave it alone anna you missed the
episode get over
it
sorry it's perfectly preserved this is
why you like sin ansel
uh because he was an excuse for me to
delve back into peter avalon my favorite
person of the 12th century
i just love that you've got your
testicles chopped off over a
misunderstanding
that's terrible yeah it's saint aldson's
father was called gandalf
no
i guess we only think that's funny
because tolkien then went on to use the
name
but that is hilarious yeah yeah hands up
that's that's why i find that funny
i'm not gonna hide it gandalf ironically
though
loved his ceremonial star that's true
handsome of course
not a fan that's true um and some once
was in
church with henry the first and he
issued a decree of excommunication
against people who had long hair
because long curly hair had become
fashionable in court
and he did a sermon that was so
convincing that several of the
people with long hair in the church
burst into tears
and pulled out their hair by its roots
and the king also started crying and one
of his
assistants had a pair of scissors and
chopped off the king's hair
there and then wow that's convincing
that's good rhetoric um
so just on these sort of medieval
strange
elections that happened and sort of the
the strangeness of their structure
and how you know um have you guys heard
about the elections
in the venetian republic oh no
okay so medieval venice was led by uh
the doge
uh d-o-g-e um and the dodger was elected
by the great council of venice
okay this is a huge council had lots and
lots of members and it was run by a few
noble families but it had you know
hundreds of members
and everyone wanted to be the doge
obviously very powerful but
the system was designed very carefully
to stop anyone gaining and keeping power
okay so you had to stop people
consolidating their authority
once they were elected doge you know so
it sort of keeps things in balance
so this is how they elected a doge right
you pick
30 members of the great council at
random okay then you pick
nine of those thirty also at random okay
uh you're trying to pick the electing
body here
you've got nine people though are you
picking them at random you just you're
just um
sort of i don't know names out of
throwing a bouquet
those nine members they then select 40
more members
right right then if those 40 12 are
randomly picked
those 12 choose 25 more who are randomly
cut down to nine
okay those nine then choose another 45
of whom 11 are picked at random and then
those 11 choose 41 more
those 41 then vote for the dosh
[Laughter]
wow exactly and can i ask what
proportion was done by postal voting
because oh
if there's any more than ten i don't
believe it
um i just reading into some of these mad
elections
there was that classic one of uh after
pope clement iv
died um they spent three years trying to
decide on who the new pope was and it
took so long that eventually
the citizens of the area got so angry so
pissed off they locked
all of the people voting into a church
and they refused to feed them anything
so it was like get in there
decide on this no food no water and they
even ripped off the roof of the church
so that the elements could rain on them
and so on just until they had that
decision and they finally did get that
decision
um pope gregory the 10th we should say
that that instant that you're describing
is the reason
that papal elections and conflicts
happen as they do today right
conclave means with keys and that goes
back to that time where they have to
lock them in the bloody
church so the new rule said that after
three days of voting
you then you only get one meal per day
from then on
then after eight days you only get bread
and water
uh plus a little wine apparently just
just it
under the next two pokes were elected
under those rules and amazingly but it
both took
under 10 days to decide because the food
rules have been changed that was it
but then in 1292 it took two years again
to get a pope
yeah the rules they're all fell apart
again
and then they stopped obeying them yeah
quite a lot and then
that time they only elected a pope
because a pissed off permit wrote into
them
warning them of divine vengeance that if
they didn't elect the pope and when his
letter came in
one of the brothers who picked it up
went well let's just make this guy the
pope and they did
not the hermit yeah he tried to run away
didn't he he genuinely didn't want it i
think he was legit pietro dammaroni
who was yeah he wrote them being like
decide they picked him he tried to flee
they stopped him they forced him to go
into power and only one edict
that he passed when he was in powers
pope remained in force
and that was the edict he passed that
was the right for a pope to abdicate
which he did within five months
yeah wow sometimes you can protest too
much
um in the 1190s in berries at edmonds
they were
looking for a new abbot and there was a
few different candidates
but of course they were all oh no i
don't want it i don't want it
but then one of them was really loudly
and annoyingly say no
i don't want it anyone don't vote for me
whatever you do don't vote for me and
everyone thought that really
he was actually campaigning because he
was like shouting a lot and like making
himself seen
uh and everyone thought that really he
was taking the piss a little bit
and then he was killed by a collapsing
beam which
all the other priests saw as aside from
god but yet he was definitely
he's definitely taking the piss did all
the other priests have to bury the
chainsaws that they brought
eating very quickly
i would love it if political campaigns
today just involve the politicians all
insisting loudly they didn't want it
[Music]
it would be fun if they were trying to
force your hand onto the bible at the
inauguration and you're saying
no i don't no i'm not touching it no
yeah
i used to be like that in america so um
when horace greeley ran against ulysses
s grant in 1872
he was the first one who went across a
whole country kind of canvassing for
votes
and all grant's team they just mocked
him for it they said look
this is just i can't believe what you're
doing this is not what this is not the
right way to
want to become president if you want a
president who is a humble man we don't
want someone who's
shouting from the rooftops that i'm the
best god that's interesting that and
when was that it was kind of 1880 odd or
1872 yeah i'm sorry okay yeah
and actually it's still the rule in
america really or it's supposed to be
that if you're
going to be the running mate of a
potential president then you're not
supposed to campaign for that and that's
now
you're not supposed to do that so
whenever yeah when joe biden was
looking for his running mate and he said
i'm definitely going to have a woman you
don't know who it is yeah but definitely
a woman obviously all of the journalists
would ask
all of the main probable candidates you
know would you be up for it
and a couple of them said yeah i'd
definitely be up for it and then a lot
of the
commentators in america said well that's
not really on you're not really supposed
to do that you're supposed to say well
if it comes my way i'll
you know i'll see what happens but um
i'm really i'm i'm concentrating on
campaigning for the president
oh i guess that still happens doesn't it
like in british
politics they say do you want to be
prime minister and they say
no i'm doing the job that's what richie
sonnax says every week as well yeah
[Laughter]
it's so transparent i wonder if it was
as grotesque transparent as this in the
olden days when yeah
even the nice ones you know aoc and
people no it wouldn't cross my might be
president no i don't i just i'm just
here for the people
to do giving i wish someone would just
say the only reason i'm in this job
is to achieve ultimate power
i've just got one more thing about uh
electoral
malpractice this is actually a recent
story it got sent to me on twitter
by kata ovari so thank you to you this
is about the new zealand bird of the air
competition
which has identified 1500 fraudulent
votes
so there has been voter fraud in one
election can i just ask
how often in the new zealand bird of the
year competition does the kiwi not win
i had no idea it's so the field is wide
open really it's amazing yeah
i mean in this case there was a lot of
tempering on behalf of the little
spotted kiwi it's got 1500 fraudulent
votes
got pushed at the top of the leaderboard
they've been removed but no
it's wide open so and this is not the
first time this election has been
tampered with so there's a whole report
about this advice which said this
in 2015 two teenage girls tried to rig
the results in favor of the cockako
in 2017 a number of fake email accounts
were created to boost the polls in favor
of the white-faced heron and
in 2018 someone voted for the shag more
than three thousand times
i didn't even know boris johnson was in
use
that's the same guy googling shunga the
british
[Music]

okay on with the podcast podcast people
fresh on with the vodka
[Music]
okay it's time for a final fact of the
show that is my fact
my fact this week is that the reason
america has a national anthem
is down to robert ripley believe it or
not
that's a very clever wording because he
didn't think he would believe it or not
i felt yucky saying that it looked fine
on the page
when it came out of my mouth that was a
bit weird um so robert ripley
the creator of the very famous believe
it or not
series of books and museums around the
world
wrote in 1929 that the star-spangled
banner
had never actually formally been adopted
by america as the national anthem
uh it was used in lots of ceremonies it
was done everywhere
and he got a lot of angry mail from that
saying how dare you say that until it
was realized that actually
constitutionally it wasn't
officially their their handsome so five
million people signed a petition that
was forwarded onto congress
and eventually in 1931 president hoover
signed a law
to say this is officially recognized now
so yeah it's down to ripley
just thanks to ripley interestingly so
it had to be proposed that law by
a uh a representative uh and it was the
man who proposed that was called john
lincoln
uh and he represented parts of baltimore
which is what this song is about isn't
it it's about
uh a fort fort mccarran in baltimore so
get this
um himself the politician his first wife
was a woman called eugenia mae biden
who appears from what i can tell to be a
relative of joe biden
[Music]
yeah i don't know about a distant
relative i mean he is quite old so he
might just be his
older sister
[Music]
but yeah that's amazing he should have
made more of that in his campaign
he might have actually clinched the
election property emphasized his
connections to the national anthem okay
donald jr
[Laughter]
it was actually signed as the national
anthem in an executive order by woodrow
wilson about 20 years earlier wasn't it
but it hadn't been
properly rubber stamped by congress and
it was in 1931 that they rubber stamped
it so it was kind of a half law
uh when ripley did this and then it
became a full straight on more
in 1931 yeah and his his piece that he
did so this was
um he used to do illustrations that
would sort of have little bits of
writing around it to tell you this fact
and in his original illustration it was
a bit controversial the wording that he
used for it because
he said america has no national anthem
so that was his big headline statement
then he said the usa
brackets being a dry country is of
course prohibition at the time
has been using without authorization a
vulgar old english drinking song
um so he was sort of doubling down on
not only is it not our song but it's
it's completely against
what our government stands for at the
moment pencil the sort of outrage
but wait then he so then he petitioned
to have the vulgar old english drinking
song
actually formally introduces no that was
separate to him he just this was him
putting out a fact
this was people randomly realizing we
need to petition he didn't he didn't
push that at all
but then they did adopt the drinking
song of course didn't they yeah
yes exactly um because the star spangled
banner
the tune came from a society in london
called the and that creontic society um
which was like a drinking
club on the strand and in various parts
of london and you would go down and you
drink and you would sing the song
it sort of sounded like an 18th century
burlington club a little bit didn't it
yeah gentlemen hanging out during except
for actually not as fun
because they met once a month and it was
fun on the one hand but it did start
with a three hour long instrumental
concert
no yeah they dropped that and then
it only lasted a few years it came to an
end when the duchess of devonshire
attended one of the meetings and then
they started singing some of these
quite live old songs and she was not
very happy about it at all
and it wasn't just that she wasn't very
happy it was that the people singing
them felt that they couldn't really sing
these rude songs in front of a lady
and so they um slowly stopped singing
them
and then resigned one after another that
same night
it just all went no no actually i'm not
doing this anymore and one after another
they all left until
there was only a couple people left
under the duchess of devonshire
i know i know but i mean that the thing
is that she really wasn't a buzzkill
like georgiana the duchess of devonshire
she was the great great great great aunt
of diana princess of wales
uh and she was really famous for being
kind of a bit out there as far as
chesses were concerned she was always
drinking she was gambling um she got in
real trouble in the election of 1974
because
of claims that she was trading kisses
for votes
not 1974 presumably 1774
well weirdly it's 1784 so i'm not sure i
got
i got the one and the far right that's
all that matters
but yeah um apparently she'd um said
that she would
kiss a particular butcher if he voted
for
this guy fox and then supporters of
william pitt said
well that is just basically akin to
prostitution so
this is going to be a massive scandal
and it became a massive scandal although
it seems when we look at it now from the
future it looks like
that perhaps it wasn't even her who was
saying this it might have been her
sister
wait was her sister saying i will kiss
the butcher or was she saying
i'll get my sister the duchess of
devonshire to kiss you mr butcher
what i believe happened is the sister
said i'll kiss the butcher if you vote
for fox and the
papers thought it was the duchess of
devonshire who's done this
oh so this is like the dodgy relative
who's dragging down
a proper political campaign kind of yeah
although really it was just an excuse
for the pit team to just
you know yeah it's such an ineffective
method of winning an election as well
like if you have to transport someone
around the country kissing everyone
yeah did this poor butcher end up
getting a kiss for god's sake from the
duchess or her sister
that's what i want to know everyone
forgets about the butcher in this story
the she did the butcher got a kiss
i think that was
if she had just said i might give you a
kiss if you vote then it might not have
been so bad but it was the fact that she
did the kiss and then he voted so they
were like yeah that's
bang on prostitution she was
she was a cool dude though it must have
been a bad really bad song for it to put
her off i think if you're ashamed to
sing a song in front of a duchess
then actually you shouldn't have been
singing the song in the first place
yeah but it's very hard isn't it to sing
the star spangled banner so i've never
i've never actually had a crack of it
but apparently it's got 19 semitones in
it and it's just such an inappropriate
song for almost everybody's vocal range
and mostly when you're watching someone
saying it you're just thinking are they
going to hit the high note or not
yeah it was written by a guy called john
stafford smith
when he was still a teenager he was a
lay vicar of westminster and he died at
the age of 85
from a great pit lodged in his windpipe
no well can i can i say something about
this
yeah because i wasted a day i think
trying to track this down so he john
stafford smith who
incidentally never claimed that he'd
written the anthem refused to
acknowledge he'd written it even though
everyone in the society was like yeah
you wrote this now there's like various
books
say that the way he dies was age 85 or
86
from a great pit lodging his throat but
the society the inappropriate society
was named after this ancient greek poet
an acronym
6th century bc poet who also according
to pliny the elder
died from choking on a great pit at the
age of 85 or 86
now this just is this is too much of a
coincidence
someone has popped up those sauces
you're too skeptical
it's definitely you know they're both
famous drinkers
they drank wine what's mine made out of
grapes
it was one of the leading causes of
death for the over 80s
quite recently for about 3 000 years
wasn't it
it was it was back in the days when you
still had pips in the wine it's nice
that we get pitched
wine now isn't it yeah so the the old
vicar sorry he's the one who wrote the
origin did he write the original lyrics
or did you write the two he wrote sorry
oh yeah was you know the
semitones thing that's about the the
famous song yeah so that that was
written by
a guy called francis scott key and he
was 35 years old at the time
when he was on a british ship in the
baltimore harbor
and there was the bombing of fort
mchenry and
he was watching as all the bombs went
down and so on and it was in the dawn's
early light that he saw this massive
flag
the stars and stripes still flying there
from this vantage point on the boat
and he just found it so amazing that he
wrote down
these lyrics for not that song just as a
poem and it got published in a paper
and it got adapted then by someone else
into
that song that we now have seriously
weird moment for him
because the way it happened was he the
war of 1812 was happening in 1814 as it
did
and he boarded a british ship to try and
negotiate the release of this doctor guy
who was a good guy who treated lots of
british soldiers very
well so he boarded this british ship
said look give this our doctor back he's
a nice man
and the british uh guy on the ship the
british general british admiral said
yeah
absolutely you have the doctor would you
mind just waiting
a day because we are about to bomb the
absolute out of this harbor right
in front of us
and so he then have to sit on the ship
while
all the brits on there sort of flatten
his
homeland and then um yeah i guess what
else can he do except write this poem
but the fun thing about it is the flag
probably wasn't actually
the same flag that was flying the next
morning this is according to the history
channel
so when it's like you know just say can
you see
by the dawn's early light the flag that
you're looking at
is actually a new flag they erected that
morning because
the actual flag was so massive and it
was pouring with rain the night of the
battle
it would have been wet and it would have
weighed 500 pounds on the 500 pounds
which would have snapped the flagpole
so actually they had to do a replacement
mini flag
while the battle was going on and then
overnight
the flag erectors got the massive flag
back and
hold it up the flagpole and so in the
morning it was the replaced
large flag that he was looking at so it
hadn't even stayed there during the
battle
it's a it's a full song guys this show
hasn't even gone out yet and already i
can hear the fury of the americans
listening to this episode
i just hear it in my ears let's hit it
with us right now should we talk about
ripley instead he's a great american
um so yeah ripley believe it or not uh
started as a cartoonist
had a bit of spare time and so drew some
cartoons of
crazy things that athletes had done and
that became really really popular and so
the next year he did another one and
then a few years later he started doing
more and more and more of these amazing
unbelievable
feats that people had done and
illustrated them himself and then
eventually that became believe it or not
he's basically a one-man qi it's so
interesting
and he you know he was he loved doing
the thing that cured us to do which is
to debunk
uh commonly accepted truths hence the
national anthem thing
but he the brilliant thing about him was
how much uh
post he got because he was known as rip
uh robert ripley
and um people would write to him in a
series of elaborate codes so they would
write his address backwards
or upside down or in braille or they'd
draw it on in semaphore flags
uh some people apparently would put a
very slight tear
in the letter right i.e a small rip
and they would then post that and see if
it got to him anyway this this became so
popular that the us postmaster general
had to announce that the postal service
would
would no longer be deciphering codes for
people
i said stop all this we just
just write the address on like normal
people
but he was so famous that they they
tended to know to send it to him
yeah absolutely although i do imagine if
that rip thing is true that was he also
getting loads of letters that were
loving letters of daughters to mothers
which had accidentally got a bit ripped
in the post
must be one for rob and also whenever
anyone sent like
some flowers saying r.i.p on them did he
get all those
oh yeah he thought he was much more
loved than he actually was
um he was you say he was a one-line qi i
think he sort of
was james the life he lived was
essentially
traveling around the world but not going
to the normal places most of his travel
going to the really weirdo places so he
could come back and talk about the weird
shitty scenes
he he went to because i'm not sure it
was
i think it is kind of felt like a
compliment until the word weirdo came in
he went to norway and immediately
visited a place called hell which is a
tiny norwegian village just for the sake
of coming back and saying he'd been to
hell
and he went around finding i guess
people who before
the internet existed would would have
been complete
extraordinary people just people from
different cultures
from different tribes and then reporting
on them and no one believed him it was
like quite every time he announced
something everyone refused to believe
him didn't they
would he announce some pretty fruity
stuff in my opinion
oh yeah yeah i mean he
he claimed things like a frenchman once
drank 13 pints of wine in one breath
and you think um okay
well believe it or not what the tragic
thing was the
tragic thing about that was that there
was a single pit a great hit
right at the end he would have done 40.
okay that's it that is all of our thanks

hey everyone welcome to this week's
episode of fish before we begin we just
want to let you know we have a
very special guest on it is the q i
main man himself james harkin who is it
it's james harkin the qi vain man
himself
that's right and the second banana has
joined us this week
as well no it is his name is his name is
alan davis and he is the main big banana
he is the biggest banana of
all the bunch of people who work at qi
he's our absolute
best mate and he's come along to tell us
a load of facts that we didn't already
know that's right
yeah and we also want to just quickly
mention that he has a new book out
it's an extraordinary book it's called
just ignore him and
it is a memoir of which stephen fry
former co-host on cue high
second banana the second banana to alan
uh said it's funny sad frightening sweet
savage and tender
just ignore him will never leave you and
that's what all the critics are saying
about it as well it
has had universal praise and we highly
highly recommend it yeah it's an
absolutely brilliant book
it's just i mean you probably know alan
is just this funny happy-go-lucky guy
but it really really gets down to
what made him who he is and i can't
recommend it enough it's just such a
great great book
uh it's available presumably in all good
bookshops i guess
even the ones even the ones so
definitely go out and get that but in
the meantime
uh you can hear him doing what he does
best which is being unbelievably funny
in this week's show
okay on with the podcast on with the
show
top banana
[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with james harkin
anna tashinsky and special guest it's
alan davis
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with you alan well i've
found for you from the lismore library
in australia an unusual approach
you can borrow a person
[Laughter]
the human library it's called
the human library has started to create
a space
and this is the from the founder ronnie
abagell
you can walk in borrow a human being and
talk to them about a very challenging
topic
ideally we wanted people to talk about
issues they would normally would not
talk about
or don't like to talk about and so you
get you get a human
book and that's a volunteer from a
diverse background where they have
experiences they're willing to share
and they have titles the human books
have titles like
black activist or chronic depression or
survivor of trafficking so i mean
they're not very funny
[Laughter]
is there a comedy section it doesn't
seem to be
it feels like you may have like had a
really really bad edinburgh
experience
[Laughter]
that's a good point about edinburgh
though imagine getting that in your
review
have you thought of being a human book
instead clearly
yeah there is a photo here and it's just
you just sit at a table
for someone you sit on a table with a
human book
and then and you borrow them from for an
amount of time
i mean i don't know it reminds me of
that monty python sketch you know where
you
you get an argument do you remember that
one oh yeah yeah yeah
well what's that someone goes in and
says i've come here for an argument and
they go no you haven't
yeah but i think it must be really
like imagine if you're one of these
books and like you're there for a few
days and no one takes you out that must
be pretty
depressing yeah bad stick
they have a thing where so they all sit
in a sort of waiting room which they
call the bookshelf
and they have a matchmaker so someone
says i want to get a human book out and
the librarian match makes you with
a type of book they give you the list
but but here's an interesting thing
while they're waiting to be chosen it
can obviously get a bit boring there
so they can borrow each other out while
they're waiting
it's like like the toy story toys play
with each other
[Laughter]
sorry i didn't realize i borrowed this
one before
as soon as i got into it i realized i'd
heard it all before
i wouldn't do they have barcodes on them
i mean if you try to smuggle out a book
under your
jacket can you will be alive
[Laughter]
it is a cool idea yeah it's not just
this lismore library in australia so
this was launched back in 2000 in
copenhagen by who
allen mentioned earlier ronnie and a few
others and
it sort of went around to festivals and
they had people where you could rent
them out
at ross kilda festival and so on and
then it sort of the idea latched on and
it's spread out so it's in over 70
countries now that you can go to certain
libraries and they don't always have
them waiting in the back room they're
not just permanently sitting there
it's sort of like on a friday between
the hours of nine and three or something
like that where you have so much
since covered they they have started
doing it
virtually so you can
you can borrow one you know it's all
about diversity and you know
understanding people from other
backgrounds or races or cultures
it's very good yeah it's a good plan
it's it's challenging your
preconceptions i guess isn't it um
making new people making some friends
you know if you're really lonely well
that's it i mean we're now recording
recording this in a second locked and
everyone's sick to the back teeth of all
the people they normally zoom
yeah quiz the quiz market's falling off
a cliff
i know it's like you get sick of the
people you live with and then sick of
the people you zoom
yeah and then i'm sick of my amazon
delivery guy now
[Laughter]
well it's time to go to the human
library yeah
libraries are really trying to branch
out in the modern day right you know
because
people often don't use them anymore so
they say they're trying to get to grips
with the digital age
and now they just hire out loads of
random stuff
so there's this woman barbara stripling
who's the president of the american
library association
and she says that local libraries are
constantly getting calls from people
like
plumbers or electronics specialists
saying do you want to put me in your
books catalogue and you can rent me out
you can hire me out to people who you
know need a plumber
or need to learn about how to wire a
plug and
so actually you can hire people for
practical purposes as well
i think it'd be a weird thing to do to
go to your library as a first port of
cool if your toilet's blocked but
it's worth a try apparently i really i
have a lot of
faith in youtube for all of those things
yeah yes
so yeah i had to sew up uh my
five-year-old's uh one of his paw patrol
toys
that had split down its back oh my god
it was marshall for those of you
interested in the tutorial the best
martial derma
great guy i love him that's the prone
that's why he's funny
yeah and ironically uh it's he's the one
who got split down his back
typical uh and i got a needle and thread
for the first time since i don't know
when this century
and stuff and then thought how do you
finish oh i must have been taught this
at primary school i'm sure but i don't
remember
and i found a youtube video that told me
how to sew
wow and how do you finish you do like a
little knot at the end or something you
don't put it all the way through you
leave a loop and go in that
ah and then do another one of those and
then you're done
i've left i've i've proudly left
marshall on the table
can't wait for my five-year-old to come
over and probably just rip him over
when we started talking about paw patrol
dan was so
much in his comfort zone yeah i've ever
seen him on this podcast he was like
finally fully engaged
um just on anna you were just talking
about things that you could
take out from libraries like curious
things so outside of people you can also
get
really sort of practical things for your
house like like the philadelphia library
allows you to get
cake pans for if you're baking that's
part so you can get a book and a cake
pan
the oakland public library rents out
tools so
hammers and saws and and all that sort
of stuff
and then this is a thing that's becoming
more and more popular libraries in
america
now rent out prom dresses for anyone who
doesn't have
enough money to get a really nice prom
dress that's part of their
thing so they're kind of just turning
into all rounders right like it's no
longer about books
that is not the prom queen is it there's
it's not someone who's got a date to the
prom who's rented out their prom dress
with a library
particularly when it's got that little
label with all the previous stamps on it
yeah oh no one's taken this out since
1959.
wow yeah you can at the ann arbor
library in michigan as well you can rent
out lots of weird
tools and it says we we only stock the
unusual tools that you might not have in
your own house
which is a kind of a good idea right
because with a cake pan
you know i'm only going to make one cake
every three years or whatever so i don't
want to buy
a whole pound for it much better to just
hire it out in my time i've lived with
several unusual tools
they know who they are
um guys this is on books and vaguely
this fact
and we just never mentioned on the show
and i think we should talk about the
fact that boris johnson wrote a novel
in 2004. has any of you read it
i've seen it it's called something
virgins right
very well done it's a certain number of
virgins
72. virgins
it's littered with racial stereotypes
isn't that right
i think i read about it in the guardian
the racial stereotype detectives
well you won't be surprised you know the
telegraph called it effortlessly
brilliant
so your view of the book really depends
this is genius this is exactly what i
think
therefore it must be excellent
it does sound i mean it's extraordinary
first of all
it's about a sort of bumbling gaff prone
bike riding mp
who's vaguely in trouble for a sexual
indiscretion and
it so marina hyde read it so we don't
have to and
tweeted a few of the quotes from it one
quote is boris johnson wrote these words
um she was looking this may sound crude
but is no less than the truth
like a lingerie model only cleverer and
if anything with bigger breasts
jesus christ you just wrote those words
in a book although it is meant to be a
fast
so to be fair well that's what his
premiership was turning into
i read i read an article that suggests
that people who are storytellers like
boris johnson as you say
um have more children than
non-storytellers
really this was a couple of uh
anthropologists who are looking
at the agtar people who live in the
philippines and they're a
hunter-gatherer group and they don't
really
they're one of these groups that aren't
really affected by the western world
very much
and they looked at the people who tell
the stories in the group
and they found that they are more
desirable social partners they ask
people
of all these ones this guy does lots of
um finding food and this guy tells lots
of stories and this guy does a lot of
fixing things who would you most like to
have sex with and most of the people
said they wanted to have sex with the
storytellers
really yeah is that because they don't
have paw patrol to put on for five hours
there so they know whether they have
kids they need someone
who's gonna sit up doing the bedtime
story thing they didn't
they didn't come up with any idea why it
might be the case they just said it was
the case
so interesting yeah well it does figure
doesn't it
kiddo boris maybe the only way to to
shut the storyteller up is to have sex
with them
oh that reminds me of another story
that's a good point yeah fair enough i
was reading about in terms of
um old storytelling traditions in china
they have pingshu which is a version of
the any sort of group that has that one
person who knows all of the stories and
all the traditions of the people and
what led them to this current point
that's their version of it and for a
very long time
these people were so revered that radio
channels would just play them
and farmers would have the radio out
there listening to these long stories
and those classic chinese stories that
date back
from ages and ages ago that they're
simply telling over and over
but as far as i can tell pingshu is a
bit different to other storytellers in
that
while they're telling the story they
break off to give commentary about it
and the commentary is their own personal
opinion which they could go on for
20 minutes or so and it's a tradition
that is kind of still going on so
the old stories aren't engaging the kids
anymore so they have to use news stories
so there's a guy who's been going since
2012 telling in ping-shu
the entire harry potter book series and
he's going to finish it um some he's on
the order of the phoenix right now in
2020
so that's book uh five i believe and so
these little diversions
in in the second book you've got the
three-headed dog in chamber of secrets
he'll then go into greek mythology for
20 minutes to talk about the
three-headed dog
away from the so it's the worst to me
kind of storytelling
yeah you want to hear the story and then
you're suddenly getting 20 minutes about
greek
and thought you know yeah it's like
someone leaning over your shoulder when
you're reading going i love this bit
love this bit oh this guy's awful isn't
he you don't you don't want that i think
it's sounding your own book does it not
sound more like footnotes or something
that's true actually that's true how
quickly i've buckled i'm really into it
now
sounds awesome james do all your
favorite works of fiction and footnotes
well i think the problem is that i don't
really read fiction very much i read a
lot of non-fiction and
what dan's describing sounds more like a
non-fiction thing doesn't it it sounds
more like okay
now we're going to tell you some facts
about kerberos or whatever
and yeah to me that's i guess i just
need to read more fiction
well sometimes you can get like if
you're reading a
dickens book for example yeah his books
are so full of
references of the day yeah they were
written and
you know published as they were magazine
forms full of jokes about characters of
the time
and so the footnotes in those books are
they usually notes at the back of the
volume
the pages and pages here he refers to
and here this is about
and this is a popular song at the time
this is the right of the time and this
is someone think it's hated
yeah that's true you can you can go to
those or
or not yeah i love this actually it's
kind of the best bit sometimes you know
full it's full of weird
facts i think um james i think you found
something recently about how
if um people didn't have somewhere to
sleep for the night but they couldn't
afford a bed in a homeless shower
yeah you could sit up on screen can i
just say
we shouldn't be saying this to ellen
because it will be on qi next year
if it wasn't for the fact that i i 100
know that he will have forgotten it by
the time it goes out
we should be saying it but um yeah and
sorry what did you
[Laughter]
so in victorian times if you didn't have
anywhere to live but you were working in
the city but you needed somewhere to
sleep you could pay one pence and you'd
be able to sit on a bench for the night
or you could pay two pence and you'd be
able to hang over the top of a rope
right the rope would go underneath your
armpits and then you would kind of sleep
there
and that is it dickens isn't it is it
and it's it's like
i remember i read about that in a
footnote in one of the dickens's yeah oh
really yeah
one of the dickenses so they're good
there may be good fiction for you to
start
with james full of footnotes or david
foster wallace if you want more
footnotes than actual
fiction okay any footnotes in the boris
johnson
but um a lot of very arcane references
that yeah you need tons of footnotes for
those
it did sell more than the last book we
wrote just want to make that clear
to criticize
[Laughter]
you eddie izzard's written an
autobiography which is a
great fun especially if you like eddie
but he's got lots of footnotes in it but
so in the audio book that i listen to he
reads the footnotes
but of course eddie's always digresses
and he's in his comedy it's big part of
what it does is digression integration
digression
but instead of just digressing he reads
it as a book so he'll
talk for a bit and then he'll go
footnote and then he'll tell you
something and then he'll say
end of footnote and then he'll carry on
talking and then he'll go
footnote after a while
[Music]
i love it i love eddie dearly but i
could not listen to that
yeah edit those out maybe he'll hear
this and go back and edit the footage
straight back to hillary mantell
[Laughter]
chapter 907 oh god
don't get me started
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hey everyone this week's episode of fish
is sponsored by the great courses plus
yep the great courses plus it is the app
or the website that you can sign
onto and get access to dozens and dozens
hundreds in fact of lectures
on any topic under the sun delivered by
the world's best
lecturers yeah that's right it literally
has everything you could hope to learn
about so for me as a pop culture fan and
a massive beatles fan there's a great
one at the moment called england the
1960s and the triumph of the beatles
and this is a particularly cool course
because it's not just about the beatles
it's all about the culture of what led
to the beatles being created so what
were the influences coming into
liverpool at the time
how when the beatles went to america
were they used for propaganda as the
cold war was being fought there's
so many interesting things that they
were a part of this course has it all
that's right and weirdly on a completely
different attack i've been
listening to a course currently about
white collar crime not because i
intend to get involved in it just wanted
to understand it a bit more
but it is excellent and you can switch
the courses to being just audio so you
can listen to them out on a run or
something or you can watch the
videos and if you want to try this out
you can go to
thegreatcoursesplus.comfish
and our listeners can get a free month
of unlimited access to the whole library
that's right go to the great courses
plus that's p l u s
dot com slash fish and you will get a
whole free month
of beatlemania in your ears as well as
white collar crime and so on
all right on with the show on with the
show
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
anna my fact this week is that it's
illegal
in the uk to tickle a trout
truck tickling yeah they don't like it
no they do like it that's the problem so
i guess anyone have you guys ever
have you guys heard of trout tickling
you familiar with the concept have you
ever tickled trout yourselves yeah we
have it in the dark
can i just check that trout's not a
euphemism
i don't want to be kind of uncool and
know that you're all talking about the
penis
[Laughter]
it's an angling thing that goes back
many hundreds of years and
fishermen will talk about it and it's
what you do is you dip your hat if
you're trying to catch a trout without a
rod
then you dip your hands in the water i
was actually speaking to someone i know
who
says he's done it yesterday dip your
hands in the water and you sort of want
to chase a trout
under a rock they'll hide from me under
a rock then you go underneath the trout
and you pull your hands up gradually
until you're touching it
and then you want to touch it at the
tail end and then just sort of tickle
its little belly
creeping your fingers up in a weird and
pervy way until you've tickled it right
up to the head and it makes them go
completely emotionless they seem to love
it
or it at least makes them catatonic
i've heard of it they go into a sort of
a trance exactly but that's illegal
it's illegal because it's
um well so there's a lot of angry people
online who say it's a hangover from
classism of the olden days essentially
because it's thought of as poaching
because you if you don't have a rod then
you can easily pretend that you weren't
trying to poach fish
from a river so it's a way of getting
away with stealing fish from someone's
river
without permission and so it's illegal
you've got to fish with a rodden line or
a net
you're allowed to do it if you're if
you're on your own property and you have
your own river going through your own
property
and i think you are let's do it right
it's only in public
lands yeah right i think i remember
years ago i was on holiday with bill
bailey
in indonesia and we went on this river
doing some sort of canoeing or rafting
or something anyway
it was idyllic mountains and trees and
tropical
foliage everywhere and floating down the
river and i thought this is perfect i
want a paradise i understand my bill
comes here all the time it just really
takes you away from everything
he'd always say never got asthma while
he was there there's no pollution et
cetera et cetera
then we go around the bend in the river
and there's a local gentleman
with a car battery slung over his
shoulder
connected to a metal pole wading in the
river
electrocuting fish oh my god
so suddenly completely removed from the
ecstasy
of communing with with nature
the brutal reality it's kind of the only
time i've ever seen
and seen a car battery used like that
was in a film about the craze when they
were torturing someone
i mean it's very resourceful you're
gonna get more fish that way really
really effective yeah oh wow
i think they do try to uh people who
actually have permission to try to kill
trout like that
in fact so i think they're invasive
trout in
yellowstone lake which are eating up all
the
trout that are supposed to be there and
they've tried to electrify the whole
lake
by so electrocuting all the eggs but the
water didn't conduct it well enough
because so you've got to make sure
you've got the voltage for it
yeah um and actually what they did and
this is really creepy
is they so this is yellowstone lake and
the native trout are the cutthroat trout
which is confusing because they're the
good guys
who are meant to be there and the
invasive trout
have come in they're eating them all up
and so the way eventually researchers
have managed to get rid of the invasive
trout one of the ways
is they suffocate the invasive ones by
dumping
loads of dead fish in the water and then
that removes the oxygen from getting
stops the oxygen from getting in
and the eggs don't survive so you see
them like tipping
all these fish back into the water
suffocated by their own parents but it's
it's all in honor of saving the
cutthroat trout so it's actually
sort of a good thing depending on which
side of that fence you're falling on
the sound of the cutthroat trout yeah
how do they survive all the lack of
oxygen though
they hang out in slightly different
parts of the lake and
so you just gotta pick your spot got it
right
um chart tickling's mentioned in
shakespeare isn't it i reckon if you
looked in the um
in the footnotes it would be there it's
in 12th
night when malvolio walks in and
malfolio's a bit stupid
maria says here comes the trout that
must be caught with tickling
i don't know that might be one of um
shakespeare's weird sexy jokes that no
one gets but
i don't know yeah oh can you imagine the
righteous laughter
i actually i saw stephen fry big now
malvolio and
it was genuinely riotous laughter he's
quite a talented manager that's stephen
fry but yeah
i don't remember that specific line this
um i was reading as well about these
methods of
uh unconventional fishing so
electrifying
and using car batteries in the water to
get fish and one of the ways a lot of
people do it
is using dynamite so dynamite fishing
you pop a bunch of dynamite and
blows up all the fish raised to the
surface and you collect them
and that's a big problem for a lot of
places where there's coral reefs because
they're absolutely decimating
all of these coral reefs and in the
philippines it's a big problem in
particular
so in 2010 a group called the sea
knights
decided to do something about it
philippines is very very religious
and so what they did was where the coral
reef was they dumped at the bottom of
the ocean a 14 foot tall statue of the
virgin mary
so that if anyone came by they would see
the virgin mary in the ocean
and want to pray to her as opposed to
decimate her
with dynamite so yeah so they've gone
back
uh in 2018 eight years later and it
seems to have worked
she's covered in coral it's growing on
her now and all the coral in the area
seems to be vibrant again
because no one's blowing it up and it's
bringing a lot of tourists in so if you
want to stop
yeah any illegal poaching just pop a
virgin mary into your area
and you should be fine popping your
virgin mary into your area again does
sound like a humanism
but that is ingenious it's better than
popping a virgin mary out of your area
or is it i don't know in scotland
it look it looks like it's known as
guddling
it is that's what my friend called it
yesterday he does it in the highlands
cuddler trout in scotland it's like
you're talking about this
it's a bit like cuddling isn't it
tickling and cuddling and
touch it into a trance it's a wonderful
skill yeah
i read one person who does it who says
you need to be very gentle
and with a delicate touch much as though
you are caressing your lover
you then of course fry on the barbecue
after you've gutted them
[Laughter]
technically gobbitting if you ever want
to know the term
specifically for trout if you're gutting
a trout or chopping up a trout it's
called gobleting
according to a book of carving from 1508
so i don't know if it's in common news
anymore
a few workshop programs on bbc two i
think about
it's called scotland from the sky no
yeah i think i have seen it
it's really good and it's a kind of
history
history of scotland from the sky so
aerial photography
but in getting to the sky and you
there's all kinds of
lost history that's rediscovered
and one of the things they were talking
about in the last
i watch it with my daughter she loves it
and the last one was
the lost herring industry scotland used
to have this huge
herring industry and they used to export
herring by the hundreds of tons
to particularly to russia and germany
and those markets disappeared
with the second world war but they would
have herring girls and herring girls
could
gut herring they had footage black and
white footage of herring girls with
buckets full of hair and gutting them at
a terrific rate
gutting up 40 fish in a minute it's
absolutely extraordinary kind of lost
art and lost industry that i wonder why
it was the girls who did it
the boys were on the boats and the girls
were doing the gutting and that's how
that's how it worked i remember reading
about those herring girls and
they used to you know they were all
really cliquey and they would like
do all their gutting in the daytime and
then they'd all go to the bars in the
evening
and they would never go home in between
so they'd go to the bars and they'd be
covered in herring guts and
you know blood and whatever yeah really
messy business the smell must be
unbelievable
that's a human library book you wouldn't
want to sit in the bathroom
please oh my god
yeah scotland from the sky it's worth a
watch there's another thing in there
about creating this
they kind of can't create fish traps by
building a kind of l-shape out of rock
into a tidal river and as the tide goes
out fish get caught up here in the
l and then the catch it was incredibly
efficient way of catching
fish so much so that they had too many
and then they ended up dead fish were
poisoning the locks it became
it was made illegal sometime in the 19th
century but yeah
yeah ingenious ways of trapping fish
the scots are all over it
[Laughter]
feels like cheating to me yeah
um you know we had a conversation a few
weeks ago about how did all the fish
get in the lakes oh yeah and this weird
mystery
and alan any guesses you know when
you've got legs
[Laughter]
they just used to be amoeba okay cut to
10 million years
um even darwin doesn't agree with you
there so darwin
saw that the way that the fish had got
into the lakes was the eggs that little
fish eggs that attached to bird feathers
and then in the sea and then birds had
flown and sort of dropped them over
lakes which is
generally how people thought these fish
got in lakes
but christian christians just laughing
at you now
[Laughter]
you know we can all say that it went
from amoeba to fish in the lake but
you know you need the perfect conditions
to create life
and liquid and you've got to be in the
goldilocks zone james okay
got it it's not it's not lancashire
life on earth did not start in
lancashire i know you credit a lot of
things with language that's where life
on earth did not begin
but that is where it reached its
absolute peak
[Laughter]
humans are officially going downhill now
uh are you gonna tell us where these
fish came from yeah so they don't
we think there's no evidence that this
happens although it tends to be what
everyone still thinks is the cause of
fish ending up in lakes
but then the latest theory which a few
people sent us after the show because it
was on a podcast that same week when we
mentioned it
and i think it was jim alcaledi was
saying that jamal khalidi podcast inside
science
that birds eat this is going to sound
even more ridiculous to the creationists
but
birds eat fish eggs but fish eggs
actually survive
going through their digestive tracts
with some fish and then they poo them
out when they're flying over a lake
and the eggs end up in the lake i'll go
with that
you know this is going to annoy the
christians even more
the reason you got fish in lakes is acts
of god you know
huge storms where sea creatures get
swept up into the air and then
rained on land and all this is always an
act of god right
it's god's throwing fish down he must be
annoyed or happy or he's got too many
fair shares
he's having to clear out and they land
in the lakes
yeah yeah some stuff on trout maybe
yeah um female trouts fake orgasms i'm
sure you guys saw this
um so when a female is ready to spawn
she kind of quivers a little bit and
that kind of turns the male on
and then he gives her his sperm
um but sometimes she will do that when
she's not going to release any eggs
because it makes all the other trout in
the area horny
and it's either that then she gets a
really good mix of dna from all the
different
trout or that all the males then start
fighting each other and so she ends up
with the best possible
male uh clever yeah yeah
they so this was a study that was done
by the swedish
national board of fisheries a guy called
eric peterson
and they checked out 117 different
spawnings and they found that 69
were false they were false orgasms and i
just like
this very sexy number landed on
that's sexy
all this just makes me think of mike
trapp the
baseball player familiar with mike trout
i am
he's like the best baseball player ever
isn't he it's one of the all-time greats
he signed a contract in 2019
with the uh the la angels uh for 426
million dollars
wow it was the singer at the time of
signing it was the single biggest
contract in the history of sport ever
he's an extraordinary baseball player
and i've actually seen him play
i loved baseball when i was in toronto
working and i went to see the blue jays
play
and there he was and a guy when i went
with a guy a canadian guy i was working
with and he said
fill me in and that's trout that is
trout that
you're you're you are in the presence of
greatness
the main thing that i know about him um
is that they sold a baseball card of his
for like 5 million quid or something
last year or this year maybe
and it was the most that anyone's ever
spent on a baseball card
um wow and i think like what i always
thought about that was
he is only and i think he's in his late
20s isn't he so
there's so many chances that he gets
cancelled in the next five or six years
and that card
just becomes complete
you can't not be a fan of anyone except
people whose careers are over just in
case they
i think that that part by fans are
bought by collectors
aren't they like the most money ever
spent on
a card before that i don't know the name
of the guy but
they only ever made one or two of these
cards because he hated smoking
and he refused to let cigarette
companies sell his card
and so they made one or two of them and
he wasn't even a great baseball player i
don't think but they
you know it became really rare and then
people paid millions of dollars for it
wow all right mike trout you want to
tickle my trout that's the most
expensive possibly if you trickle my
trout into a
trance yeah you're winning is this one
of these people
he'd probably be good at any sport i
mean he could do anything yeah
field any position hit do anything
better than ever
so what you need is the keeper the
keeper behind him
just slowly tickling his bum as he's
going to hit
i don't know much about baseball rules
but i can't think that's a lot is it
very rarely do it's not really a contact
sport in that sense you're
going to get many opportunities to
really tip into a cobra but if you get
one take it
yeah just one more thing on trout uh
that i really liked is
coral trout which are these beautiful
red uh spotty
fish in the west west of the pacific
ocean and they
are doing this really clever thing which
it was previously thought was only
possible
for great apes and for ravens you know
ravens were always
super clever and essentially they
recruit other animals
to help them hunt and so they'll chase
prey smaller fish into crevices but they
are too big and fat to squeeze into the
crevices
so they recruit eels and octopuses
because octopuses have tentacles
to get them out for them and they do
that by going up to them and performing
this series of signals which essentially
says hey can you come on a hump with me
wow and so they do kind of head stands
they'll flip over onto their head and
wiggle around
and they'll do specific like head shakes
and then they'll lead an eel or an
octopus to
where they've chased this bit of prey
and they'll point
at where they've got to go to get it out
and it's they're the only animals
aside from apes and ravens who are known
to do referential gestures as in
you know you're pointing at something
and they'll point and they'll say can
you go in there and get some of those
fish out
and in return the eel or the octopus
which like puts its arm in there
gets a little bit of the fish catch as
well so they get to share it
that's amazing like i'm even quite
impressed by the eel in this situation
because like if i point at something to
my cat
the cat has no idea what i'm pointing at
she just looks at my finger
right yeah so the fact that the eel even
knows that that's what he's pointing at
i just
[Laughter]
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that
is james okay my fact this week is that
all of the cheese eaten
on antarctica is past its expiration
date
yummy
well this is well first of all i saw
this on a video on the pbs youtube
page and it was an interview with tom
sente who's the culinary manager
in the mcmurdo galley and he was talking
about how they got all the food in and
he says basically all the food comes by
boat
and it takes so long to get to
antarctica and most of this cheese has
got an expiration date of maybe
one month two months three months by the
time it gets there it's always out of
date
but they are in antarctica so luckily
it's very cold they can just freeze it
and it's all fine
but technically if they were in the shop
they wouldn't be able to sell it
and you can always just scrape the mold
off i suppose once it gets there
but yeah exactly it's cheese cheese yeah
that's forever doesn't it
yeah okay exactly
drop food out of a plane
every now and then i think like once
every three or four months and only in
the summer they do have
a plane that comes with food but they
can only fit so much in there and so
they always go for the really fresh
stuff like salad and
vegetables and fruits and stuff like
that because they can get away with the
cheese they don't bring cheese in there
so this is the last place at
[Laughter]
your rider has left the restaurant he'll
be with you in nine months
and then you look
[Laughter]
it's a really amazing video this video
um you get to see it's a sort of
journalist going around and showing you
all of the canteens that you meet all
the chefs and
basically as james says it's not just
the cheese that's expired
basically most of the food has expired
and it's all frozen
and they have a fraser which is that
expiration dates or a
suggestion i suppose as a thing that you
meant to take for real
um but the way that they have to plan
for these big ship containments of food
to come in
mean that they're making a million meals
and they have to plan that 18 months in
advance
for every time those shipments come so
it's a huge operation
it's mad level of meal planning me as
someone who decides half an hour in
advance what i'm having for dinner
it must be hell being the chefs and they
get probably good chefs don't they so i
think
i was reading an interview with the
british chef
who says it's it's quite a fun job
because it's such a challenge but
he'll make thai curry and moroccan
tagine and meatballs and burritos and
this is all with ingredients that
arrived
sort of eight months earlier and you do
so he has to put in an order it's like
the most high pressure tesco order ever
you put in an order once a year for all
the food ingredients you're gonna need
to last an entire year
if you forget coriander that's it you're
done for
but it says on the on the youtube
channel that if you don't get a delivery
there's a lot of fish obviously in
antarctica if you can catch it
but other than that all there really is
to eat is sealed placenta
[Laughter]
which the penguins love apparently
what's wrong with the rest of the seal
it's supposed to be the best bit
you could eat a seal i suppose you don't
have to catch the presenter
[Music]
they did used to bludgeon seals back in
the day sort of when
scott was there and they would take the
blubbery bits and they would mix that
into a
porridge that they would make to sort of
use that um
which is disgusting but they're not
allowed to do that anymore because
there's this whole antarctic treaty
which got set up which sort of yeah the
old
antarctic boring treaty that they set up
um
which means you can't yeah you can't do
that anymore you can't sort of
beat any species
it's political greatness gone mad i
think we all agree
it does sound like they ate better back
in the day like scots
expedition obviously famously he didn't
eat very well towards the end
but when he was an antarctic before he
went to find the south pole he lived at
cape evans in a hut which sounded like
they were living the life of riley
so he wrote in his diary all the meals
they had and they'd have things like
sort of several courses they'd have
turtle soup they had
uh stewed penguin breast in red currant
jelly
they were having crystallized ginger and
champagne they cooked they used penguin
blubber as
oil to cook it and although apparently
it didn't taste very nice so
they were really i mean before he ended
up accidentally going on an expedition
where he only brought half the calories
he needed
then he was living the high life most
interesting thing about scott though
is that he is the spitting image the
doppelganger
of john lloyd the uh
the reason that we all know one another
the creator of
the creator of qi and i know this
because i went so i was touring in new
zealand and i went to a museum in
christchurch
and because a lot of the antarctic
expeditions set off from new zealand
and they had a a replica of the
of a hut that they were going to take
with them and erect when they got there
and it's
that one you think about how you think
of a shed but this was really
enormous several rooms and planks of
wood and tables
and then a picture of it's the biggest
double take i've ever done in my life
on the wall dressed in some 100 year old
explorer outfit standing in a heart in a
sepia photograph was john lloyd
[Laughter]
it's extraordinary it's a little known
fact that the reason captain oates left
the tent is
because scott was just telling me all
these tedious facts
another quite interesting thing about
penguins
i maybe sometime no it's quite
interesting
eating penguins can be quite good for
you or it was back in the day because it
contains vitamin c which would help you
get scurvy
chocolate chocolate on the outside
i should have taken more penguins on
that expedition
200 000 penguins they have all lived
the um the belgica uh when that got
stopped
in antarctica in 1897 they decided they
were going to eat penguins to stop them
from getting scurvy
and so but they needed to catch some
penguins right so they came up with a
rule where
every time that someone caught a penguin
they would give them
some money and just try and encourage
people to go and catch penguins
but then they realized that all you had
to do was play a tune
on your trumpet and the penguins would
just come and stand right next to you
because they loved the music so much
and that became the way that they caught
them all and so
first of all they would play the cornet
or the trumpet and then there was one
guy who pulled out his banjo and started
playing a long way to temporary and
apparently the penguins loved that and
they would come right up to him
and hang out with him and then one
scottish member of the expedition
started to play the bagpipes
and apparently the penguins fled in
terror and plunged back into the sea
i went to the professor once and stayed
in a hotel on princess street
and uh it's pretty busy princess trees
you know but it's very very very quiet
in the morning apart from
10 a.m outside waverly station
a bagpiper starts up and that i've never
in my life wanted an air rifle more than
ever
i think we can all empathize i'd like to
borrow that from a library
yeah um the antarctic was known as the
womanless continent
for a long time uh because there weren't
any women there
basically uh good name yeah there was um
the first women to
uh go and stay further evidence that
women are a bit
a little bit less stupid than men
so men just kept sailing to this place
getting out and dying and then other
ones would think those men were idiots
i won't die if i go there then they go
there and die as well
well i want to take credit but actually
women were desperate to go weren't they
they were the first women to actually go
and spend
like a year on the continent where uh
two women called jackie ronnie and jenny
darlington
and they were actually the wives of two
explorers
and all the other men on the expedition
signed the petition trying to stop it
from happening
and when the two women arrived on the
antarctic base
one person who was already there fled in
fright thinking that he'd gone mad
because he saw two women in antarctic
that's how surprising it was
okay um but
women were explicitly banned from
antarctica until the 60s and 70s in
america and the uk
so as in british and americans banned
them
and it wasn't because we were too smart
because thousands of women were applying
right from the start of antarctica
exploration
and they were bound on partly on the
grounds that they tried to seduce
everyone's husbands so
i think the first woman who eventually
went out with the british antarctic
survey janet thompson
she had to go round and properly meet
and talk to all the
wives of the teammates that she'd be
going with to convince them that she was
an actual scientist and not just going
out to seduce all of their husbands
which were a huge effort to go to there
was another quote from the british
antarctic
survey a few years later i think which
when a bunch of women applied to go to
antarctica
and were turned down they would turn
down on the grounds that
there are no facilities for women in the
antarctic no shops
no hairdressers wow
and even like these days there are more
men there but
the you know it's getting more and more
level i think the u.s antarctic program
is about
60 to 65 men but in the 1980s
they had there was so many men there and
so few women that they had something
called the sistine ceiling
uh in wedding hut in antarctica which
was basically the ceiling of this whole
hut was covered in
uh naked pornographic pictures of women
and in the 1980s there was an attempt by
some australians
to turn that ceiling into an australian
national heritage site of high
significance
so what do you mean they kept it as it
is they wanted to
put it back as it was and um you know
have it as some special
site that is protected it's a bit of a
mystery that they're so important to
have a visual
stimulus that you have to have the image
in front of you
yeah you can't just can't just picture
somebody naked in your head some people
can't i just can't think of anyone i'm
going to have to look at
an actual photograph oh there's one yes
some people can't picture things in
their head i can't picture things in my
head
and that's why your ceiling is covered
in pool isn't it
as i say the pinnacle of human evolution
i keep pointing them out to my cat she's
not interested
there's a load of wheels
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hi everybody just wanted to let you know
that this week we are sponsored by
ask it yes now ask it they are a
clothing company but they're not just
any old clothing company
they're a clothing company that say
don't buy clothes off us unless
you really need them yes that's right
they
want people in general to buy less
clothing
to keep it longer to wear those items
more to reduce the kind of throwaway
culture because reducing consumption is
the only thing that's actually going to
reduce
impact on the planet yeah and on top of
that if you go to their website you can
see a lot of information about their
garments so
you can see how much carbon they use to
create them how much water they use to
create them
it's really quite a clever way of doing
things and we have
actually got some mascot clothes
ourselves and i gotta say they are very
high quality i got a pair of jeans i got
a nice jacket
i got sweatshirt amazing you might think
from all the
you know environmental impact stuff they
just sent you hair shirts and sort of
sackcloth and things like that actually
they're really nice clothes
as james says they've sent us some of
them and the things they've sent me i've
worn and watched loads of times and they
are still as good as new
so if you want to find out what ask it
is all about then all you have to do is
go to ask it that's
a-s-k-e-t dot-com and just buy some
clothes but only if you want clothes
only if you need clothes that's right
ask it a-s-k-e-t
dot-com okay on with the podcast on with
the show
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that in 1990 a
british airways flight landed
with one pilot in the cockpit and the
other hanging by his legs outside the
front window
it's an extraordinary story so this was
uh british flight
539-0 it left birmingham and it was
heading for malaga in spain
and um they were just under 15 minutes
into their flight they were cruising at
17
300 feet over oxfordshire when suddenly
there was this huge loud bang in the
cockpit
the window on the pilot side on the
left-hand side suddenly flung away from
the plane
and exposed the plane to all the air on
the outside and the decompression was so
great
that the door that blocks off the pilots
from the rest of the uh
plane got ripped off its hinges straight
into the control panel
as well as the pilot who got ripped out
of the window of the plane and
only didn't disappear because his legs
got caught on the control panel
so he was just being whacked back and
forth on the plane on the outside
and um the story goes that there was a
first officer who came in to see if they
needed refreshments which i don't quite
believe
i think when the door is ripped off and
the plane
is sent into a descent um he comes in
anyway he sees the pilot
outside the front window and quickly
runs and grabs his legs
and has to hold him and the story ends
with them having to make an emergency
landing
they spend 22 minutes from the moment
that it happens to landing
and they successfully land and um he's
alive it's an extraordinary survival
story but that's the other brilliant bit
about this story
that i liked was two things one was that
the the flight attendants were taking
in turns to hang on to him because it
was really exhausting and freezing cold
the air was thin they were and they but
also that they thought he was
dead they thought they were hanging on
they thought they were hanging on to a
dead person
and the reason that they kept hanging on
was because they were worried
that if they let go he might get sucked
into the engine
he was unconscious right he lost
consciousness so it's only when that
they landed and they kind of
i don't know how delicately they dragged
him back into the windows
[Laughter]
to their amazement he was rushed to
hospital
wow and that's good i hope they never
told him i hope he woke up and said god
thank you so much for saving my life and
they didn't say
no mate we were just trying to stop you
up the engines
it is extraordinary pretty incredible
when the guy
the one of the flight attendants got
frostbite in his eye
wow and suffered per ptsd but they
there's such a suction that they they
think that is
the equivalent weight of 500 pounds they
were hanging on to
so really terrific feat of endurance and
strength to save
this guy or really it's a bizarre story
what is that that's about the weight of
sort of four people isn't it
yeah yeah yeah wow well well two
large blocks
it's fake it's like two greg davis
and seeing it all i mean it's kind of
amazing that the passengers got to see
everything
yeah i think that's that's a real perk
for the anecdote
purposes once you're back on earth so
the door blew off or would you rather
not know what was happening maybe
certainly at the time you'd rather think
everything was fine into handy but
yeah then you get two weeks in
southampton
um what i found amazing is that in 2018
this happened again
so there was a sicilian there's a
sichuan airlines
plane going to tibet and there was again
the windscreen went
and the pilot got sucked out and the
co-pilot said i looked over to my side
and half of my co-pilot's body was
hanging out of the window
fortunately he was wearing a seat
seatbelt so
they only got halfway out and they
managed to pull him back in
but apparently it's a thing that happens
that is an advert for seat belts if you
haven't
really i don't ever totally see that off
in a plane
does go wrong it's not by chance so i
will probably be all right anyway
no you'll definitely go out the window
we should say so the reason that this
happened was because the windscreen
itself had been refitted to the plane
the night before
and the wrong bolts had been used to
secure it so they were
half a millimeter too small and so it
just couldn't handle the intense air
pressure once it was up there and that's
why it blew out
so since then they've changed it so that
they've stopped bolting them out
a from the outside they now do it from
the inside which um
it just apparently is a bit more helpful
and they make sure to use the proper
bolts this is just for anyone who's
currently on the plane listening to us
it's not going to happen again don't
worry okay good to know they're making
sure to use the proper bolts how about
reassuring it's i mean it's amazing the
stuff that can
go wrong there was this 1983 canada
flight
where the pilots have to check this so
you check the fuel levels before you
take off so you know how much fuel to
put
in the tank for your journey and they
were a bit understaffed so the pilots
had to do the checking themselves and
they did it
their electronic system was broken so
they had to use a dipstick so
they just dip the dipstick into the fuel
tank pulled it out you've got to figure
out the volume from that
and then from that they have to do the
calculations to figure out the mass of
fuel so they know how much to add and to
add an extra complication they just
switched to the metric system
which confused them so they used the
wrong calculation they used a
calculation as if they were converting
to pounds
rather than kilos which given that 2.2
pounds is one kilogram meant they ended
up with just
under half the amount of fuel they
needed and because their systems were
broken they didn't get a warning until
the plane engine just completely cut off
and they started plummeting out the sky
and fortunately the captain was an
experienced glider pilot which always
comes in handy
and so he glide them down just about
to safety although he did break the nose
off the plane
but it's quite confusing was that pilot
hero or was he a
i mean he did up the calculations
yeah
it's interesting isn't it that pl uh
planes they can glide down can't they
really in theory a an airplane is
designed
so that even if both of the engines go
it can
glide for quite a long time and actually
the chance of surviving depends on how
high you are because
obviously the higher you are the further
you can get and the easier it is to get
to an actual airport
and apparently i was talking to my wife
about this who is a helicopter pilot as
you guys know and
i was asking her like if we were flying
in a helicopter and she collapsed
would i be able to land the helicopter
and she reckons that there's about a 50
50 chance that i would be able to do it
no way and survive that's what she
reckons i reckon yeah
it seems she dies into this whole thing
about your family being the peak of
england
she thinks you're an actual genius she
thinks i could jump out and just fly
down but
james when you say she collapses is she
still telling you
what to do or not just taking control
she said that the main problem first of
all would be throwing her body out of
the helicopter
uh and getting the controls before it
went out of control but if i manage to
do that
why do you need to throw the body out
what if that it's that pilot situation
again she's just fallen unconscious it's
quite a small helicopter and you know i
just want to
look we don't want to drop a stretch i
want to stretch my arms
i gotta say the the 50 side of you
surviving kind of makes you a dick
if you do survive it's not there's a lot
of
unfortunate things you need to do to
survive there apparently i wouldn't be
able to hover but i'd be able to
probably make quite a hard landing
uh and that's a crash right that's it
it's a crash but the survival would be
the survival would be approximately 50
but i don't know right that's what she
says
um i had my favorite plain base story
from the year
is one that i read about a couple of
months ago but it's that
a there was a french businessman 64
years old
and his colleagues got him a present and
they got him like an experienced present
and what they got him was a flight on a
fighter jet and this was in spite of the
fact as he said afterwards he'd never
expressed any interest at all in planes
or fighter jets
or desire to go in one so they got in
this fight in this amazing question
and he it took off and he felt really
unstable he said he sort of flew off his
seat as it took off because you know
gfos and everything
and he grabbed at the nearest lever to
try and stabilize himself
and what that lever was was the ejection
mechanism
so he he accidentally ejected himself
from the plane so the roof flies up the
plane
he flies out of the plane and had to
surprise parachute land into a field
and be taken immediately to hospital
where he was absolutely fine
but resentful of his colleagues
that's so funny i i think the ejection
mechanism shouldn't be that accessible
well you do need to if you're kind of
imagine if it wasn't accessible and you
did actually want to leave the blade
yes and then you have to you have to
solve a rubik's cube just to get out of
the plane
or something else yeah
my first is
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening
if you'd like to get in contact with any

hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with anna toshinski
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with fact number one and that
is
andy my fact is that one in three people
in the uk
has seen the queen in real life wow so
that's insane feels high to me there are
about 70 million people in the uk
shouldn't we start off with a survey of
the people on this zoom
yes 100 and i've got some extra data to
add actually i know that
dan has for sure because dan's actually
properly met the queen
i went to buckingham palace you've slept
with her haven't you
i'm sure you could be arrested for this
kind of comment
now the treason cast okay so dan has
debunking palace garden party fine
anna i don't think so
okay i meet a lot of people you know
we should ask the queen
[Laughter]
have you seen her though anna like have
you with your eyes
in public scene no no not in public the
only reason i hesitate is because i know
my
siblings have met her because my
brother's called charlie and um
she meets all the children it's a
ceremony every year
are they like swans they're like the uk
swans all the charlie's
to he got a golden ticket in some
chocolate that let him meet the queen
didn't they
yeah um the wrong way around because
my dad for his job meant that my parents
met her and
my mum was holding my brother charlie
was a baby at the time and the queen
said to my mom
uh what's he called and she said charlie
and the queen said oh
i've got little charlie as well wow
that's awesome
which is weird because he would have
been about 30 at that point
okay so no
well i think i have seen her it's kind
of i was very young when it happened i
think when
when i was 10 years old she came to
bolton right okay
to celebrate bolton's 150th birthday
and i think i stood on the street and
saw her go past
and i looked on the bolton even news
website to see
what happened and they said that
everyone from age 9 to 11 was given the
morning off to go and see the queen and
i would have been tense that makes sense
but i asked my mum and she didn't
remember at all
and i'm like yeah but mum i have kind of
a memory and it's in the bolt leaving
news that we were there so surely it
must have happened and she said well i
had three young children and a full-time
job so how the hell am i supposed to
remember
stuff but i think i might have done
two days a half yeah okay i'm a i'm a
yes
oh yeah she was visiting the university
i was at and she walked past
um but no no face time with her no
personal contact
um but i've also i've also asked uh ann
miller and alex bell uh the other uh
regulars
and they have both seen the queen and
was a child and alex was i think an
ascot or something and saw a
yellow blur in the distance yeah which
he claims was the queen
was she on a horse a yellow flare yeah
she came in third she did really well
um but that's how many is that that's
one two and a half with james
i think andy i really do think honestly
i think i've seen her
so that's five out of six that's
something am i one and a half because
i've touched her
am i in a different camp you're not
allowed to dan that's the main thing
what are you talking about you're not
allowed to touch the queen of course you
are no
well she touched me she touched me
your honor
but this that's that's one of the main
rules there's no touching but there are
there aren't really any rules right it's
just kind of etiquette in fact on the
royal family website i think maybe
they're trying to play it cool
but they strictly say there are no
obligatory codes of behavior at all when
you beat the queen
you can pull your trousers down if you
like um
dan you actually did pull your pants
down didn't you and said hey
yeah i've got a little charlie of my own
oh no
oh next week's episode coming to you
live from the tower of london
it is nerve-wracking though all the
protocols so i met her
at buckingham palace it was part of a
party in
celebration of her heading to australia
and i got sent an invitation
as supposedly a notable australian which
is so bizarre
and um you get with the invitation you
get this extraordinary list of protocol
of how you approach the queen if you
meet her what to say
how to use mom the first time and then
her majesty this that's i've got the
order wrong in that but it's stuff like
that we've also got so much junk sorry
you've also got the pronunciation wrong
according to the royal family official
website
they're very strict it's ma'am it's the
only bit of protocol they say is a rule
a dress as mam as in jam well she's from
the northeast
isn't she so she always calls herself
matt that's not it's never mum
it's always mad yeah but sorry dad go on
no i'm just saying with all that playing
in your head it's a very nerve-wracking
experience
to you so you find it very hard to be
present in the moment when you're
meeting the queen and shaking her hand
uh philip less so because you're just
waiting for him to say something a bit
rude with all those australians
yeah exactly he just had to bite his
tongue he genuinely when i
shook hands with him he kind of lent in
as if he was going to say something and
just went
not worth it because this little shake
of his head just went uh
i don't need this today
but he didn't say not worth it no no you
could tell with his look his eyes said
well because i got in a fight later on
with
one of his sons prince edward i mean uh
who came up
who won he did because i was in his
house he kind of just sort of
won it by default he knows where the
weapons are yeah
he doesn't like qi by the way so he kind
of insulted all of us
yeah he said oh is it that pompous show
with the pompous stephen fry who
pretends to know all these facts
well at least he has seen it yeah
[Music]
christ i think the royal family wants to
talk about pomposity
yeah that's true stephen fry never
insisted on a gold carriage
not for the first three series anyway
so dan you're not the only eminent
australian to have met uh the queen
i mean it would be insane if you were
but um this sort of ties in with the
touching thing and the etiquette about
not
uh touching the queen uh unless she
you're shaking hands with her or
whatever
but she visited australia in 1992 which
i guess was the
time before dan your garden party with
her but the pm at the time paul keating
he put his arm around her um not in a
kind of
cinema yawn stretch way but
he sort of just put his put his hand on
the small of her back and the british
papers called him
the lizard of oz as a result yeah
one newspaper wrote mr keating in
placing his hand in the center of her
back
was actually touching that little
fastener which is the miniature linchpin
of
all women's femininity what is that
a thing it is and i got how did they get
hold of that secret
we were sworn to keep it under wraps but
the queen actually it's not a linchpin
it's one of those
strings that you pull out when you pull
it out she goes how do you do
i think it's implying that he was trying
to unhook her bra
is it the minute it says the minute
little fastener which is the miniature
lynchpin for women's
not lower back oh no it wasn't sorry it
was just
it's not like elderly women have got
their browser on their way you know what
we're learning we're learning a lot here
today aren't we
yeah real lesson for the lads
but you shrink when you're older so your
back gets smaller doesn't it just gets
closer your shoulders get closer to your
farm naturally
i guess um this um this
thing about one-third of britain's
having seen the queen was part of
a survey by ugh wasn't it um
and so i looked at some of the other
things in that survey and um
so 22 of people have seen prince philip
so that's one in five-ish
um the next most commonly seen is
princess anne on 17
only one percent have seen meghan markle
um
but she's not been going for as long as
she no that's true
she's a new character prince harry was
the same it's it's
um three percent of 65 year olds
and over have seen him and only five
percent of 18 to 24 year olds
yeah and it's just because the queen has
been going for so long and has been
doing so many visits
all over the place so for people over
the age of 65 49
have either seen or met her which i just
find insane well it's true it's like
when she came to bolton it was like it
was just to get her numbers up really
because like she got all the kids
along the street and she's like oh this
is another you know
200 000 people how can i basically clear
the list
she's playing a long pokemon game with
all of us it's we are the pokemon
it's pokemon commodore isn't it she's
good she's got a list of all the
commoners
in the country and she's just ticking
them all up the list of people that
she's met i read
that she has met over a quarter of all
the u.s presidents ever
she's met something close to it yeah
she's met something close to 30 percent
of all the presidents that america has
ever had that is insane
yeah oh sorry that is
that's a news that's breaking news for
me
i was trying to find the most famous
person the queen hasn't met
um and so i went on to google and search
for who's the most famous
person in the world and then went down
the list to see yeah and googled how's
the queen met this person
well i didn't have to go that far
because as far as i can see she hasn't
met justin bieber
and google thinks that he's one of the
most famous people in the world they've
never been seen in the same room at the
same time well
you see justin bieber is another person
whose shoulders are quite close to his
bum
isn't he because he's a very small man
because i was reading about people who
have met justin bieber and uh freddie
flintoff
the cricketer who is an extremely tall
guy he went to meet him and got a meet
and greet with his kids
and his wife and they went down the
queue and they got to the front
and the kids got to see justin bieber
but the justin bieber staff wouldn't let
freddie flintoff go anywhere near him
and they said
he doesn't like big guys because if you
have uh freddie he's like six four six
five something like that
standing next to justin bieber he's
gonna look like a little
tiny girl yeah it's like why he only
hangs out with them tom cruise and
people like that justin bieber
yeah yeah also justin bieber is why he
wears his trousers so low is because
he's trying to make it look like the
distance from his shoulders to his bum
is greater than it actually is they're
only a few inches apart
um the royal family have banned
commoners
from wearing their official tartan oh no
can you believe this
prince albert designed a tartan for the
family for the firm in 1853
and um then several decades later in
1937 there was a tarpon manufacturer who
wrote them
saying oh this is a lovely tartan and
we'd love to make it and the keeper of
the preview purse wrote back saying
absolutely not you may not make this is
exclusively for the royal use
anyway you would think that was in 1937
things might have changed a bit since
then
in 2016 the palace confirmed that this
remains in place
there is one person in the world who is
not a member of the royal family who is
allowed to wear the
tarzan it's guessable as well it's
definitely guessable
nicholas sturgeon it's not nicholas jay
is it is it one of the crankies if any
of those are still alive
it's jimmy cranky yeah no it's is it the
person who tries on stuff for the queen
oh yeah must be brilliant
is it the winner of the cabertos in
every year's highland games
it's another lovely lovely guest it's
not that's a bit funny
is it someone scottish does it have to
be someone scottish in this it's someone
who is almost certainly going to be
scottish due to their job
oh it's someone who might be wearing
tartan
as a matter of fact who paints the
fourth rail bridge
oh no it's not that it's the black piper
on princess street who annoys everyone
every morning during the festival
you were so you know what i think just
to end this torturous competition
it's her it's her it's her alarm clock
her backpiping alarm clock man
her backpiping alarm clock man the
official role is yes
wow i know that's another incredibly
long lasting thing there have only been
15 royal bagpipers since 1843
and they have to play for her every
every weekday morning not every morning
of the week she's not a masochist
for 15 minutes they play and apparently
um she doesn't ever want to hear the
same tune twice so it's a nightmare
because
there was one there's one called gordon
webster who said he had to
know about seven or eight hundred
different tunes yeah but they must be
running out
by now like how long has she been queen
60 years what is it something like that
yeah
and um every morning apart from the
weekends she's had a different tune they
must be getting they must be kind of
getting down to the
oh yeah i'm gonna do the killers today
does she have that one
well she's had this to bright side but
she hasn't
that's a cool way to inform her of like
the latest charts yeah you just start
playing
the latest ariana grande i don't know if
she needs to be informed of the latest
charts
is that something that she demands
definitely well maybe you know when she
meets bieber one day she can say
love yourself
can i do one more guessing game because
andy's one went so yeah
oh yeah yeah according to ben shot who i
think we all kind of trust uh writing in
the spectator
um a brilliant sort of collector of
trivia who do you think
is the most seen human ever to have
lived
as in the person that most people have
seen in real life oh
wow okay so someone who's done huge
events
on and and rallies and things like that
um is it someone is it donald trump
nope is it a politician from a really
populous country like xi jinping oh good
call narendra modi
this is the dalai lama ben shot thinks
none of those
then shot thinks it is probably mick
jagger
and that's because he's been going for
so long
so long and playing in front of massive
massive audiences
non-stop and non-stop and non-stop and
out of all the
is he from the rolling stones yes yes of
all the rolling stones
can we just do a little straw poll among
us who's seen
we know james who knows who he is i
might have done for all i know
i don't think i have seen the rolling
stones at any stage any of them i don't
think
i've seen jagger i've seen all of them
because i went to a gig once
dan no no surprising no no very sorry
queen in our little straw poll can you
ask
um alex bell at that miller as well
please yeah i'll drop him a text
yeah jagger was on the horse behind the
coin
oh that's such a great what we're just
talking of rock stars i've been reading
elton john's autobiography called me
which is unbelievably good very
scandalous and he meets with the queen
quite a few times
in the book and he tells a story in it
where he was at a party
and he saw the queen approaching a man
called vi count lindley
and she asked him to look on after
his sister who'd been taken ill and
retired to her room so he said go and
look after her
and he kept just partying and so once he
was popping the queen off too many times
she went up to them and this is what
elton john saw
you know that thing of saying a single
word and slapping a cheek of someone
back and forth
in between the words you see in movies
she says that she
that the queen went up to vi count
lindley and went don't slap
argue with me i am
the queen and then he went off
to look after the daughter and then
elton says the queen then turned
to elton she stared at him and gave a
little wink and walked off
that's what he said i mean it might have
happened it's in the book
he's delton john's a fantasist
not sure he is i think i think he tells
me is that i mean can that have happened
no no because it's true no i do remember
actually in um
in prince's biography he says that he
saw the queen
slamming prince edward's head in the
fridge door repeatedly
yeah because he said he didn't like qi
she said you
should watch qri it's very funny

okay on with the podcast on the show
not on with the show yes continue with
the stopping of the show
because i want to tell you a fact
dan treiber okay yeah it's that one way
of curing impotence in the 14th century
was to put trousers on your head for 10
days what is going on anna are we doing
a sort of our own
two-person fish in between the show
facts
we're starting a rival show hope that's
okay no what i'm saying is
i am particularly grateful for this fact
because i have just received a pair of
new trousers from our sponsors this week
stitch fit okay am i wearing them on my
head right now
but yeah i was wondering um stitch fix
is an
online personal styling service for men
and women and
the idea is that you sign up to them you
set up a profile page and you tell an
expert stylist
what you like and then they decide on
five items to send you
that maybe you never would have picked
out from a shop to try out and see if
you can get some new styling going
that's right and all you do is you pay a
10 pound styling fee
you get all the clothes sent to you and
you can return any that you don't want
so i've just got my batch of five
and i'm currently wearing the coziest
jumper i have ever put on
which is also cool a thing that i very
rarely managed to
achieve the good thing is if you do keep
all five items you can get
20 off your order and you can do that if
you go to stitchfix dot co dot uk
fish now that's right so go to stitch
fix dot co dot uk
fish set up your profile get your expert
stylus they'll send you those five items
and if you keep them all
using our offer code slash fish you'll
get 20 off that order
okay on with the show on with the show
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is my fact
my fact this week is that in 1714 when a
dutch ship ran out of ammunition
14 hours into a battle the captain sent
a boat over to the enemy
asking to borrow some gunpowder and
cannonballs so they could continue the
fight
and did they give them the cannonballs
no
no that's quite good can we can we
borrow them as quite because like we'll
give them back
really fast yeah no i think it was seen
as a sort of a bit of a cheeky surrender
really
um because the captains actually i don't
know if it was the humor of it
uh ended up having a drink and toasting
each other sending some compliments
very nicely thought well done and then
hopefully went on their ways
um so neither neither ship was sunk in
the end and neither was captured
um so quite a quite a good ending um so
yeah so this is
um this is a story to do more with the
captain
uh whose name was peter janssen vessel
otherwise known as
tordenshkild and he was a daniel
norwegian
nobleman who was um he's very famous in
sort of the history now of of
um denmark there's statues of him in
copenhagen the most popular brand of
matches
has his image on it he's mentioned in
the royal national anthem he's sort of a
big character at the time
but this was quite an infamous incident
in what was known as the great northern
war
um he was captaining this royal danish
norwegian navy ship
and he ran into what they thought was a
british ship was but was actually
swedish
and it was a much bigger ship than what
he had he never should have engaged in a
fight with it
in a battle with it and so he was
reprimanded when he got back
for having done that for risking
everyone's life and the ship
itself so that he survived but it kind
of didn't work out for him for a while
well although he fought his case and won
it in the end didn't he he was such a
brazen man
that it seemed like he just always got
away with the stuff he seemed to be
always doing things like this
and yeah like you say he was reprimanded
he was court-martialed and
he managed to find an obscure piece of
naval law which got him off so
he was caught marshalled because he
persisted much too long but then he
found a bit of law that said that you
have to pursue
any ship that's fleeing you and got off
scot-free and was immediately promoted
and he was constantly promoted in his
life but it was with this battle because
one of the reasons he was lucky i guess
was because he was quite um
i guess he cheated so he often went in
disguises another country so in this
battle it would have looked to the
outsider like it was a dutch ship
fighting a british ship
because like you said he thought it was
the british because the swedes had
sent a ship to britain to have the brits
fit it out
with you know some good gear and the
brits were sending their ship back at
the time so it looked like it was
british because it was covered in
british regalia
and then he himself disguised his ship
as a dutch ship so that he could sneak
up on the enemy without them realizing
that he was
so it looked like a dutch ship in a
british ship but it was actually a dino
norwegian and a swedish ship yeah that's
correct
it's unbelievable that anyone got
anything done at this time
but what was the difference is it like
the flat i guess it's the flag that
they're carrying is it
or something i think yeah yeah it's not
like everyone on board was like with a
cup of tea
[Laughter]
[Music]
those union jack suits
head to toe he died aged about 30 didn't
he was incredibly young when he died and
he died in a duel
uh with a swedish count yeah who it was
over a disagreement about cards
it feels like um he could have it feels
like whatever war it was could have gone
the other way what do you say that was
great northern wall
another one well it's like anna says he
was just incredibly brazen
and what happens is you get promoted to
captain then you get promoted to the
next thing then you get promoted to the
next thing but eventually your luck runs
out and you get killed in a jewel
yeah but what happened was like he was
in this duel with this proper
like um what was he a captain or
something like that colonel
and um the colonel was fully kitted out
with proper warlike
equipment like proper swords and and
armor and stuff like that whereas
all he had was his ceremonial sword
which was like
might as well have been made out of
plastic and comes with bishop rice
because it didn't really work very well
and so as soon as he got in the
jewel he had no chance oh no yeah yeah
his um his name was given to him quite
um
it was after even this incident where he
asked to borrow some ammunition
1716 he was given it and taught him
skilled
translates as shield of thunder like
thundershield
such a such an awesome nickname to have
but yeah
it's it's interesting that that's what
he's known as now and it almost has been
put as his unofficial
or rather look seemingly official
surname even the vessel
well it was his official title i think
when he was knighted that's what they
knighted him ass
talking skilled shield of thunder which
would actually be already used to the
shield if it was made of thunder
doesn't work at all but you'd only hear
him coming
like five seconds after he'd already
attacked you
that's true it's good point hey you know
the brand of
matches you mentioned at the start dan
yeah that are named after him
and they were named after him in 1882
when they were founded
and it was because sweden had a monopoly
on match matchmaking and match exports
and so the catchphrase of these matches
was you can use these to once again
strike at the swedish the idea was to
take down their monopoly oh
yeah and they were bought by a swedish
company in 1972
[Laughter]
in your face torton skill
so todd scold won this war in the end or
his side won it
and it kind of stopped the swedes from
being like an absolute
massive country so at that time sweden
was huge
like they were in charge of most of like
northern europe
um they even had a colony in north
america
at the time they were kind of spreading
out and then it was kind of the russians
and
the dana norwegians and the british were
on both sides at various times of this
conflict but it was basically the
russians who wanted to stop the swedish
from being massive
and then when the swedish lost that was
kind of the rise of russia and peter the
great and stuff like that
um but what i found really interesting
is in this war there was
um quite a lot i think there are three
or four examples of
women who fought on the swedish side who
were dressed as men and who no one
realized
until either they got caught or you know
after the war and stuff like that there
was one called
elizabeth alstota who was actually
executed
afterwards on the charges of having
dressed as a man and
serving as a soldier uh there's another
one called ulrika stalhammer
um who was let off because she did such
good work for the army so they caught
her and they arrested her and stuff and
she got married to a woman
but they arrested her and she got off
but there was
um sorry james did she get married to a
woman with the woman thinking she was a
man
well it's controversial dan you see
because they got caught and it went to
you know it went to court and they said
that the woman didn't know anything and
you know she was she only found out
later on
um but we're not sure what happened
there but because this was happening
because it was really famous that it was
happening
it was used as an excuse by homosexual
soldiers in the swedish army
because obviously that was illegal in
sweden as well especially in the army
and whenever they got caught they would
say well we've heard all these stories
about these women pretending to be men
so we just assumed it was a woman
and apparently quite a lot of people got
off because they used that
excuse me that is so slick
i just assumed that half the people on
board this ship were very realistically
women dressed as men yeah that's like
is it hannah snell who was the
famous um person around about the same
time the famous british women who was in
the navy
who was in the royal marines i think and
she was shot in the groin
at one point which is really awkward if
you're a woman pretending to be a man
and so she had to extract the bullet and
deal with the wound completely herself
to keep it secret
and she was just gonna say that probably
my balls my balls
[Laughter]
i was looking into other sort of bizarre
moments in
naval wartime history and just sticking
with the dutch for a second
the capture of the dutch fleet at den
helder this was in 1795
and basically this was a this was a
battle between the dutch
and the french and the dutch were on a
boat
that was on a body of water that froze
over while they were anchored
and so the french had the ability to not
even need a boat
or a ship to get to them they went out
on horseback with cavalry
and they fought a ship on horseback
it was a battle between cannons and and
met on horses with swords
and and the french cavalry captured them
it's extraordinary the imagery i just
want to see the paintings of that
so good why surely just fire the cannons
into the ice create massive holes
and the horse is gonna gonna fall right
through them see
that's clever yeah they need my kind of
leadership because i think they just
surrendered straight away didn't they
yeah they couldn't run away you know
iran owns a fake
uh us aircraft carrier which is
exclusively for the purpose of them
attacking it ah but the great thing is
it's reusable
this year they had their third ever
attack on it where they symbolically
sync it basically um but unfortunately
this year they tried it again and it
sank by itself and it's now created a
shipping hazard
blocking a really important naval port
so i can't get to it
how would they how is it reusable if you
sync it can you bring it back up again
or not
okay so this is a really tricky thing i
think they didn't properly bomb it as in
when they do their
displays they might fly helicopters at
it they might fire it a bit but they're
quite careful to
i think firing it above the water line
or whatever so they don't
properly sync it um and this year it
clearly decided it had enough because it
just
sank and they don't have salvage ships
so they now can't get it up either
well that sounds like good news because
it sounds like based on that they
probably won't be actually attacking the
us anytime soon what are you on about
they now know exactly how to sync these
ships
well all we have to do is try not to
sink it
that's a good point um do you know who
you think an ancient greek
trireme what's a tri room is that a boat
with three
three sets of arms is it yeah exactly
yeah three so it's just
yeah one of their boats um it sounds
like the start of a joke doesn't it
that's true how do you how do you think
a try ream
well do you they've all got holes that
they row through so do you just have to
tilt it a bit so that the holes
let the water enter that's clever that
is clever it's actually that's how you
don't sink it
oh so they would ram each other right
they all had tough and proud and they
would ram each other and try and
um sink each other that way and the the
rams are often
uh at the waterline so you know if you
hit them with the ram
that you know that hole below the water
line they're going to take fast so
genuinely
if you had a if you were being attacked
by another ship and you can't get out of
the way in time
what they would do is everyone on board
would run to one side of the ship
which is about to be hit by the ram the
ship tilts over into the water
then when the ram hits it's hitting
yeah then when you tilt back it's hit
somewhere that's above the water line
exactly it's not that insane as a
defense tactic to run towards the
massive battering ram that's about to
hit your ship that's amazing
but if you've half tilted your ship one
way isn't the battering ram just being
given an easier job to flip you over
entirely it's not aiming to flip you
over
yeah yeah it's not like a spatula you're
not flipping your pancake
that this isn't robot was i just
fighting by accident not intention yeah
if sir kill a lot is approaching you
with the battering ram
what you i don't i don't think it would
if you're coming at that angle
i don't the physics of that wouldn't
cause your boat to capture
largely speaking boats are designed so
that they don't flip over
that easily yeah right it's true well
although
since i mean although some boats have
flipped over
we all know that um but famously we were
talking about the swedish empire and
what powerhouse it was
and when it was this huge naval power in
the 17th early 18th centuries
they thought to celebrate this they
built the world's best warship
and this was 1628 it was called the vasa
it was 68 meters long it was the most
high-tech warship the world had ever
known
it was painted in really stunning
colours scenes from the
swedish military victories of history
all over it
and so thousands of people flocked to
see it launched from harbour
and it set off and it 20 minutes later
it tipped over
and sunk and they just built it too top
heavy and it keeled right over
oh my gosh it's an amazing story is that
the one they have in
that they have in stockholm in stockholm
yeah i just heard about that they
dredged it
and they have built an entire museum
around it and you guys are not going to
believe this
can you see the mug i'm drinking from oh
yeah it's got a ship on it
that ship is the vasa look at the handle
here
it says vassa how did you don't see it
andy
did you guys see it when we were there
it's where i was just taking me i didn't
know about i was busy dancing with
holograms of
abba at the abbe museum well they would
of us are doing long-range research for
an episode of the podcast in two years
nice
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
anna my fact this week is that vanilla
farmers in madagascar
stamp their names on each individual pod
on the vine
wow they've they stopped it that's
it yeah it's like when you're at school
you have to have your name sewn into all
your clothes
it's the same kind of thing exactly just
to stop
gangs of robbers from stealing your
vanilla oh no that's why i have my name
stitched into my clothes
of course stop the gangs of robbers you
had a pretty scary school didn't you
they're really sweet the little stumps
as well so this is because
madagascar is in the middle of a vanilla
boom or actually sort of coming out of a
huge vanilla boom so it produces
80 of the world's vanilla and prices
just shot up a couple of years ago
and there are these vanilla gangs these
huge gangs and robbers at night who come
and use
they strip your vines completely bare
because it's going for so much money
and so now the farmers literally put
that either their name or sometimes
their serial number specific serial
number
on an individual port so if you see it
on ebay later you could be like oh that
was
stolen from my farm because one of the
problems is that
once your vanilla pod is ripe you kind
of need to leave it for quite a long
time don't you you need to leave it for
quite a few months to just get better
and better and better
and the longer you leave it the better
it is but the thieves know this so if
they get there early then
they have something which is still good
enough to sell but not quite as good
enough that the farmer would like it's a
trade-off do you wait till the end
so you get really high quality product
or do you take it early so the thieves
don't get it
yeah actually i've just that makes more
sense of something i found out because
the government has now banned
people the farmers in madagascar from
picking vanilla
too early because they have to be shrink
wrapped
if they're picked early and that can
make them moldy and it lowers the
content of vanillin
which is the main flavor chemical and
they in fact you know how government
sometimes burn
smuggled or illegal goods in public so
they'll burn ivory for example to
destroy the market
they recently burned uh half a ton of
prematurely picked vanilla pods
in public to kind of make an example
about this law yeah do you think that
would have smelled
nice i bet it would ah what does that
mean amazing yeah
like an amazing scented candle a giant
they ran a huge bath next to it
but it's amazing the prices have leapt
up but
weirdly it doesn't seem to have left up
specifically for the growers there seems
to be this middle group
of people who distribute it who are
known as vanillionaires
and they're the ones that are sort of
really reaping the money
and building up all these areas in
madagascar now from
if you were living in a wooden hutted
house they're now brick
like there's a big change going there as
a result yeah weirdly
the huge jump in prices doesn't seem to
have made it back to the original
producers
[Music]
situation in this world we live yeah
they're trying to write that wrong
aren't they and actually i read a very
heartening article
in i think it was in the ft which was
saying
that this is being clamped down on and
the reason it's being clamped down on
is because buyers as in us are more
discerning than they used to be
so all like the hipster sort of morally
sound awareness of where your goods have
come from means that there's a lot of
pressure on big companies like mars to
actually make sure that you're not
exploiting farms at the other end of the
chain
and so what that means is you know the
person who's owns mars goes to
madagascar
looks at farmers situations and tries to
sort it out and i think there's a
project
called livelihoods out there now which
is making sure that the money's making
it back to those
original producers but some people
really did profit from
growing them as well there was a woman
called lydia sower who was interviewed
in one article
who said that her husband was a
fisherman a few years ago and she wanted
to plant vanilla and her husband said no
absolutely not terrible idea
and she did it anyway and it's now worth
about she's got a tiny little garden
with a few vanilla pods in it
and it's worth about eight thousand
dollars which is massive
massive there although she was saying
this very very proudly to a woman called
victoria mars
who was visiting and who does have an
eight percent stake in mars
which as this person pointed out its
annual sales are three times the size of
madagascar's gdp
yeah but so you know was it probably
didn't her jaw didn't drop but the sound
of eight thousand dollars
in the same way that this woman was
hoping
you know how there are millionaires as
you said
there are also i don't think anyone's
called them this venice
vanilla vigilantes yeah it's the thing
i'm trying to get because
as anna was saying it's so much theft so
a few years ago 15
of all the vanessa on the planet was
stolen which is a hard
and some vanilla thieves would write
ahead in advance that's how brazen they
got
they would write a note saying we are
coming tonight prepare what we want
um and that has actually led to quite a
few deaths because when these people
have been caught there isn't
enough sort of justice available on the
ground so
there are vanilla vigilantes now who are
catching and even killing the thieves
yeah that is crazy they sound like
they've taken a few leaves out of
peter skewn things but
taught torden's girl's book yeah
but can't you get around the poaching by
you know just changing your name to the
name that's on the pod
you know the guy in your article is
called called leon
can i just arrive in town and change my
name to leon well
sometimes they put like codes and
barcodes on you can't change your name
so 731964.
you could i bet there's a child of celeb
of a celebrity who's called that right
now
yeah elon musk is up to something
[Laughter]
and so vanilla grown uh like you say 80
in madagascar but it's not
originally from there is it it's um
originally from
south america or uh south and central
america and north america because mexico
which is
neither in south america nor in central
america it's in north america it's from
mexico
it's vanilla's from mexico and it was
invented
by this woman called princess zanat
uh who probably didn't exist um but she
was a princess
from the roller coaster tottenham people
uh and she was
uh goddess kind of as well as being a
princess she was forbidden by her father
from marrying immortal
and she ran away to the forest with her
lover and they were captured and
beheaded
and where their blood hit the ground
that's where the first vanilla pods grew
and that's that's where vanilla comes
from there's an arduous way to invent
something isn't it
and then it got taken over to madagascar
and more specifically reunion
which is where they learned how to grow
it but it and it didn't work for ages
because
the pollen is inaccessible the flowers
are insane they're fertile for 12 hours
after they bloom
so if you're a vanilla farmer there's
big pressure you can't just take the
weekend off
assuming that it'll be all right when
you get back the flowers bloom for one
day a year for this 12 hours and
in mexico obviously there are insects
which have evolved to
fertilize the flowers only one species
of bee there's only one species should
be called the melapone
who can do it although actually you know
they've recently done a study and they
don't even think it's that really
they they always thought it was this one
melapona bee and um
they now can't i haven't actually got
any evidence that this even pollinates
it
but it's something's pollinating it
something in mexico that's all
yeah yeah so for years they couldn't
export it around the world because you
know you don't have the bee or the
hummingbird or whatever it is
so the method is hand fertilizing you
have to
get in with a toothpick and um rub the
flowers genitals together
and that's what fertilizes it and that's
what makes it produce the vanilla pods
and if you miss your window with the
flower you lose the pods
yeah you're sort of trying to make it
have sex with itself aren't you
against its will yeah it's against its
work
the reason they're so hard to pollinate
is because they've got this lit
between the male and the female parts of
the plant and the idea is you don't
really want to self-inseminate because i
guess
over many many generations maybe that's
bad for an organism
and so it's against the plants will that
you lift the lid very very carefully
and you dip into the anther the female
part and you get you know
you get the um pollen out and you smear
it all over the male part
yeah this is definitely a side of the
metoo movement i don't think any of us
expected
so this was first discovered by an
enslaved man
in reunion called edmund albius
and he was he basically had this
guy who was his boss and he was telling
him how they make
watermelons but how they can't do it
with vanilla pods
and so edmund albious decided well okay
you say you can't but let's have a go
and he started messing around with it
messing around with it and he came up
with this kind of technique where you
use a little stick or a blade of grass
and you flip up this little cap which
hannah was talking about called the
rustellum
and you flip it up and then with kind of
a flip of the thumb
you move some of the male and female
parts together
and you smear them over each other and
that's how you pollinate them
uh and that technique is still used
today uh in reunion for sure and i think
actually
in madagascar i think all over they use
this exact same thing
uh and then he was given his freedom
but he really you know he he really
struggled afterwards
uh and ended up dying in poverty uh
especially as there was a french guy
called jean-michel claude ricard
who came over and said oh this was my
idea this i came up with this
and he went back to paris and he told
everyone that he'd come up with this way
of creating vanilla and reunion
and everyone sort of fated him for being
amazing but then uh the former owner of
edmund delbios
came to paris as well and said mate like
that is just not
that's just not what happened like it
was the this guy is this edward elvis
who went round and
teaching everyone else how to do it and
he's like a hero in reunion and there's
a statue of him quite near the airport
and
he's really famous what did you lie to
make up yeah but
quite a trumpian thing to do it just
warmed into a country
like i did that that was me you know
that thing which is like
4 000 miles away which no one can prove
who did it
that was me yeah
um the longest cake ever made was
vanilla flavored was it
it was baked this year in south india in
kerala state of kerala and it was 10
centimeters wide but how long was it
10 centimeters wide is really that
doesn't thin that doesn't help you at
all
without knowing how long it is it kind
of feels like okay but can you tell us
the airful
area of the cave
2.4 kilometers very strong offer
um 20 kilometers 20 kilometers
that's ridiculous 200 yards long
and she said that it was in kerala not
kerala and
uh
it was six and a half kilometers so
james wins because he was close it
wasn't 20 kilometers
where did they fit that because outdoors
you'd imagine you'd run into a lot of
obstacles
yeah it's very rare you get a six and a
half kilometer run they did it in
sections and it is it goes up and down a
lot it's
it's slalom it's a great deal hang on so
it's it's not one it's
not one one single cake that's six
thousand meters really you can't you
can't call that the longest
not the longest cake right the longest
cake is every kick that's been made on
baycomb in the last 10 years they don't
have to be collected
i'm so
in the photos of the cake that there are
sections which slot into place but i
think they're joined they are all joined
together it's like a big
cake snake okay it weighed 27 000 kilos
and as i say it was vanilla favorite
hence me mentioning it
so um one of the best books about
vanilla i would say the best book is
called travels in search of the vanilla
orchid um by two sorry james are you
claiming to have read
all the books about it sounds a bit like
you are
and then you've put you've ranked them
all it's a small stunt
it's a very small appeal and they're
actually all if you press them up
against each other they just make one
long book um
tim eckhart who andy and i at least know
yeah
uh he wrote the book about vanilla and
it's it is awesome there's lots of stuff
about the history of vanilla in there
when it came to europe
one of the reasons this guy was showing
off about it is because it was an
absolute amazing thing so um
louis the 15th would have soup made of
vanilla
francisco hernandez who is a physician
to philip ii of spain
he said that vanilla could suit the
stomach cure the bite of a venomous
snake reduce flatulence
and cause the urine to flow admirably
so if you've just if you've got a bad
stomach and you've just farted really
loudly attracting the attention of a
snake
which has then bitten you and you need a
piss no and your friend has been stung
by a jellyfish so you need to urinate on
them
just one one vanilla there's one weird
trick
yeah also according to bizarre zimmerman
who's a german physician
um from the 18th century he says that um
vanilla cured no fewer than 342 impotent
men
so they drank vanilla and it made them
uh able to have sex again
so if you were if you'd farted really
loudly
because of your bad stomach and a snake
came along and
a very beautiful person of the sex that
you're attracted to
has been stung by a jellyfish after
you've urinated on them and they're so
grateful you can then have sex with them
i'm so impressed by the admirable flow
of your urine community
this is a bear grylls episode
[Music]
stop the poker stop the podcast hello
everybody just wanted to let you know
that this week we're sponsored by
expressvpn
wow anna i know what the word express
means it means to do something quickly
but what does vpn mean
that's a great question that is the
intriguing part of this name a vpn
is an app that re-routes your internet
connection through
secure servers and what that means is
that your internet service provider
can't see the sites that you visit so
it's a way of keeping your internet
history
secure from outside prying eyes so if i
wanted to buy a christmas present for my
internet provider
then i'd be able to use this and they
won't know what i've been buying for
them
that's so sweet that you and your isp
have such a close relationship
some people think that a possible way of
doing this is using incognito mode which
i used to do but actually
incognito mode does not hide your
activities which is why expressvpn is
the better option
it's available on phones computers and
even on your smart tv
and the best way to do that is to go to
expressvpn.com
fish and if you do that you'll get an
extra three months free on your one year
package
that's right so go to expressvpn that's
e-x-p-r-e-s-s-v-p-n
dot com slash fish to get an extra three
months free on a one-year package
okay i'm with the podcast on the show
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that is
james okay my fact this week is that
russian football team
fc sacklin are based in such a remote
town
that to get to their closest away game
they have to travel one-sixth of the
circumference of the earth
it's incredible isn't it oh my days like
this is incredible so this is a team
based
in the town of yushno sakhalinsk
which is in the far far far east of
russia
and they're in the third division of
russian football
and the way the third division works in
russia is it's such a big country they
want all the teams to be kind of close
together because otherwise you have to
spend so much money traveling
so they put all the teams that are next
to each other playing each other
but unfortunately there's no one else
around this town a fierce no suckling
and so they've been put in with all the
teams around the black
sea and around dagestan and stuff like
that and so when they play krasnodar
which is one of the teams in their
league um they have to
if they want to fly it would be at least
16 hours just over 16 hours to get to
this game
you could drive but it's a 132 hour
drive
a total of 9781 kilometers because you
have to go slightly weird way around
and i looked at it on google maps and it
says warning this route includes a ferry
this route has tolls this route has
restricted usage or includes private
roads
your destination is in a different time
zone so it's not an easy place to get to
so i'm suspecting stuff like this this
bit is guarded by a wizard
[Laughter]
um at the time of writing they haven't
won any away games this season
um so far they've won quite a few home
games where they've not won any away
games
but they did have a few good seasons a
while ago they won the league a couple
of times
in the last few years but they refuse to
get promoted because if they get
promoted
they're going to have to start playing
lots of teams in different parts of
russia
and then they won't be able to do this
thing which they do which is they go
over and they play loads of games at
once and then they come back so they
don't go every week
if you know what i mean yeah is the time
difference between
them and the nearest team is eight hours
it's so
weird well the thing is it's not there
near his team so
if they played in the japanese jay
league for instance they're
actually quite close to hokkaido so
let's say all the planes stopped and
they had to play either against
someone like krasnodar or someone around
there or against hokkaido
um it would take them two days quicker
to get to hokkaido than it would
take them to get to that part of russia
and that's if they were to walk to
hokkaido and get a car to russia
that's how much closer it is like they
could walk to the ferry get the ferry
and walk to the football match
two days quicker than driving all the
way across russia wow
and we could if if they were doing that
distance and we had to do the equivalent
we could drive to moscow back again to
london
back to moscow back again to london and
probably one more route before they
even got there it's it's what is this
they're closer to
the um seattle football team and
in the american league than they are to
their nearest russian rivals
it's insane so there's not a lot of sort
of neighborly antagonism is what you're
saying it's not like man united mountain
city where
you shag the wife of someone who's now
married the person across the street
exactly it's not like liverpool everton
where you literally cross one park to
get to the other ground
it's like yeah yeah it's incredible it's
more like there are fault lines left
over from the russo-japanese war of 1905
which are diplomatically tricky wasn't
james wasn't there a bizarre thing that
happened
with one of the british teams or two
british teams that got to the final of
some
uh and they had stuff it was arsenal and
someone right they had to fly
i think it was chelsea against someone
chelsea spurs or chelsea arsenal or
something
but yeah then they get the final was in
baku i think in azerbaijan and they had
they both had to go all the way over
there for it that was in the ua
car possibly yeah wow i didn't realize
that this so this place is basically in
the islands of japan isn't it i
actually didn't realize that russia um
claimed a portion
of what i would have if i'd looked at a
blank map assumed towards japan
and i think no sorry putin really hope
you don't listen to this
this show and i think isn't the south
half of the island is japanese isn't it
he turned off when we started making
jokes about short people i think
podcast um yeah exactly that's it but
it's basically
a part of well it's right on the border
of russia and japan
geologically i guess it looks japanese
but it's a very disputed territory and
there are still some islands uh the
kuril islands which are disputed
but but this is is russian sort of uh
is russian and is russian have
ministered yeah yeah um
i don't know why anyone plays football
russia it sounds like an enormous hassle
for so many teams it's just it's too big
even if you're playing for vladivostok
which at least is attached to it by land
it's still i think 10 000 kilometers
east of saint petersburg
so a week's train journey and um i think
there was quite a nice story in 2006
where three fans of zenitz and
petersburg
which is a football team that they drove
to vladivostok because
people were playing an away game there
so they joined the whole like week and a
half there once they got there
their car broke down but to reward their
loyalty
their team gave them a new car wow
nice of course the reason that people
play
football in russia is because the
soviets like to force people to play
football
back in the day cool um actually it was
quite thought of as a bourgeois
sport originally because um it was
brought over by the scottish
people in particular uh and the first
person who
brought it over there was a guy called
mcpherson who was arrested
after the revolution because they saw
football as being a bourgeois european
thing and
they should be doing it in russia um but
the first ever football match
in russia was in 1893 and they squeezed
it in between two tug-of-war
competitions
uh so there was a big tug-of-war thing
happening
and they were like well what should we
do in the middle because we're just
sorting out our rope or something and
they're like oh let's have a game of
football
that's so funny they cleared all the uh
seven arms off the pitch before they got
the footballers on
[Laughter]
oh dear um but yeah yeah handball and
it's just the ball rolling over
[Laughter]
and then the most famous team in russia
is spartak moscow and they came along
when the soviets were controlling
everything they were the team of the
people
and there was a load of brothers called
the staristan brothers who started
spartak and then very mysteriously they
got sent to the gulag
about three or four years later because
they started a you know people's
football team
but they were so popular that when they
got to siberia the guard in siberia knew
about them
and so let them kind of practice the
football and eventually stalin's son
vassly was so
into football that they brought nikolai
starrison back from the gulag
so that he could live with vassal and
stalin and he would just live in his
house
because he was such a big fan of this
footballer that's so awkward
imagine if like lionel messi just moved
in with you or something
even if you thought he was a great
footballer i still think that would be
awkward around the dinner table
i think it would pass me the salt and he
does another head kick to you or
something
[Laughter]
stolen was just speaking of stalin it
was exiled to siberia
six times between 1900 and 1913 and
escaped five times well speaking of
people who
uh escape a lot and um the passing of
someone quite
famous diego maradona who passed away
recently
very sadly um he used to didn't used to
um play football at the request of pablo
escobar
while he was in prison just him and
pablo just
yeah well no i'm sure there were teams
that were uh that were put together
but um he he had at this particular
point i think it was in 1991 escobar was
in quite a luxurious
prison um he kind of ran the prisons
didn't he to begin with
of course escobar and maradona had quite
a lot in common cause
they had some shared hobbies didn't they
yeah
today was once sent home for the world
cup for taking cocaine
i just i just cottoned on as as you guys
thought maybe he also collected um
or whatever else in his house
um should we talk about siberia for a
while yeah sure
um so i was saying before about people
being sent to siberia
in 1591 this is the earliest
example of anyone being said to siberia
and it's not anyone
this was a bell in russia which was
found guilty of sedition and
flogged and exiled to siberia
and that was because the bell had been
rung to celebrate the assassination
of dimitri's son of iran the terrible
and so
the son had died and the locals were
happy about it and so they rang a bell
and then they put the bell
in court and sent it off to siberia was
it because they couldn't identify
any of the bell ringers so they was it a
way of letting the bell ringers off the
hook
it could have been that because that is
the epitome of a workman blaming their
tools
really where that came it's not really
the bell's fault
is it it doesn't feel like it doesn't
even know it also feels like flogging a
bell
is gonna cause it to ring again and then
you'll have to block it
this is a never-ending cycle oh yeah
have you heard of megaden which is
a very remote city kind of no two
two days north of the nearest um train
tracks and things like just a very very
remote city in siberia
um they have a mayoral position and
they're having a nightmare filling out
at the moment there have been
zero applications for the job of actual
mayor of the city
and there are 92 000 people in baghdad
it's not a small place um
and they've extended the deadline to
mid-december
so depending on whether this goes out
you might still be in time but
what happened to the previous met if the
seven last mayors all died
it's kind a lot of people say that you
kind of won't be able to change things
properly and there's a fair bit of
you know graft and corruption and it's
it's probably a pretty thankless job but
when the story broke for the first time
there have been no
applications a the boss of a funeral
firm from
tomsk uh 4 000 miles away said he would
apply
and he said of course i don't know much
about the city and it would be better if
i had lived there a while
but i've never had the chance so he said
he's gonna play it his main policy is to
build a crematorium
so um okay well that sounds like he's
just going to be greasing the palms of
his
crematorium friends doesn't it yeah
we've never actually talked about the
amazing lukov family but
if you're talking about the siberian
wilderness they are kind of the epitome
of it
so this is a family who
basically fled the bolsheviks and in the
1920s 1930s family of four i think at
the time went into siberia
and just lived without ever seeing
another human soul
until the 1980s and it's insane
their lifestyle they didn't bring much
stuff so they
had to when their clothes started to
fall apart they had to grow hemp from
seed in order to make new clothes out of
that
they wrote by dipping sharp and birch
sticks into honey supple juice
and writing but they raised this family
and there's one surviving member a
gaffia
lukov and she is now in her 80s but she
lives completely by herself in the
middle of the tiger
middle of nowhere 150 miles from the
nearest town
a thousand meters high on this
mountainside
and she wasn't discovered until the 80s
when these geologists were flying over
in a helicopter and saw their tiny
little hut that they were living in
and it just sounds and they said they
were kind of famous in russia weren't
they in the 80s
when they were found in the 80s um they
said to them oh
you guys probably don't know that the um
second world war is finished and they
went what's the second world war
it went before then that was in the 30s
i think or the 20s when they went like
anna says
but yeah when they were found they were
um they were kind of taken around the
country as
almost like uh kind of a sideshow almost
i suppose which is like look at these
amazing people that have been living in
siberia
and agafia lucifer kind of was
they said in one article i read that she
saw aeroplanes horses cars and money for
the first time
but then basically said i ain't having
any of this [ __ ] i want to go back to
where i live because she says that
whenever she leaves the town she always
um gets really bad asthma or you know
it's bad for her skit she just doesn't
like she doesn't like the noise and all
that kind of stuff so she's just kind of
happy where she is now
and every now and then they bring her
like uh food i think like once a year
they bring her
things and people yeah people knit socks
and stuff don't they and knit them
things
yeah i think just earlier when i said
about the football team going back on
the route passing a wizard
i mean this is this is almost yeah
this is hard it was really sad actually
when they were discovered i think there
are
five of them and then in the 80s they
all suddenly died
and left her on her own but the thing
that most amazed the dad
he was told everything they were told
about um the mood landings they were
shown a television which they became
kind of addicted to and then thought it
was the devil so repented of it
immediately
uh they were talking about the moon
landings and refused to believe they
happened which is fair enough
the thing that most amazed the dad was
cellophane he saw
this thing where she was like it's like
glass but it crumples
i couldn't believe it absolutely yeah
and they didn't they didn't know what
plastic bags were as well i remember
reading that was a new thing for them
uh i believe mick jagger was flown in
trying to top his numbers up
and they were like yeah of course we
know who this guy is
but then the big problem now is they do
go in there every now and then and drop
her
some supplies and especially um like i
said people knit them socks and knit
them clothes and stuff
but of course like with coronavirus you
just
do not want to be going into an area
with a very elderly lady who's not
really had any human contact for decades
and decades and decades and so that's a
real issue with them at the moment
you know what they should do they should
set her up on a date
with do you remember that brazilian guy
the man of the whole
the most isolated man in the world they
should get those
two that would be a very charming
rom-com
we are we on that copyright mr spielberg
just to say because we mentioned it on
here so
we'll take 10. that's how that works uh
just one last bit of data
before we go okay yeah in the breaks
between facts i texted ann
and alex to see if either of them had
seen mick jagger live
yeah go on and say and said no i have
not
okay and alex said no i don't really
know who he is
so james if you want something to talk
to about

i'm with the podcast
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
here with anna toshinski
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order
here we go starting with you
andy my fact is there is such a big
market for
fake letters by abraham lincoln that
people have started selling
fake fakes wow yeah
how cool is it there's a big old market
for fake
letters uh of abraham lincoln people he
died in 1865
and uh there were a lot of scam artists
in the 20s and 30s who started
faking the letters um and you know
faking his signature
using old paper all these amazing
tactics they used and
those those fake letters are now worth
thousands of dollars in their own right
they've sold for thousands of dollars
each
um but obviously that means there's a
market and so people have started
forging forgeries and is it like
is it like chinese whispers where the
fake big fake fake fakes look absolutely
nothing like the original letters it's
just a picture of a horse's ass
yeah abraham long can
but so these are um these fake fakes
they have to be attributed to the fake
writer right so as in people who became
famous in that period for having written
these fake letters
in themselves have become celebrities in
that world and then they're buying fates
of
the fake forgers one it's not just a
random fake
no no but also it's the fact that the
real ones are so expensive is that right
like if you're a person with a normal
income and you want to buy a lincoln
letter you just can't afford it
so the next best thing is to buy a fake
one yeah exactly yeah and the weird
thing is there are so many abraham
lincoln
memorabilia collectors in the usa it
seems to be the national pastime
um i always thought it was american
football but i turned on the um
tv on thanksgiving and it was just
people passing around fake letters to
each other
if you look closely at these stands in
american football matches
they're all trading their abraham
lincoln bits of beard
there are 15 000 collectors of
apparently serious collectors of
memorabilia not just your fly-by-night
you know amateurs yeah which is 1000
more than there are books written about
apparently there have been 14
000 books written about abraham lincoln
it's still a lot isn't it
it's a record after jesus and napoleon
apparently
really yeah i saw it when we were in um
washington dc for our tour last year i
saw
a huge pillar at the ford theatre where
they have glued
every single book that's been written
about lincoln or at least as many as
they could get
to a pillar that extends to about four
floors
so we should say the most famous faker
is uh joseph cosey
right um and is it mostly his that are
being sold
the things that are being forged so
joseph cosey was sort of the
big lincoln faker who was kind of an
amazing guy
so he started out he went to the library
of congress he was really into american
history and stuff
and then he saw a pay warrant that was
endorsed by benjamin franklin so had his
signature on it this is in 1929 and the
payback was in 1786
and he took it and his argument when he
was caught was that the library of
congress belongs to the people and he's
one of the people so it's not actually
stealing
anyway oh wow that's yeah so he went to
sell it to a dealer who told him it was
fake
he knew it wasn't fake so he basically
devoted his life
to making actual fakes to screw over
these idiot dealers who couldn't tell
the difference
well i mean that must have been pretty
hard for him to go in and say
no it's not fake i stole it from the
library i mean
yeah actually i did buy it from a dodgy
guy
it's so weird this relationship he had
with
his arch enemy is a bit like you know in
superhero films which i don't watch
they i think the superhero often as well
as hating his arch enemy has this weird
grudging respect for him and they'll
have a chat at the end
you know where they're bonding it's kind
of like
yeah he had that with william berquist
who was the investigator for the new
york
public library and it was him who
spotted in 1933
something dodgy was going on with the
documents set up this big sting
operation
caught cosy as he was trying to like
escape getting away with forging stuff
and basically congratulated him brought
him down to the police station and said
you're a genius
and cozy immediately was like oh thanks
well you should see what i've done with
this and pulled some
portraits out of his pocket it's like
look at this and vocals was like look
employ your talents better in future
please don't do it again off you go
and cosy disappeared and immediately
started forging loads and loads of stuff
again
but they sort of hung out as well as
bergquist trying to
stop these forgeries getting into the
market and trying to suppress him they
also like paid each other social calls
sometimes
he would occasionally give cosy a bit of
money to help him on his way
wow very weird all right it's weird do
you know how cody got started
he got he was in the army um originally
not originally he joined the army as a
young man
i guess that's a baby um look anyway
you've got that slightly that's why they
call it the infantry isn't it
[Laughter]
um he got kicked out of the army for
assaulting a cook
in his company i don't know why he
assaulted the cook but he forged a
certificate of honorable discharge from
the army
because he was obviously dishonorably
discharged and so that was i think his
one of his first steps on the road to
forging all this other stuff yes but he
signed it as abraham lincoln
he never really made money from it he
sold stuff quite cheap i think because
he was
nervous that if he tried to sell it
really expensively people would
interrogate it more
so he'd sell it quite cheap and he said
when he was questioned
the pleasure that he got was from seeing
that forgery that he sold
climbing up and up the auction market
and then selling for a huge amount in an
auction house
him sitting there at home you know
tapping his fingers together going
ah i know that's just something i
scribbled in my bathroom
yeah yeah and he um he had a little bit
of a loophole didn't he because he
in new york it was illegal to kind of
advertise something as
being something it wasn't and then
selling it on but if you went to someone
and just said oh i found this um
this scribbled signature i don't know
who it's by
i don't know what it's on i know it says
abraham lincoln but i don't know who did
it
then um and you sold it to them then
technically that wasn't a felony so
that's so clever yeah well we don't know
he
he might i don't think he is but he
there's a suggestion that he kept
operating for years and years after he
went awol because he kind of dropped off
the radar um
in 1943 but even in 1956 the new yorker
wrote a piece saying
is he still producing forgeries we don't
know so i'm saying he could will you
say you might still be around today if
you've actually got a signed copy of a
know something's a fishbook
[Laughter]
do you know how you can tell if a
lincoln letter is fake
uh no how can you do that oh it's there
there are so many exciting ways you can
tell
so one is uh what he wrote so if if he's
talking about his ipad
um that basically is one of the tips
they give is is what's he
you know is it signed 1866 or later in
which case
it's not real um but another thing is
just what he signed that um so he never
ever signed
abe or honest abe or old a
um that's just a meister
exactly um it's either a lincoln
on letters or uh if he was a lawyer he
would just sign lincoln so there are all
these things
also if a if you wrote a letter on
animal skin
then it's fake however a lot of
presidential documents are on animal
skin
or vellum and their letters are on paper
that's another way you can tell
oh it wasn't like he was an early animal
rights campaigner or anything
you know we should be using the animals
for obviously not
do you guys see that um i think it was
only in the last month or so they sold a
lock of lincoln's hair
fifty thousand dollars wow
um although there is a thing about fake
locks of hair
we do know that quite a lot of them
exist um because one collects said if
every lock of lincoln's hair out there
was genuine
the man would have been a wolly mammoth
i'm not quite sure what the providence
is
look at what the most expensive items
currently on ebay are that you can buy
that are related to lincoln and hair is
a big big thing
so there's strands of hair that you
could buy of lincoln
and they're all quite affordable i found
one for 636 pounds that you could buy
i found an exciting um well the more
exciting one is the bundle
that i found it's for his baby son all
right
i'm more interested in this one for a
thousand five hundred you can get a
bundle of lincoln
geronimo lord nelson and king george's
hair uh for a thousand five hundred
which is exciting
and then slice them all together no
they're four separate cards
oh that's true yeah you could have the
ultimate wig the ultimate historical wig
yeah um i don't think this one's real i
have to say i
the other things that this guy's selling
is you know tiger king joe exotic
he's selling premium condoms of this
guys um so
it's a big premium condoms of disguise
do you mean
i know because i only thought basic
condoms i'm a bit
annoyed that i've been buying the wrong
joe exotic condoms now
i don't know tiger king joe exotic but i
don't think i
i need to oh okay it was a bit well it's
about imagine the superhero movie where
you've got one superhero who keeps
tigers and another superhero who's a
woman who also keeps tigers
and they kind of have a grudging respect
for each other apart from they don't
really
then that's pretty much where you are
sounds amazing
i'll watch it after yeah it's huge i'm
just on lincoln letters
did you know that whenever he wrote a
letter that was a bit
angry or telling someone off or
disagreeing with someone as soon as he'd
written it he put it in a locked drawer
overnight
the equivalent of not sending your email
until the next morning
that's clever yeah that's a really good
idea yeah
yeah you should do that more often andy
i stand by everything i said in that
letter to you
i mean andy goes to bed at half night
every night
and those 915 drunken emails from him
too much
did you guys know that abraham abraham
lincoln's hair went to the inauguration
of
teddy roosevelt i didn't know that oh oh
yeah so he was handed a ring by john
haye who was the secretary of state for
roosevelt but he was also lincoln's
personal secretary between 1861 and 65
and he had a strand of lincoln's hair
and he put it into a ring
and the ring was worn by teddy roosevelt
on the day that he was inaugurated in
1905
as president yeah so do they do that
kind of something old something new
something borrowed something that's
right related for the next
inauguration it's going to be uh donald
trump's hair
that's going to be warm and there's
something old is the actual president
yeah something orange
speaking of um donald trump um at time
of recording he still hasn't left the
white house and i'm assuming he probably
won't have done we can put this out any
time now
anytime do you know someone else who
refused to leave the white house
was mary todd lincoln really yeah
so um when abraham lincoln died
obviously it was you know
extremely distressing for her she was
inconsolable she locked herself into the
white house
and andrew johnson couldn't move in and
so andrew johnson became president on
april the 15th and he couldn't move into
the white house until may the 26th
no because mary's harry todd lincoln
just refused to leave
you can buy her opera glasses oh yeah
you can't buy them there's one
actually no there isn't one pair this is
the problem so there is a pair of opera
glasses which ivory and they were
engraved
mary lincoln left these glasses in the
box at ford's theater
uh good friday april 14th when our
president and leader was cruelly
assassinated
um they sold for nine thousand pounds
last year
but there are at least three pairs of
abraham lincoln's opera glasses in
circulation
which does make you consider just how
keen was he on seeing this play
well it's it's so good for the
collectors of the weird
paraphernalia which is a lot of it's
around the assassination isn't it people
collecting stuff that was at the theater
and it's great for them that abraham
lincoln seemed to stuff his pockets with
stuff
um there's a collection i think it's in
the library of congress and it's the
contents of
abraham lincoln's pockets on the night
of the assassination it it's just full i
don't know how big pockets were in those
days
but that was two pairs of glasses
i guess you you lose one while you're
sitting there watching the opera you got
a second
one of them was mended with string i
guess because such a humble guy
such a kind of jeremy corbyn style
leader having
glasses well like jack worth i think
jack duckworth sorry that's a that's
encouraging it's a superhero
he becomes duck man
um it was he was carrying a pocket knife
which i think is so painful because he
could have whipped that out and defended
himself had he not been shot in the back
of there
he would have literally been bringing a
knife to a gunfighter
[Music]
stop the vodkas stop the podcast hi
everybody just wanted to let you know
this week we are sponsored by
the economist magazine yes the economist
magazine
is that brilliant fact-packed magazine
that covers everything from economics to
finance to politics to business science
technology environment is good at all
it's got it all it covers so many areas
of
life in the world today it makes you
informed about what is really going
on i'm reading the latest edition right
now there's a brilliant set of pieces
about making coal
history which is really interesting if
you're interested in the environment
it's so fascinating and then right at
the other end of the spectrum there's a
piece about
maradona an obituary which says that his
first ever ambition was to get a second
pair of core droid trousers
from his footballing skills yeah so it
covers the range
yeah it is a fantastic magazine we all
fight over it in the office
and uh actually we don't have to fight
over the physical copy anymore because
we all have online subscriptions which
means we can sneak away into it
and discover all these facts and if you
want to get access to that
you can via a very generous offer that
they are giving which is
percent off to a one year digital
subscription
if you go to economist.com
fish 50 500 that is that is right just
go to
economist.com fish5o
and you will get 50 percent of your
first year subscribing
okay on with the show on with the show i
wish i had a second pair of cord droid
trousers
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
james okay my fact this week is that if
you ask someone what day it is
they'll take twice as long to answer on
a wednesday as they would on a monday or
friday and that's because
by wednesday you literally have no idea
what day it is
does this data take into account
everyone working at home
and having no idea at all we might come
to that
later oh okay but let me quickly explain
this
um study very quickly so this is a 2015
study by david a
ellis richard wiseman and rob jenkins
and they asked people
what day is it that's the first thing
that they asked and they
timed how long it took people to respond
uh and most of their differences were
not really significant uh statistically
but they did find the statistical
difference between monday and wednesday
which was it took just over half a
second for people to say well it's
monday obviously and
it took about a second and a half just
under for people to go
um it's wednesday and the same was
between wednesday and friday
but none of the other comparisons were
kind of significant
and they reckon that it's because monday
is a really depressing day because the
week's starting
friday's the exciting day because it's
the new monday
and then in the middle they all kind of
come together
and that's what they think friday's
really exciting because i get to go to
bed at 10 o'clock on friday
james when they did the survey when they
were asking people did they kind of
dress up the actual survey as just a bit
of form filling in before the experiment
began saying
all right let's just get you logged in
so what day is it and then timed them
you're smashing it you would be an elite
scientist yeah that's what they did they
didn't tell people what the study was
about and they said okay first of all um
what day what day do you think it is
that's so funny but then
did they ask them to leave straight away
because you'd really think you'd
absolutely failed that initial question
get out
okay you can go the whole rest of the
day you'd be going is it a thursday
it's a tuesday but you'd kind of know it
though because if you had to go in for a
survey
i'd be in the preceding week going oh
god i go remember i've got that survey
on wednesday
what are you doing on wednesday i got to
go and do this survey that would be the
forefront of my mind that's a really
good point i'm not sure in the study if
they thought about that where actually
the fact that they're doing the study
affects the result i suppose it doesn't
away like you say
yeah so the difference might be even
greater the difference
yeah could be could be but during
lockdown that there was a study done
uh in america this was by the southwest
youth service and they asked people what
day it was
and 59 of people said they were unsure
what day it was
and that was this wow most people didn't
know what month it was this year
i'm not sure how scientific that one was
and there was another
um study with a different set of people
which says what does it feel like
and they found that usually people kind
of got it right
but mismatches were 52.2
during a bank holiday so um more than
half of people in a bank holiday week
will not be quite short or will think it
feels like a different day than it
actually feels like
which i think is i agree with that i
definitely have that yeah
yeah yeah people it's because and they
guess they've theorized that it's
because
certain days have stronger identities
than others don't that's what they say
which is really sad for some of the real
personalities days in the middle of the
week
but i think in the um follow-up study
which is also david ellis and co
they ask people for the words they
associate most with certain days
uh it's very predictable it's monday is
words like
boredom tiredness and rubbish friday's
fun friends party
and bacon apparently one of them oh yeah
birds
i mean is there a big tradition of bacon
fridays i don't know about
oh there is i was going to say in my
family um
because i grew up in the catholic family
we weren't allowed to meet or we weren't
supposed to have meat on fridays
i mean maybe that's why you're thinking
about it so much though
yes i could really do with a bacon sally
yeah i think maybe i definitely
this is anecdote now not data but um
i definitely would allow myself to have
a bacon sandwich on a friday
which is a bit really less healthy
than obviously the grains and vegetables
i normally
consume insights into your unbelievably
weird mind
andy friday friday is a huge day for you
isn't it andy bacon how much in the
morning
10 p.m bedtime oh my god you're off the
chain
you probably go to bed early on a
thursday thinking well i i'm really
looking forward to getting up the next
morning like kids on christmas eve
i want to maximize the friday awakeness
yeah
actually this is a thing where people
are more concerned with their health on
a monday than any other day of the week
so just if you look at google searches
people search for health related things
you know how to stop smoking or um
starting a diet or making a doctor's
appointment they do that 80
more on a monday than on a saturday no
one on a saturday is searching yeah
how to give up smoking we've all got
we've all got our bacon hangover that we
can try to get
there are certain countries and cultures
that make it a lot easier for you to
remember what day it is
so in thailand they used to do a thing
where they would dress
in the color of the day so every day is
assigned a color
sunday red monday yellow tuesday pink
wednesday green thursday orange friday
blue saturday purple
and it those colors were all to do with
hindu astrological influences and the
color
was given to each one of them so you
would go out of your house and you would
wear
if it was a monday yellow that would be
the wall everyone will be wearing yellow
on a monday this is yeah this is
this is a while ago so and it might be
that you would have a statement
piece on you that was yellow just to
represent it and nowadays
because everyone knows their own color
because they're born on one of those
days they have a personal color that
becomes their color
so more often than not you'll see that
as a prominent color on someone in
thailand
and you can go oh you were born on a
wednesday or so on that sound
amazing but then if it's a bank holiday
do you turn up on the green day wearing
something blue and everyone's like oh
not embarrassing it's like going it's
like turning up to non-uniform day
forgetting that it's happened and
wearing a uniform isn't it
oh god it's the stuff of nightmares i
know what our colors are for all four of
us here oh yeah
what of what day we were born on so
uh anna you're blue you were born on a
friday was i know
yes james you are blue hey born on
friday hey we're blue twins
yeah and i am a blue hey we're blue
nice one oh this is so nice and cozy and
we're all friends and
we're all the same colors it's like
we've been chosen by the universe
then you're purple you're a saturday
but we are now auditioning for someone
to join the podcast who was born on a
friday
so if that's you get in touch um do you
know someone whose middle name is friday
is it someone really famous i think that
no i do i do but only because of
research but
let's pretend i don't yeah yeah it's
someone it's a fictional character
it's not i know that the horse in that
riddle's first name is friday
he wrote it on a friday yeah yeah it's
it's not man friday is it friday so he'd
be called friday friday
friday was his middle name
but it's someone whose first name is a
day of the week so
oh wednesday adams wednesday adam so
happy middle name is friday
and the reason that she's called
wednesday i mean i know dan knows anyone
know why she's called wednesday
uh it's because wednesday's child is
full of whoa
oh according to that rhyme and so she
was like the
sad child she was miserable yeah
um in ghana you are named after the day
of the week you're born on
okay um so boys are named
uh quadhua komla kwaku your kofi kwami
kwazi after the days of the week and
girls are there are female equivalents
too
and you get that name when you're born
and then you get another name a bit
later on but you keep your day name
and it becomes your middle name so you
can tell from a birth certificate in
ghana
did you say kofi is kofi annan one of
those
masters yeah i guess that kofi is kofi
is one of the names that's the
fifth of the list yeah you just said
andy that you could know from
a birth certificate what day the person
was born how was i saying it dad
i was hoping we i was hoping i'd slip
that one past you
typical typical purple comments
um i looked a bit into wednesday
specifically
because it's this underappreciated day
and
i like the sort of stuff about the word
wednesday
it's it's basically the wrong word so
i've decided we should rename wednesday
it's named after odin who is called
woden
who is the north early norse god um
and it was named that because it was
thought to be a parallel to mercury
which is what so mecca d and all those
romance languages wednesday is named
after mercury the god
but i've recently been listening to the
excellent
um audiobook on norse gods by neil
gaiman and
odin is nothing like mercury so mercury
is you know like it's like a
fun-loving trickster playful wily
odin's not like that i think it should
be loki okay so i'm gonna start calling
wednesday loki
and everyone's gonna get confused um but
the person who decided that it
should be the equivalent it should be
odin was tacitus and this is in the
first century
and it was when the romans were kind of
occupying uh bits of germania as it was
called at the time
and he decided odin was the equivalent
and it was because
and i just love this word they're both
psychopomps
odin and mercury wow and the psychopomp
again a word i'm going to use a lot now
is the word for a deity who escorts
people from earth to the afterlife when
they die
wow that's a psycho that's a great word
i thought that um let's say we're going
to accept that it's
odin's day rather than loki's day yeah
let's just imagine that that's fine
which we all know now it isn't
are all calling it loki's day but let's
imagine it was odin day
why is he not odin's day why is it
woden's day
like it's because it was another name
that was used uh
in germanic areas for odin but odin had
more than 150 different names
any one of which we could have chosen
for wednesday instead of waden
so we could have had grims day a grim
day
it's like for wednesday we could have
had skill finger day
i would have been good uh we could have
had sadder
saturday but i guess that was a bit too
close to saturday so they decided that's
good that's great yeah that's
skill finger date i take it back it
shouldn't be loki day let's call it
school finger date middle finger day
i love that that's so good hey what's
your favorite day of the week guys
it's obviously friday thursday oh dan
you nerd is it thursday because we
recall the podcast on the thursday this
is the highlight of your week
it's the best moment in my whole life no
it's i
i like the number four four is my
favorite number and so
that's the fourth day of the week to my
week schedule i know sunday is
technically the first day so it should
be wednesday
uh yeah uh i think monday is the first
day officially according to the
international standards organization so
i think you're fine
with having thursday in russian thursday
is chet buerkle which means like
fourth day so it works there as well my
favorite i think probably saturday where
i can just chill out and watch the
football
okay everyone's got good answers here
apart from dan whose answer is very
weird statistically
[Laughter]
so 21 of young people say that friday is
their favorite day
uh only six percent of young people like
sundays and that i think that rises as
you get older you can start to
appreciate something a bit more you're
off the bacon binges
um but tuesday is just one percent of
people's favorite day
and i think thursday might be another
one percenter it scores very low
do you know why no one likes tuesday
because we are saying that
wednesday was named after odin and odin
was a pretty cool god right he was the
king of the gods and stuff do you know
who tuesday
was named after no tuesday was named
after
a god called tyr who is one of the most
obscure gods we have literally no idea
anything about this guy
we only have one myth of him
that's that's left we don't really know
anything about him at all
and this was there was a wolf who was a
baby wolf but it was growing really
really quickly and the gods were worried
that this
wolf was gonna get so big he was gonna
eat them all and so they said right
we're gonna have to tie him down so
we're gonna tie him in a load of ropes
and stuff and like
magic god chains uh but when fenrir the
wolf saw the chains he didn't trust that
anything was gonna happen so he said
okay well i'll kind of
come and say hi but only if one of you
puts your arm down my throat
because then i'll trust that you're not
going to chain me up
um and so um tear the god who tuesday is
named after decided
okay well in good faith i'll be the one
who puts my arm
down your throat and then of course they
chained the wolf up and the wolf bit his
arm off
that's the only story we have about the
guy who tuesday's named after
there's it's such an important moral to
that story don't put your arm down a
wolf's throat
the it's isn't important yeah that's
true
yes without that wolf arm casualties
would be way higher than they are
i've got one last thing before we move
on uh which is remember we were talking
about that one who gets the
color wrong as they rock up to a
a sort of school yeah yeah in thailand
i'm afraid
i'm that what because i was
born on a saturday it turns out
ah where are you so what color are you
i'm purple i'm with andy welcome you
traitor
i can't believe it have you just been
double did you have a feeling as you
said that i bet i've got that wrong it
wasn't yeah i think oh
yeah we just tried to get in maya and
then anna's cool club if i pretended
to be a blue i was trying to be a blue
yeah
yeah no i had a weird feeling come over
me i don't feel very blue
i had a quick google it turns out
i was i mean it's so in line with
my facts
[Laughter]
is this a situation where your whole
life you thought you were born on a
friday and you've only just realized
or was it a fact that you thought i know
what day i was born i'm gonna google it
and you just got the wrong answer on
google or which one
i got the wrong answer on google yeah i
double checked it on a different site
just as we were talking because it just
felt wrong and i had a memory
just a memory of saturday i remember
seeing the newspaper
as i came out
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
anna my fact this week is that according
to vietnamese historians
chinese forces were once defeated by a
woman who had breasts
so long she had to throw them over her
shoulders in battle
dearly and this is i think this is the
second fact we've had on the podcast
about
women with breasts so long they have to
throw them over their shoulders one was
a yeti
yeah one's a yessie female yeti um they
have to throw them over their shoulders
before they chase you
or they might trip on them and hurt
themselves yeah yeah
possibly can i ask is this is this lady
as real as a yeti she's i would say
she's more real than a yesterday okay so
i'm going to say this fact is less of a
nonsense fact than dan's because
it's recorded by historians and it's
about a almost certainly historical
figure
but i still find it hard to believe that
this breast thing actually happened but
this
so this is this warrior called lady chu
or lady true as we'd anglicize it and
she
is amazing and she's a hero in vietnam
in the third century she
led this revolt against the invading
chinese wu
state and the yeah the writing about her
from almost contemporary
said that she was this extraordinary
figure and
her features included four foot long
breasts which either she tossed over her
shoulders to get them out the way or
sometimes
she tied them to her torso so they
didn't get in the way that's interesting
because i read in one account that they
said that she had three breasts
that were four feet long yes um so i can
imagine how two of them can be thrown
over the shoulder but the other one's
gonna hit you in the face isn't it when
you yeah it is
yeah maybe that's the one she strapped
to her stomach yeah i've seen a painting
of her with the third
sneaky third brush hanging down there
okay so we're not disputing the length
of the boobs
we've actually just cracked that she had
three and both of these points about
going over the shoulders around the
stomach are true
well also that's exciting nine feet tall
that was the other thing as well so i
think
yeah you know yeah this is a sort of
tradition in vietnam where some
historic warriors take on this mythical
status and then
they are written up as becoming more and
more godlike so yeah she
was written up as being nine feet tall
she could walk over a thousand miles in
a day
but there are various things we think
she probably did do like
rode elephants into battle um so rode on
an elephant's head
the story says she thought with a sword
in each hand again
probably why she had to tie down her
breasts because otherwise you're in
danger of slicing one off aren't you oh
yeah
um she had a voice as loud as a temple
bell
so but i think she probably did exist
although oddly
she's not mentioned in chinese sources
whereas she's mentioned a lot in
vietnamese sources
but i think for china this was just uh
you don't really want to write about
this
people who defeated you a lot especially
if it's this woman with extraordinary
breasts whereas in vietnam
it was much more of a great thing to
record although there is one thing that
a lot of the women got written out of
history
in china didn't they when uh
neo-confucianism came in
they kind of changed the rules a little
bit so um women
had to be at home and had to have this
exact role in society
and so a lot of the historians in china
wrote out all of the women
in history i think yeah that was 10th
century or something
it was i think it was before that and
vietnamese society used to be
much more equal in fact impressively
equal until it was sort of from the
first century
chinese started really encroaching and
like you say it was confucianism they
really liked nuclear families
it's just all the same old stories isn't
it nuclear family is women subservient
to men
whereas vietnamese society was much more
clown-based it was quite matriarchal
some people say that it was actually
more women-led than than man-led
and so it wasn't totally unusual for the
idea of female warriors and female
fighters
so she she was eventually defeated and
there's a kind of myth about how she was
defeated which is really
uh nice well it's a maybe a slightly
sexist myth actually the myth is that
she was very fastidious
and that the chinese general who
defeated her sent his men out of the
fortress
naked kicking up all the dirt and grime
and she was so horrified by this that
she left the battlefield
and then her men all panicked because
obviously the nine-foot warrior general
has
run away and that's why they were
defeated but that it feels slightly like
she can't cope with a bit of grime yeah
on some man's willys
yeah people that was chinese historians
who said the men exposed their genitals
and scared her off which interestingly
was also claimed of the trung sisters
who were some other vietnamese warriors
and it was said they were defeated when
men show them their balls well there was
this idea that you could
scare these people away with penises
wasn't there because
and there is the really funny story of
the chinese commander
who after lady trio died and started
having nightmares where she came to him
in his dreams
and was saying that she was gonna kill
him and so to keep her away he hung
a hundred wooden penises um outside his
house
so that she wouldn't come to him in his
dreams i mean that takes a lot of
um like it takes a lot of explaining
away doesn't it when
your relatives come around to visit yeah
why are there 100 wooden penises outside
your house
well i just saw it in homes and gardens
last week they had
they had a special offer on which if you
buy one you get 99
free well what about the um
the trunk sisters then and who you just
mentioned oh yeah they're cracking as
well
again these are real vietnamese heroes
aren't they worshipped in vietnam
so this was the first century a couple
of hundred years before
two and they were chung track and trung
knee
and they defeated an invading chinese
army and they actually conquered 65
cities
in the end and this is about 80 40 and
trung track became queen and apparently
she was a lovely queen she was quite had
quite a soft rule
um she tried to restore a lot of
vietnamese practices
and yeah they're amazing and the idea is
that they were raised by their mother
who taught them just like you teach men
and so taught them
how to fight taught them lots of
military skills uh
yeah and these um these 65 cities that
they conquered
um the head of each city became like the
head of one of their
armies almost all one of their groups uh
all women so they had 65 female generals
who would
fight in the wars against the chinese
yes one of which was the mum right
yes exactly oh really oh they're like
the kardashians in that sense
that the the momager figure is still
very important to them
very much like that just exactly exactly
yeah they once killed a tiger
um so that they could write a promise to
the people of vietnam on its skin
if you've run out of paper sometimes
it's all you can do
i think khloe kardashian did that once
actually
and these trunk sisters were descendants
of lak
long kuan who was the original dragon
lord who is
according to the creation myth of
vietnam he was the founder of the
vietnamese people
uh he married an immortal fairy called
alcor
and they got married and she laid 100
eggs who
gave birth to the 100 noble families of
vietnam and they became the elite of the
vietnamese society
50 of them preferred to live in the
mountains 50 of them prefer to live
by the sea uh and they kind of split
into these two groups
of it's a bit custody battle isn't it
it's a bit um custody i think it's made
out of eggs or
[Laughter]
no you're right it's like um like half
of the people went with the dragon lord
and half of them went with the immortal
fairy and
yeah families that would have made a
cracking version of that film the parent
trap wouldn't it where you've got to get
your
your parents back together but they're a
dragon lord and an immortal fairy i
watched the parent trap last weekend
that's so weird which version uh the new
one with um
lindsay lohan sorry heather now you say
new that's pretty old when i said that
moodle rouge was a recent film i got the
crap kicked out of me on this podcast
this comparison new compared to the old
one
i said that moon route was recent
compared with the history of film and it
didn't cut
any eyes
[Laughter]
anyway my point is it would have been
vastly improved if it had included some
kind of dragon lord feature
so it's a good comparison i've got a
couple of things
on modern vietnamese women sort of okay
who are pretty interesting um today so i
found this really interesting thing
which is
the nail industry in america so for
manicures and so on
approximately 51 of nail technicians in
america
are vietnamese descendants so either
vietnamese american
or have moved over there 80 percent in
california
and this only happened in the last 40
years and it's as a result
as far as we know of one single person
which is tippy hedren really now tippy
had
the actor the actor who was in the
alfred hitchcock movies
um she's the mother of melanie griffiths
yeah she was in the birds
she was at refugee camp for vietnamese
in california 40 years ago and while she
was there she thought it'd be good to
teach a skill and she noticed that they
were all very obsessed with her
beautiful nails she had them beautifully
manicured and painted
and they all wanted to look at it so she
brought her manicurist in
and a lot of the women who were there as
refugees were part of
the military intelligence so they were
sort of high-ranking women a lot of
influence
and they all got taught how to do this
and over 40 years
that spread to be a proper way of
earning your money in america for them
to the point where it's now 51
of them wow all descended from this
supposedly from this one refugee camp
that tippy hedren
just happened to say who wants to learn
how to do this that is incredible
remarkable it could be also different if
tibi hedron had brought something
else well if she taught them i don't
know bowling it could be like
80 percent of bowling champions in
america
are of descended from vietnamese
refugees oh thank god it was her and not
you i feel like tippy hedren had her eye
on the commercial market a bit more than
you did
the demand for bowling tutors wasn't
quite what it should be there is money
in bowling if you're good
at it and if you the problem is that in
america there's so many people who
already do bowling
that even if you have been taught by
tippy hedren it's still gonna be quite
hard to break into
that elite i'm gonna say yeah i do see
what you mean there
it's a problem okay yeah
i i won't try and start this
the first female billionaire in vietnam
was not too long ago and it was as a
result of something which actually
slightly
uh sets women back i would say uh via
jet air
there was this thing i don't know if you
remember the bikini clad flight
attendants
this is the idea that they would all
dress in bikinis and it became very
popular
because they all have three breasts
[Laughter]
well so she made her money off that
airline yeah she made it she made it go
public and when it went public it turned
her into a billionaire
and she's the first ever billionaire
from vietnam
see i'm into your minds about that
because i can't i
like women but i hate billionaires it's
difficult that is tough
well luckily there's not many of them
luckily most of the billionaires are men
yeah thank god i can still like most
women
so um it's really interesting i find
about vietnamese
history which is the fact that it's kind
of historical but at the same time so
much of it is very obviously
folklore and and not real and try and
work out which is which
and i suppose that's quite a lot of
similarity with things like the amazons
right
which were largely thought to be quite a
mythological
group of women who were like um warriors
who attack the greeks and
various different people but actually
the more we look at it the more we think
that there might have been some truth in
it
um so there's this group of people who
lived around ukraine
and around all the way up to siberia and
from
around the ninth century bc they were
attacking the greeks and attacking a lot
of different groups around there
but because they were a nomadic tribe
you can't really say well
this group of society will stay at home
and this group of society will go to
battle basically everyone had to go
everywhere and so all the women got
taught how to fight and we know this
because
a lot of burials have been found of
sydney and women and about one-third of
them have been buried with weapons which
um suggest that they will have been
warriors and so we think now that a lot
of the amazonian
stories that came through uh classical
times might have been referring to these
city and women
really yeah that makes sense kind of
interesting
and because of their horse riding skills
they could deliver any package
with one day delivery that was the
amazonian promise back in the day
[Music]
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that one of the few
incredibly rare times a giant squid has
been seen attacking an ocean vessel
which was an image made famous by jules
verne was in 2003
when a boat was attacked while competing
in the jules verne trophy race
amazing what incredible coincidence
um so this was i should say that this
was reported by
the captain of this ship taking part in
this race olivier de casalson
and he is a captain who's had over 40
years of
experience in the ocean and he was
taking his boat
on this trip when suddenly it kind of
ground to a halt he was thinking what
the hell is going on
and he saw through the porthole this
giant squid which was attached to it
he's never seen anything like this in
his life he quickly radioed it in
saying we've got a giant squid that's
attached to the boat um
they brought it to a complete halt so
they stopped it completely and it sort
of just disattached itself
and went off and that's the last that we
saw of it so we don't have a photo
we don't have anything that can sort of
completely verify
other than his experience as a sailor um
and as a good sailor as well so the
jewel then trophy is
to try and beat the record of going
around the world isn't it did he beat
the record do you know
so the way the jules verne trophy works
is you hand over the trophy to someone
who beats
the record weirdly there's a world
record which is separate to the jules
verne so you have to specifically pay up
to this membership group
so he did not win it that year in 2003
but he did win it in 2004.
so what i'm thinking dan is in 2003
he's sailing around the world he hasn't
beaten the record and when he comes back
he says well it's because i got attacked
by a giant squid
and they say do you have any photos of
it and he goes no i don't have any
photos
but i got attacked by jessica then
that's why i didn't win the race
and i'm not saying that he's lying i'm
just i
agree i'd like to see some evidence i
agree and i would love to see some
three-foot boobs
we can't we can't all have what we want
um
that's absolutely true it's not the
first thing you do if the first thing
you do when you're being attacked by a
giant squid is take a photo of it then
you're one of those irritating
millennial types who's always got your
iphone on you
and actually they're a bigger fish to
fry like getting it off your boat
i'm i'm with this guy um you know the
jules verne trophy that you mentioned
then
yeah it floats but it doesn't float
just in water it floats in air
what what this is so cool the jules
verne trophy is a metal sculpture of a
ship's hull right it's quite long it
looks like it's about six or eight feet
long
and at the ceremony where you hand it
over because you have to hand it over to
the next people to wet it
everyone puts on gloves and you take it
out of its case where it is floating
on top of a magnetic field you hand it
to the guys who've won it and they put
it back in this
huge glass case in a magnetic field so
it just hovers there
in mid-air and then they put it away
again that's quite oh it's a floating
trophy isn't that awesome
why does it because of the magnetic
field yeah but just because it's cool
right
that's the idea yeah because it's cool
yeah great joel's word he's a
science fiction writer well it's a cool
science fiction thing jules verne
the reason that this is named after him
is because it's around the world in 80
days right which is what he wrote
can you name any kind of transport that
phillius fogg used in around the world
in 80 days
balloon hot air blood pod air blue
amazingly not right
in the book he doesn't go in a hot air
balloon at any stage
it's so weird it's if you look at in all
the disney films he's always in a hot
air balloon and if you look at like lots
of the books
with an illustration on the front
there's always a hot air balloon in it
or on the posters or whatever
but no he just goes by train and by
boats i mean it would be a much more
boring disney film wouldn't it just a
guy getting trains around
yeah it's a commute it's a film that's a
michael portello documentary not
the most friendly novel of the 19th
century that's fascinating
i think the first thing he wrote was
about balloon wasn't it it was a short
story about called something like
adventures in a balloon and i feel like
people must have conflated
those uninflated conflated and inflated
that balloon god you don't inflate the
balloon of one of those
hot air balloons do you don't you you do
that wasn't the main problem with that
joke i have to say
the technical issue you're right
yeah jill's friend had an amazing life
didn't he yeah i loved the fact as a boy
his uncle was the mayor of brains
yeah i'm not sure i'm pronouncing the
french town of brains correctly
but really how does it spell it's spelt
brains um
he was mates with alexandra duma amongst
other people who was this great
inspiration for him and actually
kind of sadly dumas son once wrote to
jules verne
saying uh that he considered phone the
true son of duma
over himself which shows a real
lack of self-confidence what did did he
write he wrote musketeers was that yeah
and monte cristo
yes sorry andy for your pronunciation in
french you might know him as an
alexander dumbass
do you guys know how jules verne and
dumas first met
apparently um in a hot air balloon
nice it's almost as cool this is
actually something that was
sent in by a listener called elise
kramer and it's from a 1954
article about a party that vern was at
where he was kind of bored and he was a
bit of a
bit of a rogue and he i think he was
referred to as witty and impudent in the
article
and so he decided to leave and he left
by sliding down the banister
slid down a banister smashed straight
into someone at the bottom
like smashed into his torso so stood up
didn't know what to say
said the first thing that came to his
head said have you had dinner quite an
odd thing to say to a stranger
and the man replied he'd had an omelette
at which vern
said no one could make an omelette as
well as as well as he could and so this
guy was like all right you make such a
good omelet
make me an omelette i'll come around for
dinner next wednesday and he
gave him
it's a true story this guy handed over
his business card
and it was alexandra duma this sounds
like you know
um if you you and your partner met on
tinder or something
and you're like well we're gonna have to
come up to the start whenever it asks us
how we met
i'll say that i made an omelette you say
you're coming down the banister
yeah omelette was the original eggplant
emoji i think
there was a sexual thing going on there
so the thing about joven
is in britain i would say we kind of see
him
as more of a kids author right because i
certainly read
a lot of his stuff when i was a teenager
or younger still
and the reason is because he had really
bad translations into english
so his in france and in russia and in
lots of different countries he's seen as
quite a serious author
but in britain he's more of a kid's
author and these translations were just
bad
uh and the thing about translate his
translations i find really interesting
is that the british ones were then
translated into japanese
so in japan they get a translated
version of the
english stuff not the french stuff i
mean obviously these days you get better
translations from everything but the
original
japanese ones and then in china they
translated the japanese ones
which had been translated from english
which had been translated from french
so you get this weird sort of chinese
whispers things going on
but also in chinese kind of oral
tradition
as a storyteller you would kind of add
your own little footnotes and stuff like
that right
and so the original french one section
of well i think i've not have not
written down what bucket is but i think
it's around the world in 80 days
uh and really apologies for my french
here but it says something like
pondon lager federal de atta
baltimore on planned maryland so it says
after the civil war a new club that was
very influential
was established in baltimore which is in
maryland
and the chinese version becomes anyone
who has studied world geography in
history knows of a place called america
as for the american war of independence
not the civil war by the way
even children know that it was an
earth-shattering event a deed that ought
to be recalled often and never forgotten
now among all those states that
participated in the war one of them was
called maryland
whose capital baltimore not the capital
was a famous city
teaming with crowds and packed with the
traffic of horses and carriages
in this city was a club magnificent in
appearance and as soon as you saw the
high-flying american flag
flapping in the wind in front you
naturally felt a sense of awe
amazing translation of that one sentence
and someone who doesn't want to be a
translator they want to be an author
translation by the word
[Laughter]
and the only thing people are going to
write in about is um the reference to
maryland as opposed to maryland oh
maryland yeah
i'll be furious james not so easy now
isn't it
there was a guy who claimed to be the
real phillies fog
uh who was called george francis train
we've mentioned him once before actually
i think
um so he went around the world in 1870
and then the book was published at about
1873
give or take but he had already traveled
around the world
um supposedly in 80 days yes so he was
80 days traveling
but he stopped off in paris for two
months
during each time he was arrested and
sent to prison for two weeks
and i think it might have been dumas who
got him out of prison actually
um but he was basically it wasn't really
an
80-day full trip right but the first
person who did it in under 80 days i
think was nellie bly who did it in 1890
right
and she did it yeah that's right
and released the book around the world
in 72 days very unimaginative
i think you could sue her for that but
she also she pit stopped and said hi to
jules verne along the way how meta is
that cool
yeah it is weird it's like your books
coming to life in front of your very
eyes
so she was a journalist right and she
was
working for was it the new york world it
was for some
was pulitzer anyway yeah so she was
working for pulitzer
and she said i want to go around the
world in 80 days
and i want to like write my story about
it she's an investigative journalist
and the newspaper had a nellie bligh
guessing match where people could guess
exactly how
long it would take her to get around the
world um
by you know by the minute and if you got
the closest then you'd win a prize
and she traveled by ship train and
donkey the three things that she's nice
to right
feels like the ship in the train
probably did most of the legs
when she met vern in paris she he said
you know i'm so impressed by you if you
managed to do this in 79 days
i'll applaud with both hands
don't you question what the alternative
way of applauding is
yeah she was cool she they didn't want
to send her around at first i don't
think so she had this idea and she
insisted on being sent around the world
and first the editor of the new york
world
said uh no a woman can't do this i'm
afraid
and she said very well start the man and
i'll start the same day for some other
newspaper and beat him
and so then they they caved and she sort
of put one outfit a few changes of
underwear
but she had a rival didn't she this
woman called elizabeth bisland
who was sent round by cosmo and it was
the sort of classy alternative to nellie
bly
who was racing her basically but nellie
didn't know to begin with right so
she was engaged in a race she wasn't
aware of and then when she found out she
just didn't care if she was like i'm not
doing this
forever oh really yeah yeah she claimed
she didn't care but she sprinted away
when she was told
i'd rather see if they're going to
remake around the world in 80 days for
one billionth time
or whatever for disney then i would much
rather see
the nelly bly versus this woman from
cosmo
trying to race around the world in 80
days rather than some philly
character it's not great spectator i
guess because the race is very much
two quite separate people you just have
to keep cutting between them she said
apparently the moment when she found out
was in hong kong
and so nelly blair arrived in hong kong
and elizabeth bislam was beating her
at the time and in fact i think was
beating her until she got back to
britain where she was told she'd missed
her boat
which was actually a lie she hadn't
missed a boat no one knows if that was a
trick
but when nellie blair got to hong kong a
guy who met her there said oh are you
the one that's racing
the other the other person and nelly
said yeah i'm
i'm in a race i'm in a race with time
and the guy said
i don't think that was her name
[Laughter]
thus she discovered it is a good premise
for a film because one of them's all
is working for cosmo it's all kind of
high powered and you know doing it in
high heels and a little scrubbed up and
the other one's nelly bligh who's sort
of a you know street urchin vibe to her
that's what i was saying it's amazing
and then it's a bit like
race around the world where you make
them have to stop in london and
meet each other and stay in the same
hotel and talk about you know
okay fine and they become friendly
yeah they become friends no but they
become enemies but they respect each
other like superheroes and
super enemies like forgers and their
chasers
okay another part of nellie bly's life
which would have been a good movie
is when she exposed all the insane
asylums in america
because she pretended to be insane and
got herself committed
to an asylum on blackwell's island
in new york and it was a basically an
expose of how badly treated these sick
people were
she showed that they were doing beatings
and ice-cold baths and forced meals
including really rotten butter and
rotten food
and that actually changed the way that
asylums worked in america thanks to her
expose
yeah but she never got out that's the
sad thing she kept saying i'm a
journalist i've just been writing an
expose
sure you are yeah i've always i've been
around the world about 80 days
yeah right yeah and the nurse the nurse
turns around and suddenly you see it's
elizabeth

favorite facts to each other and to you
alright dorks we love you merry

[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you live from
king's place in london
[Music]
i'll edit the cheers in later my name is
dan schreiber i am sitting here with
anna toshinski andrew hunter murray and
james harkin
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones
with our four favorite facts from the
last seven days and in no particular
order
here we go starting with fact number one
and that's my fact this week
my fact is that every year in the uk
a joke committee gets together to
whittle down a short list of jokes
that they think are unfunny enough to
put in christmas crackers
amazing yeah there's a company called
robin reed which was set up by a guy
called julian reed and
every year they get together a group of
them they sit in a room
and they each read out jokes and if it
gets a laugh
julian rejects it he says he says no
that's not going in
oh wow and it's this big theory which i
think a lot of people know which is that
the idea of cracker jokes is that
they're not meant to be funny they're
meant to be groan worthy because
you don't want to isolate anyone at the
dinner table of wanting to tell a joke
if they know that they
might deliver it and it won't get a
laugh and also if you're one of those
kind of people who doesn't really
understand jokes very well you're not
feeling bad because you're not laughing
right everyone else is laughing you're
like i don't understand yeah
i think richard wiseman theorised this
didn't he um who's like obviously a
great psychologist who also talks about
christmas crackers
but the idea is that you are supposed to
blame your tools
no one is a bad workman you don't want
to humiliate anyone around the dinner
table that they can't deliver
good jokes so it's all the joke's fault
which is quite nice it's a scapegoat
it's a scape joke
okay who do you think lasts most at
cracker jokes who laughs most
well which profession member lost most
at crackers well comedians don't laugh
at any jokes
there was a survey they found a thousand
people from ten professions okay to take
part
uh so 100 from each job right so they've
got 10 kinds of job
and their reactions were rated into a
laugh a smile or nothing
okay and then they robin reed released
the results of this
study so the profession that laughed
most was funeral directors
oh really then doctors then accountants
the vicars were the least likely to
laugh i can't believe they've got 100
vicars at 100 funeral directors and
seriously got
them to do this research that's a fun
sitcom surely that science lab they all
get locked in
100 vickers 100 funeral directors yeah
we get to pull these crackers by the way
yeah why not we can read it well i know
why not because we're not allowed to
touch each other or even get close to
each other we can pull our own crackers
okay okay i actually uh let me pull out
and i'm going to tell you something
about that
all right it's going to be an awkward
silence now
oh that lovely smell it's so nice
it's such a nice smell oh okay well i've
got a glue
i've got yeah i've got a joke here okay
yeah yeah
what did adam say on the day before
christmas
um i was born many many thousands of
years before jesus so this really
doesn't
have any application to me as a person
don't touch that [ __ ] apple
he said happy christmas eve like a
variation
a variation you got it it's christmas
eve well done
i've got one who played edward
scissorhands in the movie of the same
name
christian bale edward norton sean penn
or johnny depp
i don't i don't get it no
[Laughter]
is that one of those that you're not
supposed to get i think so i think we
all
no we're given facts as well these are
trivia questions all right okay if we'd
known about these crackers years ago
this is a gold mine of information
i've got one i'm gonna save that one for
fact number four who got these crackers
are you really i am okay here's a joke
why did the oyster leave the party early
uh because he had a he had a shocking
bad time
that's really good but though he was
because he was being really shellfish
and just get home these are so much
better than the slightly
sexist one that i've got why do they
always leave the party early yes because
you wanted to get a pearly night
early early yeah yeah yeah no he um
he pulled a muscle he pulled the
so you say sexy as opposed to sexy it
should have been sexy shouldn't it yeah
and i have the world oh i had the world
record for pulling
crackers on your own um for a short
amount of time earlier this year
guinness world record guinness world
record as in the guy from guinness was
there and watched me do it and counted
how many i pulled and i beat the world
record
uh only for it to be beaten about three
hours later by alan davis
no yeah so we did it in a qi rehearsal
yeah and
i was pretending to be alan for the show
and they gave me two boxes of crackers
and saw how many i could pull in a
minute
and i yeah absolutely smashed it and
then
because i did so many they gave alan an
extra box and then he could beat my
record
that's sad how many did you get it was
two full boxes so it must been 24.
did he manage to make a call back to hq
and say log harken down or
did you just miss that all together no i
i might have got really lucky that when
they were printing the guinness book of
records 2020 it was just in that
two-hour slot you kept changing the
recording schedule didn't you
make sure i've got another one
twitch actress and her mother died
within a day of each other in december
2016.
this is genuinely in a cracker it's
carrie fisher and
debbie reynolds debbie reynolds that's
right well to be honest the
funeral directors would have pissed
themselves at that one
christmas has come you're bang on time
for them genuinely a christmassy thing
what have you got
yeah i've had johnny depp and i've had
people dying within a day of each other
you just haven't got the joke out it's a
slightly different format and you can't
tell the difference between a fact and a
joke
which is what's been holding his back
who played the role of nelson mandela in
the 2009 film invictus
what is this cracker
oh jesus i've got another i've got
another
joke from christmas crackers oh yeah and
that is what kind of medicine does
dracula take
blood and the answer is and you'll get
this in quite a lot of your crackers
this year a lot of people will get this
in their crackers this year
the answer is con medicine
c-o-n medicine doesn't make any sense
right
yeah so according to matt parker who is
our friend who's a mathematician
uh and all-around good guy according to
him when computers write down the
letters
ffi okay the ff and i are kind of
kind of squish together so instead of
putting them down as actual letters on
their own
they have just an ffi character so it's
just one
code that they put in just for the ffi
now not all computers
can read that and not all computers know
that when they see that code they're
supposed to put ffi so some of them just
miss it out
and so it's supposed to be coffin
medicine
but loads and loads of cracker companies
have this particular computer system
that misses out the ffi
and for years and years and years you'll
see it on the internet every year people
see this and they're like i don't get
this joke
oh what's it mean what's it mean it's so
good that's amazing no good
you know you you claimed you alleged
that yours was sexist even though i
wasn't it was sick it wasn't really yeah
but i don't think it was sexy because
sorry
i i think it was sexy i was certainly
around the muscle
um well the person who runs tom the tom
smith cracker company so tom smith was
allegedly the person who invented
crackers 150 years ago and his company
became
a company is today which still sells a
hell of a lot of crackers
person who runs it said in 2005 that the
only changes they've made to any of the
jokes since 1950
is going through every year to take out
the offensive ones so
that's why they seem quite dated yeah
she said it's mainly things attacking
the scottish and women not attacking
sorry uh
joshing in a potentially offensive way
about scottish people and women
and they go through extract those that
means for years they were looking at the
coffin dracula joke
going that's good that's nice it's not
offensive
offensive um we should give a shout out
to peter kempton
who literally wrote the book on crackers
he's written a book a history of
christmas crackers and i think he used
to work with the tom smith company as
well
right so he went i think he went through
the company archives because they used
to have crackers for everything it
wasn't just for christmas
or rather i think they released them at
christmas but they were themed every
year
so for example in 1882 the crackers were
featured around the
battle of tel-el kabir in the
anglo-egyptian war
that's a theme wow 1904 you had tom
smith's russo-japanese war crackers
i don't know what was in them but they
had a lot of these very
themed ones so they had suffragette ones
had spinster ones specifically for
spinsters which included
a wedding ring some faded flowers and
some makeup
wow yeah that's rubbing it in what are
you gonna do with a wedding ring it's
you're right yeah you're right yeah it
is rubbing again yeah
i even think if you're a splinter who
finally gets lucky at christmas manages
to almost seduce someone and then says
well i happen to have this wedding ring
from a christmas cracker
that might be what puts the word off
they also had one for
the discovery of the tomb of tutankhamun
in 1920 or whatever that was
and in the same year one that celebrated
the prince
edwards world tour and it was advertised
with you've met the prince
now pull the cracker that's so good
um so this tom smith guy it's alleged
that he invented it
and he got the idea when he was in paris
and he had seen
it was in baguette shots and beget shots
exclusively
they sold the guts only um and it was
little sweets wrapped up one of those
being sold in baguette shops then
this is a tiny baguette you've got this
isn't going to feed the whole thing
terrible
yeah they were next to the baguettes
they weren't in the baguettes but he saw
that and he thought that looks really
interesting why don't i try and apply
that back to my shop back in england
right he did that
was he inspired by the baguette too
because often you get
the tug of war of the baguettes yeah no
but he it's there's a lot of mythology
around it right because we don't we
don't know what the true story is and
it sort of evolved over time so the
crackling bit was supposedly he was at
his house asleep by the fire
and a log cracked and he woke up and
went
my goodness bangs of expectation
and supposedly which is what they were
called for ages
um i've tried to find that term bangs of
expectation i can't find it before about
1960. yes that's what i mean it seems
like mythology right because it just
kind of appears
they were originally called bangs of
expectation but i don't think it's true
because they were definitely called
cossack
for a while weren't they which was
apparently because the crack sounds like
a cossack's whip
and you do see that but that's
interesting actually the the
the exact wording according to the myth
of him waking up by the fire is he
yelled bangs of
bonbons as soon as he woke up
and then he thought wow that would be
great inside my weird baguette thing
and then that evolved into the cracker
i'm banned from all the bakeries now
though so it was his mythology wasn't it
what's up smith yeah isn't he
he said i've invented the cracker i'm
genius here's how i did it
and he claimed to be the inventor and i
think he did invent them didn't he
he did he definitely did invent them
there was someone else around the time
who was interviewed by henry mayhew the
journalist in 1850 just before
uh thomas smith came along and he was
called gaudente sparranya panni
which lovely i want him to invent to
them because of that name
and so he he was an italian migrant and
he came over and he said he invented
them and he actually in the interview
by henry mayhew he gives him an italian
accent which i won't
but he said yes it writes down the
italian accent yeah so it's d
e for the um it's dem for them right
it's pretty crude he said yes i make
detonating crackers and i'm the only man
in england skillful enough to make them
it lives in my breast alone the full
entire secret
and then he said what they're useful for
and he said what happens is at parties
the pretty lady pull
a sudden bang and the lady goes ah
wow amazing amazing that he
kind of talking about the lady going ah
and all that because both his daughters
were really prominent suffragettes
what made them become prominent
suffragettes we may never know
their dads spooking ladies
one of them was maude uncliff senate and
she was once imprisoned in holloway for
breaking the windows of the offices of
the daily mail
because they hadn't reported a rally
that had happened but in fairness the
newspaper paid her fine in the end and
she came out
uh and she was um part of a
group called women's social and
political union uh but she left them in
1908 she resigned
because she really she thought that the
people who were in charge
really weren't doing the job properly
and then i found separately that in 1909
they made their first ever suffragette
christmas crackers
the year after she'd left that must have
been such a slap
oh that is a real slam because she ran
she took over the company sporaniapani's
company and ran it and
i've got a suspicion i don't like to
cast this person on a true feminist but
i think she might have just pretended to
be a suffragette to sell crackers
because she used to put adverts for the
cracker company in all the suffragette
newspapers
oh it's a good i mean it's a good idea
because who goes
oh when they see a cracker women where
do you find lots of women
suffragette rallies it's obvious
marketing genius
if you let off a cracker at a
suffragette rally the uproar and the
riot that would have broken out
but actually isn't that true about the
bank that i read somewhere in fact it
was on the
tom smith website that they used to put
them all together and pull them and make
massive bang to train soldiers what it
would be like in war
yeah it's on their website i mean that's
amazing the second world war it was a
way of getting
used to the sound of gunfire you could
only imagine how unprepared you would be
for d-day
crawling around the beach is looking for
your paper crown wait for the joke wait
for the joke
who played
um we've got to move on shortly oh can i
tell you about a
a giant cracker very quickly it's from
um oh man i think it's around the turn
of the century so
around 1900 the the smith factory they
made an eight-foot cracker
which was to be pulled by a group of
clowns led by the famous harry payne at
the jury lane pantomime
it contained various things so the
sources all differ because it was meant
to be reused every night but it
apparently contained a costume change
for the whole cast
inside the cracker several hundred
smaller crackers which were then handed
out to the children in the audience
and then other sources say there was
just a person inside the cracker a sort
of
child who just burst out of the cracker
and started doing something
wow but yeah that's very dangerous
because you risk snapping the child
right in half presumably
but useful if you're a spinster because
you have a child without having to get
married
spitster's in the audience spinster's
night of dreary lane
um i've actually just got i've got one
last thing before we move on which is
that
the crackers i was talking about this
joke committee was run by julian reed
so julian reed started this in 1975 when
he was a young school boy he was
obsessed over it he got a two pound 50
cracker kit and he made his own crackers
and he started making them himself and
he started selling them to local shops
built it up and built it up and he's
become this guy who 40 christmases later
is still
making crackers for the country over 10
million go over
so um i actually emailed him to say
can you give me any extra facts about
crackers some of the stuff that i've
already said
about the committee and rejecting but
what he's also done
is he has read out to me some of the
jokes that made it through the committee
this
year that will be appearing in this
year's christmas crackers if you get a
robin read you're going to hear it
wait a minute so this goes out actually
the day before christmas so spoiler
alert
yeah spoiler alert yeah yeah so yeah
apologies
i really hope he reads out the con
medicine one
i really hope because he plays edward
scissorhands
so we've become we've become whatsapp
buddies and he's been sending me voice
memos
so amazing here are a few of the jokes
that will be appearing in this year's
crackers
this is julian reed founder of robin
mead crackers
why did the donut seller retire he was
fed up with the whole business
what is the best thing about deadly
snakes
they've got poisonality
[Music]
what do you call a man with a seagull on
his head
cliff good got it
stunning that's from the voice of the
jokes of crackers
that's great amazing anyway thank you to
julian for that and we need to move on
to our next facts
stop the poker stop the podcast hi
everybody just wanted to let you know
that this week we are sponsored by
yext yes yes now
who are next well yext are a powerful
powerful
search engine that you can use for your
businesses website so when people go to
your website and they want to learn like
what's your returns policy
or what times you're open or stuff like
that they want to put something in a
search bar but often those results
are really quite terrible but yes they
will really do this job extremely well
that's true it basically integrates all
the ways that you are telling
your customers and the people who are
visiting your site about your service
your product whatever it might be
and it's a way of giving them the
results that they need giving them the
answers the facts about your business
so that they don't just then bounce off
to a search engine
i.e the main search engine there is
which starts with a g and they will be
bombarded with adverts there and not the
answers that they were already on your
site looking for
it's all about getting the right facts
and that is literally what we're all
about
it's exactly that yes it's exactly that
and guess what they're offering
a free 90-day trial of yexed answers and
if you want to get that all you have to
do is go to yex that's y
e x t dot co dot uk slash
no such thing that is right it will
start giving your customers answers
not ads oh well ironically this is an ad
oh yeah but it's also an answer yes
it is i think you mean yext it is
okay what was that website again yext
dot co dot uk no such thing cool
and that is for a 90 90-day trial okay
on with the podcast on with the show
[Music]
it is time for fact number two and that
is
anna my fact this week is that in the
1880s
to defend against attacks on nativity
scenes one priest
issued knuckle dusters to his
congregation
wow things got pretty heated round about
this
time so uh this was there were a lot of
riots going on around about this time in
the uk
from anti-paper so basically a lot of
people felt like the
anglican church was creeping back
towards catholicism and the pope
and doing all sorts of things like
putting decorations up and
doing weird blessings and worshipping
idols and you know all that
fun frivolous stuff that the protestant
church didn't really like
and so when for instance people put up
nativity scenes and did this big
ceremony called the blessing of the crib
they were often vandalized
and people used to get quite violent and
so there was a priest who
issued yeah knuckle dusters you can
actually see them if you go to cleveland
court which is in somerset i think
one of the knuckle dusters is on display
that he issued to the people of this
stately home to say
look if they start trying to tear down
your nativity you have my blessing and
god's blessing
to crack him in the cell amazing yeah i
mean
he must have been able to source loads
of knuckle dusters which is quite
impressive
you had a lot of knuckle dusters around
in those days they were a bit more
common
were they yeah you used to make them out
of coins and used to like make holes in
coins and then put them together and
you'd be able to
give someone a bunch of fives nice
yeah and so do we know if they were used
in a big battle i don't have any
i don't know it was a big battle because
i think i found a few big battles
um so one of the main offenders of um
people who wanted to stop all these
processions and stuff was a guy called
s p andrew who was in manchester and i
was reading a story about him
in the british newspaper archives and
this was in the sun
in thursday the 5th of january 1871
and apparently there was a procession
going round and he tried to stop
them from walking around with this cross
and they just stop them and stop them
and start them and eventually they went
round
and then the next day they'd been trying
to put decorations up
and then he'd take the decorations down
and then he put the decorations up again
and then he take them down
and they put them up again and he take
them down and eventually there was a
massive brawl
between all these kind of church people
and they called the police and the
police came a whole lot of police came
but they said that they had no authority
inside the church so that all they could
do was sit outside the church while
everyone was having a massive scrapping
and eventually no one came out so they
just left but this guy did get arrested
and fined
five pounds wow
um yeah so nativity thefts modern day
nativity thefts
and anyone trying to tamper with it is a
big deal in america it's got to the
point where
churches have been fitting baby jesus
with gps tracking systems
because people come in and they steal
the baby jesus and they they wander off
and
a lot of people a find it upset that
baby jesus is missing
some of them are really expensive so
there was one church which is in florida
which had a life-size ceramic
jesus uh which was a thousand three
hundred five hundred
sorry a thousand three hundred and fifty
pounds um
done sorry pretty patel
um yeah so it was it was very expensive
and they
wandered off with it but it was a gps
tracking system which as soon as there's
movement in jesus
it sets off and it starts going and so
you can silently follow without the
people knowing that there's the gps in
there right
and he was found face down on a carpet
of a woman so they
they find her sorry repeat that sentence
but better
face down in the carpets of a woman yeah
so he was found
in a nearby house leg face down on a
carpet
not dead he's ceramic it's just
something about saying in the carpet of
a woman which sounded
absolutely foul oh good are you sexy for
a cracker joke
i think it's been banned yeah you know
benedict cumberbatch's first role was in
a school nativity play like a lot of
people yeah
apparently pushed mary off stage because
she was talking too long
wow he still does that it's really
awkward
the outtakes for sherlock are insane
i'm the first nativity ever i don't
think we've mentioned but it was made by
a
friend of the podcast and francis of
assisi oh he's going to guess who
yeah oh sorry friend of the podcast who
could it be oh i want to know who you
would have guessed now
everard digby everett digby yeah so sad
he's william hazlett i would have gone
for william hazlitt
yeah julian reed love cracker face
and he's imaginary whenever people say
what's your ideal dinner party i would
always say
definitely william hazlett everett digby
and julian
of crack of fame just to keep the
conversation spicy he can lob another
one in
any time if anyone laughs julian bans it
no it was saint francis right at the
front of the podcast and he set up the
first century
in a little italian town in 1223 and he
made this
manger and he got a doll that he cradled
as he gave mass
and apparently the doll so this is
what's meant to happen in activities the
doll
arose from its eternal sleep as dolls
are usually in
and cried real tears of joy uh which
obviously didn't happen and then
i mean that sounds like pinocchio yeah
dolls aren't in an eternal sleep they're
just not alive
well don't ruin i mean there might be
kids watching it's not what you tell
yourself
i think that's spoilering all of
religion which is that's a different
kettle of fish i think that's too big
all right doll woke up imagine if you're
a doll and you wake up and you're face
down in a woman's carpet that would be
surprising
well i think this is probably quite
dramatic for the dollar as well swat
team with a tracker making their way
into the room
there he is secure the asset and you've
got a messiah complex
very weird sorry you were saying i was
saying same francis
yeah look i was i was mostly done but it
is the case i think it's more true that
apparently
francis himself was so moved by the mass
that he himself was giving
that as he spoke the word bethlehem
during it his voice sounded like the
bleating of a lamb
which i didn't know that was what
happened when you're very moved by
something
[Music]
yeah you're getting powerful very weird
thing to record
weird like weird detail to record about
his diary did he say
i was so good in the mass today that i
sounded like a sheep
i don't know i think his mate wrote the
diary i do actually have a nativity
sheep
fact nativity sheep and dolls
actually so it really works it's a story
from 2018 the sourcing is impeccable
metro but it is amazon has pulled a
sheep sex doll from its website after a
mum accidentally bought it for her son's
nativity play
[Laughter]
it was so okay i don't really know much
about
sheep sex dolls but i reckon you could
get away with it couldn't you well i
know
so it's a joke gag gift right it's for
it's
it's called it was called a stag night
bonkin sheep
and it has a how did she not realize
when she was audrey there
i think it was record i think it was
sort of those customers also bought
things i
bought a joseph outfit
so anyway she said she sent her son to
school with the doll blown up
um but it had a really big hole at the
back end and it was
you know anyway i'm surprised the
teachers knew what it was really
but they refused to use it they sent the
boy home and
um she the woman added they sent the boy
home
kept the sheep just that's so that's
harsh because they can't have said
if this is a young it's like it was a
young boy a seven-year-old boy
and you send them home because they've
done something wrong you can't say the
reason i'm sending you home
is because this inflatable sheep is
normally had sex
with by people can you what that kid
doesn't know what's happening
no i know well she she added her son had
become really attached to it and really
liked it she said
she said no for heaven's sake no she
said he's probably in his room right now
stuffing lego in the hole
wow
i'm so sorry
wow we do this
um do you know who is very pro christian
christmas the the merry christmas
christians the pope
yeah um the old correct i should have i
should have closed
the field a bit there are you reading
this from your cracker trivia
uh someone you wouldn't expect richard
dawkins okay
richard dawkins very pro-christmas we
found this out in an article that he
wrote was a letter actually in the new
statesman that was published
written as an open letter to david
cameron in which he wishes him merry
christmas
adding that he would not accept
substitutes to that no happy holidays no
nothing
he said all that happy holiday season
stuff with holiday cards and holiday
presents is a tiresome import from the
united states
where it has long been fostered more by
rival religions than atheists
as a cultural anglican so he he kind of
puts himself as that he says i recoil
from such secular carols as white
christmas rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
and the low-sum jingle bells
but i am happy to sing real carols and
in the unlikely event that anyone wants
me to read a lesson i'll gladly oblige
only from the king james version of
course jesus christ
what was david cameron like didn't even
invite you mate
no he's not on anyone's dinner party
list dawkins or cameron dawkins
i'd be fun him and him and julian dan
did you listen to the quote that you
just read
he's pro he's pro classic i know i'm no
i'm modern what am i talking about
yeah i love rudolph oh yeah so you know
people are always saying are they that
christmas
you know it's it's not quite as
religious as it should be
um there's someone who said this
festival teaches even the little
children
artless and simple to be greedy the
tender minds of the young begin to be
impressed
with that which is commercial and sordid
and that was written by cappadocian
bishop asterius of amasaya in 400 a.d
wow amazing what was it saint augustine
as well as a
bit later than that but not much he was
saying that
stop giving people gifts you need to
give people arms instead you know
you need to give to charity stop giving
gifts so that was right at the start
because at the start they didn't really
celebrate christmas christians because
um
like in early christianity you wouldn't
celebrate birthdays because it was kind
of a pagan thing
and so to celebrate jesus's birthday was
just ridiculous
um so it was quite late when they did it
and even then they were already saying
this is too commercial
what i mean were there any shops but
it's like what is it
trying to envisage 400 a.d shops though
sort of what you would give someone
that wasn't wrapping there will have
been like baguette shops wouldn't there
be
of course have always been exclusive
baguette shops
um we've got to move on to our next fact
guys can i give you another just a quick
just it's people who don't like
christmas
that's what this is about so yougov does
a lot of surveying of people and
they ask all sorts of christmasy
questions so there was a survey recently
and they sort of matched people who
don't like christmas with all the other
attributes that they know about all the
people
on their database so people who don't
like christmas
are more likely to say there's no point
in getting married over half of
marriages end in divorce anyway
they're more likely to say i think the
olympics is more financial trouble to a
city than it's worth
and they're also more likely to say i
don't understand what many emojis mean
they only interview richard dawkins
[Laughter]
uh okay it is time for fact number three
and that
is andy my fact is that when asked this
year
21 of people said they didn't want
christmas carol singers visiting their
home because of coronavirus
another 55 said they didn't want carol
singers
regardless of coronavirus
[Laughter]
people just maybe those 21 were slightly
using the
cover as an excuse but it seems that
people just don't want
carol singers no they hate them i i mean
i really i like the sound of
would you guys say you didn't want i i
would say i do once yeah
you do i would say that this year i
haven't really opened my door to anyone
other than an amazon delivery guy
so probably if he was singing at the
same time if he would
keep the dog closed yeah i've actually
become quite good friends with that my
amazing delivery guy now
the blow up sheet mr hart
um yeah only 13 percent of people
surveyed actively wanted
carolers the math doesn't quite add up
but 11 women
don't know camp a bit indecisive wow
there is a bit of a weird thing of
if you're the only audience standing
there at your front door
it is awkward oh come on you've done
edinburgh shows like that
i mean we're literally doing a show with
no one
what i wouldn't give for one audience
member right now
[Laughter]
there is a thing where people don't like
them and there was kind of uproar in
2009
there was this thing it was in a place
just opposite preston
where neighborhood watch distributed
these cards they put them through
people's letter boxes and they gave them
out in cafes and
pubs and stuff and there were cards you
can put in your window saying carol
singers were not welcome
at that house actually if there was one
person that
stayed called carol singer it would feel
awful
she lives with the bill stickers i
believe
[Laughter]
i actually was looking up carol singers
in um the newspaper archive british
newspaper archive and the only one i
could find was a carol singer who was
brutally murdered about 100 years ago
which really ruined my search terms well
to be fair the word there are two
separate editions
if you do search the newspaper archive
for carol singer shot
there were twice that that did happen in
history 30 years apart one was in 1916
in newcastle
uh there was a guy called john nixon who
shot someone who was carol singing
outside his house
apparently they were kind of friends and
they might have been
i think he might have owned a paw boyed
on up somewhere near a pub and they'd
been
drinking earlier that day and then they
decided to carol sing and then he
decided to shoot them wait
were they singing together no he wasn't
they were singing at his property
got it okay uh and then another one in
1886
there was um the rising sun in clapham
was a pub
and again the landlord shot someone
because they were carol singing so
it's a very dangerous dangerous thing if
you're in the
turn of the 19th 20th century
wow it's weird how the hatred goes back
a long way
and so if you look them up in 1906 the
leading article across the papers there
was this big thing about whether
counseling was very annoying and they
should be banned altogether
and there was a piece written like a
leader piece in like the
i think the bex hill on c newspaper or
something saying
we love carol singers this is really
unfair and it published the letters it
got in response and they were furious so
it got all these letters in response to
it publishing this thing saying look
carol's things are harmless surely
one of them said i don't think the
writer kind of experienced firsthand the
bands of carol singers
so called that have visited this town
the past few christmases
um another and this is 1906 said most of
us who have experienced it would be
inclined to call it not carol singing
but
carol howling or carol murdering wow
that was only 20 years after there had
been a carol murder so it's pretty
insensitive yeah
it really in 1887 and the essex newsmen
someone said the singer's antics were
little better than rowdy burlesque
drunken or half drunken orgies
i mean that sounds quite good actually
something to open your door to
you're expecting silence singing well
shepherds watch while you twirl your
little
so it seems to be a thing of christmas
music is a lot another thing people
really don't like when it's too early
so another survey do you enjoy hearing
christmas music a month before christmas
so november 25th are you up for it four
percent said yes
i'm up for it the other 96 were not up
for it or maybe they would don't know as
i know
but five percent of people surveyed
didn't want to hear christmas music
until the 24th of december
5 surveyed more than we're happy to hear
it in the end of november
right nothing until the day before do
you remember when you guys were in
australia
with me for the tour for fish and we
went to my parents house
and it was i think may or something like
that yeah the only thing my dad played
was christmas music
is that in the light yeah do you not
remember i remember the day but i don't
remember the music today it was a lovely
day it was a lovely day and it was
probably made better because of the
christmas carols but
it for some reason the only playlist
that was coming up you know what i've
remembered why they did that well i've
remembered why we were at your parents
house it was my birthday and we went
there as a special birthday treat to
celebrate so they must equate me with
the messiah
the ceramic one or before you were face
down in a car
quite early on
they they had a reputation of being
brought to you though they were banned
by the church multiple times
and medieval christmases were generally
really like
raucous and it was the 12 days were um
basically
all one big pagan drunken mess and
a lot of the caramels like holly in the
ivy was actually a pagan fertility dance
they think or related to it so it would
be accompanied by dance moves
and i've read things that say maybe the
holly and the ivy equate with
male and female genitals and and if you
read the lyrics with that in mind things
like the big thorn that's mentioned in
about verse three
uh do suddenly sound quite raunchy and
you can imagine the congregation dancing
in a bit of a sort of beyonce way that
maybe
a 10th century priest might object to
yeah
wow i think that's why they do carol
singing rounds of houses right because
it was banned from churches and they can
kind of see if they're all doing sexy
dances
[Laughter]
there's a great one in sri lanka in 2016
the church accidentally printed the
wrong lyrics
for hail mary they accidentally printed
tupac's
version of hail mary and so they all had
the lyrics
and it is one of those things where when
you when you read the lyrics i've got
them here there's a few bits where it
like it says this blows like a 12 gauge
shorty or shotty rather so a gun but 12
days kind of immediately you're thinking
okay yes it's christmasy this sounds
christmassy okay
feel me and god said he should send his
one begotten son i mean he's yeah
feel me like you feel jesus yeah yeah
exactly holy spirit
legit so i imagine they got in quite a
few verses into this before realizing
tupac was behind the lyrics as opposed
to yeah
you know the song silent knight i'm sure
you do um
written by two people the lyrics written
by a guy called joseph moore
who was a priest in salzburg and the
music was run by an organist called
franz gruber
uh who is from a village called arndorf
and became
very popular of course they both died as
people do
uh and in 1912 spoiler alert
too soon i'm talking about it because
that was just another one for the
funeral directors
in 1912 the austrian taurus office
decided that they wanted
a memorial for these two writers
and there were loads of paintings of
this guy called gruber but there were no
paintings of more because he hated
having his painting done
and so to get this to get this sculpture
they dig up his grave and take out his
skull
so that they can make a sculpture of him
and the sculpture is still there
and they reinterred the skull in the
chapel where the sculpture is
but that's going a long way isn't it
it's interpreting the word sculpture
as that's insane i know
did they do a sculpture of them the
skull or did they put flesh over it
i think they must have got the skull and
gum well he's got a you know he's got
good cheekbones imagine not liking
having your portrait done in life and
then imagine if he could have known that
after his death people would dig up his
body
to do the thing he didn't want done even
when he'd been alive
he probably would have acquiesced to one
in his lifetime if he knew that was
gonna
is such a good name because it's almost
exactly the villain of dairy i know
that's why when it went because i've
never seen die hard but i do know about
that
and when i saw this guy was called franz
gruber i genuinely thought it was him
and i was like this is the best place
i've ever heard
silent night was written by hans gruber
yeah he wrote it at the nakatomi plaza
building he the guy who wrote silent
night apparently did it because the
organ was broken and he needed
an emergency to come up with the tune in
time for christmas
and i think it was he was near salzburg
and
so he was a vicar wasn't he or a priest
and he went to this church he was
working this church
and the organ was quite quite crap
didn't work and so he was very good at
the guitar and so instead it was
supposed to be accompanied by the guitar
in its early days
and then it became more acapella but it
was so popular within 30 years
there was a version along the labrador
coast where it was translated into
inuktitut as in like the inuit language
within 30 years oh my god
and you know why they went to the organ
so they were playing it on the guitar
but the guitar was banned from churches
it wasn't seen as a church instrument so
you could only allow to play certain
instruments in church
he wrote it on the guitar they wouldn't
let him play it so he played it outside
and then that's why he had to get the
organist in
you know there's carol i didn't know the
carols used to be for all occasions much
like crackers
they were just themed differently so
there were easter carols there were new
year carols was the one for the
anglo-egyptian war of
18 whatever it was okay there wasn't but
there was a battle of agincourt
carol there was a a carol that was
written after the battle of agincourt
in 1450 oh so not for it no one was
running out of trouble with their guitar
though sadly i think they waited until
the result was in before they
commemorated in
song because otherwise that's cocky um
in the second world war carol singers
kept going but they were a bit
restricted
and so to be safe during the blackout in
britain in world of two in london
specifically
they weren't allowed to carry lanterns
around with them or any kind of light so
they couldn't actually read their hymn
sheets at all and you couldn't see them
uh obviously
when you opened the door and they also
were issued with a government warning
that they mustn't
warble like air raid sirens
and that's some bad singing if you can't
tell the difference between the carroll
cigarette and air raid silence
people flocking to the underground every
time i'm out there
it's okay i'm the door i suppose that
bit that goes
that does sound like it yeah and we've
got to move on in a sec guys oh
our final fact i'll tell you what while
i was um searching for
carol singer shot uh on the newspaper
archives i came across
an article in the sun from thursday the
5th of january 1871
and they had a christmas cracker joke do
you want to hear it yes yeah
as we did that before um what ancient
author
is supposed to have written a tree ties
on plum pudding
uh i think i've got it have you is it
sewertonia it's
suet that onions that is in the sun
in 1871 it's changed doesn't it
and just for for anyone that's watching
who doesn't get that
can we explain what that means
i don't think so let's see it is a type
of pastry that's made out of
animal innards yeah uh and suetonius
classical writer yeah you're welcome
yeah
[Laughter]
in the same article by the way it said
the noticeable feature of liverpool
police sheets on monday
was the fact that only 66 persons had
been booked for being drunk and disarray

[Music]
okay should we move on to our final
facts all right it is time for our final
fact of the show
and that is james okay my fact this week
is that jim carrey's makeup for the
grinch
was so onerous to apply the studio
brought in one of the cia's experts at
enduring torture
to help him get through it so yeah this
is
about jim carrey and the making of the
grinch and
he had so much makeup on he said it was
like being buried alive
the main guy who was in charge of it was
ron howard uh the director
and he had a partner who's a producer
called brian grazer
and brian grazer had a friend who was
from the cia and he was
specialized in kind of helping people
get through torture
and he spent the weekend with jim carrey
saying this is the way
that you have to sit through hours and
hours and hours it's eight and a half
hours that he had to sit there
having this makeup put on that's a lot
he got taught how to do it
and kerry said at first that he thought
it was quite hilarious but in the end
you know it did the job and and they
made the film because he said that he
wasn't going to do the film you know he
said this is too much
yeah he said he had to sort of become a
zen master
he had to train himself to just be at
peace
the guy the cia guy had to teach him a
lot of things one of the main things was
distraction
he was saying and there's a clip of jim
carrey talking about this on the graham
norton show where he really goes into it
where he says
you just have to punch yourself at times
just at random just go ah
and hit yourself in the leg um suddenly
just get up to check something
do something very different um he did a
lot of smoking while he was doing it
this is not describing the zen monk that
i have in
my mind
but the stress of it with the smoking
was just to get through the stress but
the problem was is that he was wearing
this really thick grinch suit which was
made of yak hair
and so he had to have a really long
extended pipe so he was sitting there
sort of going it's so that's so doctor
yeah yeah but then of course the movie
did go on to win the oscar for best
makeup so it was all worth it in the end
is it
would he have been happy about the best
makeup oscar because it feels like it's
a bit of a slap in the face literally
they're saying all the stuff
around your body is getting an award and
you are not
yeah but i i'll be honest i don't think
that his um performance in the grinch
probably was going to win best actor
yeah i started i started watching it as
research for this fact did you
and i can say that i've seen the first
six minutes of the film
would you describe the makeup as a
deserving of a best actor incredible
makeup is incredible yeah yeah
regardless of the movie the guy so the
guy who did it
he's called kazuhiro tsuji and he's an
amazing sort of legend of the makeup
world
and he said that yeah kerry was a bit of
a nightmare to work with
and that um i mean it sounds horrible
being under all this makeup
it sounds really really restrictive but
kerry
apparently sometimes said you're
painting me a different color to the
color you painted me yesterday
and suji obviously wanted to say why
would i do that
why on this big budget hollywood film
but i paid you a different color
imagine if you started watching it i
think you're just like wait a minute i
just went from green to used to be great
yeah
and kerry kept saying you've got to fix
it you've got to fix this and he said in
an interview
so i fixed it i kept painting at the
same color
you know claimed it was different yeah i
fittingly actually
i think he only took that job in
exchange for a green
card so if anyone knew about the color
green it was this guy that's brilliant
really really yeah it's not quite that
actually it's it's no no
that's absolutely true it's not why he
took the job he took the job because
he was offered it and he thought this
would be great he was doing the job
but the stress that jim carrey put him
under during this job
was so intense that he had to quit and
he actually had to get a bit of therapy
because jim carrey was kicking his foot
through
this is before he was zen monk-like and
had a cia guy coming i think
he really the guy this this makeup
artist says he was a real dick on the
set he was
he was rude to everyone he was and jim
carrey goes very method it's hard to
know if he thought he was the grinch and
he was embodying that character
yeah what an excuse come on well
there's a very famous documentary which
i'll mention in a second but
just to finish that he basically sent
this guy off the movie because he was
so traumatized by jim carrey how he
spoke to him and everyone else
so he was off for a couple of weeks and
jim carrey called him up himself and so
did ron howard and said
please come back i've worked on my
temper i'm zen-like now
please come back and do it and he said
okay i will and his friend said to him
why don't you do it for more money
he said i don't want to ask for more
money but then he went okay i'll tell
you what though
i'll do it for a green card and that's
how yeah
so you can work in america yes yeah
although i think they didn't even give
him the green card until he got the
bafta
it was a hard one thing the bafta or the
oscar no it's bafta weirdly but it was
the bathroom but it was quite a big deal
for once the baptism in america
then in that one year um so he got up
after the makeup and then they gave him
a green card
but that was a high bar to have to have
to pass yeah stressful
so the um the movie you're talking about
where he goes method is
called jim and andy isn't it well the
movie was man on the moon
where he plays andy kaufman but yeah
there was a documentary they did a
documentary where he was like that but
he got the job while he was working on
malin the moon didn't he
yeah and audrey geisel who was um dr
seuss's wife
went to visit him while he was doing
that movie and to try to decide if he
was gonna
if he was gonna get the job now he was
doing this movie pretending to be andy
kaufman and was so method
that he wouldn't respond to jim carrey
he would only respond to andy kaufman
and he would just pretend to be him
completely basically for the whole
making this movie he was andy kaufman
and so when audrey geisel came to
interview him and said do you want to do
the grinch
the only way she could find out what he
would be like was if
andy kaufman did an impression of jim
carrey who was doing an
impression of being the grinch yes wow
yeah there's a dog in the grinch oh yeah
the grinch has a dog um but and it looks
pretty normal
certainly in the first six minutes there
are some interactions between the grinch
and his dog
and i found out later the dog is voiced
by a human they didn't use
the dogs that's disgusting it's putting
dogs out of business
humans yeah it's a guy called frank
welker oh
frank welker yeah oh okay does he do a
lot of dogs frank welker's probably got
more
hollywood box office hits behind him
than any actor alive
huge claim huge well i mean so this is
the thing he does have foreign playing
dogs because he also
played scooby-doo oh there you go yeah
so maybe
it's his thing can i go to frank
welker's at imdb he's the most
successful actor
on earth i can't believe this because
surely we would have heard of him more
because he does voices it's like andy
circus before we found out his name and
he was golem and king kong and yeah
yeah well this is a bit like the
original grinch right um
thor ravenscroft was the voice of the
grinch
and he was tony the tiger and lots of
other people but people didn't know that
because sorry he sung the grinch's songs
but boris karloff was the grinch's
normal voice
so cool which well that what cool that
he was
frankenstein yeah the mummy it is very
cool but then he got all the credit
so it was reported as him being the
grinch whereas actually the main song
was sung by tony the tiger
and it was great um can i give you
another
joke from our crackers earlier on oh
yeah you were saving one yeah it's this
one
um what is the name of the grinch's dog
is it a
ben b max c sam or d
buddy i say on your notes i literally
watch the film and i have a note about
the dog
and dad is the one who knows i'm so
upset what is it i'm going for max
oh uh i'll say i mean dan knows the
answer
but i mean go for something else if you
want i'll say buddy i'll spin it all but
put everything on buddy it's max
um the grinch wasn't green originally he
was black and white with pink eyes
yeah i'm not sure if that's with pink
eyes with pink eye the medical condition
i doubt it but that wasn't what it was
about certainly no certainly not
that was steve but do you know what
color green he is what shade of green
is there a particular grinch green that
dr seuss demanded
kind of it's ugly car and
that's not a specific green obviously
but the
director of that film chuck jones was
inspired to use that color green because
he had this ugly car
that he rented that was this horrible
shade of green
and he went actually that would look
amazing on my grinch
and he picked that exact color and put
it on the ground actually speaking of
grinch-related cars
audrey geisel who we're talking about
who sadly she died a couple of years ago
but um at the age of 97
and she ran all of the dr seuss estate
for quite a long time
she had a cadillac that she would drive
around with with a number plate that
read grinch
wow that's so cool is that grinch
post his sort of reformation of
character or pre
is what i'd want to know i think no i
think deep down the grinch
is a good guy who is misunderstood
at the start right because there were
two kids two little boys called bob and
david grinch from new jersey
they wrote a letter to dr seuss saying
everyone makes fun of them all the time
because they're called the grinch
brothers and he wrote back to them
saying no the grinch is a hero
a changed man tell the other kids it's
not where you start it's where you end
up
that's a hard message when your head is
being flushed down the toilet
to articulate
[Laughter]
um i looked into some makeup a little
bit of
movie makeup stuff yeah and so
traumatizing makeup experiences in films
and i think the prize goes to um the
person who played the tin man in wizard
of oz originally
who was buddy ebsen that so the tim
around the wizard of oz was
extremely intense it's one of those took
five hours to put the makeup on
every morning and then five hours to
take it off again and you don't know
when they even got the acting in
and eventually he got really ill from
all these aluminium powder fumes he was
in
ingesting and inhaling and he woke up in
the middle of the night screaming and he
had violent cramping all over his body
and he was rushed to hospital
he was in this oxygen tent for weeks and
he didn't have a heart
the thing is andy spoiler alert he did
have a heart
all along did he i think wait was that
it
oh god it's been a 10 minutes does he i
don't
know they don't tear out someone's heart
do they in the film it's been a while
since i've seen it but i'd be really
surprised if it ended with
that i think the lesson is he doesn't
need a heart i think does he get like a
medal of a heart or is that the courage
for the lion thousands of people in the
comments are screaming
right now sorry
well he said he didn't need a heart but
he did need the use of his lungs which
didn't have for a while
and his skin turned blue and the studio
just wouldn't believe it so the studio
were like no this is rubbish you're just
malingering come back in and they
actually sent someone to the hospital i
think
or to his home when he was just emerging
from this coma to say you've got to come
back and do the acting
and a nurse said no no he really is in a
bad way
and so they replaced him and not only
did they replace him with this guy jack
haley who played the tin man but they
never told jack hayley why
the last
that's incredible um i've got a makeup
fact about
um the grinch oh great mr grinch makeup
uh kazuhiro tsuji so he's done a few
things like he did men in black you know
when the guy is a
sort of a cockroach turned human and
he's kind of twitchy under the skin
terrifying
he designed the silicon the live
twitching
silicon and it was um i think silicon
gel so it's kind of implant gel on
people's face so he did that
he did benjamin button he's done all
sorts of stuff but he also he came out
of retirement um
to do churchill because gary oldman was
playing churchill
a few years ago in a film called darkest
hour and so
he did a wig for gary oldman which
has a very specific thing because
churchill was about
mid-60s in the war i think and can you
guess what he used for churchill's very
fine hair for that phase of his life
um well it wasn't his own pubes or
anything oh his
own pubes no of course it wasn't his own
pubes
picture treadmill in your mind's eye
what is his hair like
oh my gosh it was it's so much less good
than that answer but it was it was
baby's hair
right to mimic elderly hair so he was
asked about it he said baby's hair is
the most expensive you can buy in the
world because it's very fine and very
thin
and he he was quoted no one is killed
alarming way to start talking about this
that just feels like it's protesting way
too way too
much no one is killed no one over the
age of two is killed
um a baby grows hair and sometimes they
decide to cut it
um but it's so fun and it's for the hair
light it's for the hairline because your
often your hair at your hairline is
finer wow and but it was so fragile he
had to make a new wig
every 10 days because how many children
did he have to shave
[Laughter]
um we've got we've got to wrap up soon
guys we've actually gone we've gone way
further than we have
ever should have in a live stream so
mark just
more christmas movie stuff really
quickly um the imdb
top hundred christmas movies by rating
um it's a wonderful life
how the grinch stole christmas which i
thought was gonna be the one that we
were talking about is actually the 1966
one that anna was talking about
charlie brown's christmas and then die
hard which is the controversial one
right because
some people think it's christmas some
people think it isn't yeah but the
villain did write silent night so
i think that's probably okay that's why
it is is that why
so i read um an article a scientific
article by
us a dieca called every stain a story
the many dirty undershirts of john
mcclane in die hard
he says this article explores the 34
undershirts
worn by bruce willis and his stunt men
in the 1988 action film die hard
okay and they go through all of these
things and
they tell you exactly what they mean and
all that kind of stuff so
the dirty undershirt according to us a
dieca
is a symbol for injustice and class in
other films such as a streetcar named
desire and rocky and rambo
it's further tied to male sexuality and
violence in films such as bonnie and
clyde
cruising and white house down and they
said that all these different
shirts they were all stained in a
slightly different way
so that you could know which ones to
wear at all the different parts of the
movie had some that are really
unstained and some that aren't and they
were all numbered on a rail
and he would like oh i'm going to have
number 12 today right
and all the stains were specific to
things that had happened
and according to the article it was a
planned design process
in which no stain was accidental
that is really cool and that wasn't
written by a crazed journalist that was
written by someone that that's the
like the act is written by an academic
yeah so for instance one of the shirts
is in the smithsonian now so
it kind of looks like he starts off with
a nice clean vest and by the end he's
absolutely mullet and you know
but i didn't you'd never consider that i
assumed there was one shirt how wrong
was i
really wrong
okay that is it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening
if you would like to get in contact with
any of us about the things that we've
said over the course's podcast

[Music]

=354
hi everyone welcome back to the end of
2020 oh my days we made it
it's the end of the year and the start
of what hopefully will be an amazing
2021
for all of you guys um what have we got
for you
well we have our annual clip show it's
massive it's one and a half hours
of all the bits that didn't quite fit in
the edits of this year's no such thing
as a fish
i really hope you like it these are
always my favorite episode because they
go from one thing to another to another
you never know what you're gonna get but
you do know that there'll always be
something interesting
or something a bit silly okay well what
else is it to say i suppose uh our book
fund you should ask is still available
in all shops if you got
book tokens do people still get bug
tokens
well anyway it's it's in the shops funny
you should ask
by the qy elves and also next year we
hope will be a big year of touring for
us as soon as the venue's open we will
be back out there
to do our thing meet all you guys so
keep an eye on no such things at
fish.com for any details about that
and i believe there is one show that is
currently on sale
that will be in london in the spring so
get tickets for that
get our book enjoy the show and we'll
see you on the other side
happy new year i'm with a podcast
[Music]
hey guys i've got a quick quiz question
if the date
is wednesday the 31st of december
are you in the last week of the year uh
yes
yes yes that is incorrect you're in the
first week of the year
so i'm afraid you all have to leave what
could you not be in both
no of course you can't be in both what
do you mean it's wednesday the 31st of
december you're in the last no but the
week's different isn't it because it's
it's more heavy set on the other side of
the week in days
if it was on a scale it would way over
to the
the new year week wouldn't it dan's
describing better
what the international organization for
standardization
describes in terms of how to refer to
weeks so you know across the world we
have to have the same
definition of week one week two week
three of a year
i gotta say i'm without the on this one
look
the w wakes up to start on a monday and
we've got to have the same week so that
trading and business internationally
globally works
so there's an international body that
decides what week one is and the
definition of week one of the year is
the week with the year's first
thursday in it so if the first of
january is a thursday then week one
actually starts on the 29th of december
which is that monday
right so week one is that so if the 31st
of december is on a wednesday
then you're actually in week one of the
next year because that's insane
you can't have week one beginning two
days before the year ends i'm sorry it's
absolutely matt no one does things in
weeks anyway you do things in quarters
or when it happens like that anna always
has her new year's party on sunday the
28th
of december it's an absolutely banging
event
with me me and my cat in attendance i'm
sorry you guys have never been able to
make it
uh just very quickly what number
archbishop of paris
do you reckon andre antoine is
is obviously the current 20th 23rd 22nd
as far as i can tell he's the thirtieth
so that's his actual name andre
and he yeah he was born with the surname
23
and the the best guess is that it was
because
and uh sort of ancestor of his was found
and adopted and they were found on the
23rd of the month and so they were given
that surname yeah so but as far as i can
tell he's the 30th there's
there's a lot of breaks in their
archbishops over the years so there
might be a few that are not in there
hey what's archbishop van pois
favorite band i don't know andy what is
archbishop antoi's favorite band rifle
65.
and it's because they have a french name
and then a number
oh really well i thought no no i
i do understand that yeah and he's
french uh and he has a number in his
name
because you know what their favorite
punk band is
tonight it's blink 182 and that's
because french people
blink like the rest of us and there's a
there's a number following that
i really think we should move this on i
i've got to get out of here what is
favorite album by adele
there's a few options there 21 because
he's called 23 and it's just another
number yeah
yes but interesting you propose it to
the original 19.
it's closer closer to him yeah
are all the fidel's albums numbered yeah
oh mate yes yeah 19 that's the age
she was when actually it's actually not
the ages anymore they've become
untethered from her age but yeah got it
i thought i was thinking she can't have
released 23 albums
okay
um there's an indian loser uh
called shiva keshevan and he has been
a true victim of the indian government's
low prioritizing of
various olympic sports he is
think about the himalayas think about
the territory you've got for looting
i was just thinking that sean connery
would be a good luge
manager like coach because he'd be like
you're a loser
you're a loser and
all the shs sean connery's both got
shiva keshevan
um but so he had to train on
wheels uh not in a proper luge thing
because that's normally on ice isn't it
he had to make a cut sled basically with
wheels on and just train on busy roads
oh wow just going downhill in the
himalayas and he had there's footage of
him dodging a herd of goats which is in
the middle of the road
and he has to sort of frantically lose
around you know um
old macdonald had a farm very well did
you know
yeah e-i-e-i-o well
the earliest version we have was
actually old mcdougall had a farm
e-i-e-i-o and there's an even earlier
version which is not about um
a farm but it's old missouri had a mule
he hi hi ho and
every country around the world has its
own version of um
old macdonald and they're all on
wikipedia of course
so um in turkish it's alibaba has a farm
e-i-e-i-o in swedish it's per olsen has
a farm
e-i-e-i-o uh and in serbian
it's sparco utrow yet no yay
organized which means
one egg a day gives the strength to
human organism
wow they've just gone completely random
i don't understand that at all
every other country in the world it's
about someone having a farm
and they're just like don't eat your
eggs when planes are actually just
coming into
land as a normal procedure the way it
works is that they have to get ready
miles before
they even see where the airport is
they've got to get to a certain height
and then there's a couple of things that
they have to either see they've got to
either have eyes on the runway
or the lights that they can see coming
from it to know that they're at the
right height
and it's actually the computer on board
the airline
that makes them make a snap decision
about whether or not they're
able to land or if they're at the wrong
bit so as they're getting ready to that
moment the computer
will just yell out in the cockpit decide
that's all they get she goes decide
and then they go yes we're doing it or
they have to pull out
a tv quiz show
and now it's time to decide
oh you would have won a speedboat but
you've died in a blink
[Laughter]
that is amazing do they get warning is
there a sort of
i'm gonna have to have to hurry you here
yeah your time's gonna yeah
i think i hope you've made up your mind
because in a minute you're gonna have to
decide and then if they go through it it
goes
interesting decisions
[Laughter]
um there is a problem with being in the
center of america
someone found out there's this massive
problem that was generated
for someone who lives quite near the
center of the u.s
in fact and this is to do with a company
called max mind have you read about this
story
about ip addresses okay so it's so weird
basically
max mind is this company who about just
over 10 years ago
started calculating the location of
loads of ip addresses so you know with
your computer you've got an ip address
max mine figured out whereabouts they
all were geographically and then it
could sell that information to companies
like google and facebook and lots of
other people
but often when you're trying to work out
where an ip address is you can't get it
exact
and sometimes it'll just say this is
somewhere in america or somewhere in the
u.s
and so for all of those max mine just
default
assumed that they were in the middle so
they got the coordinates of roughly the
middle of america
and said okay all the ip addresses that
we can't quite place
they just are here and it turns out here
is
a rural farmhouse belonging to someone
called joyce taylor
who now has 600 million ip addresses
and it's so it's a complete disaster
because basically if there's a troll
online or if there's someone who's
hacked your company
or if there's uh someone doing criminal
activity online and the police are
tracking them down
they chase up their ip address and they
constantly find it's at joyce taylor's
farmhouse
and she's just inundated with kind of
abuse and people writing her threatening
letters
and had no idea why for about eight
years she was just like why am i being
oh
are we definitely discounting the fact
that joyce is like a massive cyber
criminal
is that she's she's a criminal
mastermind
an 82 year old criminal mastermind it's
possible
that's funny oh poor choice choice
apparently that vern scholars refer
to the novel as around the world in 80
days and the play as around the world in
80 days
but with 80 the digits
so that's how you can tell the
difference i'll be honest i didn't get
that from when you were reading it out
i saw the facial flaw in transferring
this
visual thing in front of me to the audio
media we're really hoping you're going
to say around the world in 80 plays
was what it called the play he wasn't
that smart a guy you know
people claim he was you know you know
mitten crabs
is if you catch one is there always a
string attached to another bitter crowd
the cia they collected a load of jokes
in the soviet union
in the 80s that was one of the things
they did and that got declassified quite
recently
we're not quite sure why they did it but
it might have been a way to kind of
gauge what people were thinking in the
soviet union or maybe a way of
undermining the government or stuff
so they found stuff like and there are
two men waiting in the line to buy vodka
the first man says i've had enough save
my place
i'm going to shoot gorbachev two hours
later he returns to claim his place in
the line his friend said
did you get him and the man replies no
the line there was even longer than the
line here
that's a good joke it's not bad is there
a man goes into a shop
a man goes into a shop and says you
don't have any meat
do you um no replies to sales lady we
don't have any fish it's a store across
the street that doesn't have any meat
again that's good it works doesn't it i
think that's really good yeah were they
planning on distributing the big book of
cia jokes about your country
doesn't it my favorite person to have
sort of an olympic career
career and then a follow-up is a guy
called ross rebagliati
he was the first person ever to win gold
at the winter olympics in snowboarding
which was in 1998 and it was really sad
for him because he won gold and then
he was drugs tested and they found
cannabis in his system
and so he was immediately had his gold
rescinded he was put in jail
for maybe importing it into japan i
think which is where the olympics were
and then within about 72 hours they then
gave the gold medal back because they
went actually cannabis is not on our
list of banned substances
as it wasn't back then but he insisted
that it was from second-hand smoke
uh you know he hadn't smoked weed for
almost a year and
it was nothing to do with him he was
furious but he has now gone on to found
a company called legacy brands a cbd and
cannabis consumables company
and has a series of different strains of
weed named after him
so that's that's his job now
and [ __ ] wasn't stoned then but is
stoned all the time now yeah
i guess you can never guess what's going
to happen because the the uh
the 1984 olympics uh promotion by
mcdonald's
about uh you could get a free item off
the menu every time the us team got on
the podium
uh i don't know what you got big mac for
gold or something fries for some reason
um they didn't expect the soviet union
to drop out of the olympics so
the bloody american national anthem was
playing all the time
uh and uh there was i think there was
even a shortage of hamburger buns
uh people got so many so you've got to
be careful what you uh what you offer up
i think
yeah at any olympics saying that about
team usa
is not the right course oh you're right
you want to make a
team togo just be super cautious yeah i
think so yeah
the danish basketball team i think
you're going to be you're going to make
it
quite nice and specific jamaica winter
olympics i had one year where it looked
a bit dodgy
[Laughter]
burgers but otherwise you say one more
thing
um just that you can buy so i think you
were talking at the start about how
um audio stuff can also maybe trigger um
weird hallucinations or change your
brain makeup and actually
they have now invented headphones which
i think are either on the market now
they're coming onto the market soon
which send electrical impulses into your
brain and they
cause it to release more uh like
dopamine and serotonin oxytocin like
happiness hormones
essentially and they're called i think
they're called nirvana headphones
so they stimulate the vagus nerve in
your brain apparently which then
releases all those neurotransmitters and
they'll do it in time to the beat of the
music you're listening to
so you could even be listening to the
verve or something
but you'd be over the moon oh
unnecessary burn on the verge i love the
book but they're not upbeat
yeah but i've heard that they've tried
that but the drugs don't work so
hey there was wasn't there a big clash
in east berlin about uh updating the
traffic light
men because really that yeah the the
east
had particular traffic light men and
they were called ample mention
i think which is that literally means
exactly that the traffic light men
and one of the things that was proposed
is replacing all of them and people in
east berlin particularly said no we
really we really like
these particular traffic sites it's sort
of a something very recognizable very
iconic about this half of the city and
so
those i think were rolled out and in
fact this is not useful for anyone at
home but we have one in a jar just here
oh that's what this is about
right okay let's see it can we see it
okay
yeah yeah it's here so this is a little
tin of tea this
oh yeah it's that yeah yeah and you'll
recognize the stop and the ghost you
know what
the goldman looks a bit like an old
monopoly man kind of thing because that
doesn't
we've all seen lots of these right these
are these are in
berlin well it's a big souvenir thing in
berlin now yeah yeah but also
on the traffic lights is the noticeable
thing exactly where you see a traffic
light go and you're like i mean there
aren't souvenirs but
they're all they were well they were
kept that's the that's sort of the point
yeah yeah yeah they're really cool
they're much more jaunty
um i just not sure that show and tell is
ever going to work as a podcast but
it worked when you had your own toy so
maybe
the american dairy association has a
page on its website called famous cows
of the world
and it's a good read there are a whole
bunch of cows on there but my favorite
was elm farm ollie
do you guys know about elm farm molly
well neither did i but it was the first
cow to fly
and also the fir uh when i say fly i
should be clear
the first clown to ride in an airplane
a clown so it's a cloud as well as a cow
if the clown cow must have had massive
shoes
i had a red nose and huge shoes i've
lost it
it was the first cow to take a flight
and it was the first cow to be milked
mid-flight
this was in missouri in 1930 and it you
know all these things have some kind of
spurious scientific justification
and so the justification for this when
they paid huge amounts of money to take
it up was
they wanted to observe the mid-air and
high-altitude effect on animals in
flight of their milking and of their
milk
and it turns out it didn't make a
difference to the milk but
oh there was a farmer called bunts
elsworth bunts who milked her
who then also became the first person to
milk a cow mid-flight
so a huge sequence of firsts for elm
farm ollie
yeah it's good to be the one who's
milking elm farmers because
um if you if she asks you to smell her
flower it's always gonna be milk that
squirts out of it into your mouth
okay
do you want to try it better punch line
to that section yeah i'd like to see you
try it dan
the master is smoking possibly
told that has wonky shut down now yeah
yeah yeah has it what no it had new
management
a few years ago i've definitely had it
in the last year i can guarantee they
don't do that kind of rude service
anymore
they don't do the root service uh all
their trip advisor reviews went downhill
slightly after they stopped being rude
to the customers because that was part
of the experience
like three stars the guy was really nice
to me who gave me my meal
it was amazing i went there once and we
sat down on the table
it was me and three other people and
then halfway through the meal literally
halfway through the middleweight and we
need this table now you need to go
upstairs
and they took all of us and made them
sit on a much smaller table upstairs
while they
put other people on our table wow i had
a deal there with tom davis who is uh
people know him on tv as king gary and a
few other tv shows
and we went there and they put us on a
big round table where there was an
entire family sitting
and we had an old grandmother sitting in
between us we weren't even next to each
other
oh it was wonderful great days monkeys
anyway our podcast yeah back to the
[Laughter]
podcast
stop the podcast stop the podcast hi
everybody just wanted to let you know
that this week we
are sponsored by expressvpn that's right
so express
vpn is the app that re-routes your
internet connection through secure
servers so that your isp your internet
service
provider if you will cannot see the
sites
you visit that is right it's a very
useful tool to have
particularly if you want to make
yourself seem like you're
coming from tuvalu or that you are based
in tuvalu
for fun you know it's a fun thing to do
i've done it and it's funny to say and
do
it's very easy to switch on it runs
seamlessly in the background it's very
easy to use
you tap one button and you're protected
and your isp can't see the sites that
you're visiting that is
correct so if you are visiting lots of
very weird
sites as we often do sites that look at
sort of
moth genitals or strange
historic practices that you don't want
going into your preferences
then a vpn is what you need it does much
more than simply just going into
incognito mode for instance which
doesn't hide your activity
and express vpn is the best one to get
and
you can go to expressvpn.com fish to get
an extra
three months free on a one year package
to try it out
that's right just go to express
e-x-p-r-e-s-v-p-n
dot com slash fish and you will get
three months free on a one-year package
okay on with the show on with the show
[Music]
do you guys know about the devenish fibs
family no
no well they're in a extremely prominent
family
in a sense in that their names are all
over park benches
across the uk and so this
started to be spotted about 10 years ago
maybe a bit more and there are sort of
park benches with you know those plaques
on in memory of
and they're always in memory of someone
devinish fibs so for instance in
dartmouth park whenever i used to live
there's one that was in memory of winter
devinish fibs
and it said like to have everything just
so and then the plaque was at a lopsided
angle
and there was there was another one
somewhere which was
in memory of barbara devinish phibs
whose wish was to have a bench plaque
inscribed with her last words
unfortunately her last words were and
then it's a series of expletives
the uh asterisk asterisk clouds that's
really funny
currently scientists are trying to find
out uh who killed the dodo
with a ct scanner whoa there was more
than one dodo though
that's true but yes no that's true what
do you mean though so do you mean like
not a specific one or is it i do mean a
specific one there's a dodo in
oxford's museum of natural history and
uh it's it's a celebrity dodo actually
although
these days all the days are celebrities
but um this is the one that lewis
carroll may have seen
when he was writing alice in wonderland
and it might have inspired the dodo in
that
but scientists thought that it had been
killed
some some way or that it died of natural
causes actually they thought
they threw it on it threw it on a
bonfire or something i thought they
destroyed it
yeah well they still got the skull all
right that's the main thing
and so they they put the skull in a ct
scanner
and they found it didn't have natural
causes it was shot in the head with a
shotgun
so that is the opposite of natural
causes
and what they're trying to do now
they've got a little bit of the lead
that kind of impacted with the back of
the skull
and they're trying to find out what
country the lead from those shotgun
pellets was mined in
and then they're going to try and find
out where the shot was made
from that lead and they basically
they're on the longest cold case ever
where they're trying to find out 400
years later
who pulled the trigger well oh gosh
what are they going to do great great
great grandchildren
yeah exactly they're going to get a
knock on their door where are you
on the 4th of march 1596.
it's just i was just looking into the
quirks of iceland the country
um i didn't know this beer was banned
there until 1989.
really it was banned in 1915 they had a
referendum and they decided to ban beer
and then in 1921 they had to change it a
bit they legalized wine
because spain threatened to stop buying
iceland's fish
if iceland kept on refusing to import
spanish wines so it was okay fried
blossom wine
and then they they allowed very very
weak beer
but they didn't allow normal strength
beer
and this backfired badly because people
just started putting vodka into their
incredibly weak beer and making a kind
of horrible beer and vodka cocktail
oh some of that some of the spirits that
you get in iceland are unbelievable
i went to there's a restaurant that
specializes in slightly sort of
quirky food and i ordered the fermented
shark
and it comes in a jar sealed kilner jar
with a rubber thing
and a very very strong glass of well we
call it schnapps i don't know what you
call it it's a very strong um
pure alcohol thing uh and uh
i said to the guy i didn't order the
schnapps he said you're going to need
and do you because for the sake of the
other diners you have to open the jar
really really quickly
and grab a little spoonful of this stuff
just stick in your mouth and close it
because it
smells so terrible and the taste
was the most disgusting thing i've ever
had it burned the back of my throat
and i and i did take it take the
schnapps as a shot
i drank it so quickly anything to make
the taste of the
vintage shark go away i really thought
you were going to turn around and say
that the amazing thing is it smells
awful but the taste is
divided no it smells awful and also
tastes awful
um hey one bit of royal etiquette which
i think is um
upheld in the royal family as opposed to
being upheld by the tabloid press
is eating etiquette which is that
and it doesn't it makes sense so the
queen is so first you would serve the
queen first at a dinner
and then when she stops eating really
you're supposed to stop eating as well
and this has existed for a few hundred
years
and it was really difficult with queen
victoria because this was
the practice then as well but queen
victoria i think about her was
she was incredibly greedy she used to
eat extremely fast like her advisers
used to say stop eating so fast she got
terrible indigestion
she could eat seven courses in half an
hour apparently
and she was always done first and so the
people who were served last by the time
they got their plates they were sort of
immediately whipped away from them again
because queen victoria inhaled her first
course
i gotta say anna we've been for dinner
quite a lot of times
and you will not let a plate go if
there's any food left on it
no matter whose plate it was yeah is
this why you've never met the queen
because it's i did it once and i've been
banned from dining with the queen since
desperately trying to lick everyone's
plates as they were taken away
i had a quick look at some things that
you could get sent to prison for in
finland
oh yeah in 2015 the police
asked the members of the public that if
they saw
a pizza that was on sale for under six
euros to inform the police
the way that they saw it is it's
impossible to run a business
where you sell pizzas for less than six
euros it's just
the ingredients are too much it's
completely impossible so if people are
doing that it means that they can't be
paying the tax
on the pizza which means that they must
be tax
avoiders uh and so they asked literally
ask people to send as soon if you see
any
pizza on sale for underneath that price
send us the menu
and we'll arrest the guys that's so
funny that is a bugger price for a whole
pizza
yeah it is unless you're in the shop in
a shop it's a kind of normal price for a
shop pizza
that's a very very posh shop pizza
really isn't it
but i mean there are pizzas around the
corner that you can take away delicious
for a fiver and i'm not wondering if
it's my responsibility to be informing
on them
just tell the police in finland because
obviously the taxes in finland are
a bit higher than they are in the uk so
probably
it's more of a seven pound thing in the
uk you feel bad if you've got the whole
staff and structure of the co-op sent to
finnish prison
[Laughter]
what are you in for i'm also in for
selling this pizza
there's the pizza wing isn't there
the hardened criminals i went on ebay
to look at what the most expensive items
currently on ebay are that you can buy
that are related to lincoln did you find
the horse hair
yes that's so good so there's a lot
there's a lot of hair from uh the horse
you rode in the 1860 election called
old bob and um old bob attended his
funeral
and for just 1 250
you can buy a hair of this horse one
hair yeah
actually it's one hair a single hair
you wouldn't like if you open the
envelope that could just fall onto the
carpet and you've lost it
if you're a mafioso and you don't have
the resources to put a whole horse's
head on someone's pillow
i'm just thinking that you know as a
middle-aged man who's losing his hair
it shouldn't i shouldn't be letting it
go down the drain i should be saving
this in case i become president or like
the president's house or something in
the future i don't know
surely this is our next tour match
um i've got just one last thing about
sort of ingenious ways of catching
poachers people who are trying to
illegally catch all of these fish
um during the early 80s to about 1998
there was a guy who worked for the
california u.s fish and wildlife service
and his name was terry gross and he was
sort of sick of the fact that there were
poachers that would go in the early
morning
to catch all this salmon when that was
highly illegal so
you usually had to stop half an hour
after sunset and they would drive out at
two or three in the morning
and they would get away with it because
the tracks that were leading to all of
these lakes
were monitored by other poachers so if
they saw a truck come down
that they knew was one of the wardens
they would say quickly get the boat in
get out of there so they had plenty of
warning so he had no idea what to do but
then he came up with this idea
of putting on a wetsuit getting into the
water
before the day ended and waiting
patiently
and what he would do is while they were
fishing salmon he would loosen the glove
of his wetsuit
and as they were fishing it would hook
onto his glove
and he would slowly splash around and
they would start going oh my god i've
caught a massive salmon and he would go
harder and harder and like this is the
biggest salmon we've ever got
they've got this on recording these
words and they would slowly come in
and they would get to him and as they
got right up to him he would say
good morning gentlemen state fish and
game warden you're under arrest
he would pull out of his wetsuit a
citation book and he would give them
their and then he would go back in and
try and catch more people
and ira glass npr and this american life
um looked into it and they found that
there were plenty of these people that
used to do this
sit there for hours and get caught by
the fish
yeah wait but did they so did they have
their heads underwater while they were
waggling their glove above the water
no because it was so dark so they would
they would sort of
yeah sit above and yeah but just in a
nice little spot
it's brilliant this guy's an amazing guy
that's real commitment to the job
i don't know if i'd sit in freezing cold
water for a full day in a pond
just to catch a poacher i had a
neighbour once an elderly neighbour
who would sleep in his car to try and
catch car thieves
[Laughter]
and he and he caught them actually
waggling keys out of the window as soon
as
i someone grabs thinking that this guy
who's pretending to be a fish basically
he's lucky that they're not
catching them with dynamite isn't he
yeah
well actually
in the example in this interview they
heard somebody going get the net get the
net and then another voice goes get the
net
heck get the gun
so one more thing about uh olympians who
have other jobs you know the brian
brothers
the the tennis the tennis guys the
tennis brothers yeah we absolutely love
the brian brothers
uh so sort of best doubles partnership
of all time they've won
a billion olympic medals and they have a
second
i don't know if i can call it jobs i
don't know how much profit they make
from it but they also are a band
they have the brian brothers band and so
bob plays the keyboard and mike is on
uh guitar or drums but he's not on the
drums when the drummer of the counting
crows joins them
which he does sometimes so like legit
band
and i mention it because everyone has to
look up the 2009 song autograph
which i'd forgotten about that is it
features cameos from andy murray and
novak djokovic
and i'm telling you i i wish to god it
was this andy murray here because that
would have been less awkward than what
they make
andy murray the tennis player too it's
it's about what a horrible jordan is
signing autographs after matches
and andy murray's little rap section in
the middle
uh includes the lyrics during wimbledon
it gets really crazy my hand cramps up
and my mind gets hazy
and um look i'm going to leave people to
imagine the rest but andy murray's rap
section is never
the words that should never ever be put
together
another fun thing about ghost crabs is
that they're very house proud
but only when they are sexually mature
which maybe is the same for humans
so when males are not sexually mature
and if you get female house crabs
they burrow into the sand and they leave
these tiny little holes in the sand
they're smaller than a tiny coin but
they can go four or five feet down which
is kind of cool
anyway they borrow holes into the sand
and they just
throw the sand anywhere the sound that
they've used to borrow they just chuck
it all over the beach
but as soon as they hit sexual maturity
they suddenly sculpt the sand into a
perfect pyramid
and this is to sort of advertise
themselves to ladies we think so a woman
can look across a beach
and she'll spot the sexually mature men
by the perfect pyramids that are next to
their entrances
and you'll see you'll see the little
entrance and then it's little crabby
footsteps footprints going to the
pyramid
do you think that if ghost crab goes to
egypt they look over and they go
[ __ ] hell there is a very attractive
enormous ghost crab over there
yeah very intimidating trip very
intimidating stag do for those males
so you can find out a lot of things from
ct scans of mummies
um they tried to they ct scanned an
egyptian priest called
nasir moon uh and they scanned his
throat and his vocal cords
and they could find out what his voice
was like
so they did the ct scan of his um vocal
cords
they created a 3d printed vocal tract
and then they kind of fired air down it
and they could work out exactly what he
sounded like
um and it's basically people on the
internet think he sounded a bit like
britney spears
cool oh i thought
[Music]
the sound did the rounds on social media
and
a lot of britney spears fans were very
excited about it
wow unreleased material from 2000 years
ago well the interesting thing is like
would have he was a priest so he would
have done a lot of singing and chanting
in the
temples so basically if you went back to
ancient egypt and you walked past the
temple it would sound like
someone's singing baby one more time wow
he wouldn't have been dressed as a
school girl though
it seems implausible it might have been
there's
probably a lot less chess players on
line than we actually think there are
because they create fake accounts
and they build them up and up to be sort
of well played
chess players with high rankings and
then they play themselves and defeat
that person so it's sort of creating
bogus accounts in order to defeat them
and then raise your ranking
master is just one guy
have you heard of sandbagging that's
another cheating thing
[Music]
yeah this is where you play deliberately
badly to qualify for a tournament that
is actually a bit beneath you
and then you win you take the breaks off
and you
you thump everybody that's that happens
in golf as well
people claim um like you you play badly
for ages until your handicap gets way
worse and then
eventually you go right today's the day
that i'm going to try and win the
tournament
it's extremely locked down upon yeah
yeah
well they've got measures in place don't
they i think they have actual measures
in place now on the chest side to stop
that
so i think it's yeah i think it's if you
ever achieved
certain high scores they looking go well
there's no way that you can now
suck that much because you got to this
level and if you
if you won a certain amount of cash
prize like a high cash prize
well how did you get to that you must be
good you must be sandbagging us in order
to to do that so very embarrassing if
you're not sandbagging and you aren't
just having a really bad exact place
you just got lucky one time yeah
it happened i think they had to change
the rules or tighten them a few years
ago because there was
a middle school so sad when you start
forcing 12 year olds to do this
but in texas it's called henderson
middle school and
they entered a competition where you had
to have a ranking under 900
and then they absolutely smashed it they
were investigated and it turned out
they'd lost
all of their previous 28 matches um and
they're really good and someone worked
out the chances of
having lost them all being as good as
they were and it was one in sextillion
that they could have lost all 28. which
is like if
they'd been them playing chess since the
start of the universe and everywhere in
the universe it still wouldn't have
happened probably
so they were disqualified but 12 year
olds come on
okay i think it's not impossible that
some people get to a really good
position on chess.com because they're
only playing people who are deliberately
losing in order to
stand back so they think they're
incredible they win a big cash prize and
then the next time they play it their
deficiencies are revealed and then they
get banned from playing because
chess.com thinks they were the ones
doing it
absolutely it's a vicious cycle um other
people who go down
um sort of scavenging and and hunting
around the
the lost rivers are the type it's tyburn
is that the
pronunciation is it the type of angling
society yes the tiber and angling
society
it's just wonderful they they made up
once a year to report on the fish they
found
uh it's always zero so it's not the
greatest angling society but they are
obsessed with the idea of daylighting
which is
the idea of bringing these hidden rivers
back to the surface
through destruction of the stuff on top
of bringing the tyburn
back to being what it once gloriously
was and
it's an extraordinary thing that they
put together in around 2000
where they put a full report to show how
they would do it where it would go
it would demolish about 1 billion pounds
worth of real estate
unfortunately it's only buckingham
palace that needs to go really
it's [ __ ] a palace that's part of
their plan
they want to get rid of it i've one more
thing about houdini's
habits at home when houdini and his wife
had an argument
he would leave he'd walk around the
block and then he'd come back
and he would open the door of the room
where his wife was and throw his hat
into the room right if it was thrown out
again
she was still angry and i guess he would
do it again
and if the hat remained in the room she
had calmed down and
they would go in and resolve it what if
the argument
was about him leaving his clothes
hanging around the house all the time
like a lot of the arguments in my house
are about
so i read a paper called madame
mongooses in
indian culture uh by derrick o'lodrick
i'm not sure that's how you pronounce
his name but i'll look it up afterwards
uh
and i found the oldest known story about
mongooses
and it's from 3000 years ago there's a
king who's having a feast
and then a mongoose walks in and half of
his body is made out of gold
and he comes in and he rolls in all the
food of the feast
and the king's like what the hell are
you doing and he said oh well i once
rolled in the food of a brahmana
uh like a really holy uh hindu guy uh
and the brahmana was so holy that he
turned
when he rolled in his food he turned
half into gold
and this mongoose is going around
looking for another holy person so he
can turn his whole body into gold
right i don't know if you want your
whole body turned into gold
i'm pretty sure king midas taught us
that didn't he yeah
yeah they hadn't come across each other
king michaels didn't turn into gold did
he
yeah no no no he turned everything he
touched into gold he didn't
like get a gold finger and then no but
what he but he returned his leg and he
had a gold leg i know he regretted it
because he couldn't even but wait a
minute what happened no no
he regretted it because you couldn't
well partly because you if you touched
another person who he loved they turned
into gold
and that's based on the fact that people
don't want to be turned into gold
yeah what happened if with king my just
touched himself do we know
and is it in the story or they didn't do
that in those days james it was a
cleaner time
[Laughter]
i there was something about finland that
was in actually the original article i
read
and it's about um it's an amazing fact
that i didn't know and i can't remember
how the journalist
louis segued into it but i'm just going
to segue into it by saying she also
mentioned
that finland's only monarch the only
moniker's ever had
is this german guy who never visited
finland
that's right yeah and they this is in
1917 they got independence from russia
and they started off thinking we want a
king uh everyone else has got or a queen
um everyone else has got one where
should we find one we obviously don't
have a royal family here in finland
because we're brand new
and so they picked this guy frederick
charles of hesse
and he was a german prince they designed
a crown for him which i think you can
still
see on display somewhere in finland and
then before he even had a chance to
enter the country
they changed their mind uh after a few
months and he abdicated
ah that's it that's did he advocate from
overseas as in he
yeah yeah he's still outside god that's
must've been good in those days when
there were all those
new countries being formed and if you
were if you were a minor
noble in anywhere in europe whenever
there was a new country you must have
been there with your fingers crossed
thinking oh maybe i'm going to be king
of there you're sitting in the waiting
room with all the other
potential monarchs going in for their
interviews
i hope that bastard from schleswig
holstein doesn't get it he's coming out
looking all cocky
really aced the practical the waving
section of the interview
here's one quick thing on forgeries um
there is a forger
or there was a forger called elmir de
hori
he was a hungarian in the united states
and he did forgeries of loads of people
picasso matisse
and he did loads of forgeries of
madigliani
okay and he did so many madigliani that
these days it's impossible to compile a
catalogue
of liani's work because we don't know
what is real and what is a forgery by
this guy the hori
and the reason i bring it up is because
he has a collection
of all of his forgeries and it's run by
a guy called mark forgi
no wow
he's got extremely fast internet as well
hasn't it
i like have you guys come across freddie
and truce over stegen
no who were not today he's not hit at
the hotel here
um they were part of the dutch
resistance in fact and they were
14 and 16 years old respectively and
they were killers cold-blooded killers
and they called their kills liquidations
which is kind of terrifying and
apparently the 14 year old actually
looked about 12 so
it was quite easy for them to get away
with killing because no one expected to
be killed
by a 12 year old girl and the way they
did it was they had various methods but
they cycled around quite a lot i guess
cycling was a thing for these resistance
ladies
and they would ambush uh collaborators
so they'd be on two bikes and they'd
have pistols in their bike baskets
and they'd ambush them or sometimes
they'd do a drive-by so
freddie would be riding the bike and
truce would be on the back
and you know cycle past some
collaborators and just shoot them up as
you ride bikes
and what was the liquidation bit or was
that just a fancy
they would just shoot them as opposed
there was no melting down no no
they didn't have like a vat of acid in
their cellar
where they dragged nazi bodies
what you didn't melt them down no we
just we just did a drive by
and shot them well you got to melt them
down mate
maybe they could take cause i didn't
look into it enough there are a few sort
of modern
loopholes for companies in britain that
don't have a liquor license and i was
reading about one place which was there
was a new craft distillery in yorkshire
that was being
set up in a disused train station so
they'd done it up and it was for
um it was going to be for gin i believe
and it's called tappling and meegan
distilleries
and by the time they're about to launch
all the paperwork hadn't been done yet
for their license
but they had this big party that they
wanted to promote uh their drinks so
what they had to do was they looked and
found a loophole which is
if you're on a moving train you don't
need a liquor license so all trains that
you buy alcohol on they don't need a
license
a moving train is exempt from it and the
fact that they were in a train station
and they had a parked train there
they got all the guests onto the train
and they took her on a two and a half
hour ride
uh just to one that just went one way
turned well not even turned around just
drove back again
and did a uh two and a half hour gin
master class once it was in motion
and that that allowed them the loophole
of of having the party still
if you had a bar which had a miniature
train on the counter
so it sort of came chew chewing along
with your drink does that count and then
you wouldn't need a liquor license maybe
you have to be on the train so
if you went to like what's that um
what's that sushi place which has got
the
sushi and you sit on the conveyor belt
technically you don't need a license
don't sit on one of the colored plates
you will be selected
um i was looking at other ways that
museums need to preserve their
artifacts and one is from fires serious
problem
and it's a really difficult choice for
museums because the main way to get rid
of fires is with sprinkles
sprinkler systems but obviously if you
sprinkle a whole
art gallery then you've sort of ruined
the paintings that way
but so a lot of museums kind of don't do
it and that was
a serious problem in brazil you might
remember a couple of years ago when
the main museum in brazil destroyed 90
of its collection
because of a fire and they just didn't
have the adequate protection
but there is one place the getty museum
in la which has such
cool fireproof systems so they have
like they had the big wildfires last
year and they were pretty much
licking at the size of the museum and
the curators were completely chilled out
about it
because it's so well protected so it's
full of like rembrandts and mayonnaise
but
they first of all they have a system
where the oxygen can get sucked out of
the rooms
so that as soon as a fire got in there
it wouldn't be able to breathe
and so it would just immediately go out
so it's like an anti-ventilation system
and then they also have around the
museum a million gallon water tank
and so as soon as a fire starts coming
close they just start releasing water
into the ground
all around the museum like a moat it's
great and so firefighters who are
fighting the wildfires use the museum as
like a rest area and a vantage point to
look around at the rest of la and go
ah well i guess i guess the art's okay
wow really pleasant really that's
amazing really clever
uh well just speaking of water um there
was a museum
in spain which is the museum of
underwater archaeology which is called
aqua and they've had a real problem with
leaks
this year
now hang on honestly they get all of
their stuff
is stuff that's been found underwater
like statues which are sunk or
with um shipwrecks or anything that's
come from the bottom of the ocean
uh and they have hundreds of thousands
of things in there
but they also have uh leaks in the
basement and
a lot of damp causing problems with the
wall and they're really worried about it
and they reckon that it's going to wreck
all of the things which have been
underwater for thousands hundreds of
years
[Laughter]
um have you guys heard of uh at nuclear
trains a twitter account
no no this is a really cool one so it's
a twitter bot
um and it's made by two scientists who
are called matt allenson and
kier little and what it does is it
tracks trains which are carrying nuclear
waste
across the uk so these trains go you
know
they existed actually sorry i didn't
know there were trains that had
i knew well right you you they're yet to
tweet
no no no um well yeah i mean it's not
it's not common knowledge but they
sort of they you have to transport
radioactive containers and trains are
not a bad way of doing it
they're very tightly sealed um and
these guys they're not pro or
anti-nuclear they they genuinely are
just
in it for the trains as they say um and
they
have clarified that the radiation you
would get because sometimes these pass
along platforms you know they go through
brixton or whatever quite near
passengers
but they've said that the radiation you
would get if you're on the platform and
one of these trains went by
will be like you just eaten one banana
isn't that amazing but everyone on the
platform has just eaten
the equivalent of one banana but would
you feel it would you feel full
everyone slips over on the platform yeah
no they don't emit bananas um they just
get that much radiation
yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah but that's
quite dangerous because if you're such a
banana lover that you're constantly
operating on the banana eating cusp of
getting radiation
and you manage it very quick you know
you're eating 350 bananas a day and you
know
351 would tip you over the edge yeah
yeah you're right
yeah what happens then andy if a train
full of bananas passes by
what is the radiation level in that at
that speed that kills you immediately
they have to transport bananas one by
one don't they that's why they're so
expensive once they get to the shop
do you know that this is one of my
favorite totally random
facts but you know penny mordant who was
defend very briefly actually defense
secretary last year yeah and
before that was international
development secretary yeah she's named
after a royal navy frigate
wow she's named after hms penelope
that's so funny isn't that weird that's
a really good giant
it's nick it's because she's from an
army family and actually it was known as
hms peppa pot
because it was shelled so many so many
times in world war ii
so she could easily be pepper pot modern
oh didn't she do that
pepper potts is iron man's girlfriend
yeah oh really
yeah maybe that's why they didn't go
with peppa pot they didn't want her to
be confused
why is she called peppa potts it's a
weird name it's because she comes from a
comic book like all these characters
that they often
they often have quite funny names and
illiterate
names don't they yeah good point i read
about one um
plane crash or um you know emergency
landing in 2013
this guy called john pedersen and he
realized that his plane had had a little
bit of damage and he wasn't going to
make it all the way to
the nearest airports this was in around
chicago
and so he saw a long road and he thought
well
you know that's probably the best way to
go i'm going to try and stop on this
road
but obviously there's traffic on this
road so he doesn't want to hit any
and what he managed to do was exactly
time it so that when the lights went red
and everyone stopped that's when he
landed in the middle of this
intersection
isn't that amazing that's his story
and i was reading this article about it
in the chicago newspaper
and they said that he landed and didn't
hit anyone and he was in the middle of
this intersection
and then the lights changed and two cars
just went didn't notice him and crashed
into him
[Music]
what and then just apparently it says
and then mysteriously sped off
so they they kind of drove hit this
plane
and then thought oh [ __ ] i just hit a
plane and they just did a hit and run on
this
that's the scene of the accident
[Laughter]
people always think that pneumatic
technology is going to be the next
big thing i think there was a lot of
excitement in the us
about 40 years ago that it was going to
be how we all disposed of our rubbish
and so disneyland i think was a pioneer
of this right so their entire garbage
disposal system is fully pneumatic so if
you're in disneyland
you put something in a bin and then it
drops down into a tunnel system and
every 20 minutes it just gets sucked
about 60 miles an hour to a collection
point there are a lot of theme park
nerds
who are about to get angry at you
because it's the magic kingdom of walt
disney world in florida not disneyland i
guarantee
you're getting it thank you correction i
i
i got to do a behind the scenes tour
that one so i actually got to see some
of the
the tunnels uh that those go through and
you're just kind of walking through the
backstage tunnels and there's just this
tube next to you
where every 20 minutes or so you just
hear this do you have to
dive out the way every 20 minutes no
it's just it's just a tube on a wall
it's not like a transparent how big is
the tube can you fit a human in it
it's 20 inches diameter i think you fit
a mouse in it
20 inches okay so yeah that's pretty big
yeah i reckon
yeah i i've been to disneyland and
disney world as well
and the rides i don't really like them
as much i prefer their universal ones
the rides but if there was a
garbage shoot i think that i would be
definitely going for you could sell
t-shirts saying why don't you get sucked
off at disneyland
hey i like the rubbish for pneumatic
tubes
i will i i will argue with you for like
half an hour that universal's rides are
terrible compared to disney's but we do
not have the time for that
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hi do you like reading books but you
don't have time to read books
yes well you know what you need dan you
need blinkist
yeah blinkist is the perfect thing for
someone like me it is an
app that condenses best-selling
non-fiction books right down to the key
takeaways
so that you can listen to it or read it
in just 15 minutes
for instance there is a book called a
short history of brexit from brentry to
backstop
so if you're absolutely sick of hearing
all about brexit you can learn about the
whole thing in just 15 minutes
you'll be an expert exactly james this
is the other thing right you ever join a
book club
no oh it's a nightmare you've got to
read books and you've got to read them
in time for the club
this is the way that you can cheat it
you can become an expert in 15 minutes
on the way as you're walking to the club
i'm not sure that you're really getting
into the nub of what book club is
supposed to be done
if you want to cheat it everywhere but
if you do love to cheat your book club
if you want to be an expert on brexit
or even if you want to be the kind of
person who has a new year's
resolution to read more books and be
more erudite
and keep that new year's resolution then
go to blinkist that's b

fish and if you do that you can get a
free seven-day trial
and 25 off your blinkist premium

as the most informed book reader they've
ever seen
okay on with the podcast on with the
show
[Music]
have you heard of jebediah buxton uh
that's my favorite
no i don't think so my favorite plaque
plucky
um in the uk uh lived in derbyshire
the label is mental calculator
so jebediah buxton lived in the early
18th century
um i we think he was an
autistic savant you know people who
could do unbelievable calculations in
their head
so jebediah buxton was once asked after
a church sermon
what did he think of the sermon and he
said
oh i just counted how many words there
were in it he just gave a word count
that's so good i know he was completely
self-taught
not formally trained at all and didn't
know much about anything except numbers
but knew everything about numbers so he
walked around the local area which is
called elmton was about a thousand acres
and he could give it size not only in
acres but also in square inches
wow he was amazing sorry i have no idea
what you just said because i was trying
to count the number of words you were
saying
not as easy as it sounds is it it really
isn't it really is not
uh if you get a seal and you blindfold
it and you
give it a pair of ear buffs then it
can't find
fish i'm not surprised yeah yeah
i'm surprised at all actually sorry i've
misread this they can
find fish oh if you blindfold them and
give them mean muffs
okay that's gone from being an
incredibly underwhelming fact to being
quite interesting
and it's because they use their whiskers
right and the whiskers can tell the
movements in the water
and this is amazing so when fish
swim we talked before that they have
like lots of eddies and
vortices and stuff like that which they
leave in the water these seals whiskers
can detect these tiny little vortices
in a fish that swam past 30 seconds ago
so it swam past 30 seconds ago and you
can still feel where it was and then it
can still follow the tre
the track of the fish to get that even
if it's wearing earmuffs oh wow
that is amazing can it tell sort of the
time
that's passed right rather than up to 30
like maybe like
15 seconds ahead because they can tell
the strength of the wait they can't tell
the future
not the future what i'm saying is they
could count up to 30 but when they feel
it let's say it's a wake
that comes past them 15 seconds after
it's been there
can they know it's 15 seconds i don't
know if they can count up to 30.
i don't know if they know it's exactly
30. but i think they
they will have a basic idea of time
and we'll know that yeah and know that
the varieties will be stronger
if it has gone more recently passed i
mean it's like smelling something
you know you feel it getting stronger as
you get closer don't you yeah you don't
when you're
trying to find something in your house
where the smell's coming from
you're not counting this you know your
nose isn't saying that's exactly five
meters away but you can tell that it's
closer or further
you guys don't do that
i think if you want to sue anyone you
should sue the makers of sherlock holmes
baffled
have you guys seen that movie no yes
it's from 1900
it's the first ever movie with sherlock
holmes in it
and it's an american silent film and
basically
it's very much against the canon
of sherlock holmes because what happens
is people keep
kind of stealing things from under his
nose and then using trick photography
they just disappear
and then you just get a picture of
sherlock holmes going oh what happened
there why did they disappear
and then they reappear in another part
of the room and then they steal
something else
and then disappear again and it goes on
like that for a couple of minutes
and i just don't think that that's
really i mean
first of all he doesn't solve anything
he just stuns her looking
yeah well that was made in 1900 i
believe right is that right james
so there's another one which i'd love to
see 1916
the mystery of the leaping fish and
this was a movie where sherlock holmes
was
sort of lampooed by douglas fairbanks
douglas fairbanks
uh junior who was one of hollywood's
leading actors at the time he was a
swashbuckling adventurer
and he along with charlie chaplin they
set up they set up ua
united artists and he was a huge
influence in hollywood back in the day
and he played basically the druggie
version of sherlock holmes really
bringing up that side of his character
so the way that in the movie he was
presented he wasn't called sherlock
holmes he was called
coke any day e-n-n-y
d-a-y as his surname and he had a
bandolier of syringes that he wore
across his chest
so he was constantly injecting himself
as the movie when it sounds
cocaine yeah um he had a clock with the
clock face that says
eats drinks sleeps and dope instead of
the numbers so he would know when to
inject himself
and the idea is that coke any days was
trying to find all of these
drug barons and once he caught them he
would sample all the drugs that they had
as he was busting them and fairbanks
hated the movie after it came out it was
only a two-reeler
and he just said this is horrific but
that's one of the earliest sherlock
holmes movies as well
you said 1916 1916 yeah wow
but that dan that was the first year as
the first
full-length sherlock holmes film but
this was a bit more serious because he
was
um because it wasn't a mad cocaine
rob it was um he was played by william
gillette
who was a distant cousin of the gillette
razer
family exactly yeah um
and uh william gillette was a really
interesting guy so he only played
sherlock holmes in one movie
but um that was after he played him on
stage about 1
300 times he'd come up with a stage
version of it
and yeah and he and arthur kendall were
actually friends um
they i think i mean arthur and i was
probably pleased because he
managed to work out a way of doing the
character well on stage and it was
you know respectful and all of this but
also entertaining and when they met
i really like this william gillette um
they were meeting i think on the same
train and uh gillette got off the train
dressed as holmes and then he found
arthur conan doyle
and he examined him through a magnifying
glass and that was
from that point onwards they were firm
friends granddaughter loved it
yeah that's it's a risky move isn't it
because it really is
yeah yeah he might think you were taking
the piss a little bit
but we also we had um temperance bars in
britain
which were super popular around the end
of the 19th century again
with this big push to stop people
drinking and apparently
for every little mill town there would
be at least three temperance bars which
is essentially like a
i mean the cafe what is it like a milk
bar like it's a cafe
i think i might they used to be not not
that long ago there was definitely one
in lancashire i know that much
well there's one left now and uh it's
fitzpatricks and lancashire you're
absolutely right
and the owner of the fitzpatrick's in
2012
he'd just been on harry bikers actually
and talking about the great stuff about
non-alcoholic drinks like dandelion
burdock and how great abstinence is and
how popular the bar still was
and then he was done for drink driving
have you guys heard of the nuclear bomb
that was dropped on the greggs
i can understand that okay craigslist
greg well no i've tricked you with my
words
this is the story of the only nuclear
bomb that has ever been dropped on
american
soil by an american plane okay and it
fell on the family who were called
the greggs lived in south carolina
parents three kids uh their cousin
everyone was
playing the kids were playing in the
yard next door to the garden right
perfectly normal afternoon high above
them in the sky there's a plane
which is doing a training exercise with
a real nuclear bomb
where they have to transport it across
the country um
so training exercise there had been some
kind of mess up with getting it sort of
locked into its
um it's sort of um hanger thing
you know it's hanging there above the
bombay doors um
so the captain sends a crew member to
adjust the the locking mechanism
the crew member uh can't quite get a
handle
these are huge bombs it looks like a you
know it looks like a whale weighs about
three tons
the crew member climbs slightly up the
side of the bomb and reaches up
to grab something to get a handhold
unfortunately what he grabs
is the emergency bomb release mechanism
right
and then does he fly down on it like in
doctor strangelove
so exactly well the bomb falls onto the
bombay doors
right which crumple like paper the crew
member makes an x
shape with his body and just about stays
inside the plane
the bomb is now falling towards the
completely unaware greg
family house it lands in their garden
it makes a crater 15 meters across and
10 meters deep
the fact no one is killed the family are
all injured but they
they you know they became superheroes no
they become
superheroes um the families chickens
unfortunately
were vaporized but thank god the bomb
did not go fully nuclear it kind of had
the safety catch on
but then amazingly they stayed the crew
was so apologetic they were so
mortified they'd done this and they
wrote to the family apologizing and they
stayed in touch for
years with the crew this family the
great
even to the extent that one of them
visited the family for a week's holiday
many years later wow thank you
so nice that must have been an
embarrassing moment because i used to
get embarrassed enough you know when you
had to knock on your neighbor's door and
say i'm really sorry i've kicked my
football into your health
i am so sorry i have dropped my nuclear
bomb
in your backyard in the vietnam war
i don't think we've ever mentioned
operation wandering seoul
have we which was one of the tactics
that the us
used against vietnamese soldiers which
was to play
ghost noises incredibly loudly out of
helicopters
and from u.s soldiers sort of hidden in
vietnam
they'd have these big boom boxes and
play ghost noises together like it would
work
because helicopters are extremely loud
yeah and it's not like you're gonna
they're not like they can sneak up on
you
and then play this noise you're gonna be
first thing is you hear the helicopter
and you're gonna go why are ghosts
driving helicopters now doesn't make any
sense
you're so right the idea was that in
vietnam the belief is that if you don't
get a proper burial then your soul
wanders the earth
and so they actually recorded south
vietnamese people they recruited south
vietnamese people to record themselves
shrieking and screaming and saying my
friends i've come back to let you know
that i am dead i'm dead don't end up
like me
go home quickly really crazy
and the vietnamese soldiers mainly
didn't believe them and all it did was
give them a target to return fire to
so oh no that would still scare me i
have to say
if if the four of us were out you know
in a in a jungle and we were scared
and a boombox head a voice of say alex
bell saying
come over here i'm dead i i get scared
by that
what situa why are we in the jungle then
how badly wrong is our tour gone
we're on foot in vietnamese jungle and
why
yeah why does it take a boom box and a
helicopter and the jungle for you to pay
any attention to alex bell
[Laughter]
alex if you're listening here's how you
get us to actually upload the podcast
correctly
when you say there are there are all
these museums around license some of
them do sound i would say of limited
interest
so there's a museum there's an island
called
jaime jaime um and there's collector on
there
whose collection museum whatever you
like is a lifetime of paper napkins
which are organized by theme into
binders and
supposed for online her sofa is covered
in binders
full of paper napkins i just does
anybody else feel an overwhelming sense
of sadness
well there's napkins there to wipe your
tears away saying that yeah
that's so true and they have a
museum of sea monsters but the way that
they've done that is they have the
stories
of sea monsters like any museum might do
but the founders they phoned every
single care home in iceland
and they asked for all of the elderly
residents do you know
any stories about sea monsters that have
happened in
your history or have you heard any
stories and they collected all of those
and they're all the stories that are in
the museum which i think is a really
good way of
finding social history isn't it yeah so
wonderful
but that's the origin of um of grimm's
fairy tales in the first place isn't it
the grimm brothers didn't write them
they went round and collected them
mostly from women yeah that's a woman i
think she was called daughter wilder who
who uh gave lots of the stories but they
went around and
particularly older women asked them for
the stories that they remembered
i mean really we ought to be doing more
of that i think that that kind
of um gathering of stories is a
wonderful thing so good for them that's
great
yeah it sounds wonderful it sounds like
an incredible um filing
system but done as an entire country
where they're all dedicated to filing
one aspect of social history yeah yeah
it's just yeah it's incredible with the
grim brothers i read a story which i
really hope is true i
always keep meaning to look it up which
is when they were gathering the stories
one of the brothers
was trying to get a great story off a
sailor or
some guy who um who knew bunch and
uh he said what can i give you to give
me your story and
the sailor needed new trousers so the
grim brother gave his trousers on the
spot to this guy
to wear and then gave him his story and
he took it down sort of
you know trouserless as he was as he was
taking it just love i love that kind of
i need your story what do you need my
trouser is fine go for it
wait did the guy did the guy he was
talking to not have any trousers on no
he probably just was approaching a
trouserless man and saying tell me your
story
there's another story there wait was it
the story of winnie the pooh
i'm actually in berlin there was a
traffic jam this year
that was in the news which was this is
in february
and this was created by one german
artist who calls himself an artist
called simon
weckert who created a traffic jam by
just
pulling a hand cart so he was on foot
and pulling a handcart behind him
carrying 99 phones
so how google maps works is when it's
giving you traffic updates
it assesses all the number of phones in
a certain area and then assumes that
those are lots of people in cars and
then assumes that that means there's a
huge traffic jam
so google assumed massive traffic jam on
this one bridge
and it redirected traffic around it and
this guy
was just him on his own walking through
the center of berlin he actually walked
past
google's offices just to do a sort of
middle thing
freaky for the guys at google it was oh
my god the traffic jam it's coming this
way
it's an invisible one they're the worst
that's hilarious they
they claim to be supportive google a
google spokesperson said
whether via car or cart or camel we love
seeing creative uses of google maps as
it helps us
make our work better oh yeah it doesn't
sound like they
one thing that's quite similar which is
uh about modern technology
and slightly hacking it is the old
teslas um which would drive you could
set them to drive just underneath the
speed limit wherever you were
um they would read the traffic signs and
so
researchers at mcafee realized that if
you've got a 35 mile per hour traffic
sign
and you got some black sticky tape and
turned the three into an eight
then your tesla would drive at 85 miles
an hour
um these are the old teslas and the new
ones don't do that anymore um i think
possibly thanks to this little bit of um
work by mcafee but it just i mean
especially as the 35
mile an hour traffic signs are usually
in places that need people to slow down
it's yeah yeah yeah and that's that's
why we're still in the trialling stage
really of the driverless cars isn't it
like one smear on a speed sign and
everyone dies
have we ever talked about just that
reminds me of the tree of tenere which
is in
um or was in i think liberia but
somewhere up there
and um it was the most isolated tree in
the world and there was no tree
anywhere for like i don't know 100 miles
in any direction and then it got knocked
over by a libyan truck driver
literally there's nothing else to and he
just decided i'm just gonna drive
straight into that by accident
that must have been like the scene in
austin powers where the guy's being
about to be run over by the steamroller
and he's shouting no
from about 20 meters away very very
slowly do you think the guy the truck
driver was similarly
i can't see anything else i think that's
a really unfair analogy because in
austin powers the idiot is the person
who's about to be run over so that
implies you're blaming the tree
and the tree's gone to extreme lengths
to escape
traffic collisions it's so socially
distant that tree
it really is i think what it is is
there's something about
people when they're driving if there's a
massive area with nothing there at all
but there's
one thing then for some reason you just
kind of get drawn towards it
like your brain just can't avoid it
there there is a thing called target
fixation isn't that where someone is so
focused on avoiding a thing that they
keep looking at the thing and aiming
towards it accidentally the
conversational equivalent is that thing
which is in
the meaning of lift where there's
something you're trying to avoid talking
about and so you can never avoid talking
about it and i think the example that's
given in that book is
if you're talking to someone with one
leg and you find your conversation is
liberally peppered with
references to long john silva or the
last leg of the uefa competition
it reminds me of um michael windsor who
is now basil brush's
pa jenny you're always you're always
name-dropping
cause you're friends with basil brush
aren't you that's why i am friends with
basil brush
so the way he got the job was he
rang up basil brush's creator's son
as basil brush and auditioned for him
during that you just just was in
character the whole time
did the voice perfectly got his
mannerisms and he got the job
phone call which is an absolutely bold
move because yeah you've got the
potential to really upset somebody who
literally this guy sees basil bush as
his brother that's how um
that's how peter sellers as well got his
first job peter sellers of inspector
clue so fame and lagoon show and so on
he was getting nowhere and he was an
impressionist and he called up the bbc
and he did an impression of the the head
of the bbc at the time
saying to the person who's the producer
picking up going have you got this peter
sellers
you're not an american where's peter
sellers
this kid's hot i hear you gotta get him
you gotta get him now
um so yeah so he imitated it and the guy
went oh i'm so sorry well yeah we'll
book him and peter selos later admitted
that was actually me but the guy was so
impressed that's hilarious
that's actually how rory bremner still
keeps getting jobs
you can do a very good impression of the
director general of the bbc
that's not fair rory brown was great i
don't know why i said that
do you know vanilla rice's real name oh
i feel like it should
um oh gosh i can't remember
he's called rob rob van winkle
yeah anyway apparently why on earth
would you change that
i mean that's a fantastic name and also
wait a minute
it scans perfectly doesn't it rip van
winkle
he wouldn't have to do eyesight's baby
he's got you're absolutely right yeah he
was called vanilla because he was the
only one in his friendship group who was
white
and he got called that and then he had a
dance move called the ice
yeah right i didn't i didn't know it was
white i didn't know anything about it
[Laughter]
he almost played london i think in 2019
or 20
possibly yeah 2018 or 2019 on ice it's
going to be as gross vanilla ice on ice
no concert yeah and he sings a song
where the lyrics are iced baby this guy
has an obsession
he's got a problem actually um
like crowley has something in common
with rex lambert
uh founding editor of bbc's list the
magazine is it that they were both
insane
i suppose so actually you'll get sued
for that and this is about being sued as
well so
and alistair crowley tried to sue a
writer called nina hamnet for libel
because
she called him a black magician who said
he was into black magic
and he said that this wasn't true and he
tried to sue her and
he lost and he was declared bankrupt and
then towards the end basically he became
a big drug addict because he'd taken a
lot of drugs before and then he became a
real drug addict
uh and he died quite young um but i was
reading about nina hamner and
according to wikipedia she was a welsh
artist and writer
who was an expert on sailor shanties and
became known as the queen of bohemia
she sounds incredible isn't she um
she was basically like one of the main
people in soho
around the 1930s who kind of knew
absolutely everyone
she had an incredible bohemian life but
actually when she sued
crowley it became such big news that it
really kind of wrecked her life and she
became a bit of a
alcoholic just walking around taverns
in fitzrovia trading anecdotes for
drinks
sad yeah if you take on black magic you
always win
yeah um i was amazed about other
people's connections to the occult
around this time
and people who i thought were just legit
humans so the way
crowley first got into this whole world
was i think he joined an order which is
called the hermetic order of the golden
dawn
and another leading figure in that was
yates
which as in wba eight and he was
actually him
and his partner maude gone famously his
sort of muse and also e.e nesbit who
wrote the samyad if anyone's
read that um like five children in it
yeah exactly wow it sort of makes sense
when you think about it
you can imagine someone who is into
weirdo magic writing that
yeah but yates was a chapter leader for
this order and crowley
didn't like him and there was this big
rivalry going on about who should be
ruling this chapel croniel yates and
eventually crowley invaded his chapel
mid-sermon
he launched what he called an astral
siege on the chapel
which involved um kicking the doors down
and he was wearing a kilt for some
reason and an osiris mask was inspired
by egyptian mythology
and he started casting spells and waving
daggers around and the police had to
come and break it up
wow the big story of that it's called
the battle of blyth road
and the story is that he came through
and he started propelling black magic
at yates and the others as he was coming
up the stairs
yates was using white magic and the
white magic toppled him over down the
stairs now that's what they say but when
you read into it
what it actually was is he was coming up
the stairs and yates and his buddy who
was a boxer
was kicking him back down the stairs is
that what white magic
is white magic is some big guy kicking
you down the stairs
yeah exactly he's one of the gladiators
this is white
magic but this
this order the idea was they wanted to
discover a unified theory that explained
the magical world so that they could
bring endless possibilities to magicians
that was why they were set up and that's
why yates joined he wanted to use it for
good
um and so he joined crowley and he had a
mentor there and the name of his mentor
alan bennett wow yeah how cool i mean
it's not actual alan bennett obviously i
was summoning a demon yesterday
um this year has had an exciting new
naval battle which is
great because you know not as many
classical encounters as that
yeah definitely well i don't want to get
old
i promise this is a good one because
this is the first naval battle in the
caribbean for 75 years
um and it's between venezuela a
venezuelan
naval patrol vessel which was doing the
rounds um
defending the motherland and so on and
it had guns anti-aircraft guns the
machine guns mounted on the deck lots of
stuff
on the other side was a portuguese
cruise ship which
included an 80 seat theater a sauna and
a jacuzzi
okay the the venezuelan patrol vessels
as
it said you're being very territorially
aggressive or something they
basically they were chanting around a
bit they approached they ordered it to
come into port
venezuela and you know surrender and all
of this they then opened fire
and then they rammed the ship okay they
rammed the cruise ship but unfortunately
they didn't realize that the cruise ship
in question the resolute was built for
polar cruising and it had a one meter
thick
hull the venezuelan
naval patrol vessel crumpled basically
like a tin can
44 sailors had to be rescued
unbelievably embarrassing
wow yeah that must have
that must have really livened up that
cruise ship the cruise
cardboard and if you look out on your
left you'll see the venezuelan navy
and venezuela is now owned by thomas
cook is that right that's right
yeah amazing
you know that there's a lot of art that
just sits
out at sea on private yachts that often
are worth sort of two to three times the
value of the yacht
itself they're such valuable pieces of
art so for example
um joe lewis has a 200 million pound
super yacht he is the majority
stakeholder of tottenham
hotspurs the football club he is he's a
very he's a billionaire
in the uk and um he has a yacht and that
moored
and when it moored people could see
through the window and they saw hanging
inside one of the rooms a francis bacon
painting that sold anonymously at
christie's for 26 million pounds
and so there's courses you can take now
to train people for the practical care
of onboard art collection
because everyone on board doesn't know
how to look after these
you know sort of priceless pieces of art
and they keep getting damaged when
they're out at sea and
you know someone will pour um someone
will uh pop a champagne bottle and a
cork might
hit a priceless piece of art or in some
cases there was one guy
jean michelle basquiat who's an artist
who has
little bits of cornflakes that are
hanging off the paintings and they were
very worried that they were going to be
ripped off
thinking that maybe the kids on board
had spilled their corn flakes onto the
painting itself
um you can't spill cornflakes onto a
painting that you had
vertically honorable i don't know dad
you've got kids
how how far does the food fly when it
gets special i i
exactly you very much
well that the ceiling fresco the vatican
is just
full of coco pops isn't it yeah
i think if you're putting cereal on your
paintings then you shouldn't have an
automatic right that it's
taken seriously yeah well apparently
apparently in this case it was a mistake
he was eating cornflakes looking at his
painting as i was laying on the floor
and it fell on it and it became part of
the art
is what they say in this article but
then one of the more famous ones
is that um some millionaire or
billionaire owners came back onto their
yacht
and they've been told by that the
captain had unwrapped
a piece of art that had arrived for them
onto the yacht
and had hung the painting on the wall
and this was a horrific moment to hear
it because the piece of art that they'd
unwrapped was a bit of art done by
christo and jean-claude
and their way of doing art is they wrap
things up
so they just wrap stuff up and so
effectively the captain
had taken the actual art off put it into
the room with all the hot pipes and then
hung up this painting on the wall
and you might know some of their work
they did the the reichstag in berlin
they
wrap the entire that's what they do they
just go around wrapping things
so yeah so there's courses now for
teaching you how to look after art on
the high seas very good
so funny god i bet after that there was
a famous dog he was called dom the
talking dog
and he was called the k9 phenom
phenomenon of the century uh he debuted
in 1912
and he had a vocabulary that reached
eight words
what words were they well please don't
say rough and rude
i think it was a bit like that they were
all in german first of all
um he could say he could say haben
he could say he could which means cake
and the first one means have
uh he could say he could kind of say
yeah nine
and he could say oh come on i need a i
need a recording of this sir i will not
believe well he was really saying he was
absolutely massive he was like he was
when he came over to america so he was
big in germany obviously like you're
going to be big in germany if you speak
german
but when he came over to america there
was a lot of kind of german expats there
and they were really excited and so they
met him on the coming off the ship
a load of reporters and asked him for a
quote which um
his owner said he was too seasick to
give a quote uh when he arrived
but he was very impressed by new york
but whenever he went on stage he would
kind of um answer
a series of questions um presumably the
answers were always
or something like that but the point was
that he would make noises that sound a
bit like it but
according to um the journal science
someone did an actual paper on it they
said that really he's only just making
noises and it's the people in the
audience that are interpreting
it as words they sound a bit like words
but obviously he doesn't really know
what he's doing and it helps that the
german language sounds quite a lot more
like
dog barking than sort of the spanish
language i mean you wouldn't get away
with a big romantic language and a dog
trying to impersonate that you're
absolutely right
when i don't understand a question or i
can't quite
um determine what the person said i give
an answer
that is uh indeterminate as well so it
could be
uh sort of a mixture of yes and no or or
i'm not sure so
you know because i don't know what the
person said but i still want to respond
because they're staring at me
so i'll often say something like oh
no and they're on they and they go are
you sure and i'll go
huh and so that's just a little hint
there for some people you might want to
it's a little little skill you can have
let's do sort of a halfway
noise in russian you can say yes no yes
no which means
no daniet means no
right as well in new zealand we have a
term
called oh yeah oh yeah you've probably
heard of this one
that's right yeah yeah so when people
say you're going to the beach
oh yeah nah and what does that mean
does that mean yes well it means you
might but you just see how you go
oh okay and they might say to you oh are
you into it have you seen this thing are
you into it no you know
you know you could be but you don't want
to give it away
so it's a wonderful response because and
then you can't you can't actually
respond again to that by law in new
zealand so if you've received an
all-year nar
you can't go look which is it because
then you're just you're shunned i
suppose you could just
you could just say maybe i guess it's a
similar word
no because then you're really giving it
away that you're not sure
oh okay yeah all right it's not an issue
is is the full spectrum okay very
non-committal country an entire country
that's terrified of commitment
that's actually that's actually an
option that's actually an option on the
upcoming election ballot isn't it
no it is yeah yes
no oh yeah nah now
even though it ends on nah the
year part has got to be strong oh yeah
no
oh really the way you say it well i just
yeah there's different ways of saying it
it meant no in the end the one you end
on seems to be the dominant ask me ask
me whether it does
oh does it just mean no no
right great should we get back to
talking dogs
and the breath actually can be a problem
in some places like the um
edvard monk museum in norway they
say that the scream is fading the scream
which is his most famous work is fading
because of people's breath
and that's because he used very cheap
low quality paint
he used cadmium sulfide paints monk when
he did his painting uh
and it means that when you breathe on it
it kind of gets worse and worse and
worse and they're trying to stop people
from breathing
and that means they should they should
replace it with the screen
yeah yeah the scree screaming yeah very
nice
[Laughter]
sorry it was too good if i didn't like
one of those ones
i was afraid to breathe in front of it
in case in case the joke faded
should we um we can stop there actually
should we cancel yeah let's do that
that's cool that was a great one no no
it's fine
i was only going to talk about um taser
tampons we could let's talk about taser
teleports quickly
yeah and then we can move on after that
i refuse to press stop
so some modern uh self-defense gadgets
that obviously it's still a a bit of a
growth area
even though a lot of these things get
released and they're not legal to carry
see there is a killer engagement ring
with a
particularly sharp cut diamond um an
unbreakable umbrella which wax just as
strong as a steel pipe but weighs only
one pound and 11 ounces
but i think my favorite is the pink
stinger
which is a stun gun made to look like a
tampon
it can deliver a 50 000 volt shock and
can be used handheld or shot out to
distances up to 14 feet
so no that's that's a heck of a tampon i
think i've seen that done in thailand
actually
um
[Music]
[Laughter]
so no but you don't wear it as a tampon
before you fire it
at your inside no no it's no it's to be
hidden
within your handbag and nobody would
know not presumably among your other
tampons
yeah you don't want to accidentally get
the wrong one do you
yeah although if you've got enemies and
they ask for a tampon in the bathroom
that's a hell of a prank
50 000 volt prank prank goes wrong
man doesn't understand what a prank is
lovely wow that's extraordinary those
are all on the market we can
we can yeah they're they're available
somewhere and i cannot guarantee that
they are legal
in the territory in which you're
currently listening so please don't
waste your money
i got one last thing which is i like the
idea of the name center for north
dakota so i just quickly looked into
other names of north dakota to see if
there's any
fun names and i found there's a place
called flasher which is great
in north dakota a place called zap
and zap kind of the only major thing i
could find that happened there
was in 1969 there was a movement called
zip to zap
where the mayor of zaps suddenly found
two to three thousand partiers
tearing up the streets and setting
bonfires in the middle of them
uh to have this big party uh and they
had to get the national guard in to push
them out
why was that called zip to zap i thought
you were gonna say the mayor zip wired
into zap that sounded really fun
no i think it was just a group of people
that let's zip over to zap
and have a massive party is the uh i
believe
and then lastly a place called
buttsville which is a cool name
b-u-t-t z-v-i-l-l
oh that is weird there's a lot of butts
in um in that part of the world isn't
there because um
but like means a it's like a raised
bit of land or something so there's is
that b-u-t-t-e
yeah so yeah montana and wyoming and
dakotas there's loads of butts
you're not going to believe this in
south dakota
there is a place which was the original
center of north america
which was done by drawing two lines and
it is called snake butt
really yeah and they put an obelisk on
it uh
and they named it the approximate center
of north america and
um then in 1930 they changed their minds
and decided it was in rugby north dakota
but it was snake butt a confusing name
because it's actually really hard to
work out where a snake's butt
really is do you know what ice um eyes
having a look let's go looking for some
old books and uh
maybe this is just me having some lock
down brain but i suddenly
had a look at winnie the pooh and i
hadn't realized quite how philosophical
it is so there's a wonderful bit where
piglet and poo are sitting underneath
the big tree
and piglet says what if this big tree
falls down
and poo says what if it doesn't and i
just thought
it's a great attitude to life isn't it
instead of catastrophizing and thinking
what if this terrible thing happens i
like that attitude
i mean or am i being ridiculous
is praying for an end to the pain there
it sounds like he's taken piglet there
on the assumption the treat will fall on
them both
i don't really like that why are we
always worrying about the bad thing
that's going to happen
what if yeah what if it doesn't we just
sit here happily
and not worry about bad things happening
to us

=355
[Music]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming from four
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
is dan schreiber i'm sitting here with
anna toshinski
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order
here we go starting with my fact this
week
my fact is that while working as a
publisher the poet t.s eliot
liked to sit his visiting authors on a
whoopee cushion
before offering them an exploding cigar
wow i mean did he do this with everybody
yeah i don't know if people were warned
about it i think most people assumed it
wouldn't happen he was a very serious
guy according to the
writings that he released so the idea
that you would enter the office of the
great poet t.s eliot
and have a cigar explode in your face
while making a loud fart
seems out of place doesn't it do you
think maybe
the very grave serious persona he had
throughout his life was all an act so
that he could
do this without people expecting it
that's a great could have been all
building up to this
all the front yeah yeah it wasn't just
his authors who came in who he would
turn these sort of practical jokes onto
he once broke up a board meeting as well
by setting off a bucket full of
firecrackers underneath the chairman's
legs
so he was all over the shop he was a
nightmare to work with sounds like a
maniac
that sounds dangerous as a fourth of
july prank
yeah yeah you'd be fired if you weren't
quite senior in the company or you
weren't about to become the greatest per
of the 20th century you would be fired
for that but wait a minute wouldn't it
be quite cool if you're about to be
fired
and they went you're fired and you went
no you're fired mate and a lot of
firecrackers went off
his ass stunning maybe that's what
happened and it was such an event they
completely forgot this accident
so t.s eliot he um famous poet but
also uh was actually a publisher himself
so he worked for faber and faber
in fact he actually worked for before it
was faber in favor he worked for it when
it was faber and gwyer
you know what i'm just saying very very
good publishers faber and faber
um they've got one book out this year i
think it's called funny you should ask
by the queue
there we go here we go
very good very crafty sorry dan you were
saying
but so yeah so he joined them in the
1920s
and he became a director and an editor
there
he was saying he was one of the great
poets of the 20th century which i guess
he was
fine but he did he did also write cats
i mean he's i think i believe that's
what we're referring to when we say i'm
sorry
he is the lyricist credited as the
lyricist on the musical cats even though
he died
20 years before it came out because he
wrote this book old possum's book of
practical cats in 1939 and it was for
his godson
it was you know it wasn't yeah that's
that's unfair to say that he wrote cats
i say he wrote cats because for example
he won a tony award
for cats in 1983 18 years after he died
and they wheeled him up didn't they onto
the stage very
dark award ceremony anyway surprise i
haven't been dead all this time
[Laughter]
huge stink bomb goes off at the back of
the room chaos
i think in his defense he said about
cats in an interview when he was asked
about it
that one wants to keep one's hand in so
you know you just keep
trying stuff out you just keep writing
the practice of writing even if you're
not really writing serious stuff
but he did really enjoy writing about
cats because in this same interview
he basically said i've thought about
writing about dogs but they don't seem
to lend themselves to verse
quite so well which i can see that
that's true
a dog on a log can you does rhyme but i
think there's more rhyming words for
cats than there are for dogs just
i mean i'm not a poet as you might be
able to tell but i just no i think
that's really good he probably hadn't
thought of the log thing from the
catholic frog as well actually frog
yeah but it's the cat in the hat isn't
it not the dog on the log
with the frog okay he wasn't dr seuss
come on
is that that one patriots i've never
read any of his stuff i must say
ezra pound gave him his nickname which
you mentioned a minute ago which was
possum
so it's called old possum's book of
practical cats because that was elliot's
nickname
and it's related to his serious
personality
so despite all the practical jokes he
was known for being incredibly stiff
the nickname possum came after the fact
that possums are known for faking their
own death so the idea was that
whenever he was at a social gathering it
seemed like he was faking being dead
that's how much life you contributed to
the party
like playing possum yeah exactly but so
he liked
the name possum is that what you're
saying he did like it yeah it was
affectionate
and virginia woolf said he was so
buttoned up he wore a four piece suit
and so he liked the name possum he kind
of embraced this and it was based
on that's the joke i understand
i was just trying to work out because i
i wanted to know if there was a bit of a
three-piece suit i was missing all these
years
no there's there's a bit of a bit of
your sense of humour you've been missing
all these things
but that's interesting because he did
have a bit of a lack of a sense of humor
about
his names generally for example t.s
eliot
why is the s in there why not t eliot do
you guys know
well all i know really about t.s eliot
before researching this is that his name
is nanogram of toilets
so there you go is that it if you if you
take the s out it's toilet
backwards and he did not want that to be
the case
yeah yeah kidding that's why he put the
s in this is a lot of people said it i
haven't read him saying it himself but
you know samuel beckett has written
about it saying t elliot is toilet
spelled backwards ordon mentioned it
that that's what you would get i think
it was a thing that everyone had noticed
and so that's why the yes was in there
wow um so we know he didn't
like dogs we know he likes cats do you
know what other animals he didn't like
um spiders i guess is the obvious one
farmyard animals as a as a group
he famously at or rather perhaps not as
famous as it should be
while working at faber turned down
george orwell's animal farm
it was submitted to them and he read it
and he wrote him a nice long letter
saying it's brilliant
and i'm very upset that we're not going
to be publishing it because
it means that whoever gets to publish it
will probably get to publish your
subsequent work but
i just i can't do it it doesn't fit with
us because he doesn't like things
i'll tell you another animal he didn't
like flies because they also turned down
lord of the flies
faber and faber is every subsequent fact
in this show gonna have to be linked
tangentially to an animal was it because
lord of the flies has a character called
piggy and you get pigs in farmyards
brilliant that's exactly it yes they
they well they don't specify that they
turned it down with the notes rubbish
and dull
pointless reject wow ouch yeah god
sounds like he was quite a bad publisher
he had to
write poems to make ends meet turning
down all these absolute stoke old hits
unlike faber of today of course who have
another stone cold hits on their hands
with money you should ask the new bug by
the q i else
available now spawn
[Laughter]
i didn't know how fun t.s eliot was i
appreciate we've just said that he's not
fun all the way through this but
i didn't know he really liked groucho
marx he idolized gretchen bucks
they had dinner once together t.s eliot
and groucho marx but the dinner was a
complete disaster
because all marx wanted to talk about
was literature
and all eliot wanted to talk about was
mark's brother's films
yeah it's really interesting that if
groucho marx was going to become friends
with anyone
you would think it wouldn't be someone
who has the big exploding cigar trick
[Laughter]
maybe that was his ultimate prey for t.s
eliot i will get him one day
well that actually makes so much sense
sorry because elliott once wrote marks a
letter so he'd written gretchen mark's
letter saying can i have a photo of you
and uh marx had sent it and ts eliot put
this framed on his table but then elliot
wrote another letter to mark saying
in the photo of you you're not smoking
your cigar and it's a bit annoying
because all my visitors come
look at it and say who's that no one
recognizes you without the cigar
can you do one with a cigar so maybe
that was all part of employed to get
that exploding cigar
into his face that is interesting i
think it's interesting that they were so
close because
elliot was quite anti-semitic wasn't he
you know
yes we should mention that i think a lot
of his poems that before he became
famous do have
certain anti-semitic tropes to them and
that it was before second world war
and then obviously after the second
world war people realized that wait a
minute you can't really do this kind of
thing
but he never really properly backtracked
on it so
yeah well actually it was quite intense
i'm not sure they did like each other
that much
if you read the exchanges of letters
they're full of barbs so there was one
where when
mark sent elliot this photo elliot wrote
back saying i've hung that right next to
my photos of yates and paul valeri
you know in the pride of place and then
groucho wrote back to him saying
that's so weird because i've just read
an essay about you which named those
other two pictures
but there was a conspicuous absence um i
trust this was an oversight on the part
of the journalist
what a weird thing to write to someone
saying
in the article i know you didn't mention
a photo of me
yeah elliot's excuse was that he
said oh well your picture was a photo
and the other pictures were
drawings or paintings so maybe the um
writer had only noticed the paintings
and hadn't noticed
photographs and didn't want to talk
about photographs good excuse very good
excuse me i mean it's absolutely mad
that in the old days you had to write to
someone for a photo of them
can we just appreciate that as a really
stupid system
imagine how do you get a photo of
someone now again is it easier now
yeah google it google image and then
right click
yeah but when you've got a picture of
groucho marx on your wall with all the
other people you've met
you don't want one that you've taken off
google image do you
with getty images over the top of it
you should come and see my gallery wall
it's got a lot of a lot of lovely
watermarks on it
so many celebrity friends nicole
kidman's up there barack obama
uh shall we talk about his sex life why
are you always up for that yes
okay sure yeah um he it was very
difficult
i think is is the headline there
he was very awkward around women um he
had a lot of relationships in his life
and
until the end they were pretty much a
disaster um yeah
oh i was i was ready for the juicy stuff
james i didn't think it was just
okay he had bad relationships okay i was
just gonna set it up for someone else to
jump
in there but we've all got bad
relationships yeah
um his most famous relationship was with
vivian
and he told the wolves that he couldn't
imagine
shaving in her presence that's how
awkward the relationship was between
those two people this is virginia we
should say
not actual wolves that was confusing
sorry i just i should yeah he didn't
like dogs but he loved wolves
i thought i thought i pronounced the
word wolf with the obvious
it was so obvious that there was a
double o in there guys i heard the
f of wolves and that's what i was but i
think
the wolves it's probably she virginia
always
said i'm virginia woolf
so what did the wolves say about him
they said
oh that's interesting well he was part
of that bloomsby group wasn't he with
the wolves virginia
yeah and uh bertrand russell as well
with whom his wife had an affair
wait so what did virginia woolf say what
were you saying about what did the
wolves say
we need to know what the rules of the
day he said he said it to the wolves
he said i can't imagine shaving in my
wife's presence
and then the wolf said you really need
to make this house out of bricks
[Laughter]
he said he couldn't imagine shaving in
his wife yeah because he was so awkward
they got married really really quickly
but then they it was really obvious very
very quickly that they weren't
compatible one little bit
oh they slept in different rooms as well
that's another
well they tried to sleep in the same
room on their honeymoon as is
traditional
and it sounds awkward as is the theme so
they went on honeymoon in eastbourne
and she was on her period
and had an embarrassing accident
when you know they were trying to have
their honeymoon moment and they were
both so incredibly embarrassed
that he went and slept out on a deck
chair outside the hotel for the rest of
the week
and she trashed the hotel room because
she was in such a frenzy of
embarrassment and then she took the
sheets away with her because she didn't
want the hotel staff to see them but
then of course they just called their
home when they got back and said you've
stolen all of our bedding
which which sort of is more embarrassing
i think
oh dear but they did they did also i
think at that point of the honeymoon
the honeymoon was meant to be the debut
sex
fest because they hadn't had sex as far
as i could tell it seems that they got
married really quickly because um
i think he told ezra pound he said i
want to have sex and then
three months later he was married to her
so he obviously speaks first
yeah they should rebrand honeymoon
[Laughter]
where are you going on your um debut sex
fest oh
we're off to stay with the wolves
actually virginia will world said living
with vivian
who was quite mad living with vivian was
like having a bag of ferrets
hung around your neck she was very
trouble wasn't she and and you know i
think she was
was she sectioned at one point when he
was away and she spent the rest of her
life in a hospital
yes so um he went away to america didn't
he and then
his solicitors sent her a lesser saying
i want her separation
um rather than him saying it and then
when he went back to london she kind of
stalked him
and would go to his office and he would
always sneak out of the back door so
that she wouldn't see him
and then she would walk around london
with a knife it was like a rubber knife
so it's like a joke she was like i'm
trying to find my husband with this
rubber knife wait did she get it from
the same shop as the exploding cigars
smithies absolutely cleaned up on the
elliots didn't they
uh and then she joined the british union
of fascists
in the 1530s yes that's right and she
liked to wear the uniform in public
yeah because when you hear about the
early days of her life
particularly the university years
everyone sort of talked about her as
being very flamboyant she was a great
dancer she would always speak her mind
she smoked in public
which you wouldn't usually see women
doing she dressed like an actress
aldous huxley said that he really liked
hanging out with her because she was
vulgar it was
she was just so different she would say
what she thought and then you get to
this fascist period
where suddenly it seems like a totally
different character
in fact the last time she ever saw
elliot was at one of his book talks
where she went into the audience she
brought three books with her
and she brought her dog and he signed
her books for her
and then went off with someone else it's
the weirdest thing it's the last time
they ever saw each other
wow yeah but still you know she she got
her book signed
she got what she wanted yeah she
couldn't do the book site did she not
have just found his signature on the
internet printed it off and then stuck
it in her book
all right so you've seen my autograph
book too fine
she did she tried various ways to get
him back
so one of them seemed to be bringing
this dog to his book
chat which is a bad idea another one was
putting an advert out in the times the
1930s so she thought there was a sort of
a conspiracy to keep them apart by other
people and so she put an ad in the time
saying will t
s eliot please return to his home at 68
clarence gate gardens
which he abandoned on the september 17th
1932.
wow yeah um do you know
elliot himself was really secretive
about his correspondence
in fact the whole estate has been very
secretive since he died pretty much
um because his his widow was called
valerie he married
again much later so peter akrob was
trying to write a biography of him and
he was forbidden to quote from
any correspondence or unpublished work
and he was hardly allowed to quote even
actual
published poems of t.s eliot in this
biography of the man
eliot destroyed so much correspondence
that between 1905 and 1910 there was
just one postcard left
by him that's it that's all there is for
those five years
what does it say just dear mom really
sunny here
hope you will having a lovely debut sex
fest

okay on with the podcast on with the
show
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
james okay my fact this week is that in
2001 an
artist got lost in los angeles and
decided to make his own sign
to stop other people from getting lost
in future
not only did it remain unnoticed for
more than a year
but when the city was tipped off they
found that it met all
signage rules and they kept it in place
for eight years
it's so charming what was the sign
saying
it said five and the word
norse yeah so this was a sign to get off
a highway and get onto another highway
and basically
the signpost to tell you where to go was
really close to the ramp
and really there should have been one a
lot further back so whenever anyone
drove down the 110
and wanted to get onto the five they
would only realize at the last second
that they needed to be in a certain lane
and they would kind of swerve in front
of the cars and he was like well
it's just really dangerous so i'm gonna
put a five
maybe a mile further back or a half mile
further back
uh and he put it there and he did it in
broad daylight he just one day he just
got a load of ladders and just went up
there and did it
and it was there and no one noticed and
i think he tipped them off in the end
this
artist's name richard ankrom he tipped
off the city in the end
and they just kept it there and then
they decided we're making some new signs
now and we're gonna have to take this
down
but actually they put a new five where
his five was so they took his down and
they put a new one up there
so they kind of tacitly admitted that he
was right that it should have been there
he planned it for ages as well like he
he didn't just go in broad daylight just
dressed as he was
he he absolutely planned the whole thing
so he had his hair cut
i'm not sure why but he had his hair cut
he bought some work clothes he had a
hard hat he got an orange vest
the haircut must have been to fit inside
the hard hat maybe possibly yeah he had
a
job
and um he had his truck he did a thing
where as well as making the signage for
the actual sign itself he made signage
for the side of his truck to match the
caltrans which is california transports
the logos and so on to make it look like
he was part of them so he was properly
planned
and he's an artist isn't he and you can
tell because he clearly doesn't have a
nine-to-five job
he um called his piece guerrilla public
service
and i should just say that i got this
fact from a book
called the 99 invisible city a field
guide to the hidden world of everyday
design by roman mars
and it's a really awesome book based on
the 99 invisible podcast
and it's full of loads of awesome stuff
about the streets and you
you know if you read it then you walk
down the street you go you know why
that's there you know why that's there
you know
it's a really good one oh great he's
amazing roman mars yeah
it's so cool how people keep doing this
around the place and it's kind of
all these micro banksies but with
particular bug bears
so there is a thing currently going on
in sheffield where people are changing
north on street signs into queues and no
one really knows
why they're doing this oh yeah yeah so
there is a theory that it's to do with q
and
on i was wondering if it might be that
which is the insane conspiracy that the
usa is run by
satan worshiping child sacrificing
paedophiles
but i don't know why in sheffield people
will be changing street signs
this will get the word out so it may be
nothing to do with that
um one of the road-based public service
that people perform
which i think is very cool is in the
czech republic where
a group of czech nerds basically just
saved the government 18 million
dollars what and they did this because
there's this guy called thomas
vondrachek
and he is a businessman he runs some
tech businesses and
he found out that the country was about
to pay 80 million to switch their road
toll system to a digital system
and as someone who knows about coding
and programming and stuff he was really
pissed off he put a post on linkedin
saying
this is classic bureaucracy gone mad
this task is simple enough for a group
of programmers to do over a weekend
and he just put that on linkedin and the
prime minister got in touch i was like
well
is that true and would you mind doing it
and so
he was like all right i'll ask some
friends and he signed up 150 of his
programmer friends
and over 48 hours they got together and
redesigned the whole czech road system
and they got like meals brought to them
by members of the public
and that saved the country um speaking
of european
road stuff and road signs uh the big
story of this year
as we all know was the town of [ __ ]
um which is in where is the town of
austria
in austria yeah and they are sick and
tired of all the
[ __ ] tourists coming over and
stealing their road signs
right they're really they're [ __ ]
road signs they're [ __ ] roadsides
so they decided that they were gonna
change their name to
fogging um and they voted on it
and this has happened and the town of
[ __ ] is now called the town of
fugging
but it hasn't stopped the vandalism
because there's been a whole load of
more vandalism of people
changing the signs back to [ __ ]
vlogging is is objectively a funny
sounding word as well and it's quite
close to the original they should have
changed it to ghent or something
they can't change it's again there's
already all right
yeah something nicer vienna yeah exactly
piano thank you
in 2017 in china in the province of
zhang zhu
a man was arrested for repainting road
signs
in order to make his commute easier he
was really
annoyed being stuck in traffic in a lane
on the motorway
and he was caught on cctv painting big
white
paint arrows to redirect all the cars in
his lane into the lane next to it
to stop the traffic that's brilliant
but as if as if he would get out paint
it
get back in and then all the cars are
going whoa
i couldn't work out for a long when you
started saying this i couldn't look at
how you would
choose road signs to make your commute
easier because i thought he was putting
up directions for himself like this way
derek or whatever
i would love to do do you know that's
the thing that exists in los
angeles this is another thing i read in
that book so if you live in los angeles
you would know about this but i've never
heard of it before there are these road
signs rectangular yellow road signs that
just
turn up every now and then and they tend
to be a black arrow
with some letters above it and some
letters below and the letters below are
kind of the
inverse mirror image of the ones above
and what these are is their directions
to movie sets or to tv show
filming locations and when you're in la
and you're filming in some kind of
parking lot somewhere
you'll put these signs up so all the
techies will know where to go
all the actors will know where to go
stuff like this
and obviously the people in la know what
this is but
if you're a tourist and you're kind of
looking for celebrities and stuff you
just wouldn't know you just see this
sign and you think well it's just
nonsense
also it doesn't say batman or whatever
no but what they do
is they tend to put words that the
people in the know would know what it is
but the people who don't know what it is
wouldn't know what it was for instance
it would say magnus rex this way magnus
rex this way
and that was the batman reboot the dark
knight rises
so if you saw those signs you would know
to go to the dark knight rises
there were sites for rasputin so you
would think oh they're just doing some
low-budget russian movie but actually it
was for iron man 2. but that's so that's
got a russian baddie in it
so does it yeah yeah yeah does it so
that's a
very tricky clue yeah iron curtain man
brilliant isn't that absolutely yeah i
think that's what they actually tried
calling it yeah
well in ancient rome they used to have
names on road signs didn't they i think
i read this
that yeah you used to have if you had a
road sign whoever built the road would
have their name on it
so you could admire the work of this
particular person and then it would have
the name as well of the person who last
repaired it so a sort of update on
who to thank for the smoothness of the
these toilets were last checked by
signs yeah exactly
so this is kind of about you know street
art and artists
mucking around with things um so i just
thought i'd try and find out a little
bit about banksy
and i'm here to tell you who he is no i
don't know that but
there was a large theory that did the
rounds that it's neil buchanan
from art attack if you remember that
from your childhood
because he's very used to large outdoor
multimedia installations you know
there's lots of good circumstantial
evidence it got so bad this year
that he had to put at the top of his
website an announcement
saying neil buchanan is not banksy we
have been inundated with inquiries over
the weekend
this website does not have the
infrastructure to answer all these
inquiries individually
but we can confirm there is no truth in
the rumor whatsoever
that's exactly what banksy would say
it's new so um the museum of modern art
in new york has had a few of these over
the years um there was a guy called
harvey stromberg who in 1971 decided
he wanted an exhibition in moma but
obviously they wouldn't let him because
he wasn't very famous so what he did was
he went in every day
and he would take photos of a light
socket or of a tile on the floor
or of a brick on the wall he would go
home he would print it out on his
printer
and then he would go in and stick it
over the exact place
where you've taken the photo from so
like a load of them and never found them
for years and years and years
whenever he put one on the floor they
would find it on the same day because
they had those kind of buffing machines
that would go around
and clean the floor and they would find
them but there were some that were just
over a brick on the wall which they
didn't find for decades
i'm going to start doing that in my
house to broken bits of wallpaper
and you know rusting bath handles just
take a photo of a nice bit of wallpaper
stick it over um have you guys read
about the grammar vigilantes
no these so these are people who
go around correcting signposts they seem
to happen in various countries
in bristol bristol has the uk's leading
grammar vigilante
and he specializes in apostrophes he
began in 2003
it's when he saw a council sign which
said open mondays to fridays but with
apostrophes
in both of those words which obviously
is a painful experience and so
he invented something called the
apostrophizer which
is an eight foot long tool which
basically
has an apostrophe stamp on the end so
that he can reach the really high
signs and insert the apostrophe and he
doesn't like to do damage so he built
his own specially made step ladder so it
doesn't have to be lent up against
shops how much damage is he doing with a
normal stepladder
you're using the stepladder wrong if
every time you take it away from the
building
bricks fall out of it
he's not a stepladder pro um i've got a
couple things just on
signs okay general signs so firstly
i found it quite amazing that signs
played quite an important role
during world war ii in the uk in that
there was a message that went round to a
lot of people to remove the signs
so that if any germans were coming over
they'd be confused and have no idea
where to go
so they were people encouraged us to
take them down and
people would arrive not know where
they're going but on the flip side there
was also a movement by
hitler to change signs around so you
would send people to the
apparently that's a thing that was
attempted i don't know how successful it
was
so it must have just been very confusing
that's amazing if you are a hitler and
you've got
spies on the ground during the second
world war i would definitely want to
know about troop movements
and the state of the country's defense
is more than misdirecting people to
their local church
or whatever the signs are for getting a
commuter lost on his way home for tea
well this is why they lost the war andy
they definitely it was definitely a sign
of resistance in norway when the
fascist took over norway a very subtle
sign of resistance was apparently
you often gave nazis incorrect
directions when they asked the way for
somewhere that was a signal that you're
on the good guys side
and they can't find their way back to
you because they're lost so that's
actually pretty effective
yeah have you ever given someone wrong
directions in london for instance like a
tourist
and then realized afterwards that you've
done it you didn't do it on purpose
and then you realized you think oh [ __ ]
i've just sent them to the wrong
place that is one of the worst feelings
in the world isn't it
it's bad but if you suspect that they're
a foreign spy
then it's actually patriotic things yeah
yeah they were a leftover nazi
still plugging away 80 years
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
andy my fact is that king edward iii
owned a yeti mask
[Laughter]
okay so i've said yeti mask there is a
creature in english mythology which i
think is kind of close
sort of analogous to the ethic basically
these were things called woad woeses
and they were wild men who lived in the
woods they were big
they were not civilized they were
covered in hair
they weren't really human from all the
depictions of them they crop up a lot of
medieval manuscripts and things like
that
normally kind of trying to carry women
off and then a knight has to turn up and
save the day and kill the woes
and in edward iii's accounts they have
these wardrobe accounts which list
everything that the king bought from
1348 a.d there
is capita de woods which is the head
of a worldwide in fact before it there
is xiv which is
14 of roman numerals i don't think that
means he bought 14
i really hope it was could be yeah it
was that yeah
so this is the word was he um he really
liked
he's from the 14th century edward iii
right um he really enjoyed doing like
tournaments and jousts and stuff like
that
and according to one paper i read so
this is by a guy called a chester beatty
who is like an
american billionaire who became a
historian he reckons that edward might
have used the mask
for one of his christmas tournaments so
that maybe people would be jousting with
a world wars
so it might have been like you know like
the masked singer where people are kind
of
jousting but they're in masks and stuff
because there was also a capita
elephantum
a capita virginum a capital leonam and a
capita signorum so
in his wardrobe he had an elephant head
a virgin's head
a lion's head and a swan's head so
this fight between several wild animals
how can you tell the virgin's head i
mean the hymen is not on the head
what's gonna give it away or just on
edward's royal wardrobe
he did have pretty lavish taste so this
might be the same year as the
word was a costume but in 1337-38
the clerk of his wardrobe ordered these
huge amounts of like cloth and yarn and
a full
bull's hides and loads of gold leaf and
also 86 plain masks and 12 masks with
long bids
and this was preparation for the kings
games which they had every year
and along with that they built an entire
fake forest
so out of timber and paint and
everything a massive fake forest
and then they made loads of linen
baboons and
they sort of dropped all these linen
baboons into the forest
and they sewed the baboons into tunics
with sort of pearls and hoes and gloves
and caps on them and everything
so they were wearing the proper gear
because they're in the royal household
and then i guess they galloped through
the fake forest and hunted down linen
baboons oh my
god that sounds amazing a lot of this
was because
um so edward was married to philippa of
haynolt
right and they were very young when they
got married and so there was a regency
period where
um isabella was looking after the
country
who was edward's mother right isabella
so
isabella kept philippa and edward in
real punery like she wouldn't give them
much money to do anything
they they kind of had to live their life
almost not as normal people but as
normal rich people
but then when they became king and queen
proper
they just really went for it and
philippa of hanel just spent
so much money on all these incredibly
lavish
clothes and jewels and by 1360
um they owed about 16 000 pounds to
various different
clothing embroiderers and tailors and
ferriers
and that's a couple of million pounds in
today's turns that they owed to these
people
and i was reading about like one robe
that she had which required
952 ventras and i didn't know what
adventure was
apparently it's the fur that you get
from the belly of a red squirrel
so they had to get 952 squirrels
for this one robe it's like whoa
is the whole blaming the grey squirrels
thing were they a scapegoat that these
guys created because they actually
caused red squirrels to go almost
extinct
maybe uh he really went bust later on he
had edward iii had to pawn off the crown
jewels
so that he could raise money he didn't
have a yeah
a but he pawned off the great crown of
england to simon de mirabello
wow just one thing that he did own
um which is quite similar to something
that dan owns is he had a yeti mug
in as much and as much as he had a
silver cup that was decorated with
wodawos's
so if we're saying that those are yetis
then um he had
the other yeti i guess i think dan will
pro dan
you've been keeping a very polite
diplomatic silence about whether they're
yetis or not i'm pretty sure dan thinks
they're not yetis
but they absolutely aren't yet easy it's
a completely different species
completely different species um before
before we get into
uh me absolutely ripping andy over that
um just sticking on edward the third for
a second he's an interesting character
that i hadn't heard of him as a king i
have to say again i'm not british so
he's very far back but you've heard of
you know ed was the
fifth and sixth presumably you knew that
a third must have happened before that
yeah i've got all the other in the
trilogy of edwards
but i i've not seen that one
unfortunately no it went downhill
actually
yeah so it's interesting in that all of
us
are probably related to him he's one of
those guys where they've done a few
reports where they say there's a 99
chance that if you are of british origin
if you were born
and your family was through this period
you were directly related to him
so all of us are his great great great
great grandchildren
but also he created something that still
goes on today which is also connected to
clothing which is
the chivalry knights of the garter and
the garter itself is literally a gator
which
you would wear there's a story that he
was at some
dance and he was dancing with the
countess of salisbury
and the garter and this this is one of
the stories there's many stories but the
story is is that
the garter slipped down her leg and
everyone started laughing but he got
very furious and he yelled shame on him
who thinks ill of it
about the situation and he kept the
garter
and that is the motto of the knights of
the garter shame on him who thinks ill
of it in latin
and that is a garter that became the
code for these knights which is a thing
still going on today in fact there's
over a thousand nights of the garden now
the thousandth of which was prince
william
which is a very convenient number to
land on yeah yeah
who had to fill in those last twenty was
that that's like the folks wandering
past
do you think that they rushed through a
load to get to a thousand dollars do you
think a lot of people weren't allowed to
become for like 30 years
yeah interestingly it's the two princes
it's andrew and edward
and then it's meant to be william next
but they just slipped in an mp
in between so there's one guy just
taking up 999.
possibly at nine nine nine
anyway wood wassers andy you [ __ ]
idiot
they are yetis then they're the british
yeti
and this is okay this is the real thing
i think they may have a
a kind of relationship with real history
in that obviously they're mythical these
word-wisers they're you know they're not
they don't exist but after the norman
conquest
you did for for many years you got gangs
of wild men living savage
in the woods the swamps they were social
outcasts they were criminalized
so that is a possible origin point for
this story you know sort of wild man
living in the woods
there are lots of medieval churches
which have word roses in their stones
and so there's this weird
kind of relationship between local myth
and
you know newer christian traditions that
kind of well even
even great scientific minds actually for
a while thought
that these were real and they didn't
think it was a separate species they
thought it was a
someone as you say went wild became wild
had children that were wild and they
grew up as a sort of
sub-species that knew nothing but the
wild
in fact the person who gave us the name
homo sapiens
he had linnaeus that was lenaeus who did
that and one of the categories was homo
ferrous
which was these wild people and he was
convinced and that's been dropped since
we don't talk about his homo ferrous
group
um there's a few but he believed that
there were wolf boys of feral children
that were abandoned by lost parents and
subsequently raised by wolves that's the
actual wolves not virginia wolves family
and and there's lots of legends like
romulus
in rome and remus who were suckled by a
she-wolf
and there was a belief that they sort of
naturally grew hair i think in the
forest to protect themselves because
they were living the elements wasn't
there
that's right i quite like that romulus
and remus were suckled by a she-wolf
because
edward iii who wore a word woose was
suckled by a she-wolf as well
no he wasn't was he yeah that's what his
mother was known as the she-wolf
oh very fair leather switcheroo these
tenuous
links to animal themes oh that was a
great one dan don't let them
don't let them do it t.s eliot would
have rejected that for publication
you know um woe dwells is uh and wild
men and stuff like that are in one
very famous historical poem seeing as we
were talking about t.s eliot
and that is the 14th century romance
poem sir gawain and the green knight
and according to that poem the word was
in the uk they live on the world
peninsula which is just outside
liverpool
according to this poem in the wilderness
of world dwelt there but few
that god or man with good heart loved
and it was basically this was such a
wild west wooded crazy area that this is
where you would get these wild men
living
if there is a little known fact that if
the beatles didn't shave meticulously
every day
they would be covered
the other stuff that gawain fights in
grain and the green knight
is quite odd so the green knight himself
is a kind of
wodawoza in the like tolkien does a
translation where he translates the
green as being a word a word
and they were often green men as well
were another mythical
wild man um but gawain also fights
in that chevalric myth um worms
which are dragons dragons were called
worms
really i think that's that's a huge
promotion we've given dragons that they
were worms
they thought worms wolves and wood was
and the reason i'm saying it weirdly is
because every time it's spelled it's
spelled differently so you can say word
a word a word a word
waza any way you like it is weird isn't
it and one of the spelling
is um waterhouse which is where
pg woodhouse gets his name sat it's
amazing
oh yeah dj woodhouse has descended from
yetis
dad do you agree with that i do but for
different theories
um you guys know you do remember john
falstaff we've mentioned him before
a friend of the podcast yeah he was
maybe the inspiration for full staff
he was and he was there at the um battle
of asian car and stuff
came into paris and all that kind of
stuff yeah he had a big old tapestry
with uh word woes in his hall yeah so
they were big well you also said they
appeared quite a lot in
architecture and cathedrals and stuff
one example of where word was or in fact
green men the sort of descendant of
wudawaza appears is norwich cathedral
and that is because they were very
common in roof bosses
which we know a lot about because they
featured heavily in our last year's book
book of the year 2019.
and that's why if you remember in
norwich cathedral they erected
a helter skelter that you could climb up
last year
so you could get a better view of the
roof bosses and i mentioned it because i
love that reverend
who was the guy who decided to put the
slide in
and he was inspired when he visited the
sistine chapel and the thing he thought
as he looked over the ceiling of the
sistine chapel
was that norwich cathedral's decorations
were every bit as wonderful but just too
high up to be appreciated
yes sistine chapel they have
take they recently because it's such a
pain to look up constantly you get a
kind of crick in your neck
if you're in there and you always have
to look you know crane your neck up
so they i think have just installed
swings so that
um you get a really good
[Laughter]
i was with you for so much of that
stop the poker stop the podcast just
wanted to let you know that we are
sponsored this week
by yext that's right yext is a company
which provides powerful proper search
engines for your company's website
and the thing is that so many companies
uh don't have
decent search engines on their own
website most business websites can't
even answer 50
of the top questions people ask about
them on search engines so
if you've got customers or clients or
whoever it is on your website you want
to keep them there
the way to do that is to have a really
good search engine so they don't just
ping off
to another search engine where they'll
be served a load of adverts for other
companies
that you don't want them to see exactly
if
you've running a beer company and people
are looking for a certain type of beer
on your site
you don't want carlsberg coming up as
the first first result of your search
engine that just drives them away
unless you're on carlsberg in which case
you absolutely do want that the point is
next offers a really good powerful
search engine for your website

on with the podcast on with the show
[Music]
okay it's time for our final fact of the
show and that
is anne my fact this week is that
there's a single
termite home in brazil that's the same
size as
great britain my house is astonishing
big home it's not i don't know yeah i do
i've got a preamble
james okay
right i want to say it no stop it shut
your mouth
it's not a single termite it's a single
home
but it is more than one termite living
there
since the kids have left were rattling
around the place
it's the size of great britain and i'm
the size of a grain of rice
the bedroom tax has taken its toll on
these termites
this is just incredible it was only
confirmed a couple of years ago only
sort of discovered a couple of years ago
when they've been clearing this pasture
in brazil for agriculture and stuff for
20 or 30 years
and people started noticing there were a
lot of mounds around
and eventually 2018 someone decided to
do a proper study of it and survey of it
they realize there are 200 million
termite mounds
these piles of excavated termite spread
across something the size of great
britain
um so all across brazil and no one had
really noticed before
then the people who lived there knew
that there were these termite mounds
kind of
scattered about it wasn't that a
scientist came along and he went what
are these massive mountains doing they
went what oh my god
it wasn't quite that uh because their
timer mines are quite
solid they would just build their houses
around them wouldn't they they would you
know they'd be in your garden and you'd
like turn it into a barbecue or
something or yeah
you could put a slide down it for their
kids yes it's amazing as well isn't it
because it's a single
termite species that's been working on
this and
the amount of so they've looked into the
amount of soil that they've managed to
excavate
that sits on top of the earth and they
say that it's equivalent to 4 000 great
pyramids of giza
it's the amount that they've managed in
all these years it's amazing
it's extraordinary some of them some of
them are as old as
the pyramids so all of these are at
least 700 years old give or take a few
years
and they're up to 3800 years old and
that's just from
the 11 that they've properly studied the
age of so far so some of them could be
way older than that but that is
roughly the age of a lot of pyramids
yeah now they've said it that's actually
the minimum
estimate of their um range and it's like
4 000 years old is the minimum it might
be twice as old as that
from what they've studied so far and
like you say it is one family because
they thought that it must be
lots of different species of termites
that are rivals
but they took a bunch of termites from
one pile of dirt and then put them with
a bunch of termites from another
and you'd expect them to always fight
and they got along like
well like family like a happy family and
so that and they basically proved that
this is just one home
one family do you know how they um found
out how old they are
this is quite cool what they did was
they dug into the bottom of one of these
piles of earth and they took out a
little bit of earth
and there's a technique which is really
complicated so i won't go into it but
you can kind of fire
lasers at this earth and like look at
what happens to the electrons
and you work out the last time that it
was exposed to sunlight
so they can just work it's so clever
it's like carbon dating but
for things that have not been alive and
you just fire your little lasers at it
and it'll tell you
when the last time it was in the sun
we're so clever we're here talking about
how clever these termites are but look
at us
i mean kicking ass when we say we it is
the scientist because
when i say it's complicated i don't want
to go into it partly it's because i
don't really understand it
we can take credit i bet there were just
two termite architects that built this
whole thing but the rest of the termites
are going god we're impressive aren't we
that's right yeah you take credit for
your species but they're not even um
they're not even proper mounds like
other termites build so some termites
build
sort of chimneys or ventilation things
these were just described by the
scientists who worked on this project as
slag piles
because they live underground all it is
is they're making space for their
chambers underground so they make a
vertical hole to the surface
and then they just chuck the soil out of
those holes and over time that builds up
into
however tall these are two meters two
and a half meters i mean imagine what's
underground
this huge cathedral space that they've
emptied out
yeah and they were first discovered by a
few scientists but one in particular a
guy called stephen martin who's an
entomologist at the university of
salford
and he doesn't even care about termites
he is an expert in giant killer hornets
the things that actually we should just
call giant hornets these days just big
old hornets we're not supposed to
horn it's murder so i'm not supposed to
say that but he's an expert in those
guys
and um he was in brazil looking for some
bees
because he wanted to see how the bees
were getting on in in brazil
and then as he was going down the road
he was like wait a minute what are those
what are those things and why are they
so regular and why are they in like a
pattern
and that was when they worked out that
it was all this same
species actually it's worth saying i
don't know if this has been mentioned or
even if it's assumed by the listener but
they're still building these mounds this
is an active house
it's not it's not dead it's not like a
fossilized old abandoned
great britain it's it's an active thing
great britain sorry not enough
i'm so termites so termites are pretty
incredible and possibly the most
incredible termite is the queen
so they've got a queen based structure
like bees and other species
and england and england and much like in
england
the termite queen is the only fertile
member and
so she is super fertile
the termite i mean and she basically
spends her entire life incessantly
mating so
she chooses a male to mate with and then
she spends the subsequent 15 to 20
sometimes years
constantly shagging him and she'll make
one egg every three seconds so in her
lifetime she makes over a quarter of a
billion eggs
constantly producing them is there a
king termite that produces all the yeah
there's a king termite and he's what's
quite funny about them is that she's
about 100 times bigger than his and than
anyone else in the colony
so he's this microscopic thing she's
next to him and the reason she's so
large is because she is one
giant ovary and do please look on
youtube
at a picture of a queen termite with
eggs inside her so
she's like this big pulsating
transparent
lump that's full of eggs and you can see
the eggs bubbling
and moving around inside her under her
surface
and yeah she and she can't move so it's
awful being the queen
because you're stuck she can't fit out
the door of her enclosure anymore
she can't move at all so she depends
totally on members of her colony to wash
her to feed her
to lick this weird sweat off her she's
just started
is this still the termite queen we're
talking about i'm just gonna leave that
ambiguous
scandal but the door the door thing
seems to be a bit of a mystery because
if you've got a house the size of great
britain you'd think you could make the
doors a bit bigger to fit your leader
out of
what's going on there such a good point
termites usually have quite small doors
they have like termite sized doors
indeed she doesn't want
she doesn't want to go anywhere either i
mean she can't attach to this huge body
of
her legs are tiny compared with the
breeding mass of her
yeah if you gave her a big door it would
actually just be horrifying for her
knowing she couldn't even get through it
because she can't move
so ah so they're tricking her they're
basically saying oh you could go
everywhere but ah the doors are too
small
what a shame but she never knows the
door thing is quite important in
termites because
um a lot of them can't really defend
themselves very well
they can do a little bit of squirting
horrible stuff out of their anus but
there's not really much they can
do if they're attacked and so usually
what they'll do
is like a few different insects they'll
come back into their door and then use
their head
as a block to stop anything else from
coming into the door
and so basically then anything coming in
will have to get past that one door head
and then another door head would go into
their place and then that stops anyone
from getting into their tunnels
and that is interesting as well because
in 2018
in japan they found the first all-female
termite colonies
where all of the termites usually you
would have kings and you would have lots
of
male soldiers and stuff like that and
male workers
but this one is all females and the
reason that they think it works
is that their males are lots of
different sizes but the females are all
exactly the same size
and so they can have a head which will
exactly fit in the door
every single time and you're not
sometimes going to have someone whose
head's a bit too big or a bit too small
and so by just having females in this
colony
it means that they have less chance of
being attacked which makes up for the
lack of genetic change that you kind of
need males and females for so that's
kind of interesting
nice that's really cool like they're
they're the ikea door blockers you know
it's just like made to
very basic specifications it's all the
same
it's gonna fit together we do take
advice from termites on building these
days
so they are particularly good at
ventilation
which is something that we are quite bad
at because the
amount that ventilation costs the
atmosphere and greenhouse gas emissions
etc is so
massive so we're now building buildings
that inspired by their ventilation
systems there's this place in zimbabwe
which is was the first massive building
it's a big shopping center
called the eastgate center and office
block inspired by termite systems
and what they do is they have this
system of opening and closing doors that
they're constantly tending to to make
sure that air comes in the right places
moves up through the termite mound so
that it's heated in the right places
it's cooled in the right places
because it needs to be a one precise
temperature the whole time
on the inside for them to be able to
survive so
yeah and they make the reason that they
work so well as the termite
mounds catch the wind so it blows
through them so so a mound is like a
lung
and the wind comes in to them and then
is absorbed by the various
bits the cells that need it this one
goes out if you want to go into this
shopping center there's a security guard
with his head blocking the door
yeah always female it
yeah that's amazing and another good
thing because they're ventilated so well
they make really good ovens
so in south africa you'll get people
where
they'll take a termite mound and they'll
kind of drill a little hole
make the door a little bit bigger
hopefully it's a termite mound where all
the timeouts out there anymore i hope
but they'll set a little fire inside and
then the air will be sucked in through
the door
and then go up through the top of the
termite mound because they're so well
ventilated
brilliant and it means that you can cook
like pizza in there or you know cut
anything that needs a high temperature
you cook in there do they warn the
termites like a demolition or do they
put a sign up saying in three weeks time
this will be turned into an oven please
vacate your home
i'm just hoping that they're old ones
you don't have the ashes of termites
on your pizza as you're taking it out of
the oven
maybe it's a delicacy well they do that
people do eat termites don't they
they're they're infused into muffins
in certain countries yeah so it's it's
possible that
yeah termite pizza is a thing oh yeah do
you know how they uh transfer
water across their mounds so sometimes a
bit of the mound gets really dry and it
needs
it needs moistening lubrication this is
so cool they drink
half their body weight in water they go
to a dry part of the mound and then they
pass it into another termite's mouth
it's basically inhabited all the water
yeah yeah and there's a scientist called
j scott turner who fed them
fluorescent dyed water and could see it
moving from one termite to another so
basically it's like
it's as if a bucket chain to put out a
fire was people
just you know pushing the water into
each other's mouths
friendly is it it's not very covert
friendly but it would make firefighting
a much sexier profession than it already
is
is it wait so is it to make sure that
yeah i think it would make it a much
less effective profession
because every time you would swallow a
little bit of the water and by the time
it got to the final fiber it would just
be a little dribble
coming out as well you'd obviously hire
people with enormous mouths
to hold as much water as they could so
the physical profile of the firefighter
might change
yeah i'm not suggesting a change in the
system i'm sorry i just like to clarify
is this you just as you see your house
being broke down why not at least have
something sexy to look at
while you're watching your life get
destroyed i get it i get that
um is this to moisten the other side
then or is this to give a drink to the
people on the other side
it's to moisten the other side so it's
sort of it's but they then go and you
know spit the water out on the
on the actual mound itself that's
incredible yeah
they never sleep as well termites don't
sleep really
yeah they're just building 24 hours a
day until they die do they rest
do they have like a nap or not even i
mean
yeah down time exactly yeah they might
play the xbox for a little while
in fact i think i've read that they they
normally like dan says they're just
all all active but if they run out of
holes to fill
they just stand around touching each
other's antennae so that might be their
equivalent of
down time well the queen rests a lot
rests her entire life
and then her life ends really tragically
because her children lick her to death
it's she sort of she dies in the same
sort of tragic way that she lives
she stops being useful stops laying eggs
and so kids like lick and lick and lick
her
drawing all the fat and fluids out of
her and she just disintegrates away
god yeah that's another sexy image for
you

=356
[Music]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with anna tashinsky
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again we have
gathered around our microphones with our
four favorite facts from the last seven
days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with fact number one and that's
my fact this week my fact is
whenever jfk flew in air force one he
was sat
in a rocking chair wow that's clever
is it so if there's any turbulence you
don't feel it because you just rock
really good point did you have a did he
have a special porch constructed
inside air force one which he could put
his rocking chair on
that would be a great look no this was
um what's surprising that he had a
rocking chair on a plane you'd think
that's not very safe
well also i would think you know what's
really annoying for a lot of people on
planes
is when the person in front of you kind
of leans back what if they were
constantly leaning back and leaning
forward and leaning back for the whole
flight
yeah you're right that would be terrible
but also you'd be walloping your head
into the front of the chair in front you
would have to
basically everyone in the plane would
have to be in sync
and going forward and backwards at the
same time wouldn't they
yeah well that's apparently a thing that
does happen but maybe we'll get to that
later
so um oh wow wow yeah fact
tantalising so uh jfk
um the reason he had a rocking chair is
because he had back problems big back
problems
and this was a result of his years in
the war he developed these problems and
so a physician called janet
travell in 1955 said to him why you do
some swimming but also
why don't you try a rocking chair and he
tried it and he loved it so much that he
had it everywhere he got this one
rocking chair
which he had in the oval office he had
it at his home he gave it to
friends he had about 12 of them and one
of them
was put on board air force one and so
anytime he was flying anywhere
that's what he would be standing cool
do we know if it was rooted into the
ground or was it slipping all over the
airplane and also could he get a seat
belt on it
i've got a lot of questions about how
this i know i i had those questions too
and i'm afraid
there's very scant detail of of the uh i
guess you know that's that's sort of
um you know need to know basis
information
maybe you had a normal seat for takeoff
a landing and then went on to it for
that that makes sense
i would have thought takeoff is the
crucial moment when you won it and you
can really
because you tip right back wouldn't you
yeah you want it i guess you're on a
hamster wheel really don't you for the
take i do
yeah you don't want the president to
flip on take off
um these are a specific kind of rocket
aren't they the thing called the kennedy
rocker
that he didn't pick out because of the
name they're named after him this
specific model of chair
but the really cool thing is there are
now about 40 airports
in the usa which have rocking chairs in
them just in the terminal buildings and
you know looking out over the planes and
the tarmac and all of this and this is a
huge trend and it's it only started in
the late 90s when there was an
exhibition at
uh charlotte douglas international
airport uh they had an exhibition called
porch sitting and there were loads of
rocking chairs and then at the end of
the exhibition they removed them and
people said what are you doing we like
those we love sitting in those chairs so
now
they've spread across america and
they're just everywhere and those are
kennedy rockers
exactly yeah they're known as well
that's the nickname they're carolina
rockers
and um yeah they they're perfect because
they mean that you can just move them
wherever you need to
so if you just need to clean up and um
just very good for putting near a wall
near an x
near a um wall plug for travelers so
yeah they love it
is it what do you say you can move them
wherever you need is that
as opposed to normal chairs yeah most
chairs and airports aren't
movable they're stuck to the ground
aren't they yeah
oh well i can't believe they don't get
stolen all the time yeah but you're not
gonna be able to sneak that onto a plane
there you anna
how are you gonna you're not gonna be
able to get it underneath the seat in
front are you
his back problems were terrible hadn't
realized what a horrible
painful life he had and
um it's weird that he was recommended
swimming since it seems to be
excessive swimming that might have made
them a lot worse in the first place
oh really wasn't it so he got he he was
a really sickly president a lot of
people say he's the sickest president
not in a cool way that they've ever had
really yeah um there's a there's been a
bunch of studies done on his health
recently and he was always in and out of
hospitals i mean who was it
who was it who was in an actual
wheelchair and had a screening yeah
yeah yeah and who was the one who died
like two days after
yeah he died after a month
was he the sickest maybe i don't know if
that's an illness you didn't say oh god
i've just been diagnosed with having
been
shot in the face he wasn't shy he died
of a chill
he he has inauguration without wearing a
hat
that's a good point all right well
that's true that's a new illness not
long lasting
yeah i guess these neuroscientists
haven't read up on all the histories of
president's health
but he was sickly and he had this
terrible back which was made worse when
he
fought in the war which he shouldn't
have because he didn't pass the health
test because of his health problems
but his dad pulled some strings and in
1943 he was in the navy
and his boat was struck by a japanese
destroyer
and so it sank and the crew had to swim
for
almost six kilometers in order to get to
dry land and not only that but
he swam while towing an injured crew
member with him
between his teeth so he got hold of his
life jacket and towed him between his
teeth
for six kilometers and then the
subsequent days he had to keep swimming
from island to island until they were
rescued
and they believe that made his back
significantly worse well it would
you would have thought so it seemed like
a bit of a sick joke that the doctor
then said have you tried swimming
to fix it that's really good that doctor
though
jeanette travell what i like about her
is she basically invented deep heat
you know that um stuff that when you're
playing football
for me and other people doing other
sports like you put it on and it kind of
heats the inside of you and it
supposedly makes you feel better if
you've had a bit of a knock
well a lot of her research was about
using
these vapor coolant sprays to relieve
pain
and that's basically what the peter's
today so she did that what is it what is
it
deep heat well it makes it burn so much
there's one that i have which is
use capsaicin i don't know if that's
deep heat oh
yeah but i think they use different
chemicals but yeah
okay right that's cool so if you're out
of deep you could just rub some fresh
chili into the
affected area let's say
you know see your doctor first is what
i'm saying
i don't know yeah
i actually think anna you say the
swimming was the bad bit of advice i
think the prescription of a rocking
chair
was the worst bit of advice because
rocking chairs seem to
be more dangerous to presidents than
anything i can see
so how many presidents how many
presidents
again i think there's a slight history
issue here
more dangerous than assassinators for
instance
well how many how many presidents have
been assassinated four
right yeah four three of the four are
are very closely tied to rocking chairs
so
john f kennedy the last chair that he
sat in prior to that car chair was on
air force one he was in his rocking
chair that was the last thing that he
was on and he loved his rocking chair
william mckinley another assassinated
president he campaigned the whole time
in his wicker rocking chair
out on his front porch that's where he
did all of his of his pitching to be
president
and abraham lincoln was sitting in a
rocking chair when he was assassinated
what the theater yeah in ford theater he
was sitting in a rocking chair so three
of the four presidents that have been
assassinated have very close ties to
rocking chairs and i think that's
something we've not been reporting on as
a society
james garfield was actually on his way
to open a rocking chair factory
you know you can visit if you want and
if you happen to be in michigan
the lincoln rocking chair and you can
still see a dark spot
on the back of it which i think people
like to believe is blood from when he
was shot
but it's actually i think more
disgustingly the hair oil
from people repeatedly sitting in it in
the early 1800s
so dan what was it you were saying
before about um
you gave us a tease or something at the
start didn't you oh that's right
yes um there's a report that i briefly
scanned
so i'm afraid no further details are the
top headline here but when
people in rocking chairs see each other
rocking next to each other they will
naturally sink the rock they will make
the rock
go with the same rhythm um and i think
we do that on
bridges and so on i've heard yes okay so
one of the reasons
[Laughter]
i did read the paper done and i read a
few papers about this because it is
really interesting
and it's basically like exactly like you
say apart from the bridge part
which i have literally no idea what
you're talking about but yeah if you put
two people in a room together with two
rocking chairs they will
move in sync and we're not quite sure
why they do it but there are some clues
um and we think it's probably that
you're seeing someone else do it and
it's like the visual clues
and you're subconsciously trying to get
in sync with someone else because you're
empathetic with them
and one reason we think that is because
actually if you get
autistic children they don't do it so if
you get an autistic child
and a non-autistic child in a room and
they're both sat on
rocking chairs the autistic child will
not go in sync with the other child
yeah kind of interesting isn't it it's
like when you walk in sync with someone
you know when you're walking down the
street with a friend and then you
realize you're walking like a boy band
or something
that's right it's just natural and if
you do that on a bridge it can cause
bridges to collapse
oh that's the issue did you guys read
about the world's largest rocking
chair no no it's um it's big
i mean there have been a few world's
largest rocking chairs there's one
called big
john um these are all in the states by
the way that was 32 feet tall got the
guinness world record very exciting
that got blown out of the water by a 42
foot tall one in fanning missouri
um which had to be welded to the ground
because it was so clearly dangerous
so that means it's not rocking no
exactly
it's controversy but anyway neither of
those is now the world's largest rocking
chair because in 2015
a place called casey illinois built a 56
foot tall rocking chair
and so the others have had to rename
themselves the former world's largest
rocking chair
and does that one rock do you know i
think the kc1 does rock and
the casey one is kate have you heard of
casey illinois
you know we're like i have actually i
don't know why though i bet you
you've probably been there james because
it's also home to the world's biggest
wind chime biggest wooden shoes
biggest knitting needles and a 200 kilo
pencil their entire tourist economy is
based on having quite big things and
it's worked they used to be really
the town used to be really broke and now
they've got big things and they get
tourists it genuinely works
i've always thought because obviously
america has lots of these places all
over it that if aliens did come to
our earth after it's been depopulated
they'd think that america was populated
by
giants there was a species of giants
that lived in peace alongside the humans
and then also whenever they come to the
uk and we have all our model villages
they'll think that
we are all type of people
[Laughter]
i'm speaking of america have you heard
about the 1901 rocking chair riots
no yes i have what a story so
this was all the fault of this guy
called oscar spate
and he was like a wheeler dealer wanted
to make some money decided to
move some rocking chairs into central
park place them all over it so it was
central to madison park in fact
placed them everywhere but the moment
people sat in one
he installed henchman just sort of
hiding out of sight
who would leap in front of you and say
that'll be five cents please
or three cents for the less comfortable
ones okay and
people didn't like that and they the
more they complained the more he
installed more
and eventually it got out of hand when
there was this heat wave someone who was
feeling a bit faint
sat in one of his rocking chairs and he
got yanked out from underneath him by
one of this bloke's henchmen called
thomas tully
and a massive crowd chased thomas tully
through central park and into a hotel
shouting lynch him lynch him he had to
run upstairs in the hotel and lock
himself in one of the rooms until they'd
gone away
and then this mob marched on the streets
of new york
saying you know get rid of the chairs
sort of smashing rocking chairs all over
the place
singing the marseilles there's big stuff
one of the problems was that they
removed
all of the normal seats uh on this
really hot weekend they'd removed all
the normal seats for repairs on the same
day
so what was left was his rocking jazz
and so that's when it all kicked off
but they did try it for a bit afterwards
uh and there was one worker who tried to
collect some fees but was stabbed
by an elderly woman with a hat pin
um and then he thought okay well what
i'm going to do is i still want to do
this because it's a good business idea
and he got the idea from europe you know
like if you go to parks in london you
might find there are a deck chair
yeah yeah he thought i'm still gonna go
with this
and so he thought well i'm gonna get all
my chairs in one little corner
and then i'm gonna hire them out to
people right and then we won't have the
problem of people accidentally sitting
in there and us
saying five cents please uh and he did
that but then basically as soon as they
saw that
all the unlockers started throwing
stones at him and just
like tried to get him out of the park
and eventually he had to give up
but the park commissioner the head of
the park commissioner who was called
george c claussen who had kind of said
yes to the thing in the first place
said okay this is kind of all my fault
so he bought all the rocking chairs off
this guy's spate
and he put them in the park and um wrote
in massive letters free
on them and so people were allowed to
sit on them for free from then on
that's weird because that would make me
think i could just take the chair yeah
yeah we've already established that that
you're a massive rocking chair thief
yeah i just got a perfect spot the
corner of my bedroom
it needs a rocking chair
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hey dan you know how everyone's doing a
lot of binge watching at the moment have
you ever considered
binge learning well you've suggested
that i should try it out uh
a lot actually over the last six years
but no not done it yet
well if you do want to take my advice
and do some binge learning
then you can do that by going to the

website an app where they have
all sorts of courses and from top
experts in their fields
they can teach you almost anything yeah
it is an incredible site one that i'm
really excited to get into is called how
great science fiction works
and it's just a total history yeah it's
a total history about science fiction so
the first episode is
mary shelley and the birth of science
fiction you've got utopian dreams and
dystopian nightmares
it's just fascinating stuff yeah i was
just looking at some health ones
and i thought these might be quite good
for you dan because i know that you're
into your
karate and judo and things but you can
go to
a tai chi course a martial arts course
here's one for me stay fit as you age

plus p
l u s dot com slash fish and get that
entire month
absolutely free okay on with the podcast
on with the show
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that
is andy my fact is that due to covert 19
the 2020
2020 qriket world cup will be in 2021
and the 2021-2020 will happen in 2022
amazing so yeah this is just this is a
fact it comes from
uh the economists world in 2021 which is
a
sort of guide to the year ahead 2020 is
a kind of cricket for those of you
listening who are not cricket fans it's
a kind of super fast
wizzy version of normal yeah so normal
cricket we play it for five days and
often
there's no result uh and usually it's
raining
and you just come back four days later
and say let's just call it a draw but
this one it's like really fast it's over
in two hours
20 overs each you're done exactly so
they could have fitted in probably in
2019 but they should they should have
done but they didn't
and it was going to happen in australia
and then obviously in 2020
uh with covid the international cricket
council said that's going to be pushed
forward and india is hosting a 2021
which is now happening in 2022
i don't know what's happening to the
2022 tournament surely at some point
we're gonna have to play two
world cups in one year no
i think it's the reason that they don't
rename it probably because they've
already printed all the merch
oh i don't know must be right there must
be loads of merch from
2020 which was printed and just not i
mean what about all the um is it the
olympics that are going to be happening
in tokyo
they're still again they're still
calling at the 2020 olympics
are they okay oh that's going to be a
little
nugget of confusion for historians in
200 years
it's also going to be huge anxiety for
anyone who had the worst year in 2020
when they see that popping up everywhere
it's happening again again very
triggering
very triggering number uh yeah quicker
has been um
well it's been affected by covered much
like everything else on earth hasn't it
it's probably the main one i say it's
the biggest sufferer the main thing that
seems to have happened to qriket
everything is always like you know
cricket's had a tough audio everything's
had to change
there's the saliva rule and then that's
pretty much it
basically you're not allowed to put
saliva on the ball anymore
for very obvious reasons which they used
to do to shine the ball
um and what are they doing instead well
there are rules so if that happens and
the empire sees you happening
he will have to sanitize the ball right
yeah and then hand it back
they should have a sort of sprinkler
system between the two wickets which is
like
a wall of sanitizer yeah that the ball
passes through
like it's a car wash that's a great idea
such a good idea
so for the people who aren't into
cricket the reason you do this is you
spit on one side the ball you rub it
against your pants and it
makes one side shiny and the other side
not shiny
which makes it move in the air in a
slightly unusual way which can make it
difficult for the batsman that's why you
do that
and these days what they do i believe is
you could do it with your sweat
rather than with your saliva i think
wait are you allowed to do it with your
sweat i believe so but
i i haven't looked that up i think
that's right interesting so if you sweat
on someone they can't get covered from
that
i think it's quite hard to transmit
through sweat i think so it's harder
right no maybe it's not impossible but
if you're playing qriket in winter do
you have someone just
sort of in a sauna and he quickly runs
out sweats
that is one thing about qriket is it's
very much a summer spot
yeah what you have to do if you're the
team sweater
then you have to constantly be getting
into embarrassing situations and making
awkward comments so you feel really
awkward and then you sweat more
and then you've got you know you can
wring yourself out and actually weirdly
and this is very ironic someone with
covid would be sweating a lot because
they'd have a fever so they would
ironically be the best person to have
in that role right catch 22.
um catch 22 is a great name for a
cricketing base
a thriller because there are 22
players in total oh my god oh really
hang on surely that's going to be what
they're calling the 2022
2020 world cup
the 2021 2020 world cup in 2022 is going
to be called
22. uh there was a 2020 world cup
this year in cricket did it happen early
uh it did it was the women's 2020
women's t20
um the final was australia beating india
in melbourne
and they had 86 174 spectators
to watch that game uh which is only 4
000 shots of the world record of any
women's sporting event in history wow
which was the 1999 world cup in
california
but women's t20 is absolutely massive
it's
big in the uk and big in australia and
india but actually all around the world
it's really big
so the next t20 world cup they're gonna
have teams from bhutan botswana malawi
myanmar philippines
argentina brazil and the reason that
these countries have got really good
women's teams
is because if you think about it let's
say you're brazil for instance
and you're trying to bring cricket up
and you're trying to make it popular
it's going to be so hard for you to
break into the men's game because
like the main men's teams have been
going for hundreds and hundreds of years
and
you know they're really entrenched at
the very very top but the brazilian
women's t20 team they really do think
that they have a chance to get into the
finals and you know and maybe do
something because
the best teams obviously still england
and india and
australia are good but they might be
able to get into those lower echelons
so yeah really big and lots of countries
coming in through the back door we call
that
via the women's game
[Laughter]
um the first qriket world cup was uh the
women's world cup
in 1973 in fact so people tend to say
the first qriket world cup ever was 1975
but the ladies did it two years earlier
and
i just mainly like it because the
captain of the women's team
of the england women's team at the time
and the instigator was called rachel
hey-ho
hey-ho that'd be brilliant if you're in
the crowd and you wanted to chant her
name hey
ho hey ho hey hello yeah
the first um ever international 2020
match
was also a women's game was it yeah i
don't really like to talk about it
because england lost
against new zealand against new zealand
we won this one heiho won so just
discussed this one to the cows come home
um so it was started when she convinced
her pal jack hayward who
ran wolves football club and he was
really up for it he said because
it's quite simple i love women and i
love cricket
what could be better than the two rolled
together and so he bankrolled the whole
thing
and they came and australia came over
and the only other thing i could find
about it in the match reports was that
the australian team in one of their off
days went to longleat
and the tournament report said they had
a confrontation with an inquisitive
rhino
that's that's all that happened the
first ever women's cricket match was in
1797.
that's a long time ago um that was
11 married women of berry versus 11
unmarried women of berry
well those are team names they were the
teams yeah they were the team names
it was always married versus singers was
such a single shaming thing in the olden
days for sports well it just
it's it's unmarried so can you have can
you have widows and virgins on the same
team
um are they separate i don't know i
don't know what the rules were but
by technically speaking by the look of
it it looks like you could
i bet it was this is a bit like you know
cricketers who have dual nationality i
bet widows could actually play for the
singles or the married so i could
probably decide
yeah well you could defect by just
marrying sort of just
a fan right yeah if you're on the
unmarried team you would want your best
player to never meet anyone then get
married to them wouldn't you
you'd be always it'd be hilariously
always trying to kind of spoil all of
the dates and stuff like that that's
really good
i think this is a good uh subplot maybe
a b plotline for cat 22
when we write our sports based remedy
yeah the married women of berry by the
way they were so good they were
absolutely amazing they were written
about in australian newspapers they were
so good
and they offered to play any other
women's team in the world for any son
that's how confident they were wow
wow um one t20 match that i discovered
which has led me into a whole area of
cricket i didn't know existed was the
blind cricket t20
and and that's that's obviously just a
subsection
of general blind cricket which um is
fascinating
to watch i'd never heard of it and it's
it's really cool there's
11 players on each team and the idea is
that four of those players are
completely blind and they're known as b1
and
three players are partially blind b2 and
the final four partially sighted players
b3
and there's all these adaptions that
they do to the sport to make it work
so if you were the bowler um you would
be bowling a ball which is
significantly larger than a standard
ball and it's filled with ball bearings
so it's got audible cues for you to hear
it coming towards you
if you can't see um and so
if you're bowling as well you have to
yell play so that they know that it's
been thrown so you know that you're
ready to get it
you can't be bowled out if you're
completely blind if it hits the wickets
it has to be an lbw
um and the usually the bowling is rolled
on the floor so you can hear those ball
bearings going
um it's really fascinating to watch and
they do t20 as well and
pakistan is where i discovered this
through their team they want it i think
in 2016
and yeah there's lots of youtube clips
uh to watch
uh it's very exciting very cool so is
the ball rolled to make it go
more slowly i suppose to make it audible
i think it's the order
also to make it a lot safer probably
yeah
you probably don't want joe for archer
bowling at you even if it does have ball
bearings in it if you're blind
yeah yeah exactly i think it used to be
rolled along the ground until
sort of mid 1800s did it i think we've
mentioned that yeah
yeah i think certain cheating
australians still have done that in
history as well but we won't go into
that
all right let's move on um
have you heard of the longest match ever
oh so the t20 is obviously a short
format of qriket the longest test match
ever was 12 days long
and it still ended in a draw uh it was
1939 it was england south africa it was
called the timeless test
which used to be a format of qriket
where you just don't have to stop
playing until someone wins
um and the only reason the match ended
was the ship that the english team were
booked onto was due to leave south
africa
and in fact it had already left they
were in durban i think it had already
left durban
and they said that's fine we'll just get
a train to cape town let's just keep
playing a couple more days and see if we
can finish the match
and they still didn't finish it it was
still a draw and i think they ended the
practice off yeah i did read about that
actually and
it was getting really close england only
needed 42 more runs
to win the game and they had two players
left in
um and so it's really getting close to a
really exciting denial
but they were like no we're gonna have
to go and at one stage they considered
leaving the two players behind who was
still in
[Laughter]
just everyone else going home to see if
they could get over the line
that's so funny the longest speaking of
longest qriket things in south africa
the longest six was also in south africa
the longest six ever hit apparently and
this was uh can we guess was it chris
gayle
well can you guess how long it was oh i
thought who it was i thought andy was
going to regale us with all the crickets
as he knows
no way i mean i thought chris gale
probably but i didn't want to play it so
i can give you a clue as to how who it
was james this might help you so this
was one of south africa's best players
at the turn of the 20th century hansi
kranja
at the turn of the 20th century oh
when you're saying turning the 20th
century you don't mean from the 20th to
the 21st you mean
exactly there are i think that's pretty
ambiguous to be honest you're absolutely
right
it turns twice doesn't it that was um
that was
that guy smith wasn't it was it oh yeah
yeah you're close it was sinclair you
got the right first letter
is it two two miles can i just guess
that as a distance hitch
it's close um times it's because
go on did they play it at on on the top
of a
an enormous plateau and so they hit it
the ball was hit out of the grounds and
then fell two miles oh maybe he only
gets it onto a rhino's horn
and then it's stuck on the rhino's horn
and then he galaxizes
and the truck drives off and it takes it
50 miles
dan's done it he's absolutely nailed it
with the reason he hasn't gone far
enough it was 560 miles
it landed on the back of a coal truck on
a railway track
i'm going to allow truck and it traveled
from joburg
to the cape before being retrieved
and that counts for fielders do you know
that there is only one person who has
ever appeared
in world cups in two different sports in
the same year
this is interesting this is only in 2003
so quite recently
it's a namibian guy called rudy van
buren
and he appeared in both the cricket
world cup and the rugby world cup for
namibia in the same year
that is really cool isn't it until you
find out that he lost all six games of
cricket by a total of 813 runs and lost
all four rugby games by a total of 282
points
oh boy that is the equivalent of when
bart simpson plays a dozen grandmasters
at chess and loses
every single one of them
still if you didn't if you didn't tell
us that extra bit it's still amazing i
mean it's still
yeah it's still amazing do you know when
the first ever
qriket match international qriket match
was played in albania by an albanian
team
do i know when that happened but yeah
it's was it would be an old piece of
information for us to have stored unless
we just
was it one of the classic where you went
was it one of the turns of the 20th
century
it was a bit after the turn of a century
yeah
well it's either going to be really
recent or in sort of two hundred percent
albania didn't exist until after world
war one did it
i don't think well okay oh but it could
have been the what was
what turned into albania you're what are
we trying to guess when the people
actually played in 2015. 2015 is when it
happened
oh okay 2015. and when what happened
again sorry
albania had their first international
qriket match it's the first time
and they they uh they played um with
it was uh on the 24th of may 2015 the
albanian eagles versus the international
lions so
not an official british uh cricket team
and
the captain of the albanian team was the
prince of albania
the crown prince and the of the british
team
it was tony hawks the comedian
yeah and um the crown prince and his
albanian
team won the match um they won by one
run and they were all out for 49.
and um the trophy that they won was the
sonoran wisdom trophy um which is
the trophy of the cup funny isn't normal
wisdom supposed to be really popular in
albania or is that yeah he's
he's incredibly popular in albania uh
for some bizarre reason they love
slapstick over there and i say that
as someone who spent a bit of time there
um they love laurel and hardy they love
chaplin
so norman wisdom fits in perfectly with
that do they have all we have wisdoms
cricket almanac they have wisdoms qriket
oh my god
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
james okay my fact this week is that in
1682
russia was ruled by two half brothers
aged 16 and
10. a special double throne was built so
they could make proclamations together
but it had a secret window behind it so
they could get messages from their
sister sophia who was literally
the power behind the throne amazing
brilliant so cool
it is really so how did this window work
talk to us about this throne
um you'd open and close it she'd put a
bit of paper in
it's kind of yeah so there's basically
behind where one of them sat
there's a little kind of hole and
normally it's covered with velvet so you
can't tell whether it's a hole or not
but the idea is that someone could be
discreetly hidden behind there
and they'd be able to kind of whisper
things to
to the um to the young tsars or they
could possibly
pass little pieces of paper or stuff
like that um or if you wanted to
distract them during a proclamation
you could poke them in the bottom
perceivably
it would be at the height yeah it would
be in yeah
it's stupid to put that little velvet
window by their ass you know you're not
gonna get it
right past many secrets
shall i give you a little bit of
background on this um russian history
really really quickly so
yeah this is in 1682 there was a sir
called theodore uh
and he was when he died the country was
in a bit of a shambles he was
he wasn't really able to rule uh he'd
sent the army into loads of stupid
campaigns and he'd left no air
and so it was up to the nobles to fill
the throne and you had two families the
um narishkins and the miroslavsky's
who basically hated each other and they
had to decide who was going to take the
throne between them which family
so the duma who is the russian
parliament they had to basically
pick one they had to basically choose
who was the right horse and they would
say we'll go for them
um the miroslavsky candidate was ivan
but he was quite sickly
so he decided not to go for him they
went for the guy from the norishkin
family called peter who
later would become peter the great so
sofia
was um a part of the miroslavsky family
like evan but she was really strong she
got the army on her side and she
persuaded everyone to go with a giant
rulership
but so that meant that you had two
rulers at the same time and
then she became in charge of russia she
fired the head of the army she
actually she had him executed she
replaced the head of the army with one
of her favorites she took over most of
ukraine she took over kiev
in exchange for helping poland against
the turks it was just basically
all crazy kind of game of thrones stuff
until sophia went a little bit too far
she tried to get the army to overthrow
peter the army like peter
so they arrested sofia had her tried and
compelled her to take the veil so she
had to become a nun
and then peter became the emperor and
peter became peter the great
he loved sending people to the nunneries
it was a real classic peter the great
power moves so
not only did he send sofia there uh he
sent her sisters along there as well at
least two of them maybe more
and he also sent his own wife to a
nunnery later on because
he he seems to have been bored of her
basically
so he was terrible
well peter is not great in my opinion i
think we need to rename him he was a
horrible guy
peter the i think he was he was
someone who basically
just killed people in the most brutal
ways disagree i mean
what do you mean disagree what was the
great bit i mean he'd had
he had a very traumatic upbringing and
it was not an especially you know
uh decent bit of human history i don't
think he was especially worse than many
of his predecessors to be honest
it was czarist russia you accepted
gruesome killings but i want to hear
about one of the gruesome killings but
also the great part was because he
modernized the country i think
more than him not killing people can we
get some good bitching from dan though
yeah sure well we've no we've actually
we've actually covered him quite a lot
with his
atrocities back and you know he was we
mentioned that he was very much into
anatomy so he would go to beheadings and
he would study
the bodies of of people that were killed
and when he had one of his
ex-girlfriends
murdered by by having her head chopped
off he then picked up her head
and explained about the windpipe and so
on literally in the moment to a crowd
like a ted talk just saying
interestingly this is where this happens
and then he kissed her in the face
and then popped her down on the floor
that's a to me
um just on sophia a tiny bit about her
she was known for being kind of shrewd
and clever and skillful wasn't she which
i guess is how she wielded all this
power
but she was not very favorably reported
on another way so there was a french
diplomat called floyd lannoville
who wrote about her who acknowledged
that she was very shrewd he said
as much as her waist is short wide and
rough so her mind is thin
shrewd and skillful which actually when
you look at it like what is a thin mind
what is that i don't know but he did
write of her
she is terribly fat has facial hair
lupus on her legs is at least 40 years
old and there's a head the size of a pot
but what a vague way of describing
someone because possibly not a standard
size
no it's stupid yeah like saying i have a
foot the size of a shoe
[Laughter]
wow yeah maybe pots were all one size in
those days
um but that's one of the innovations
peter the great head of course is the
great pot revolution where uh he
introduced different sized pots
yeah they called him potter the great
actually for a lot of his time
so um this fact is about uh thrones
and or this sort of weird double throne
that they had
um i didn't know that when you're
becoming king or queen
in um britain you don't sit on a throne
you sit on a chair
it's called the coronation chair and
it's explicitly not a throne
um it's so do we not have a throne is
that what you're saying
no they've got buckets of thrones
actually but this this particular thing
um but it's so it used to be not looked
after especially well
uh so it's the oldest bit of furniture
in england made by someone who's known
who's named someone called walter of
durham but it was
in such bad nick that in westminster
abbey in the 18th century you could have
a go at sitting on it for a small
payment if you just paid a verger or
something
um and it's even got carved into the
back of it uh graffiti from all the
people who visited
so somebody wrote p abbott slept in this
chair fifth to sixth july
1800 that's the official coronation
chair of the whole country what i find
really weird about that is
that all those bits of graffiti are
quite old aren't they
like you say that from the 18th century
or even maybe a little bit after that
but they're from around then
but in 1914 the chair was blown up by
the suffragettes
as in they put a bomb there and bits
fell off it and so they decided to put
it all back together
but they decided not to get rid of any
of the graffiti
they thought well that's true you know
it's part of it though but you would
think that a coronation chair
shouldn't have p abbott slept here
i like the fact that the coronation
chair was specifically made
to in order to accommodate the stolen
coronation chair of the scots which does
make you understand why some scottish
people aren't
massively keen but it was so it was
literally built so that underneath
it it could contain the stone of schoon
which is basically the throne of the
scots
and i had never read about when the
scots stole the
stone of school back in 1950 never read
the story but
there may be people who remember this so
this was a huge deal
it was back in 1308 when it was taken
back down
when edward the first the hammer of the
scots defeated the scots and he had the
english throne of coronation chair built
in order to sit on top of the stone of
schoon
and in 1950 four scottish students
managed to break into westminster abbey
on christmas day
and steal it back but it sounds
hilarious so they broke in
and according to one of the guys they
went in and it weighs 25
stone so it is quite a heavy stone and
they picked it up
dropped it it split in two and the ring
leader for whom this presumably is the
most precious thing he can imagine said
i was absolutely delighted when i
realized we'd broken it because it made
it much easier to transport
amazing and then they smuggled it back
up and that's the last time the border
between scotland and england has closed
is in 1950
they shut the border in order to try and
stop it from getting across
which is but it does come back now right
it visits
it visits the throne so yeah it's now
holiday scotland but
if there's a coronation uh it comes back
down so one of the
one of the students and had died just
last year
he was called alan stewart and he was
alive until last year
oh wow yeah and it was really exciting
they buried it actually they took it to
kent and they just buried it in the
ground saying police are going to be
looking for a stone
so we will hide it um
and then the furore died down and he
just subtly drove back down to kent to
collect it from where they had hidden it
but when they got there there was a
gypsy encampment right where the stone
was
so he couldn't just dig it up he
couldn't just march into there so he had
to sort of
negotiate and say by the way can i dig
up the stone there's two
weird things about that first of all if
you're going to break into westminster
abbey
i think christmas day is not their quiet
day is it
you want to go you want to go on a
thursday but
no one's in westminster abbey don't you
that's so easy
how heavy did you say it was it weighed
about 25 stone how many
kilograms is that do you know i don't
know
2.2 kilograms in a stone something like
that that's um pounds and
way more than that two big men it's one
extremely fat man
it's 160 kilos yeah 158.7 but
yeah oh my god i tried to lift 154 kilo
stone when i was in iceland
um earlier this year yeah they what they
had is
when when you're an icelandic um let's
say viking
and you wanted to get on a ship they
would have all these stones
and whichever one you could lift up
would tell you which um job you were
going to have on the boat
so if you could lift the lightest one
then you could only be like a
cuck or something and if you could lift
the heaviest one then you could be like
one of the main rowers
and the heaviest one was 154 kilograms
and not only could i not lift it i mean
i couldn't even
i couldn't even push it a millimeter
from where it was
it's it's just so heavy well imagine
something four kilos heavier than the
stone you could have left james
that's what they had to lift surely why
would you want to be one of the main
rowers on a ship when you can get a
cushy job in the kitchens by
failing to lift a stove there must have
been a lot of big beefy guys saying oh
no i can't possibly lift that that's
really heavy
i think there's quite a lot of honor in
being able to lift up because for
instance when i tried to lift them and i
had a whole load of tourists watching me
to see if i could do it
i must have it i didn't feel like
throwing it i feel like i was really
gonna try my absolute hardest
well you would have been useless on this
expedition
um i was just looking about the idea of
people taking up the throne people being
handed to
and um albania actually
offered up the throne to someone who was
not albanian
they offered it up to no but close to
what i was saying earlier tony
b fry cb fry who was captain of the
england cricket team
so we almost had an english cricketer as
the head of albania
years before they even thought to play
an international match
and set up the norman wisdom cup why
have you just typed albania qriket into
google a thousand times
for do you know who the youngest monarch
in the
world is at the moment
you can't guess it oh um because
he is the king of an area of uganda
so he's not super famous he's called
king oyo
he's 28 years old and he's from toro
which is a kingdom in uganda
but he came to power at the age of just
three
okay he now rules over three percent of
uganda's population
and at his coronation he was sat on the
throne playing with a toy car
all the way through kind of fidgeting
and at one stage when there was a speech
by the president mussovany
he started crying jumped off the throne
and ran to his mother's lap
he's in charge of three percent of the
population of uganda so
you get another percent with every age
that he has
yeah that's how it works it's a very
weird political system they've got in
together actually
the queen is so close to having all of
the uk
90-something percent um he um
he was visited by nelson mandela when he
was very young uh
and nelson mandela had to wait in the
vip tent
um until he'd finished playing with all
of his toys and agreed to come out and
meet nelson mandela
but now he's a goodwill ambassador for
hiv and stuff like that so he's quite
awesome actually
cool yeah now 28 disney
and he said that he said the reason that
he ran into his mother's lap is because
they tried to put a lion skin crown on
him and he was scared of it
uh and then the next the day after his
coronation age three he had to attend a
cabinet meeting
[Music]
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that
is anna my fact this week is that if an
octopus's arm comes off
it will keep picking up food and trying
to put it where its mouth used to be
wow when you send it round yeah i
thought the octopus would keep picking
up food and i was like how can it do
that it hasn't got an arm left but you
mean the arm
the dis attack the disembodied arm picks
up the food the arm is a dangling
modifier
very badly phrased fact had a week to
think about it and yeah
a dangling modifier could be that um
couldn't it yeah
um yeah the arm itself will keep picking
up food
and it's not the end of the world of an
octopuses arm falls off so don't worry
about that at home as we've mentioned
before they can regrow their arms
but this and they've got seven more we
should point that out
they've got plenty to go around um and
this was discovered in
in a study where uh there was an
octopus's arm was amputated
and they were less for about an hour
after they are
severed or more than an hour then they
still operate like a normal arm so
they'll recoil if they're touched or if
something you know scary
is stroking them and they will pick up
food and then drop it in the mouth that
doesn't exist so presumably they'll pick
up a bit of food
and then turn around see the same bit of
food there behind them pick it up again
and continue in that comedy routine you
know that kind of thing where you have
like phantom arm syndrome where you lose
your arm and you kind of think it's
there
it's almost the opposite of that isn't
it the arm has a phantom rest of body
syndrome
yeah yeah so because the so i'd rather
think that two-thirds of their neurons
are in their arms
and the arms are sort of running
independent to the other arms as well
they don't necessarily know
what the other arms are doing but so
does that mean that
if i was the octopus i would just have
an arm feeding me whenever
it wanted to feed me as opposed to me
would i be
mid chat and it's trying to force feed
me some fish it's really basically
well they've done a lot no one really
knew this until quite recently and
they've done a study quite
very recently where they had like a maze
and when i say maze it was like
a tube with two bits going off like a
like a letter y
and they taught the octopuses to
um always put their hands down one of
these tubes because that's where the
food is and the other one was always
empty
and what they found was that when they
learned how to do that with one tentacle
and then they put another tentacle in
then that tentacle knew how to do it as
well and what that tells us
is not that they can't work
independently but that they definitely
are able to work as a group as well so
if you teach
your arm to do one thing the other arm
will also know how to do it so they're
not completely independent
they can act independently but they also
have they can talk to each other so they
wouldn't just feed themselves
without you know i'm actually surprised
they had to do a study into that i mean
surely obviously an octopus whole body
is acting as a whole body
no no no well not always so this is the
really weird thing
um so they do so they have molecules
which stops the skin
sticking to itself because obviously
they've got suckers all over them
um but octopuses are able to pause
those molecules uh if they want to grab
another octopus which they sometimes do
they're able to pause the bit which
stops them sticking onto each other
right
but that is a glitchy system in an
octopus sometimes the off switch doesn't
work
and so there is conflict between octopus
central and
octopus arm brain sending different
signals about whether or not they can
touch
another bit of skin and so they will
sometimes dance around an object for
minutes on end while they're working out
this kind of laggy
computer system inside themselves and
they're just you can't work out what
they're doing
and neither can they very frustrating so
weird
apparently some researchers say that
different arms have different
personalities
[Laughter]
but they'll say things like you'll so
some arms will be more confident than
others so you'll maybe
show a new teddy bear or something and
the front arms are often a little bit
more confident in the back arm so
they'll reach towards it whereas the
back ones will recoil away
right that's amazing that is incredible
yeah so if you're sat at the dinner
table with an octopus
and he's got a pissed off right arm but
a really fun party left arm
yeah you want to be on that side of the
table yeah
um i should say i read this in a
magazine called new issue which is
brilliant
it's my friend gave it to me and it's
the big issue north
is releasing this four times a year and
it's a beautiful magazine full of
excellent long reads so highly recommend
cool
one thing that's been in the news quite
a lot in the last
couple of weeks and when i say news i
don't mean you know
most news i mean the kind of news that i
read and that is
the octopuses that have started punching
fish in the heads
um when you were saying about
personalities in different arms
and it seems that some octopuses they
will
look for fish with other fish so the
fish are trying to
find food and the octopuses are trying
to find food and they all kind of work
together
but sometimes if one of the fish doesn't
do what the octopus wants to do
then he just punches them in the head
and they just swim off
and the guy who wrote this study uh was
called eduardo
sempio from the university of lisbon and
he said that whenever he saw it he
laughed out loud and almost choked on
his own regulator
and if you see the videos it really is
quite funny
to see an octopus punching a fish
and it's it's it's sometimes when they
uh want a bit of food
for example but also it can be for no
discernible benefit that's the other
thing i said it was
it might be disciplined to say stay in
line and
keep obeying me but they that's just a
theory they've got it seems to be
they said out of spite which is it's
just gorgeous
it's unbelievable it's kind of it's kind
of like they're the you know the villain
in a movie and the fish is the stupid
henchman
who they keep on wacky it's like the
pinky in the brain almost
do you know what bit of the human an
octopus is most like
um as in what small past be human the
entire octopus is like
is that yeah uh yeah i'll say that like
your hand because it's got lots of
appendages
no really eyeball that's kind of
consistency yeah it's actually anna do
you wanna have crack
um my my mouth you've been using it
it's yeah i mean you have to see a
doctor about the suckers in your mouth
but yeah i'll give you that one it's
your tongue
and the tongue is the most likely
oxfords because uh they're both muscular
hydrostats
i.e almost every muscle that you've got
as a human is attached to a bone
and it's all you know you move by the
bone of the muscle working together
the tongue obviously has no skeletal
support it's just muscle
moving itself and that's exactly how
octopuses move as well they
you know they compress fluid into one
section and that creates movement in
another section
so you've basically got an octopus in
your mouth
that's how they squeeze into tiny spaces
right it's the same way you can squeeze
your tongue into a coke bottle and get
it stuck there
[Laughter]
into a tiny space i think there's
something like if uh and now i'm gonna
work in kilos so james isn't confused
but 120 kilo octopus can squeeze into a
pipe which is about like smaller than an
exhaust pipe so you'll have an octopus
the size of a human the weight of a
human
which can somehow squeeze through
i thought that it actually doesn't even
matter on the size it all just depends
on
size of beak and eyeball because those
are the only
solid bits although if you've got enough
skin there
folded up i think people say it's just
dependent on beak but you do actually
have other substance to it
that you need to fold up don't you when
you watch them go through
but yeah it's basically down to big size
do you guys know the um
the artist hakusai you do yeah yeah
for people at home he's the one who did
the wave that you'll see on lots of
you know japanese right the japanese
tsunami
he once did a woodcut of an octopus
giving oral sex to a fisherman's wife
it's a very famous one and according to
octopus
experts the animal doesn't look like
it's enjoying it at all
because the wife however well the wife
does look like she's enjoying it
i mean only search for this if you're
not in work
like none of us is at the moment but
don't search if anyone's looking at your
life and if you're one of our children
listeners
yeah exactly um but um the woman does
look like she's enjoying herself but
according to
um this was an article by diane kelly
writing in gizmodo
she says that at the northern pacific
giant octopus which is what this is
uh when it's amorous when it's feeling
horny it will change its skin
and it will become a slightly different
pattern it will have white spots on a
red background
and this this octopus doesn't have that
at all
and also that octopus always mates with
their mating arm
i think we've said before that one of
the arms is used for mating
but in this painting their mating arm is
actually hidden right behind the octopus
so the octopus does not look like he's
enjoying it at all one little bit
more he looks like he's devouring the
woman
um ah are you saying that hooker side
didn't do his research
or that just he's maybe he did but he's
trying to depict something different to
what we think
it's it's something even darker than
what you would maybe i don't know
hawkins i kind of like your earlier
stuff where there was just a wave
really good i think this is a bit of a
it's called something like i can't
remember it's called something like the
dream of the fisherman's wife or
something
like that so maybe it's the fisherman's
wife's
what she imagines and she doesn't
necessarily imagine everything to be
completely
you know biologically correct hocus i
can't blame the fisherman's wife for not
knowing about octopus
morphology no way was this the thing
james that it was
erotica involving i think creatures
there is uh there is a subculture i
believe online
i didn't search for this when i was
doing my research but um
my understanding is that there i don't
know of anything earlier than
this hawkside painting a woodcut sorry
dan do you have a fact about albanian
cricket in this
section i'm just i'm waiting i've been
waiting for it for ages and i just want
to know
i'm holding on to it when it when the
time is right i will lob it in
um just while we're talking about sort
of um
touching octopuses in a sort of nice way
that's another thing that they
share with humans they get very
very huggy when they're high on mdma
which scientists have discovered
recently
so they discovered that octopuses when
they did a full genetic
what's it called when they they mapped
the genes of an octopus
yeah and they found that there was a
serotonin thing that was very similar to
humans they were very surprised by that
and they thought well surely it doesn't
respond
because when we do mdma in any kind of
drug the serotonin levels go up and down
and so on
they tried it on an octopus and it they
acted exactly
in the sort of lovey way that we might
do if we were on drugs
and they didn't expect that because when
we have octopuses
in a lab they often have to put them in
different tanks because they're very
vicious they're quite they like their
isolation and so they'll often eat each
other kill each other
if they're in the same tank but then
they discovered once they were on drugs
they started
hanging out with each other and hugging
each other and you know
peace and love man yeah so it was very
very boring for the researchers that
experiment because they also were
very tedious to talk to weren't they six
hours straight just droning on about
nothing
so irritating guys i've got one fact
about severed limbs
which this is about right sort of
severed limbs octopus arms but except
this is a human thing
this is a story from 2005 uh and it's
that an american man
called clarence stowers he found a
severed finger in his tub of ice cream
right that he'd just been served but
then he refused to give it back to an
injured employee so it could be
reattached to the employee
because he wanted it as evidence in
legal action against the store
and what happened was he found a chewy
object in his ice cream he thought it
was an ingredient he realized it was a
finger
the employee had just lost his finger in
a machine used to beat the ice cream
so his colleagues were rushing to help
the man who'd lost a finger
but one of the guys at the ice cream
parlor hadn't noticed and unknowingly
served the finger up
too mr stone i didn't think we even sold
raspberry ripple but fine
and then a week later he repented and he
said all right you can have the finger
back which is obviously completely
pointless by that stage oh my god
i don't do anything the employee was
pointless as well wasn't he
going on anyway can you identify the man
who ate your finger
no
[Laughter]
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening
if you'd like to get in contact with any

[Music]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with anna toshitsky
james harkin and andrew hunter murray
and once again we have gathered round
our microphones with our four favorite
facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order here we go
starting with you anna my fact this week
is that in 2016
tupperware claimed to be holding a party
somewhere in the world
every 1.3 seconds
no
how's that possible you're not being
invited and i know this is awkward
this is uh this is tupperware parties
the reason i'm researching this is
because
i was talking to my mum a couple of
weeks ago and she said i wonder if
anyone goes to tupperware parties
anymore
and i said what on earth are you talking
about and then she was saying
about you know how in their youths you'd
have tupperware parties and they are
a thing where a tupperware sales person
sales rep
uh basically throws a house party where
they
demonstrate and display all sorts of
tupperware and it's still really popular
around the world so they stopped
happening in the uk
in 2003 but they happen in lots of other
countries still
every 1.3 seconds you could be at one
they make extraordinary claims so
they claim that france has half a
billion tupperware parties every year
which
how many people go to a tupperware party
would you say is it ten
ten yeah eight eight to ten these days
none
like it mostly it must have been a bad
year for tupperware sales last year
right
okay so france says half a million if
france's half a million tupperware party
each with let's say
ten people attending that's still five
million french people no it isn't
you're not saying that you only go to
one tupperware party every year and it's
like nope that's my filth for the year
these tupperware enthusiasts are going
to more than one party
that's true and also there are
tupperware raves which can get really
out of control
quite a lot they're illegal at the
moment but you have to bring your drugs
in a
perfectly labeled
it's amazing the tupperware story so as
you said that's how they actually sell
tupperware and it started off not being
very successful so it was invented by
earl tupper not an earl that's just his
name
in i think it was 1946
and didn't sell very well and then this
woman called brownie wise
came along with a wise attitude towards
pr
and she was already selling various
household goods via the house party
and she bought up some tupperware sold
it and he spotted that she was causing a
massive increase in sales this way
and i think within three years of
her being on the scene he took all his
products off shelves and sold them
exclusively at parties
and five years after she came on the
scene the company was making a hundred
million dollars in sales per year
wow she absolutely smashed it yeah
she found out that whenever you put like
some gravy in a tupperware box and threw
it across the room she always got way
more sales
that was the fiesta resistance wasn't it
bouncing the tupperware
the gravy frisbee it's mad as well isn't
it that this feels like
um again there's there's probably other
research to suggest otherwise but to me
it feels like this is the moment where
we accepted plastic into the house so
that's what they were fighting against
largely plastic wasn't a thing that you
brought into the house and a lot of
people were very resistant to it
so it's so odd to know that in my head
at least this is the moment where all of
this now all the plastic in our house is
off the back of these parties that were
happening with brownie wise an american
interesting idea
dan lives in a child's wendy house we
should say at this point
he's got his little cozy coupe car in
the corner
[Laughter]
um speaking of the actual tupperware
parties have you heard of the parties
they used to have at
um tupperware hq no it sounded
wild so these again were brownie wise's
idea it was called a homecoming jubilee
and it was for hundreds of the
tupperware sales women who were i think
they were exclusively women who were
selling their products in the home
so they had these in like a mad orgy
stick
not quite orgastic but they were pretty
funky
and they were so far from audiences no
no no no
what about this 1954's big tupperware
rave was called
a big dig um a big one very
big dig all right
she buried fifty thousand dollars worth
of mink stoles
diamond rings gold watches and tiny
model cars around the place at
tupperware hq and you had to go and dig
them up and if you found
a tiny model car you could swap it for
an actual car
i mean it sounds insane they had
methodist preachers come and say that
tupperware was a way of fighting
communism
uh they had a walk of fame which was
just tupperware sales women
um on the walk of fame they had a
40-foot mural called the museum of
dishes
um they had a pond where apparently she
baptized people
yeah i haven't been exactly clear on why
she was baptizing people
they did they did say though that
brownie wise had a sort of religious
aura to her didn't she she sort of was
treated as a sort of high priest of the
tupperware religion at that time and she
used to go around
with the original slag um polyethylene
slag
that earl tupper had used and she would
allow people to stroke it
and touch the slag with sacred slag i
said it was autistic and i
if you're touching the sacred slag
man you should say what slag is yeah
well it's it's poli it's the
polyethylene isn't it it's like a
plastic
um it's like a black plastic
mold yeah it's the plastic which the
tupperware was eventually made out of so
he was given one of these big lumps of
cast off plastic from another company
and he used a process to turn it into
this kind of see-through
plastic container thing and he kept the
original version
of it and then gave it to to brownie
wise so cool
and she said just get your fingers on it
wish for what you want
know it's going to come true and then
get out and work like
everything and it will it is starting to
sound more and more orgastic
some of this language they had a wishing
well at company headquarters
that's sort of what you were saying
about the wishes they had a
wishing one like that's the point you
throw wishes into the wedding world
don't you if there is a wishing well
and they got a wish fairy to come and
dole out expensive gifts to the
tupperware
it's unclear you i guess you lived in
some tupperware somewhere
um that would be cool do you know the
thing of someone bursting out of a cake
yeah they must have had someone bursting
out of some tupperware
because i think the whole point of
tupperware is that it doesn't open
without quite a lot of force
so you just basically got some
asphyxiated woman
in a plastic container
that's a good advert though i mean it's
so secure that if your life depends on
it you can't escape
one of the things they did just on that
subject is they did something called
carrot calling
which what would happen is you'd go to
your party and then you'd get some
tupperware
and then you put some carrots in your
tupperware and then you put some just on
the shelf wherever you keep it or in the
fridge if you're a weirdo that keeps
your carrots in the fridge
and then they would say okay well let's
come back in a month's time and see how
the carrots look that were in your
tupperware compared to the ones that are
on your shelf or in your pantry right
and so that was not only a way of
proving how good the tupperware was
but it was a way of making sure the same
people came back to your party to buy
more
so it was pretty clever right that's
really clever
um just one thing about tupperware that
i found bizarre is that a third of its
revenue comes from makeup sales
tupperware makeup that's what and in
fact in south america
it's more than half in uruguay 70
and i could i could go on in parts of
uruguay
90 there's one house in uruguay which is
a 100
tupperware makeup what is the makeup is
it a famous brand or
so they bought up a bunch of beauty
brands in the early 2000s and this is
when the guy who was running the company
at the time i think it was a guy called
rick
goings uh he realized that in south
america
he ran some stats and realized that
people spent much more on makeup than
they did on food containers
he said that he checked something called
the vanity index
and south american countries rate most
highly in terms of people who care most
about their appearance
and so they launch makeup there instead
and it's super popular
i suppose like you would have avon
parties in the uk wouldn't you like who
who would sell makeup and stuff like
that
you do and and summer's parties you i
think used to be a thing
yeah definitely a thing mustn't they i
think there was an article which claimed
that there were four thousand ann
summers
parties every week
[Laughter]
they had a falling out didn't they in
the end earl earl and brownie
the two combined geniuses so o was sort
of the inventive genius and she was the
pr
genius and he thought that it should be
more about tupperware and less about her
and it was becoming quite about her she
was the first woman ever to appear on
the cover of business week
she because of her fame as this
tupperware queen she ended up writing
this self-help book called best wishes
and old tapa eventually thought no she's
becoming too
self-involved and hungry for fame and he
fired her in 1958
and sold the company shortly afterwards
i read and i don't know
um i think there's a lot of speculation
because we don't fully know the details
of the falling out but there were a few
rumors that
he thought that once he passed away if
the business went to brownie it would go
down because
no one would want a woman at the head of
a company which
sounds mad but is apparently part of his
thinking
i mean there's a lot of rumors it's very
strange
i read one that that in 1957 she had
held a
massive tupperware party on a florida
island for 1200 people
and there was a torrential thunderstorm
which injured 21 people and that
led to lots of lawsuits and though so
the this is the most charitable
explanation of why she was fired is that
that was a big
mistake but it does seem like it was
quite a lot to do with
uh tupper's ego and in fact there's more
evidence because
you know she used to bury things on
tupperware hq property
once uh she had been sacked uh
he had a hole dug on tupperware company
property and dumped 600 copies of her
book
into the hole and buried them wow
yeah that wasn't so he could throw a big
party where people got to do it
it was not did he put it in tupperware
or was it just into the ground
i think the point was not to preserve
the copies of the book for free i don't
know i was just thinking he would have
shot himself in the foot there with that
idea he did go a bit strange afterwards
didn't he he um
yeah he what did he do he moved he moved
to costa rica
he basically sold the company got a
whole load of money didn't want it to
get taxed and so
divorced his wife and went to live in
costa rica yeah he did although before
that he bought an island
which i think he wanted to live on he
bought this island called san jose
island which i'd never heard of it's
just off the coast of panama
and he wanted it to become a holiday
resort and that makes him sound very
rich at branson but i think it was
an island that you know didn't really
have people on it and probably didn't
cost a huge amount
and so he wanted to be this glorious
resort and it looks stunning and i've
seen pictures golden sands beaches
he hadn't investigated it enough because
it had been the site of massive
chemical weapons testing and dumps by
the us canada and britain in the 1940s
oh my god
so he sent a couple of staff there they
got quite badly burned
and damaged from that and they realized
that it was uninhabitable
that's bad he was an amazing ideas man
from what i can tell uh there's a lot of
inventions that he tried to make that
never
ended up being realized which i think is
a bit of a shame he had the no drip ice
cream cone
which so great that's a great idea isn't
it
that's a great idea yeah it's one of the
only problem with ice cream cones really
yeah actually you know what i would
invent you know the best thing about an
ice cream cone is where you snap off the
bottom of the ice cream cone and you
turn it into a tiny little
ice cream tiny kind of microcosm of
itself
do you know that so you snap off the
bottom of an ice cream cone
so you have a tiny little bit of cone
and then you take a tiny little bit of
ice cream from the top of it
and it couldn't be like you're a giant
because you have a tiny ice cream
so you could resell it to other kids
around you and make back your money
but then i would invent one word they
kept regrowing the bottom so you could
do that in infinite amount of time
that's weird cause i do so do you not do
the thing where you snap off the bottom
and then you suck the ice cream out
through
that's what i do well you could do both
of those things if you
you know yeah yeah no you're all mad in
different ways these are not acceptable
ways to
go as he stands next to the ice green
van and tells the children what they're
allowed to do and what they're not
allowed to do
i've got my um my tray in front of me to
catch any spare drops
yeah you thought the ice cream van man
was scary how about the creepy guy
standing next to us catching our
droplets
a couple of other inventions by or
by earl tupper um fishing poles that
weighed your catch
as you were reeling it in great idea he
invented a machine to make it easier to
clean and dress
chickens um a dress i imagine
dress as in for cooking as in putting
trousers on the bus
[Laughter]
andy did you read this one because i
can't i can't work out what it would be
a fish-powered boat
i didn't read that that was one where
the idea is you get a really big fish
and you attach it to the bottom of your
boat and then the fish
swims along the river and just pulls
your boat along with it
the boat is directly above the fish yeah
yeah is that real
sure i mean they were written in like um
his um notebooks from when he was a
teenager some of these so i think they
were
oh they were i mean there were ideas but
i don't think he ever really
thought that we were going to take a
load of boats and attach fish to the
bottom of them
this that could be the green energy
solution that we're all looking for
could be that's what we want to do like
stress the fish out a bit more
yeah it makes sense though the invention
of a fish weighing rod because you need
to make sure you're reading in a big
fish if it's planning to drag your ferry
over the truck
[Music]
stop the vodka stop the podcast hi
everybody just wanted to let you know we
are sponsored this week by
harry's harry's i thought you were going
to say that andy because you're looking
so
clean-shaven today i thought that could
only be harry's
i'm a frictionless surface baby
[Laughter]
and that is the kind of feel that you
can get with harry's who send you
shaving products through the post to
your door never leave the house again
but always remain smooth
so if you want a coefficient of friction
just as low as andy's
then you need to go to harry's oh
they're really good razors um
the best thing is they're really quite
reasonably priced
replacement blades are still only like

spoil it i'm going to spoil it
so if you get a trial set it comes with
all the usual things of course the
handle the five blade razor cartridge
the lathering shave tail and the travel
blade cover
but also if you go to harry's dot com

so if you go to harrys.com you can claim
your trial set for just 4.95
do it now yes indeed go to harry's dot
com slash fish to claim that trail set
with the free shower gel be just as
smooth as andy's chin
and for now it's on with the podcast on
with the show
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is
andy my fact is that in 1868 there were
five
different plays on in london's west end
simultaneously
where a train burst onto the stage and
threatened to run somebody over
wow this was a huge theatrical trend so
i've got the names of the players they
were called
land rats and water rats that's one play
um rail river and road
danger after dark and my favorite the
scamps of london
great sounding play and um in all of
these plays
uh the there was there was a train drama
scene where a train burst on
and the trains were obviously in you
know quite detailed wooden
flats that were mounted on rails so they
did they were able to
burst onto the stage um lots of kind of
sound effects and smoke and stuff
yeah exactly and this was a massive
thing and i think it was because of a
play the previous year called under the
gaslight
um oh it was in that was the first time
it was really big on stage the guy who
wrote it
he was called augustin daily and he
claimed that other people had nicked his
idea and then other people said no you
nick this from somewhere
well he was he won the um court case
and so i think technically we have to
say that it was his idea
he's not going to see he claimed that he
was just walking down the road and he
tripped up
over like a piece of you know pavements
or something
and he hurt his toe and had to hop all
the way home and when he landed back in
his bed
it just appeared to him the idea from
nowhere as opposed to the fact that
there was actually already an idea out
there
yeah weirdest we we actually have his
first hand
quotes from that moment and it breeds so
bizarre
he says i was near my door and i rushed
into the house threw myself into a chair
grasping my injured foot with both hands
for the pain was great and exclaiming
over and over again i've got it
i've got it and it beats hot irons all
to pieces
it's like we should say sorry the idea
that we're talking about
is not the train crashing through though
it's the person tied to a railway
idea so this was amazing oh sorry
in 1867 which began with this under the
gaslight play
where someone's tied to a train track
and a train's coming towards them at the
very last minute you whipped them away
and that was his genius idea right yeah
by the way the stubbing his toe had
nothing to do with it
it's bizarre he just happened to stub
his toe at the same time exactly
but this play was held at the world
sisters new york city theater
in 1867 and was absolutely massive
uh and it wasn't actually these days i
would say we would see that meme and it
would be like
a you know damsel in distress who was
tied to the rail tracks and then
some you know mustachioed hero would
come and
save the day um but in this case it was
actually the woman who saved the man
and there was a man in the play called
snorky uh
and he was tied to the train tracks and
then
the woman protagonist would come and
save the day
and then snarky would exclaim and these
are the women who
ain't to have a vote not really
political
so it's quite a political little thing
but the play was run
by these sisters called the world
sisters and they were
massive they were the daughters of a
clown
uh and kind of grew up in the showbiz uh
and they kind of started doing these
burlesque acts where they would take the
piss out of other plays and stuff like
that and then eventually they did so
well that they managed to buy their own
theater in new york city and that was
where they put on this play
uh and the most famous one of them was
jenny warrell and they
and it was written i've heard that the
beautiful voluptuous jenny worrell
sucked late drank champagne owned fast
horses
wore diamonds squandered money to left
and right
until the public grew weary of her oh so
and then she died in poverty in the end
so it's not a fun story but
unfortunately she was also the daughter
of a clown so she had size 64
shoes and that made it very hard to
socialize
i don't think when snarky says and these
are the women to wait to have a vote
it's slightly
like did he believe in um suffering for
women before a woman saved him from
a railway track sometimes you need that
moment of clarity like stubbing your toe
or being safe from the train
i think no one should have the vote
unless they can prove that they've saved
someone else's life
it's quite similarly just in the case of
it switching
and it used to be a woman who saved a
man the first known
cliffhanger literal cliffhanger was in
thomas hardy's a pair of blue eyes
wasn't it in 1873 and this so this was
really the age of the cliffhanger that's
what that train scene is
is because it's the very last minute
when they escape was this a novel anna
or did he write plays as well
yes no this was a novel a pair of blue
eyes and it features henry knight who's
the hero and he's left dangling
off the edge of a cliff and then the
whole book is him dangling
at which point he reviews the entire
history of the world whilst waiting to
be rescued
and that's the book and then at the end
i believe his love interest
pops up and fashions a rope out of her
own underwear
to haul him to safety wow luckily she
just come back from alan summers party
yes it was very flimsy it snapped
immediately and he died tragically
i can't believe after all the crap we
got for ruining the ending of another
classic
literature novel that you've gone ahead
and spoiled the ending
of this hearty one yeah
what was that anna karenina yeah another
book featuring weirdly a train
uh which runs oh god
stop listening um this sort of trend was
a
victorian melodrama it gets called um
and it was
it was a really big thing um the the the
idea was basically sensation you had
huge theaters often with three or four
thousand
uh seats in them and so theaters were
engaged in an arms race to come up with
the most sensational stuff
and a lot of them were thanks to a guy
called bruce sensation
smith you heard of him he came up with
loads of amazing kind of
theatrical gimmicks um so one of them is
of a diver descending into the sea
right so that's what's happening on the
state in the story
but to show that uh the boat he's in
that got lift
lifted up into the flies right so it
looks like he's descending because the
boat is rising and rising above him
but also then they revealed huge uh
tanks of water behind him which have
real fist swimming in them
so as he descends you see he is
surrounded by actual fish
that's so cool that's very cool not
everyone was that happy with these
sensational plays so
w s gilbert of uh gilbert and sullivan
fame
he said about these sensational plays
every play which contains a house on
fire
a sinking steamer or a railway accident
will
succeed in spite of itself in point of
fact
nothing could wreck such a piece except
carefully written dialogue
or a strict attention to probability
he said avoid these two stumbling blocks
and your peace will succeed triumphantly
meow i know i think dickens felt the
same
uh again i think people would go to see
the melodramatic moment rather than
any plot or dialogue or acting wouldn't
they and dickens said of a play called
the streets of london
which had a city burning down in it and
the name would change depending on what
city it was in so it'd be the streets of
bolton when it went to bolton for the
streets of glasgow
and dickens said of it it's the most
depressing instance without exception
of an utterly degrading and debasing
theatrical taste that has ever come
under my rising notice wow that's
extraordinary i guess it's just
the equivalent of a blockbuster film
though which you get exactly because you
know that there's an
incredible scene where a plane
disassembles itself or whatever yeah
it's a dwayne johnson movie basically
yeah yeah
yeah i would have loved them imagine
what dickens would have thought of
transformers fall
[Laughter]
there was like a a response to it wasn't
this so in the 1850s and 1860s there's a
guy called tom robertson
who invented a thing called cup and the
source of realism
and what that was it was the exact
opposite of these train crashes and
fires and drownings and stuff like that
and this was reported as being really
really unusual
if there were a few people talking in a
kitchen say robertson would put
on stage as many chairs as would
realistically be found
in a kitchen or a dining room as opposed
to everyone else who would say well
there are two people talking so we only
need two chairs
so we'll just put that so he had
everything that was really realistic
and there was one where someone was
making a pudding
on stage and this was absolutely the
talk of the town because it was
so unusual that someone would really be
actually making a pudding while they
were doing the talking
and instead of kind of projecting and
really shouting
these kind of what was happening in the
play they would just talk as a normal
person one it was just like a realistic
thing and to start off with no one would
put these plays on because they were
like
well where's the car crash was
the train
we don't have it but eventually there
was one or two um theaters that did it
and then
that's kind of where we are today a
little bit isn't it sort of except the
chair thing
i think the chair thing is still doesn't
happen and that is revolutionary
you do not see spare chairs in place and
that's
you're right um i was reading up on sort
of general
theater stage props um off the back of
this fact
and so just a couple of things that i
found um there was a story
of orson welles when he used to be
performing in
uh julius caesar um he played the role
of uh brutus
and he preferred a real knife because
a plastic knife didn't really give the
proper shine in the theater lights
so when you have a real blade it really
bounces it off and makes it look real
anyway they had to take julius caesar to
the hospital because he was stabbed
he collapsed yeah and um yeah at the end
of the scene he was taken to the
hospital where he had to
recover for quite a long time at the end
of the scene i would say
bring bring the scene to a close a
little bit early
i i think everyone's watching going
bloody hell julius caesar's good in this
isn't he
[Laughter]
wow yeah but doesn't he get stabbed
about 40 times in the um
because it's loads of lots of different
people though presumably also wells was
the only one with an actual knife
everyone else was just doing the plastic
thing also wells was so devoted to his
craft he handed out 40 knives and he
recruited his worst enemy to play season
wow speaking of that there was a
production of dad's army in 2010
in south wales um local production
and they realized in a rehearsal that
they were accidentally using
live grenades which they just found
don't panic and it was
corporal jones who was the man he
realized jacob yeah i know
and really he realized as he was looking
at it he thought oh that's funny this
does look good doesn't it
in fact there's a pin still in it and
they had they had
they had found them in a car in the
garage of a cast member's father-in-law
and just driven them to the theater
rattling around and i had to call the
bomb squad to come and blow them up
oh wow um you know what they do for
drugs and films
if you because some films they have to
take lots of drugs like is it like a
flower or
icing sugar or something yeah it's
pretty close so um
prop masters basically the ones they
have to test all the drugs themselves to
make sure that you can take it as an
actor and not immediately start choking
or whatever
so um fake cocaine in the wolf of wall
street that
i think was vitamin b powder and that
was fine
um they use moss instead of marijuana
in films which andy i imagined
andy going to his boss dealer and
accidentally getting some marijuana and
going what's this
[Laughter]
i felt karma and i wanted to feel tense
um
yeah magic mushrooms are just mushrooms
they just use some mushrooms but
non-magic mushrooms it does
one more thing about the sensational
plays yeah so
um there was rules about what you could
show in the theater and then they got
slightly loosened but you still had to
pass things through the lord
chamberlain's office
and so in the 19th century in order to
get things through
the census you wouldn't put swear words
in for instance
you would have other things that people
would say and so you have loads of
awesome insults like people would call
each other
a rascally nighthawk or a herring-gutted
villain
and stuff like that and also um
sometimes
the um like a villain instead of going
you you bastard you stop my
amazing plan they wouldn't be able to do
anything you should write scripts
actually
that was stunning well i would do if it
could go back into the 19th century
because instead of using that amazing
dialogue
you would just shout out whatever your
psychological state was
it was an american player which was
adapted for the british stage
and when the villain had his plans filed
he just shouted out
confusion
[Laughter]
dan i think we have a new catchphrase
for you on the podcast
[Laughter]
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that
is james okay my fact this week is that
when it wants to sleep a walrus will
sometimes
hook its tusks onto a small iceberg and
sleep while floating along
in the water isn't that
lovely it's so cute apart from the quite
big fat blubbery things
and probably quite cold and it's it's a
cute idea
that's so cute i think that's very cute
yeah
so a few places on the internet doubt
this but i
am pretty confident that it does
sometimes happen at least um
there was a book by francis h fay called
ecology and biology of the pacific
walrus where they write that on numerous
occasions i have seen walruses resting
or sleeping in the water
with their tusks hooked over the edge of
the ice their body laying either
horizontally or vertically in the water
the tusks appear to function both as a
prop for the head keeping the mouth and
nostrils out of the water
and as an anchor preventing the animal
from drifting away with the current
um so it does seem like it does
occasionally happen it's not the only
way they sleep
um but from time to time they will do
this it's so sweet they're very
promiscuous sleepers aren't they
what do you mean they have sex no i
don't at all i just mean they
they'll sleep anywhere they'll sleep
around but yeah
literally around us in different
locations so
imagine if that was another meaning of
that the misunderstandings you would
have
that's what i've been saying for years
yeah yeah when we're on tar you always
tell your wife oh i've been sleeping
around for the last two weeks
absolutely
[Laughter]
um but they sleep um leaning over if
they're in captivity they'll just
lean up against the edge of their pool
and sleep there or they
they sleep on the bottom of the water as
well which is magical but for briefly
because otherwise they will die that's
the most common way they sleep is on the
bottom of the water but then they come
like you say wake up every now and then
just to breathe i think like every it's
every three minutes they have to come up
to the surface it's not really
yeah it's just a nap really that they're
having but they don't they
they can sleep up to 19 hours can't they
so that's yeah it's a hell of a
when they're doing the 19 hours sleep
they're somewhere much more comfortable
yeah that is like having such severe
sleep apnea really isn't it
is it just every three minutes oh my god
yeah but they could sleep for 19 hours
but they could also swim non-stop for 84
hours sometimes it's crazy so
they're just pretty hardcore isn't that
one of the longest
that any animal is known to stay awake
in in one go
it's very unusual so humans can stay
awake that late
that late that long but if you stay
awake that long
you're gonna do yourself some damage and
you you basically have to have someone
holding your eyes open the whole time so
it's possible but it's really unusual
but they
actually do it semi-regularly so just
actually how they managed to go up and
down in the water is quite interesting
actually so when they do wake up
on the bottom and need to get to the top
they've got pharyngeal pouches which are
these air sacs between
like sort of their throat and their
chest and around their sternum and they
can hold 50 liters of air
which is about the same i realized as
four party balloons
which actually i was mostly surprised at
how many liters party balloon can take
but that's a lot though isn't it because
presumably it must blow up like a party
balloon
yes you can actually see the little
lumps i think can't you when they're
inflated
and that takes them to the top and that
means that they can bob up and down
vertically and i think they can sleep
like that
wait hang on anna it doesn't take them
up to the top if they're at the bottom
of the sea and they haven't remembered
to inflate their pouches
there's nothing they can do about that
they usually
stay up when they're up yeah sorry when
they breathe out do they kind of fly
around like a party balloon
yeah sometimes you hear that squeaking
farting sound when you're in
oh that'd be terrifying because they
they weigh over a ton
some of them one of those untethered in
a room and flying around would do a lot
of property damage they can eat
as many as six thousand clams in a
single feeding
session uh and i went on morris yeah one
walrus in one session
six thousand clams and i went onto the
website of a
um seafood merchants in borough market
and that would cost
fifteen thousand pounds per meal if they
bought their welks and clams
i don't know what sort of lovely media
wars is your
market is an expensive place
um they're so cool they're so weird
their skin is amazingly thick obviously
because they need to keep warm in the
water
but their skin is four centimeters thick
which is about 30 times thicker than
human skin
and then under that they have another is
it 10 centimeters of blubber
which is it's such a thick layer they're
pretty toasty i think
in the water that's a lot and well
they're so heavy that a good way to hunt
them if you're a polar bear
if there are any polar bears listening
is to cause a stampede
so they're actually quite difficult to
hunt as a polar bear because they're so
massive on their own it's quite hard to
kill one on on its own
but they always hang out together in
huge groups and they're so heavy that if
you start chasing them they'll stampede
over each other and they'll often crush
a few of them a few of each other on the
way
and then you can pick up pick up the
leftovers the young ones um
are incredibly cute um i know we were
saying the bigger ones
might not appear cute i think they are
but the young ones definitely are and
they're also really sweet with humans as
well so
there's been a few scientists that have
talked about the fact that when a baby
walrus
is when they're working with baby
walruses it will sort of rest its head
on the scientist's lap um and then
it won't feel just content with that it
will try and climb
onto the scientists as if to just cuddle
it in the way that a small puppy would
just want to get on top of you and and
sort of cuddle into you
um cute but what if it thinks you're a
nice flow and then tries to
dig it that's what it feels like humans
with ice fluids yeah they're not not
wells mate they're not just going to go
stab at anyone it feels like they're
climbing on top of you like they think
you're a lump of ice or something
though yeah i think it's no it's because
they're thigmotactic so they're very
similar to earwigs in this one way
which is that they're positively
thigmotactic which means that they love
being touched they're incredibly social
like you say and they really that's why
they're often huddled together in big
groups because
they are always touching each other 90
of walruses will be touching another
walrus
[Laughter]
and so when you look after them when
they're in captivity like at the alaska
sea life center i think for instance
they employ four people round the clock
per walrus
to be there just hugging it and keeping
it from oh no
wow that's what they do four walrus
huggers for every walrus
wow they serve other purposes as well
you know they feed you you can't do much
you're a walrus you know you can
be on your phone you could be
yeah you're right but then i mean no one
wants to be hugged by someone who's also
like doom scrolling down twitter this is
a really good point
the walruses do have a tendency to go
look can you put your phone down
having a moment um i was looking up an
an experiment that was done uh on
walruses and this was in 2009
you know six flags the theme park in
america
no um um so it's a huge chain of theme
parks in america
um and they they have a few branches all
over the place
but in 2009 six flags in california
built an artificial walrus vagina
did they okay yeah like a roller coaster
[Laughter]
it was not for the public to have a go
on okay
what was it for then is it a theme park
it's a walrus vagina
yeah this this is an animal focused
branch of the theme park and they have
some they had a few walruses in
and they wanted uh their walrus sivuk
to um perform some sexual acts so they
could get their first ever
semen sample of water oh i see yeah
um and there was a scientist called
holly uh morasso or morocco i'm not sure
how that's pronounced
but she um was in charge of this
and they the largest artificial vagina
on the market was too
small um they did buy one which was used
for cart horses but it was tiny
compared to what's even they come to my
um summer's party that i had last week
well his penis was 22 inches around and
they had to custom build it from a big
old pipe
um wow that was just too huge that's
amazing so and i wrote
i wrote to her i wrote that scientist
but she hasn't got back in touch with me
i
said i said did it yeah amazingly
contact sadly i don't think it worked
did it
i think he died i think civic died uh
childless
um he was very obedient though i think
super cac so
he was very good at exposing himself and
she learned what turned him on so she
realized that when there were workmen
using power tools hammers and stuff
nearby he would expose his penis
and that he just particularly liked
those sounds he was aroused by them
and so eventually they made these
certain noises to make him expose
himself
and then they trained him eventually to
roll over and expose himself on the word
penis
so you just shouted imagine if he
listened to this podcast
he'd never get back on his back again
one thing i found interesting about
um walrus vaginas actually and
i assume this is true of lots of other
animals but i've never seen it before
is where male walruses are famous for
having
bones in their penises the baculum which
is
the longest i think in the animal
kingdom the walrus speculum
but they also have a clitoral bone
walruses so they have a bone in the
clitoris and this is something that does
happen in a few animals but is obviously
less common
than in um than the penis bone and it's
called
a barbellum i've never heard that word
before
a clitoral a barbell b-a-u-b-e-l-u-m
and that's what you call a clitoris bone
so look out for that word
and their teeth are very crucial as in
their tusks
so they have a hierarchical system but
the most important thing to your social
status
they think in walrus hierarchies is the
tusk so if you break your tooth if you
have a bike accident or something
then suddenly you go from being the most
sought after desirable man on the block
to being nothing wow very soft oh that's
awful
they do walk on them don't they on their
teeth what do you mean
um they sort of walk on them and in fact
their
name their scientific name is odobanus
rosemarus which literally means tooth
walking seahorse
it's a combination of latin and old
norse and it's because they
jam their tusks into the ice to drag
themselves along but like locking onto
the
icebergs yeah they do and they also use
them to break up the ice so there was an
example of
a the females get very um protective
over their children so
if you get in between the child and the
and the mother then she'll come after
you
and there was an example of some
scientists kind of moving a child from
one place to another and
the mother came after them and kind of
slammed her face down with her tusks
into the ice and used it as an
icebreaker to open up the
roots wow that is so cool
it's scary that's the stuff of horror
films
i know because they swim really fast as
well like they can swim three times
faster than michael phelps
22 miles an hour max speed so imagine
that coming at you with smashing down
its
tusks and swimming at three times as
fast as fast as michael phelps stands
still cute or
i all i'm thinking is earl tupper missed
a trick by getting just fish he should
have strapped a walruses
stop the poker stop the podcast hello

on with the show
[Music]
okay it is time for a final fact of the
show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that for many years
the horror film
the unknown was missing because the last
surviving print was accidentally placed
into a pile of hundreds of film cans all
marked
unknown so this was a movie that was
made in 1927
and it was fairly popular in its time
start a very big actor called lon chaney
and the prince as for a lot of movies
around this time uh just went missing
and no one knew where it was
and in 1973 after years and years of it
being missing
um it was discovered in the archives of
the cinema tech frances which is
a big institution in france that has
lots of archived movies
and someone must have accidentally taken
their copy and popped it into
a big room that had a bunch of unknowns
of films that had no information about
them and so there it sat for all these
years until
they uncovered it um and it's great that
we have it again because as i say lon
chaney a big deal in his day
sounds like an amazing movie doesn't it
yeah it's about
well it's about this guy who is a
criminal
and he goes to the circus pretending to
be someone with no arms
and so to do that he kind of ties his
arms to his torso
and then wears a shirt and clothes so no
one can tell that he actually has
arms and then he falls in love with this
um
woman nan played by joan crawford before
she became really famous
uh and she is terrified of being touched
by
men so that works even better that he
doesn't have any arms even though he
does have arms
and then much made in heaven i know it
isn't it
and then well it is until she finds out
on his wedding night that he ourselves
anyway so um he then um has a rival
called zanzi
uh and kills him but the police can't
take any fingerprints from him because
he doesn't have any arms
and so he escapes how does he kill him
he has arms
he has sorry everyone he doesn't oh my
god
i fell into his trap i think he took my
arms i should have known
did he did he kill him because zanzi or
whatever he's called saw that he had
arms and he was like there's nothing
left to do now but for me to kill you
you know what i've gone too far already
because we're always giving away
spoilers on this show and i get so much
for it on twitter i'm not going to
tell you what happens at the end of this
movie but it's really good
and one amazing thing about it is that
what was the name of the guy who played
him down
von chaney and c-h-a-n-e-y and we cheney
yeah
yeah that's right but he had a stunt
double called paul des mook who didn't
have any arms
uh because in the play the character had
to like
drink with uh his feet or he had to
throw things for his feet in the in the
circus he was like a knife thrower but
he did it all with his feet
and so he had this actual performer
called paul desmook who would do all
this stuff for him
and the way that they did it is
sometimes he would double for him if you
could do it with the shots and stuff if
you could not see his face
but most of the time des mook was doing
the same job but he was
doing it just with his legs and
perfectly synchronized his legs
with the actor's body and so they cut it
so you only saw the top of the ax's body
and the bottom of the stump doubles wow
so they could do all that stuff isn't
that cool that's so clever amazing
so a man with no arms pretending to be a
man with arms pretending to be a man
with no arms
it's many layers it's like the
shakespearean boys pretending to be
girls to be
boys isn't it yeah yeah
is that yeah boys with no arms who'd
like girls
who have arms
um dan you mentioned lon chaney yeah he
does sound incredible
yeah so he he played so many different
things
um he played lots he was called the man
of a thousand faces
because he appeared in all these
different costumes all these different
roles he played
i mean i've written down clowns and
pirates i imagine his brain was even
broader than that
um he played lots of foreign people
which obviously you probably wouldn't do
today
but in the 1920s he played so many
different roles and kinds of person that
there was a popular joke and this was
the joke
it was don't step on that spider it
might be long trainee
[Laughter]
and he was he was a master of disguise
in terms of his dedication to
makeup uh within the movies he was in so
like this for example there's one movie
where he plays both the hero and the
villain
um and he's so convinced that his makeup
could transform that
when he played quasimodo in the
hunchback of notre dame
he took the idea of having a growth over
his eye so
seriously that with the makeup done it
resulted in him having permanent
short-sightedness off the stress that he
put on onto his body
he he often used to put himself in
physical pain in order to get that
appearance right so he when he was
playing a legless criminal mastermind so
he in another movie played a legless
criminal
um he bound his legs into a tight
harness
and that actually cut off a lot of blood
vessels in his legs so that he did kind
of lose the use of his legs
but then for the sequel he didn't have
to have a stunt double so that was
useful
so yeah exactly but yeah and and he was
a he was a big guy he was a silent movie
guy that was in that transfer
to the talkies and um in fact when when
it became the talkies was so interesting
he wrote for his first movie because he
did five different voices
in his first ever talking movie he
signed a statement to attest to the fact
that it was in fact his voices
and this was sort of published so that
people believed that it was him
who had an actual voice and that he was
talking um
he said publicity for the film so
because people wanted to hear him talk
yes exactly it knows publicity just to
say you may think that this is
being dubbed i'm not just the man of a
thousand faces i also do voices
um a thousand faces five voices no legs
yeah and these lost films are incredible
the ones that keep popping up everywhere
and you mentioned the cinema tech
francaise was it dan
yes they've been recategorizing their
films since 1992
so um nearly 30 years now they still
have another decade to go they've just
got so many films that they're trying to
work out
what they all are it's quite hard to
tell the difference between a lost film
and a film that no one's looked for yet
i think this is a problem that the bfi
had
when they created in 2010 their 75 most
wanted
films list and they've been finding them
at a rate of knots
really i mean as soon as they publish it
people getting in touch oh yeah i got
the dvd of that
yeah yeah which is such
great news they've so of the top 75
they've discovered 18. i think
maybe one of them or a film that was
famously lost was gaslight
which is interesting because the reason
it was lost is because mgm
tried to gaslight us into thinking it
didn't exist
confusingly so this was the original
film called gaslight was released in
1940 and i think it was a british
version
and then mgm got the rights to it and
released it in 1944 but they got the
right on the one condition that all
copies of the 1940 film even all the
negatives were completely destroyed
so that if anyone said what's the film
gaslight they'd be is this one
what are you talking about film gaslight
and the only reason actually we have the
original 1941 is because the direct
rover who was called
thorold dickinson much cooler names in
the olden days
had made his own personal copy and so he
went and produced it
and that's where the word gaslighting
today comes from isn't it
because it was the movie maybe based on
a novel i'm not sure but it's
based on someone's boyfriend who tries
to convince her that she's gone mad or
something right yeah
isn't it i think it's isn't it he tries
to convince her that it's something to
do with gas lighting
in the house i can't yeah so he says
yeah yeah so he's always he basically
makes the lights go down lower and then
she who's played by ingrid bergman um
says the lights have gone lower and he
says no they're not you've gone mad
and then there's lots of other stuff i
mean that's not a really an obvious
symptom of going mad
is it really he should have like dressed
as a rabbit and danced around in the
front room and
said did you see that he's like what are
you what about that would be that was
the next scene
he should have got lon chaney in to do
one of his weird
jumping around with no arm chaney
appears to be stuck in the bath
no no
you mind playing tricks again oh that's
a long chain is back and this time he's
got eight legs
[Laughter]
one famous movie that's missing is
the arrival of a train at vansen station
by george mellier so one of the
oldest of all of cinematographers a
french guy
who did lots of really early very very
short movies of
things happening for instance trains
arriving at stations and stuff like that
but what i find really interesting about
this one uh it's an 1896
film which we don't know where it is but
what we do have
is we have a flip book of the film
which in 1896 is essentially the same
thing
yeah so cool the what just every frame
has become every frame has become a page
in the book
wow have they stitched it back together
to turn it back into a film they should
do something
oh they should because then they can say
it's based on a book
[Laughter]
that's popular for films there is
weirdly just a combo fact there there's
a myth
that when film was in its infancy um
there was a silent movie it was just of
a train arriving in a station
um but it was i think it was face on it
might have been
by the lumiere brothers so the the train
is coming right towards the camera
oh yeah yeah there was a myth that this
was so
realistic and terrifying for the
audience who'd never seen
cinema before that the audience bolted
they all just themselves on mass
every one of the 500 people
themselves
that's not the
anyway it doesn't seem to have ever
happened that's the thing no one has
ever bolted or
shot themselves on mess if they still
wanted to betray
um another film which has gone missing
is the first
film ever directed by an african
american
uh and actually loads of these have gone
missing so there was a thing which i
didn't know about
um which went from 1915 all the way up
to the 1950s called race films
and what it was was hollywood was making
all these movies
but at the same time other people were
making films
specifically for black people so you
would have black directors you would
have black actors you would have black
producers you have
basically black people doing the whole
thing but they would only be shown
in theaters that were usually segregated
so that only black people could even
watch them
and there were like hundreds and
hundreds of these things made but almost
all of them went missing
and then in 1983 there was a um
place called the southwest film video
archives in dallas
and they rang up um this kind of
historian and said look there's a load
of old
tapes here and they're just taking up a
load of space we're going to get rid of
them
do you want to have a look through them
and he went okay well i'll go and have a
look through them and it turned out that
it was
all of these old what they call race
films and now we have loads of them back
and they're restoring them all
and people can watch them again wow
yeah it's amazing how little people
thought ahead at the time
it's something that actually alex our
colleague gets really uh agitated about
when
so much the bbc's archives have gone
missing because they just didn't really
preserve stuff well they taped over it
it wasn't that it went missing
they decided that all these tapes were
useless
hanging out in the back rooms classic
comedies
that were made were all destroyed so
peter cook british comedian
he he begged the bbc to give him the
tapes so that they wouldn't be destroyed
i'll buy you new tapes he said and you
can have fresh ones and they still said
no it's our property so we're just going
to make sure it's kind of destroyed
and yeah so it wasn't even lost it was
actively destroyed
we should say why they also why there
are so few another reason
apart from people destroying them is
that they just burn so
easily they set on fire the early film
nitrate film it can combust at 41
degrees celsius
so you're in la i know i mean
it's and also the other problem is that
it has to go through a projector gate
obviously
reels of film you know balanced or
projector pushing it through the
projector's gate creates friction guess
what that does
frequently sets it on fire it and also
it's it
the substance is made of nitrate film it
produces more oxygen
as it burns which adds to the flame
it can keep burning even if you put it
under water
um it's staggering that any of this
stuff is even left on the planet it's so
unstable it just doesn't want to exist
in a stable form
so one movie that was destroyed uh in
the 1920s
was a movie called humorous which was a
movie that was the only silent movie of
the marx brothers this is before they
went into talkies themselves
and it was destroyed on purpose because
groucho marx hated it so much that he
bought up the film
and he burnt it so that no one could
ever see it again and you always hear of
artists who dream of that scenario of
being able
to go and and remove from the shelves
george lucas did a christmas special for
star wars his dream is to sledgehammer
every single copy
out of existence and no one can but
groucho marx managed it
he got rid of the history wow that's
like i mean this is
off topic we're just thinking of people
who hate the films they've produced and
which they were destroyed i remember
reading an interview with patrick
stewart who said that
um his biggest regret was doing a film
called wild geese 2
and he said the only reason he took the
role is because he was offered the exact
same amount of money for it as
a repair for a window in his house had
just been quoted
what kind of windows he's got nice
windows yeah
oh my god the guy who was his glazier
must have been just like steven
spielberg in a mustache or something
yeah this will cost you 13.6 billion
dollars
um do you guys know when the last silent
movie star
died well how do we define silent movie
star because for instance the guy and
the artist
that was a silent movie wasn't it oh i'm
not counting jean dujar down to the
silent movie star
no way sorry last person from the
original silent movie
i would have said they were probably
they became talkies in the 20s didn't
they is that when
that so let's say someone was 10
when that came out and they died when
they were 100
then possibly a couple of years ago yeah
yeah
i'm gonna say there was a kid who played
the kid in the movie the kid
[Laughter]
but did you not see the prequel to that
the fetus
lon chaney played the fetus yeah and he
built himself an entire
uh womb amazing but jackie coogan was in
that movie
the kid and i i'm gonna say him he was
he was uncle fester in the adams family
as well he died in the 80s
okay so all right so james and anna are
saying the last couple of years and
you're saying the eighties down
yeah james now are it's 20 20. um baby
peggy was her name
um not her forever she lost the
she lost the baby element actually she
lost the peggy element she changed her
name
um but she was so famous she was one of
the highest paid movie stars in the
entire 1920s which was a
gold rush time in hollywood she was so
famous she was the mascot of the 1924
democratic convention in new york wow
she turned up on stage next to
not sure who was rude's fault or someone
um but that was back in the days of
silent conventions wasn't it
oh for those days again
um the last adult man to be in a silent
movie was a guy called shep horton and
he
only died in 2017 and he was inside shep
horton
shepparton yeah h-o-u-g-h um but he was
called
the last of the great nobodies
incredible so he was in hundreds of
films
he was in gone with the wind the big
sleep cleopatra wizard of oz but always
just as a kind of handsome dude in the
background
and um but you can see him in all these
films they've tracked loads of the
movies he's in he was in a dozen films a
month
wow i know you feel like he definitely
when he that was on his cv he coughed
over the last word didn't he
well they know they called me the last
of the great
after he died they put his uh gravestone
in a pile of other gravestone of nobody
okay that's it that is all of our facts

good bye

=358
[Music]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
is dan schreiber i am sitting here with
anna toshinski
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again we have gathered around
the microphones with our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in a particular order
here we go starting with fact number one
and that
is james okay my fact this week embrace
yourselves people
is that founding father of the united
states of america governor morris
died after sticking a whale bone into
his own penis
i mean you would expect that you might
die after sticking it to someone else's
penis because they would be so angry
with you yeah
he did it to himself he did it to
himself it's it's quite a sad story
and it's quite a funny story today quite
funny yeah i mean
like was this the like the asphyxiwank
of the 18th
okay so basically first of all
governor morris um you might know him if
you've never heard his name
said as governor morris because that's
how his
first name is pronounced but he was a
big deal he was
known as the pen man of the constitution
he signed
the articles of the confederation and
the constitution
he helped plan the erie canal he helped
lay out the streets of manhattan
he's a real proper big deal in the early
united states
but he had some problem with his urinary
tract
uh we don't know exactly what it was it
could have been just a uti or urinary
tract
infection it could have been something
more serious but whatever it was he
decided to self-medicate
and try and clear the blockage in his
penis
and what are you gonna do that with
obviously with a whale bone
and when i say a whale bone i don't mean
like the backbone of a blue whale or
something like that
it was a kind of almost like an early
plastic which was taken from the baleen
of wales
so it could have been like you know the
the
ear of a pair of spectacles or the
handle of a knife or something that was
all that stuff was made out of well bone
anyway he took a piece of this
put it in his penis gave himself a very
even worse infection
and eventually died of said infection
such a shame i really hope that the day
before he did this he was having a chat
with friends going what do you think in
like
200 300 years they're gonna remember
imagine a podcast as a fact about me
what do you think that's gonna be
it's so unfair because he's one of the
most interesting
people he's one of the most interesting
founding fathers i think there's so much
amazing stuff about him
and yet i think this is the only thing
holding it back from him having a big
budget musical about him i should have
been
morris instead of hamilton i don't
really want to see the final part of
that
musical hamilton was so clever to get a
duel and die of that rather than the
whalebone thing
[Laughter]
um so this was a guy he was very like
andy says an
extremely crazy character of the late
18th century
he was he was quite a um he's quite
letharia wasn't he as well which is
something that comes up as much as his
sort of political achievements the fact
that less than the whale boat up the
penis
that's the ranking order yeah whalebone
penis penmanship of the constitution
likes to kiss ladies a lot that's that's
the order and um
yeah he he sort of um he had a lot of
injuries that were supposedly
connected to his womanizing um he had a
peg leg for example
uh later on in life and that was a
result supposedly of him trying to
escape
a furious husband that's a rumor but not
true yeah i agree i think it's not true
he did have a carriage accident and he
lost the leg in that
um and it's a really tragic story that's
the bit i assumed you believed daddy
yeah i didn't think
yeah i did it was the husband running
away no but he clearly did do a lot of
running away from husbands in his time
but um he was taking the reins of a
carriage in
uh new york i think it was in new york
maybe he was elsewhere he was taking the
reins of a carriage and the horses
bolted and his leg was broken in several
places
um and then his regular doctor wasn't
available
and the doctor they got in said well
we'll have to amputate this below the
knee and so they did
and then his real doctor his regular
doctor came back and said oh we could
absolutely have saved your leg
you can see why he started um
self-medicating later in life can't you
but he was okay with the the leg
amputation in fact i think that he
might have been happy about it because
it really cemented his reputation as a
bit of a character and even at the time
a friend visited him the day after he'd
had it off
and well that's probably where the
rumors started actually
they were like what happened with your
leg he's like oh i had it after like oh
really
um his friend was trying to do the good
thing of telling him the advantages of
his situation saying look with one leg
you're going to build up such great
strength of character
it's a great challenge to have to have
overcome in life you'll be a better man
for it
and morris immediately said you argue
the matter so handsomely and point out
so clearly the advantages of being
without legs that i'm tempted to part
with the other
so he took it in good humour
yeah didn't he used to also use it in
battle
really no i didn't yeah i think this is
another story
go on this is another story that he used
to beat off revolutionaries with his peg
leg
again take it off beat off is another
thing where he was interpreted
but i think that there was one incident
where he was posted to paris
by washington and it was around about
the time when there were quite a lot of
revolutionaries on the streets of paris
and they said don't come out in your
carriages and he'd come out in his
carriage anyway
and they descended on his carriage one
time and apparently he said that he
stuck
his wooden leg out the window and said
something like oh look i've got this
fighting for freedom too so lay off
and they did yeah they were shouting
he's an aristocrat he's an aristocrat
because he's in a lovely carriage and
then he shouted
yes trudy one who lost his leg in the
cause of liberty and he kind of
brandished his wooden leg at them
but there's another version of the story
where he just pulled off his leg and
shoved it out of the window to distract
the crowd
and they all started facing like one of
those lizards that kind of
cuts off the end of their tail
[Laughter]
wow as a two-year-old he was sold for
six hundred thousand dollars
what really i'm joking that's a
racehorse also called governor morris
there aren't many governor morris's are
there i mean governor itself not a very
popular name
governor um it was actually his mother's
maiden name
and it's what's morphed in to be
governor today the spelling has turned
into our modern day spelling of governor
but i did outside of your racehorse andy
i found one other governor morris which
was a novelist
governor morris iv who was actually a
descendant
of governor morris's and he wrote a
bunch of novels
um and his novels were often adapted
into movies including one called the
penalty
uh which was released in 1920 um and it
was about
a legless man and starred lon
chaney good friend god
as referenced in last week's episode in
that film den
he plays a man with no legs whose legs
will unnecessarily amputated
just like that of governor morris
feels like they didn't use much
imagination for the plot of this film i
just basically looked into the family
history of one of their
lead men i think they had a punch on for
weird names because
one of his brothers was called stat
how many a's did you know okay it's only
a double a but how do you pronounce the
double a is s-t-double-a-t-s
um governor morris's wife's middle name
was gary
do you know why you know what i thought
that
and i read somewhere that she was called
gary but then i
just doubted myself and quickly googled
it and on wikipedia she's called an
harry c-a-r-y morris
i read gary in a few places yeah that
was a big scandal as well because she
was
uh his housekeeper and she was a fair
bit younger than him 22 years younger
than him
and he wrote in his diary he had an
amazingly naughty diary where he wrote
all sorts of rude things that he'd been
up to he said i i'm married this day and
gary randolph no small surprise to my
guests
so he clearly liked you know causing a
fuss well because he surprised he
genuinely did
surprised him with it as a christmas
present i think he invited all his
family around for christmas dinner
as you do and then in the middle of it
uh
called the vicar in whatever got someone
to you know had planned in advance
called a vicarin
and gotten to marry them got him to
marry them in front of everyone
so i think it was quite a surprise not
what you expect well it would have been
surprised when they said
do you and gary randle it's like
that episode of only fools and horses
when they find out that rodney's middle
name is
whatever it is chelten or crystal palace
or whatever it is
we should say that part of the reason
she was controversial as well as being
his housekeeper is that she
was thought to have killed her baby yes
there were sort of two things
there was a housekeeper thing and there
was that did you kill your baby thing
yeah was earlier in her life she
married her brother-in-law hadn't she oh
no she had an affair with her
brother-in-law
apparently allegedly allegedly and so
much baby supposedly
allegedly came from that affair and she
was
allegedly so embarrassed that she killed
the baby but she said it was still born
allegedly yes but she was she was from a
bizarre
family by which i mean her family estate
was called bizarre
brilliant brilliant
that's great because we don't have to
say allegedly for that bit they can't
sue us
no they can't it's just a place called
bazaar
it's in virginia just i mean just on
this guy's actual
career which we probably should touch on
briefly because it was unbelievably
successful and obviously as james said
he was incredibly influential
one of the things he did was he came up
with the phrase we the people of the
united states
um and that this was in an early
draft of um is it the declaration or
is the constitution sorry so
that was in the constitution and the
phrase we the people of the united
states
in an earlier draft it was we the people
of the states of new hampshire
massachusetts rhode island providence
plantations connecticut new york new
jersey pennsylvania delaware maryland
virginia north carolina south carolina
and georgia and he said
i think we've got an edit in here and um
he came up with that lovely phrase
and this is claimed to have been an
absolute stroke of genius and does make
me think that we're bringing him up too
much
i reckon i could have come up with that
edit
and he left a bunch of spelling mistakes
in the actual document
there was a pennsylvania was spelt with
one n which apparently
sometimes it could be seen to be spelt
like that back in the day but not really
very often
well which which two ends did they
remove from pennsylvania
sorry it was pennsylvania
no it was sorry it was spelt with two
ends but without the double
and uh even worse there was a sentence
in the constitution
that said uh the the fragment is
necessary for executing its inspection
laws
and there was an apostrophe between the
t and the s
the possess of it on the declaration of
independence
um slightly different but around the
same time of course it's signed by
the founding fathers signed by one woman
or one woman's name was on there do you
know who that might be
gary gary that's how she got away with
it
everyone was like well gary's obviously
a man's name
who is it oh it's mary catherine goddard
uh
and the reason she got on there is
because she owned a publishing house in
baltimore and she
printed out the declaration of
independence
and at the very very bottom it says
printed by mary catherine goddard so
there is a woman's name on the
declaration of independence
and you might think okay well that's a
bit of a cheat and i suppose it kind of
is
but by doing that basically she opened
herself up to treason charges and stuff
like that so
you know it would have been very easy
for her to not put her name on there but
she saw it was such an important
document that she thought she should be
on there
it's kind of very cool um there's
a very famous statue that people
probably familiar with that is mostly
governor morris and that is the
is it the statue of long john silva
is it the whale the natural history
museum
oh no that wasn't most of it his penis
didn't take up most of his body
this is but he was very large very tall
and
he was a lot of people have commented
that the founding fathers many of them
are quite um short and rotund
and that's partly because they drank and
ate huge amounts while they were writing
the constitution
and he was tall and slim much like
washington
so when the great french sculptor who
don was commissioned to do
a sculpture of washington which is the
very famous one that's now
it's in the state capital of virginia
it's copied sort of everywhere
it's like he's got his hand on a pillar
and then another hand on a stick
that's washington's head but it's
governor morris's body
and this is yeah the sculptor popped
over to from france to
dc took lots of mass of washington's
face
took a lot of you know eye eye
photographs of his body
but then when he went back to france he
realized that
morris was in france as well so he
called him around to his house and said
can i use your body as the model for my
statue wow
um can i ask whose leg it is like well
is it like i think if you look maybe
it's gary's leg and if you look at it
it's an extremely spelt kind of woman's
leg and then a big man's body and then
washington's head
well if you do look at it one leg is
longer than the other
and that's why because he dressed him up
in washington's clothes
but his wooden leg had to extend to the
length of a shoe
so he wouldn't wear a shoe over his legs
so his leg was a bit longer than a
normal leg
so if you look at the statue the left
leg is a little bit longer than the
right leg
because wow that's a great fact
that's extraordinary that's a pretty
crap artist as well who couldn't
chisel away to make sure the legs were
the right leg
you can't fake it he was a realist
um so one reason for governor morris's
death um could have been the french
revolution um
in a slightly strange way and that is
because
um when the french revolution happened
everyone start
stopped wearing really posh aristocratic
clothes because as we said before
you probably get dragged out of your
carriage and thinking to death probably
or
guillotined or something and so um these
kind of big dresses that women wore had
a lot of
whale bone in them and so when the
fashion industry in france collapsed
they had all this
spare whale bone and the price
absolutely plummeted
so it was something that you used to not
be able to get very easily
and then suddenly you can get it
anywhere for any price and the result of
that was
this was a really useful material to use
and so they started using it in
everything and so you would have a
whalebone umbrellas and well bone
like i said before knives and um you
know spectacles and whatever
and so it was because of the french
revolution that he had so much whale
bone in his house
which meant i mean maybe he would have
had something else to stick up his woman
but
it was because of the revolution that he
had this whale bone to hand
i mean amazingly
[Laughter]
did whale bone-related penis deaths
rocket during that period when it became
widely available
i think it probably did yeah i think we
should say he had stuck something up his
penis before so
we can't exclusively
he he made a catheter once with a
flexible piece of hickory
hickory dickory [ __ ]
[Music]
stop the vodkas stop the podcast
hi everybody just wanted to let you know
that this week we're sponsored by bubble
yes babel is a app that helps you to
learn
tons of foreign languages using
interactive dialogue
speech recognition technology it's like
having an
actual teacher on your phone it is it's
so well designed and i had the most
exciting moment
yesterday thanks to babel i went to a
click and collect place
and through the nice window as the
person delivered my item to me
they looked at my name and they asked if
i spoke polish and for once i was sort
of able to say
what's your name yak mashnaemia and she
responded and i was so excited that i
have no idea what she was called because
i couldn't believe i'd got it right
that is all thanks to babel i've made a
new friend that's so cool yeah
also it's the perfect time right now
we're all certainly in the uk and
lockdown
and you've just got plenty of time to
master a language so that next time that
we are allowed back into the world and
you fly somewhere
like france or spain you can arrive
fluent
that is correct so make sure you fit in
on your next holiday whenever that may
be
by going to babble dot co dot uk
play and use the promo code fish and
that will get you six months free with a
purchase of six month subscription
that's right so go to babel dot co dot
uk
play and use the promo code fish you can
buy a six month subscription but then
you'll be given an
extra six months all for free so worth
doing do check it out
and back to the show now david tanya
what's that mean on with the show
it means goodbye i don't know what
onward the show is in polish come on
okay well our polish listeners have just
stopped listening so thanks
whoopsie okay on with the show
[Music]
okay it's time for fact number two and
that is
anna my fact this week is that before
entering a town in the wild west you had
to leave your gun
outside pick up a token and use that
token to collect your gun on the way out
much like leaving your coat in a bar
but wait a minute i've seen lots of wild
west movies and they all have guns all
the time
and yeah they're all fake they all take
place in the cloak room don't they
that sort of makes sense um
this is i was just reading a thing
recently about how gun control in the
19th century in the old
west was really strict and in most
frontier towns carrying any kind of
weapon so a gun or a knife or anything
was not permitted at all not just
publicly at all
except if you're outside the town
borders or inside your home so if you
lived in the town then you could have a
gun but you were only allowed to kill
people in your own house
and obviously people broke this law so
it's not totally fake when you see
westerns because
cowboys would go into the town and not
check their coat into the cloakroom
or their gun into the gun room and then
have big shoot-ups and people would die
well actually some of the like big
shootouts were as a result of
um people flouting the law and then
people trying to stop them from flouting
the law right
the famous one is the gunfight at the
okay corral and the whole
point of that is that the um sheriff
went over to these guys and said
you're not supposed to have guns here
mate and they went well we do so
bang that's yeah i mean that's not
that's not the whole two-hour film
of it's it should be though it's insane
so i was reading about the gunfight at
the okay corral i mean it lasted 30
seconds
so yeah there is a lot of padding in the
movie um
and i thought it was um wyatt erp you
know he's one of the famous sheriffs but
it wasn't really wyatt er
it was his brother virgil erp amazing i
mean people did just have better names
in america in the 18th and 19th
centuries
um yeah it was it was him and it wasn't
at the okay corral either
no yeah but it sounds better
it sounds better doesn't it andy well i
read somewhere saying it should have
been called the gunfight outside flies
photographic studio
yeah that doesn't quite work i think
that is better though because the
gunfight at the okay chorale has always
confused me because of the presence of
okay
which just means okay to us what is an
okay girl was it an amazing chorale no
no it was okay
three stars on google
which stands for old kindersley by the
way but
it's it's confusing before you've
researched it oh and what was that the
name of the person who ran the
corral yeah who ran the horse the field
oh really
yeah i'm annoyed that we don't have
photos of it given it was literally
outside a photographic studio well they
would have had to hold still for a few
seconds wouldn't they which
if it was a 30-second battle you had
enough time you're right i gotta say
that version that you're saying it
sounds a bit like the gunfight at snappy
snaps doesn't it
also i didn't know what a chorale was
until researching this actual effect
what is it i mean i've
it's a horse and livestock holding pen
oh is it like where you corral horses
into the pen or something yeah
it's pretty much a car park it's the old
west version of a car park
okay so the wild west if you're in the
wild west
round about wild west time which i guess
we're talking sort of
late late 19th century there were camels
wandering around with you
in the early period really so i hadn't
realized that the
u.s just before the civil war decided
that
it wanted to start a camel corps and
the i think the logic was that it was
quite successful in egypt and the desert
plains in
parts of america was pretty similar to
egypt so they imported
75 camels altogether and they were
for they were for like the cowboy lands
for the frontier for expanding territory
so hauling supplies to and fro at the
frontier
and they weren't that successful partly
because apparently there was a very
strong mule lobby
which i think was people who owned mules
not the mules themselves
and then the civil war came and everyone
forgot about the camels
and they just wandered feral through the
deserts and they were all they were sort
of like that you know when people see
big cats these days in a garden in
berkshire
they were that equivalent in arizona so
there was in the 1880s arizona was
haunted by red
ghost which was a 30-foot tall monstrous
red camel which apparently trampled the
woman to death
30 foot tall it killed a grizzly bear
it there was one story about how someone
spotted it in the distance and
shot at it and it ran away and something
fell off its back
and the thing that fell of its back was
a human skeleton who had been strapped
to it obviously
long before anyway this was this is all
part this all came out
the fact there were camels wandering the
deserts and the stories got
less and less plausible as amazing
people spotted them
right so what what i'm saying is there
were camels but they weren't
30 foot tall and they didn't eat grizzly
bears got it okay
make sure you got the right part of that
story
there are other counts in america now i
don't there are probably some
there must be some in zoos and things
but i just i wonder if they're only
still feral yeah i don't think they're
any wanderers anymore
you know the lone ranger just to go on
kind of myths of the old west now yeah
i had no idea how successful so
it was a radio show one of the early
iterations was the radio show
which ran for 20 years and 3 000
episodes it went through about eight
different lone rangers
wow yeah there was one time where the
actor played the lone ranger it was a
guy called earl grazer
he was killed in a car accident but they
had to just keep making the show they
couldn't stop making it
so they just had him speak in a whisper
they just got in a replacement who was
clearly
someone with a completely different
voice and he just spoke in a whisper for
several episodes and um
tonto his sidekick had to do all the
actual dialogue and say what's that lone
ranger
i'm still feeling very bad and
they just kept making it it was quite
weird in the wild west how reality bled
into entertainment
in a semi-confusing way right so buffalo
bill was he a real cowboy or was he an
entertainer cowboy
he it feels like they really bridge the
gap so he started out as a bison hunter
and he fought in the war and you know it
was great with a gun
and then he sort of turned that
lifestyle into this amazing
show but he was incredible he his career
started out with being a buffalo hunter
hence the name
and he once killed six thousand buffalo
in one year
that's a lot it's too many buffalo he
was sort of single-handedly responsible
for the near extinction of buffalo
that's 20 buffalo a day
how did he do it did he do that thing
where you kind of chased them off a
cliff and they all
there really big incident where he
knocked off a few thousand in one go and
they
could take a few days off this exhausted
buffalo
because he must have had a few weeks
holiday wasn't he so it's even more than
that
you can't take a holiday as a fight and
hunter it's just
you gotta keep going he once killed 48
buffalo in 30 minutes
but yeah this america started out with
millions of buffalo
in the 1600s and by the end of the 19th
century
really partly because of him they had a
couple of hundred left
wow one last thing about the lone ranger
yeah um
in the tv series he was played by a guy
called clayton moore and after the
series ended
he kept doing public appearances as the
lone ranger right
the guy who bought the rights to the
lone ranger uh got a restraining order
against the lone
ranger clayton moore saying you can't go
out wearing your mask in public you have
to take your mask off in public right
stop
pretending to be people i'm ready in
2031 isn't it yeah
you must not wear a mask in public and
clayton moore was so wedded to the
character that he started instead just
wearing huge wrap around sunglasses to
make it look like he was wearing a
domino mouth like a lone ranger
anyway this led to a huge controversy in
about 1980 and he went on the show
real people to discuss the controversy
ironic considering he was pretending to
be
someone who he wasn't but he came on
stage for a live broadcast interview
and he was the lone ranger he was so
popular clayton moore
that the studio audience who were there
they applauded for so long when he came
on that it used up the entire broadcast
slot for the interview
of all the people that you want to have
two of the lone ranger is not
okay it is time for fact number three
and that
is andy my fact is that just off the
coast of kent is a sunken ship
which is under 24 hour surveillance
because it contains 14
000 unexploded bombs
and yeah it's it's extraordinary
and if it if they go off we don't really
know what's going to happen
something bad will happen if they all go
off well bad for the fish
probably really bad for the fish really
bad for shia ness which is the nearest
town and possibly there's a theory that
it could flood london
if they go off it'll create a five meter
wave which will just come up the thames
and
swamp london wow yeah five meters i
reckon i'm five meters above the terms
we're all right here
uh i'm upstairs at the moment so i can
hop upstairs
upstairs um so this was from
a guy called tom whitwell who uh he
every year he makes a list of the 52
best things he's found out during the
previous year
really great list i will i will post a
link to the the latest one and
it's a ship called the ss richard
montgomery it was an american ship
and in 1944 it was sailing um over to
france
it was taking 6 000 tons of explosives
to normandy to support the
uh invasion and it hit a sandbank in the
thames broken half
sank and it's just been there since then
with it
this is really creepy its masts are
poking up above the water
so you can see where it is and um
some of it has been excavated or you
know some explosives have been removed
from it
but there's still i think about 1400
tons remaining on there
and we're just waiting to see what
happens
it's absolutely nuts and there's a sort
of exclusion zone
that they've put around it because
they've had so many times where
uh a ship has almost hit it by accident
coming in
or in fact what they used to do is um
locals used to charge two shillings to
take people out
and literally touch the masts of this
ship
and they're like we need to stop doing
this this is a ginormous bomb
sitting underneath it it's extremely in
fact it's even worse than that because
um local fishermen sometimes when
they're trolling for fish will like pick
up some old ordnance or something like
that
and quite often they'll go well are we
gonna give this to the authorities
that's a bit of a hassle
and so what they do is they dump them
next to the ship because they
they know that it's an exclusion zone
and no one's allowed to go there anyway
so they think well that's the safest
place to just add
more bombs what are the odds of it
hitting one of the bumps already down
there
probably like one in three but it is
controversial what will happen
isn't it like some people like there are
some people who think actually
everything down there by this time
probably won't do that much damage
or even if one of them goes off probably
it won't set all the rest of them off
there's a guy called dave welsh i read
an interview
with the bbc uh and he was a former
royal navy bomb disposal expert
had they asked him about this and he
said if you've got a one thousand pound
bomb
two meters away from another one
thousand pound bomb in water
the other one won't go bank he said i
know i know that for a fact
i did it last tuesday so there is
there is some experts who think that
it's okay and then there are other
experts who think
it's just a matter of time before this
thing goes up yeah yeah
it's extraordinary the theories isn't it
that they've postulated so the
19 in the 1970s the royal military
college of sciences
looked into it as well what the
consequences could be as andy says you
know a
a giant wave would go into shore
supposedly the other thing they said was
if all bombs went off at the same time
a 3 000 meter high column of water
and debris would shoot into the air so 3
000
meters for context 1000 meters high
exactly that's three times the burj
khalifa more than that
that's how high they're saying that the
debris and water column would go
and the town itself um actually is quite
affectionate towards this ship
they call it the monty or old friend and
there's actually a large mural that you
can see there of a mermaid
detonating tnt um with the little slogan
you'll have a blast
which i have to say i've been to
sheerness and that is definitely
just a reference to the ship and not a
genuine
time you'll have no i i take that back i
absolutely loved my time there
some of the best um fish and chips i've
ever had were on sheerness
really oh yeah love [ __ ] um i did go
just on sheppy actually because i did go
on holiday to jeffy last year and it was
so great and the only other thing that i
learned when i was there about
it was that it was the home
of the first it was the home of the
first
live cargo flight ever and in fact
there's a sign that says
this is where the first flight by a
british pilot
in britain happened so it's quite
specific
a live cargo yeah so basically um
this was early 1900s it was a pig in
fact
okay but uh when they were doing like
they did it as a publicity stunt because
pigs
would fly was that that was exactly that
yeah
so this well you're not that old james
um but
well remembered um so it was sort of the
cradle of powered flight
in the early years of the 1900s in the
uk and the wright brothers visited and
they united with the short brothers who
are these british brothers who set up a
plane factory in
sheppy and there was this guy called
john moore brabazon
who did this flight the first british
fight by a british person in britain in
1909
and then he went to disprove the adage
that pigs can't fly
and so he strung a paper basket to
one of the wings of the aircraft stuck a
pig in it and flew amazing
on this this is completely off topic now
but it's just because i read this
yesterday
um there was a company in america um
that got all their employees
as a competition to try and make a lead
balloon
and uh this is i think in that either in
their early 80s or late 70s i can't
quite remember
and what they did was it was kind of an
advertising campaign or something like
that
and they got a load of teams together
and they said who can make a
lead balloon and they gave them
extremely thin
sheets of lead and as much helium as
they could
you know use to make the voices so funny
and i think there were six teams and
only one of them managed to make
a balloon which actually did float with
this helium um made out of lead
but unfortunately due to the wind
direction it started floating towards
logan airport
and they had to ring up logan airport
and say um hey there's a lead balloon
about to hit your airspace
i've just imagined the pilot saying oh
well it's okay there's a balloon in our
flight path but i think our engines are
going to make pretty short work of a
little balloon don't you ground control
comes in anyway avoid that balloon there
was a whole load of
yeah geforing i'm sure because of that
and they
had to ground flights for a little while
and then it was last seen floating
across the atlantic towards europe it's
still out there
it's still out there with the 30-foot
camel in the american desert
um so just on shipwrecks oh yeah um
unesco says there are three million
shipwrecks around the world which is
just
remarkable that's an estimate it's not a
tally but um
there are just so many out there and
i've got we're winning on shipwreck
are we are we tally we've there's about
250 000 around the coast of britain
they reckon just because obviously we're
in either nation and then lots of
naval activities happened and that's why
uh shipwreck diving is so popular in the
uk
which it is and i was reading a really
interesting blog by someone who's into
shipwreck diving about the interesting
thing about it and i hadn't really
thought through that you can't see
visibility is so poor that you often
can't see your hand in front of your
face
so you know you picture being able to
see a wreck like if you've seen titanic
yeah full wreck in front of you
actually you're often just swimming
around and so you crash into a wreck
before you've even seen it
and you feel your way around it so it
will just appear out of nowhere
yeah in 2019 three sailors were
shipwrecked off the coast of colombia
and they survived because they had
something to cling onto which was
floating in the water
which was the plastic wrapped bales of
cocaine that they were in the middle of
struggling
about a ton of cocaine hydrochloride
and they got picked up god what do you
do do you let go of that when you see
the coast guard coming
if you find anything in a shipwreck um
in the uk you have to
report it to the receiver of rec
uh this is according to the 1995
merchant shipping act
and if you don't do that and you keep it
and they find out you could be fined
or you have to pay their owner of
whatever you've stolen or whatever
you've taken
twice the value so if you take a million
pounds worth of gold you'd have to pay
the
spanish privateer from the 16th century
who you stole it from 2 million
but in 2001 um the receiver of the wreck
who was called sofia
exelby uh did a wreck amnesty
where anything that you'd taken which
you hadn't reported you could then
report and you wouldn't get done for it
uh and there's a whole load of list of
things that they took
um but weirdly loads of people seem to
have stolen toilet bowls
from shipwrecks and we can't really work
out why they do that so they're toilet
bowls toilet pumps toilet roll holders
chamber pots
all these things stolen from shipwrecks
that's because the one thing you don't
need in the sea
is a toilet bowl you just wee in the sea
guys
i guess you could do that but how many
cruises have you been on
[Laughter]
it's a long way over the side
just stick your ass out over the edge
and apparently they had one person who
handed in a pair of white lace panties
that they'd stolen from
a shipwreck got to be a recent shipwreck
that can't have lasted very long in the
unforgiving water around the coast
um so yeah i wrote to the receiver of
wreck as research for this podcast
the current one's camilla moore uh i i
just love the alternative title the
coroner of the seas
which is so cool and basically yeah as
james says if you find a wreck artifact
you have to report it's your duty to
report it to them
and then they make sure you get a fair
price for it but the fair price has to
be agreed with
the owner so there was a thing recently
where a load of shipping containers got
washed up
i think somewhere on the coast of maybe
dorset yeah there was like it was in the
news wasn't it that everyone was going
down there trying to grab what they
could wasn't it
yeah well quite a lot of people got new
motorbikes there was a consignment of
bmw motorbikes
and um bmw said oh they're water damage
they're probably only worth a couple
hundred quid
and quite a lot of people with new
motorbikes said well i'm just gonna keep
quiet then because i i think
this brand new spotless motorbike might
be worth a bit more than that
so yeah but what are they supposed to do
they're supposed to part them all up
outside camila moore's house then are
they
no you just get in touch and cheat yeah
you probably fill in a form or something
and say this is what i found yeah that's
fine i quite like because presumably
their job as well is identifying
pieces and having a sort of
understanding of the history of
of shipbuilding to be like oh this would
have been this part of the boat
for anyone who had who had collected
something and that's because that's the
thing that happens a lot you find these
pieces
um you don't know exactly what they are
and robert ballard
who discovered the wreck of the titanic
actually used a hotel in
anik in the uk to understand what
certain fittings that he'd found from
the titanic's dining room were
because in anik at the white swan hotel
they have a dining room which has the
exact not a replica but the exact
dining room from the rms olympic which
was one of the sister ships
of the titanic and when it got
decommissioned they removed
all of the wood and everything and it
was brought up by this hotel owner who
recreated the entire
room inside his hotel to the point that
ballard was going to that room to see ah
that's what that fitting would have been
covered yeah oh it's a table
oh it's not a handkerchief it's a pair
of white lace panties
what do you think of the dining room
that's what everyone wears to dinner on
shits
you need to get quick access if you're
pissed over the side of the boat
it feels like anna's been on a special
raunchy crew thinks that this is just
how all cruisers operate as opposed to
mostly being deck
oh look i've had some good holidays do
you know what the largest titanic museum
in the world is
i thought it's in belfast i think
it's in a place called pigeon forge
tennessee
which is very far inland um and it's but
it's half the size of the titanic and
it's shaped like the titanic
wow it's really cool and it's in a pool
of water so you feel like you're going
on the actual ship
is it yeah the titanic before the crash
or
yeah it's pretty okay well it is half
the size but they haven't just recreated
it
yeah let me just cut it in half yeah
fair enough
wow yeah um that's very weird because i
feel like pigeon forge is going to be
relevant later on in the show possibly
i was thinking the exact same thing a
forward spoiler
just back to camilla more quickly
receiver of the wreck her other job
not only does she receive rex but she's
responsible for dealing with all
stranded royal fish
oh really must keep her busy so all the
fish that the queen owns
which theoretically is all dolphins
porpoises and whales that get stranded
on british
beaches um they so they belong to the
monarchy since the 13th century i think
they made the rule because you used to
get whale oil and stuff for them and
technically the monarchy
can claim that whale oil and she's
responsible for dealing with them so if
a porpoise is stranded
you call camilla and she doesn't like
drag the whale over to buckingham palace
and say here you go your majesty does
she
he drops it at the queen's bedroom door
because you asked for this
700 years ago prince charles charles's
goldfish ever jumps out of its bowl and
accidentally gets stranded on the carpet
she technically is the person who has to
deal with it
big responsibility um anna you were
saying just before
that shipwreck-wise about 250 000 are
off the coast of the british
i think yeah i was amazed to hear
we don't know we don't know exactly how
many bombs are in
the oceans around the british isles
except for the fact
we do know that just after world war ii
the british government dumped
roughly 1.17 million tons of
chemical weapons and conventional bombs
into the sea
just off our coasts um and i should
quickly say
i got this fact as well as a lot of the
things i've been saying about the
richard montgomery
uh ship we've been talking about from a
vice article by a guy called joe
zedo it's a fascinating article about
what we're talking about right now so
give that a read if you can um but he
was saying that in 1995 while they were
drilling an
undersea gas line between scotland and
northern ireland they hit one of the
stashes of these bombs that had been
dropped down there
and it released a bunch of them and
within a month 4 500 of them had washed
up to the west coast of scotland
so we just got bombs washing up our
shores and jesus nitroglycerin vials and
that's terrifying it was only one
nitroglycerin bile wasn't it one child
said that i did that one reported
oh yeah yeah there is a place in russia
which has a
ship's graveyard of nuclear submarine
engines which sounds
terrifying so it's a place called the
karasi um
and the problem is that nuclear
submarines they last about 30 years and
then they
they start rattling they get a bit
noisier in the water so they're less
secret and the technology gets outdated
and you're just building better subs
and at its height russia had 245 nuclear
submarines
which is a lot of nuclear power in the
water
and so now there is this place which
contains um
14 nuclear reactors and 17 000
containers of hazardous material
and um the russian authorities would
like to scrap these and properly scrap
them and decommission them but
apparently
it relies on recovery vessels which
don't yet exist
so this is a task don't don't build
stuff you can't unbuild
well the uk is similar i think we've got
we certainly had a couple of years ago
20 nuclear submarines left over from the
cold war that
we don't know what to do with can't
really afford to what did we
don't we just dump them next to this
thing
there was a plan wasn't there to put
like a massive concrete
um like um casing over this ship i think
you know like they did in chernobyl
but at the moment yeah every kind of few
years
the government kind of has a meeting
with some experts and they say what
should we do about this
and then at the end of the meeting
everyone goes should we just leave it ed
yeah that's yeah
so british it's really embarrassing
maybe the worst ever reason for a
shipwreck was in 2003 which was a two
and a half thousand
ton ship called the rms mulheim
and it was sunk by a pair of trousers
uh shall we work out why that happened
or it's not gonna be impossible
okay so what could a pair of trousers
done oh
someone snagged their trousers on
the port as the ship was leaving um but
the cloth was so strong
that it managed to pull down the entire
ship
you are not far off i must be miles off
no no that sounds like that would be a
trousers advert that's a levi jeans
advert for the durability
of that material what it was is it was
the officer who was on watch who was at
the bridge
he was sitting in a chair he tried to
stand up but
um his trousers snagged
and he lost him back he lost his balance
fell over knocked himself out
briefly by the time he came around the
ship was heading straight for the
shoreline
and there was nothing he could do about
it because it takes about five miles to
stop these ships so bang oh my god
shipwreck i'll be honest you said i
wasn't far off but really the only thing
i got
right was the trousers part which i
already
told the little clue yeah right
again i think attributing blame to the
trousers there is a bit like attributing
blame to the french revolution
for the death of old governor morris the
courts disagree with you anna because
the trousers were sued for 20
million pounds they're still in jail
they've been in prison since yeah
yeah do they have to wear prison
[Laughter]
trousers
[Music]
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that the nine to
five singer dolly parton
helped fund a covert vaccine that has a
protection rate of 95
percent nine to five
nine percent unfortunately unfortunately
not nine to five percent
um yeah totally pardon um she's amazing
with charity she's always making
donations to incredible causes and one
of the things that she did back in april
of 2020 was she donated a million
dollars
to covert 19 research and she sent that
to the vanderbilt university medical
center
and the money um went towards
the modern vaccine which came out which
has a
nearly 95 i've i discovered at the last
second it's sort of
94.5 percent uh effectiveness against
corona well there'll be letters
but everyone rounds it up to 95 so i
think i think we're safe
very good i should say i found this fact
while looking through twitter on the day
that it happened a lot of people made
this connection
um so it was a nice little joke going
around about dolly parton i thought
let's do it on the show do we think that
they suppressed the
effectiveness rate of the vaccine to
make sure that
they could create this fact could they
have made a 99 effective one but they
knew it would ruin the gag
uh but that was um jay-z had given the
money for that one hadn't he
[Laughter]
[Music]
or for older people uh nina from 99 red
balloons fame
um you know i just think that if you
kind of do your jokes for different
generations then
you know you get more hits don't you
absolutely absolutely
you'll stand up one out of three jokes
you'll get the other two
for the other two thirds of the audience
james the stand-up case is where the
audience is rigidly divided by age into
tranches and he'll turn to one set of
crowds they're all in triangles now what
you guys don't know about jay-z
is that dolly parton's pretty cool
yes i didn't know anything about dolly
parton apart
from big hair
and and she's famous also for her boobs
and
she sings knight i knew 95 and i knew
jolene and that's basically all i knew
but
my god she's had an interesting life she
grew up in a little place
in tennessee um which is i think better
known as the home of the world's largest
titanic museum
but belfast
pigeon forge pitcher yeah in extreme
poverty it was so poor there that the
funeral home kept sets of teeth
from people who'd been buried and you
could you could go down and get a set
if you wanted if you needed a set of
teeth really yeah
yeah and her and her family was so poor
she was the fourth of 12 children
supposedly they had no money to pay the
doctor who delivered her so instead the
dad
gave him a bag of oatmeal as payment
that was her
the first exchange wow she's got quite
an oat-based childhood
uh her childhood was bookended by oates
because then
after she graduated high school she says
that she got on a bus straight away to
go to nashville to make her
fortune doing music in the city and she
got on a bus with what she described as
her suitcase which was actually an empty
box of quaker oats
really which isn't gonna hold much
unless quaker is given
much larger much stronger boxes wow
that's amazing yeah they were so poor
that they had a lot of
animals that the father could find
didn't they so um
she said they would eat turtle frogs
groundhogs um but they never ate possum
because apparently possum is the most
disgusting meat that you can eat
around there wow absolutely never did
that yeah
she also used to get by on room service
that sounds fancy in nashville she would
walk up and down hotel corridors looking
for half-eaten trays of room service
that people had left outside
their rooms they must have stuck with
her throughout life the idea of
food not being available because even at
this age still on tour she always makes
sure she has a packed lunch or snacks
with her wherever she goes despite her
millions and despite
probably access to any restaurant she
wants she will always have things like
potted meat
or a vienna sausage with her in order to
be with her
so if you see like just in her pocket or
something she's always got sausage
those outfits are very tight and if you
look she you can see the outline of a
sausage
at some point on her person and she's
actually got a completely flat chest
but her bra is stuffed with potted meat
the only fact i really knew about dolly
parton before this is that she once
um lost a dolly parton lookalike
competition
uh that's like an old bit of trivia that
you kind of see every now and then but i
looked into it
and it's slightly different than that
she basically
entered a drag queen celebrity
impersonator contest
okay uh and there were loads of drag
queens there and they were all dressed
as different people like cher or dolly
parton or whatever
but they could be dressed as anyone they
wanted and also
they had to be drag queens so you had
this beautiful
kind of massive hair and all that you
know makeup and eyelashes and stuff and
dolly parton as great as she looked
was just dressed as dolly parton so
obviously she didn't look anything like
a drag queen pretending to be dolly
parton she looked like dolly parton
so of course she didn't win yeah that's
interesting i didn't know that
that's how they justify that sounds like
the judge's justification speech at the
end when he realized who she was
[Laughter]
how do we get out of this one she has
released over 200 albums
in her career 200 albums that's
so stupid that's like buffalo bill with
bison for me
like how could you do that many like 185
compilation albums worldwide
she's released oh 185 she's only made 15
albums and she's done 185 compilations
of incredibly different combinations
that's the thing if you're uh if your
album has
15 tracks in there are 15 factorial
possibilities
of putting those in any order so you
could do that but no no
you've got spotify now which does it in
a random order anyway you can no longer
justify
the 185 different orders she's had why
are we not releasing each episode four
different times
51 studio albums which i still think is
insane
that's a lot yeah it is mad and she says
she's written over 3 000 songs not all
of them have been
um recorded but that's that's a lot of
songwriting and with a lot of hits as
well jolene
as you mentioned andy i will always love
you which
for me i only know through whitney
houston but it is i only know it's good
i only know it through saddam hussein
that one that's that's a
it's a cool bat that if you don't get
then you're gonna have your suspicions
about james
and she wrote those two in the same day
actually which just spoke the question
what has she done for the last 40 years
given they're the two that's famous
it is like buffalo bill because he
killed like 48 buffaloes in six
hours which meant he could take a few
weeks off and she did the same she just
knocked them out she doesn't quite
remember if she wrote them on the same
day that's the
but they're all the same about the tape
or the same
the evidence that she has suggests that
they were written in the same set
yeah and she sort of says you know
people always say that was a good
writing day
you know so it's a she's she's got a
very good
she's a very good self-promoter in the
best possible way isn't she so every
interview she gives
she remembers these amazing details
about her life and then sometimes she
remembers slightly contradictory things
but she definitely knows that's such a
nice way of saying someone's a liar
she's a self-mythologizer yeah she's had
a long old life
and you know you can't remember
everything but she does say that she
wears stilettos to
make breakfast every day like she's
always dressed up it's not like she goes
home
takes off her wig takes off her makeup
is out the sausage
[Laughter]
chunks of meat out and devours them she
says she wants to make sure she's always
ambulance ready
which is quite a nice way of describing
it you've got to come at 4am
there's one of her songs that we haven't
heard which is called my place in
history
and it's not going to be revealed until
her 100th birthday
which is going to be the 19th of january
2046.
she should do it on her 95th birthday
shouldn't she really
yes but yeah it had nine to five
birthdays but it's locked in a box
in dollywood so if you want to petition
them to release it early james you can
but until then it's going to be in a box
and
they're going to release it then and i
don't know what happened that's very
exciting
cool yeah dollywood is very cool by the
way
um i mean not many people have their own
theme park and and dolly parton
is one of those rare few it's it's
packed with roller coaster rides and
and all sorts of fun things but she
inherited
an existing theme park which had been
changing
uh ownership for many many years it
started dollywood initially as a place
called rebel railroad
and the idea was that there was a steam
train they had a general shop as well
and a few other things but you could get
on this
theme inspired train and it was to
celebrate the centennial anniversary of
the civil war
so as you were on the train you would be
attacked by union soldiers
you would have trained robbers trying to
rob you you would have native americans
trying to rob you as well and you were
protected on board this train by the
confederates
who were fighting off the attackers as
they were coming for you that was what
dollywood
started as this little train it was a
celebration of the fact that the
confederates won the civil war wasn't it
certainly sounds like very confusing for
everyone if you're saying
if you're positioning it like that and
in fact dolly does say that when she was
growing up
one of the things she thought was that
the confederates won the civil war wow
when she was young yeah well she did
used to have a civil war themed
restaurant as well which was a dinner
experience called dixie stampede where
you had to choose
which side you were on north or south in
the civil war she has since changed that
a bit
well she actually she renamed it didn't
she quite recently dolly parton stampede
because
she didn't realize the word dixie had
quite problematic connotations with the
black community in america
dolly parton stampede however is a
terrifying name for something imagine
thirty thousand
poly parties stop leading towards you
oh yeah and just one more thing on
dollywood
dolly doesn't go on the rides herself
she's not tall enough is she
[Laughter]
she is five foot two she doesn't go on
it because she says it could damage her
hair
uh and she also said this is interesting
considering what we've been talking
about
she said lord knows what else could fall
out of me and i think that might be a
reference to the secret sausage
or the potted meat in the bosom
imagine if you're sat behind dolly
parton and just as the photo comes off
the sausage hits you in the face pepper
army cascade on the
loops
her marriage is sort of an amazing love
story isn't it
with carl dean who she's been married
for 57 years
although there have always been rumors
that he doesn't exist because he's never
ever seen in public
but she said that uh this is because in
1966 so just after they'd got married
she won this award for a song called put
it off until tomorrow
and they had an award ceremony to go to
and she got all dressed up he got all
dressed up they went to the ceremony
they came back home afterwards and he
said don't you ever make me go to one of
those damn things again
and she didn't and he just hates the
limelight absolutely loves
her obviously stuck it out for almost
six decades
um but he's never been to a gig either
you
you know she he doesn't need to be sat
on stage at the gig he can be quite
anonymous in the crowd
watching it but he's never gone to a gig
what if he doesn't like
what if he doesn't like her kind of
music he actually doesn't
he says he likes hard rock and bluegrass
and stuff
but he does actually see her perform
sometimes or at least he goes to her
gigs when she performs at state fairs
and that's because he really
likes going to the tractor pool
okay so he's hearing it in the
background he's knocked into her gig
to pull away keep it down over there i
can't hear the tractors
okay that's it that is all of our facts

the following podcast contains comments
that
some listeners may find upsetting
specifically people who are halfway
through reading anna karenina and don't
want to know what happens in the end
[Music]
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with anna tashinsky
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again we have gathered round
the microphones with our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order
here we go starting with you
anna my fact this week is that badgers
change their bedding
more often than i do wow
i don't think this makes me gross
because specifically badgers change
their bedding every 10 days oh you could
have said they change it
15 times more often than you do perhaps
[Laughter]
screw you okay they are very clean
unnecessarily clean really but yeah
they're amazingly assiduous with their
bedding they
air it so they have lots of straw and
grass and dried leaves and stuff that
they sleep on
and every 10 days they drag it out into
the open
and they pull it sort of backwards so
they're walking backwards pulling the
bedding in their four paws
and they roll it along and when they're
far enough from the entrance they kick
it away with their back feet
and then they leave it out during the
day to dry and air
and get rid of the fleas and stuff that
are on it
and then they drag it back in
coincidentally anna that is also
exactly how you clean your bedding as
well isn't it yes yeah
is this something you have in common
sometimes they sleep on items such as
crisp packets and other bits of rubbish
[Laughter]
there's nothing like feasts
it's tracey emin a badger is this what
we're discovering
pretty cool that they have bedding
generally we've sort of skimmed over
that yeah
that's just quite sweet i've never
pictured many animals with sort of bed
sheets and blankets
really um okay because you know when
they say that an animal lives in a
certain habitat
the habitat is the shop where they buy
all their bedding from
the art market badges yeah
but they do i mean if they were going to
habitat they do have
items in their bedding that kind of feel
up market like garlic
skins garlic pieces so as to create an
aroma and it's useful for them but i
mean that feels a bit habitat shop
doesn't it
it's really cool i read the other day
and this is off topic
already off topic but in um han dynasty
china they used to have a room where the
concubines of the emperor lived
and some of the emperors would put
szechuan peppers
in the paint or in the walls so that the
room would be kind of tingly and peppery
and stuff
because one it was it kept it nice and
warm but then on the other hand it was
supposed to be like um
a fertility symbol because it's got lots
of seeds
that sounds quite dangerous to me
because if you are in the sexy
spicy chili fertility room and you just
happen to lean against the wall for a
bit let's say you put your hand on the
wall and then later on you're taking out
your contact lenses whatever
um then you suddenly got a red hot eye
that's a really good point and also what
happens in the sexy fertility
room people are naked what do you not
want to touch
when you've got chilis on your fingers i
don't know i even when i'm naked in a
sexy room i'm really rubbing my genitals
against the wall
actually you're okay it's a good way for
the emperor though to find out who's
been sneaking into his concubine room
just by going everyone quickly rub your
eyes and whoever starts freaking out
all right mate busted come here eunuch
number 30.
uh anyway badges yeah they should keep
chili peppers in there in their sets
because their main problem is flea
infestation
probably help help them with that
wouldn't it but another clever thing
they do with their bedding is they use
it as radiators
so as well as sleeping on it and this is
especially in spring when they're having
offspring then they'll pull
fresh vegetation as opposed to sort of
dried up leaves and grass and stuff
they'll put in bluebells and other
fresh vegetation and they pull it into
their set
and then they pile it up in the corner
of their bedroom and
as it decomposes it emits loads of heat
and so
in that pile that pile can take the
temperature from 18 degrees to 38
degrees
that's really however vegetation really
yeah that's very they travel
far as well to get the materials don't
they they sort of have a 100 meter
radius
that they they like to go foraging for
they also
i believe are the only other british
mammal to build
toilets apart from humans so they they
dig their own
latrine pits and they will use these
pits
um more cleverly than humans use their
toilets i would say because they use
these as a communication device
um because they once they do a poo they
will then spray
it with a scent um from their glands
near the bottom to say who they are
what they're all about is the spray
is that sort of a freshening device like
and this is a strange personal piece of
information but like one of my
housemates has
installed in all our lava trees uh thing
called poo pourri
and insisted that all of us spray that
before we're gonna do a poo
and it apparently uh falls the scent
yeah it has to be before and then he poo
onto it and i'm just wondering if the
badgers are doing a version of that
so you spray you spray the inside of the
bowl as opposed to the room
exactly yeah yeah um and so
i don't know bad does it do you know one
badger is a real martinet it was like
look everyone stinks here's some spray
i wonder if you're really ahead of the
curve and in a year's time we'll listen
back to this podcast and go wow anna was
the first to do that or whether you're
completely insane
quite work it out it's been forced on me
okay
this is like when we predicted hamilton
should be a musical before it happened
we did re-listen guys um no it's for
it's for um
so territory marking to keep enemies at
bay right
yeah and also i think like it tells your
enemies
how strong you are so if you've done a
really really good poo
and like there's some really good good
smells with it
then it shows that you're really well
fed and you're up for a fight that's an
elephant that ufc should bring in if
conor mcgregor just had a massive poo on
the weighing scale
that sniffer went oh no that's gonna be
scary
and with scent marking they also said
mark each other
so they uh have these anal gland
secretions
and apparently they're the texture of
margarine and very overpowering smell
according to pro badger watchers but
they either do mutual marking which is
where they simultaneously scent mark
each other which is quite funny to watch
they rub their bums against each other
or they do sequential marking and what i
read in one study about this
is that that is like putting your own
personal advertisement on another badger
treating that badger like a bus with
your advert on it so when you sent mark
that badger it's going around with your
scent on it advertising to loads of
other badges
excuse me this amazing scent that's my
mate um
they've also when um this is the honey
badger specifically
i think they're technically not badgers
are they honey badgers just kidding
they're definitely very different but we
should say international listeners sorry
that we are talking about the european
badger mostly um which is uh
which is a kind of weasel we should we
should also say it's in the weasel
family
oh my god that's basically all my
research is on honey badgers here
oh honey buddies are amazing but they
deserve their they're amazing
yeah sorry dan oh man i've got another
badger who wasn't a badger and that's
charlotte badger
do you want to hear about charlotte
badger badger
was the first australian female pirate
and the first european woman to live in
new zealand probably
the probably bet is she definitely was
one of the first couple
uh she was transported to sydney for
house breaking she was born in
worcestershire
and then she was put on a boat to
tasmania and she started a rebellion
and she took over the whole ship okay do
you know about her
i've read about this boat this huge
women's rebellion on a ship it's amazing
but the captain afterwards said oh
uh yeah you know the there was quite a
lot of women involved but you see the
kind of one bloke over there it was
mostly him because
if he'd admitted that all the women had
taken over his boat he would have gotten
a load of trouble so he was like no no
it's mostly the men but it was
basically the women took over it and
they sailed to new zealand and started
living with the maoris
and then every now and then like
missionaries would go over
and see these uh women who were living
in new zealand
and eventually the maori um people kind
of fell out with her because they'd
heard
that something had happened to some
married people on her boat and she ended
up in tonga
and about another like dozen years later
there were some mysteries going to tonga
going oh yeah there's that woman again
so yeah how did she get here yeah
but anyway i know dan said badgers
traveled a long way
getting 100 yards to the end of their
territory but that
that must be the furthest travelled
badly
i've got another human badger oh great
oh okay
it's a guy he's not he's not a real
badger he is a human um
and he's called charles foster he wrote
a book called being a beast
and the idea was he's a british guy who
wanted to reconnect with nature
and he thought the best way to do that
was to go and live as animals
and live the way that they live so
badgers was one of the things that he
did and he roped his kids into doing it
with him so
he lived for a while as a badger they
went out into the forest and
they built a big hole in the ground
which was their sleeping quarters
they're set
they were eating worms because that
would be something that badgers
would eat um they were sleeping in the
daytime and foraging at night
so they lived for a good long time a few
weeks as these badgers and it wasn't the
only animals that he did he did
an otter as well he lived as an otter
with his kids
the reason i mentioned that is he also
did that um scat sniffing that the poo
smelling
so basically no yeah so by the end of
that experience
him and his kids were each able to
identify whose
poo that was out of the family members a
lot of people are listening to this
they're really struggling to educate
their children at home
and i think i think a lot of light bulbs
have gone over a lot of heads here going
that is a great idea
and it will teach you to change their
sheets more often yeah
i did meet another guy who did that
called thomas thwaites who lived as a
goat i don't know if we talked about him
before but um
yeah he was awesome yeah uh honey
badgers
[Music]
have you heard they've they've got
badges in their name
not having it no have you heard of the
badger
which i can't believe this is last
year's big badger for me
um on and i don't know what we were all
doing in february because but this was
way more important
on the 9th of february 2020 a badger
fell through the ceiling of the
northampton branch of superdrug
okay can you imagine how terrifying that
would have been like it's scary enough
when a spider starts coming down from
the ceiling yeah a badger just fell
through the roof
um and it ran under the perfume counter
probably looking for some
nice scents um and
anyway i i mentioned it partly because
it got its own blue plaque in november
we have lowered the blue black bar
[Laughter]
do you remember last week i think it was
we were talking about dolly parton
yeah and what had she done the modern uh
she'd she provided money for providing
money for a vaccine well another person
who's provided money for a vaccine is
brian may
uh who's given 50 000 pounds of his own
money
for a vaccine for badgers
which wow and this is because
uh basically uh people blame badgers for
spreading tb
and they want to call them every year
and they think one way of
not culling them is to vaccinate them
against tb so they
won't if they indeed they do spread it
they won't do it anymore
i was wondering who'd be the first to
breach the thorny subject of tb and
culls and bovine awfulness and yeah
james
you had guts to do it because now we're
going to get letters oh no damn honey
patches
thank god so honey badger skin so
thick you can hit them with machetes and
they probably won't die the only way to
kill them is with a bullet through the
skull
that's honestly what they say what they
say oh where warmstead
what are they saying can i just say i
went to honey badgers to try and get us
away from killing badges
[Laughter]
i read an essay on european badger
sexing and
it's very hard to do because there's
actually not too much difference between
them
and they basically it ends up by saying
in the words of the devin badger group
the only way to be sure is to roll it
over
and then what and then you can see the
vagina penis i suppose
i think i imagine like a lot of mammals
you kind of turn it over and it's got
either a penis or a vagina
and then which is which is it
it's not a sneaky swap seat no
no they're very tread got it one of the
only times we've mentioned badges before
i checked was
when james you said that the best way to
um
prepare badger meat is to let running
water push over it for several days
so it is illegal to kill a badger unless
you're part of a government mandated
cull and you're out shooting it with a
rifle
but if if a badger dies on the road you
are allowed to eat it
um and in 2012 the guardian interviewed
a man called arthur boyd
who was i think it was in his 70s or 80s
but he said he'd been eating badger for
55 years
and he lived in the countryside and the
guardian sent someone to interview him
and to try eating badger
um just before the guardian spoke to him
he'd had a bit of stewed badger with
genitals on the side um which genitals
was that yeah
uh i think it must have been male
genitals
pageant badges but he said that
sometimes you don't have to run it under
water and that you do
but this is the thing his wife is a
vegetarian well i'm not [ __ ]
surprised
if the other option is eating badger
bollocks every day
i suppose if it's ethical eating isn't
it if it's died of natural causes
it's one step away from vegetarianism
eating buttercups
it's one step but it's a [ __ ] long
step
it's one giant
the bloggers stop the podcast hi
everybody just wanted to let you know we
are sponsored this week by
babble babble yes now babel is the
perfect thing for you if you want to
learn
a new language and who doesn't want to
learn a new language
one day we'll be able to meet other
people who speak different languages
than us
and if you haven't used babble you won't
know what they're saying
exactly there are loads of different
languages on there there are all these
brilliant conversational practices i use
babel myself
i'm trying to pick up some german and
it's really fun
it's done very entertainingly and so
you're learning and laughing
yes and i'm using it myself for russian
and what's really good about it is
the lessons are created by language
experts
and their teaching method has been
proven to be effective along multiple
studies
so if you want to use babel at the
moment they are offering our listeners
six months
free with a purchase of a six month
subscription and you can get that if you
use a promo code fish when you go to
babel dot co
dot uk slash play that is right just go
to babble b
a b b e l dot co dot u k slash
play and put in the off code fish for
six months free
maladies andy so good
and hello guys i am here to let you know
that we are also sponsored this week by
expressvpn yes and i am still here to
tell you that very same thing
because anna god you're still here i'm
still here you know one thing that
strikes me about you anna is you're
quite the cheapster
you always come into the office with a
buzzer in your hand and a squirty flower
in your lapel
but at the moment while we're in
lockdown it must be pretty hard for you
because you can't trick anyone
but you can trick your computer or your
laptop into thinking it's in another
location by using a vpn god i wonder
where you are going with that but it's
all
fallen into place and yes i'm doing that
all the time i'm duping
my computer and my internet service
provider into thinking i'm elsewhere and
the reason i do that
is partly for privacy and security but
partly because
it's so great if you want to pretend
you're in another country in order to
watch
the shows that that other country can
provide yes so if you're not
in the uk for instance and you want to
watch black adder on netflix you can
trick your computer
into thinking you're in the uk and watch
black adder that's right so you can
plant yourself anywhere in the world the
great thing about expressvpn is that
it's super fast
there's really no buffering you can
watch everything in hd no
problem so if you want to try this out
then you can go to
expressvpn fish and if you do that
you'll get an extra three months of
expressvpn for free
that's right so go to expressvpn.com
and you'll get an extra three months of
expressvpn for free um anna
what's that what's that telescope you've
got in your hand can i have a look
through it
i don't even know what that gag is i'm
not
i'm just i'm just gonna sit back on my
whoopee cushion and say on with the show
i'm with a podcast
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that
is andy my fact is that the chief
designer of america's first stealth
bomber also helped to design the dumbo
ride at disneyland
amazing very cool yeah that's awesome
yeah so this is this is from a new book
that's called stealth the secret contest
to invent invisible aircraft
so it wasn't a book about dumbo rights
that you were reading
no i do have a big book about disney
actually but i haven't read it yet
um nice just a little insight this would
have been the moment to read it
just use it in my honey badger section
next week
um but this was a guy called richard
shearer
who he was working in the 40s and 50s
for ames he was a
you know an engineer and a designer and
he worked for a lab run by
the national advisory committee for
aeronautics which was the kind of
precursor to nasa
but in his spare time he was hanging
around with some buddies who ran
a firm called the arrow development
company and they made merry-go-rounds
and things
and they did lots of engineering too and
eventually they got a disney contract
so he shera moonlighted
from his day job which was building
serious weaponry and designing systems
for this kind of stuff
he kept getting these phone calls at
work which were from the guys at
disneyland saying we need you to sort
out the brakes and the rails
on dumbo and all these other rides yeah
so he not only did dumbo he did the tea
party ride
he did the matterhorn which is giant
mountain i mean it's absolutely
humongous
uh the little cr the little train that
could flying saucers rides as well
like he's got a big footprint on the
design of that place
yeah and did he ever confuse his two
jobs and accidentally in war
you could see tea cups looming over the
horizon
um harry s truman refused to ride dumbo
at disneyland really um because the
elephant is the mascot of the republican
party
and so he said i'm not getting on an
elephant um
and basically i mean it was just a joke
but it's a thing that happened
so there are big links between disney
and defense tech
which is bizarre so disney
um for example there were robot
animatronics in the first
disneyland um you know little robots
moving back and forth that kind of thing
they were controlled by a magnetic tape
system which was originally developed
for the polaris
submarine missile and disney
licensed the patent to use it in their
park so
i know really weird well he got he got
the idea for it from
tivoli in copenhagen didn't he which is
a couple of us definitely went to that
when we were on tour
last year which is a beautiful uh
fairground
in the center of copenhagen and that was
his dream i want
that in america and he was very good at
doing research sort of personal research
so far as i could tell
for how his park should operate so he
used to walk
after people in parks and just notice
how often they would litter
this is this is the story that i read um
possibly he had researchers doing it
but supposedly disney would walk around
and we go okay this is the distance that
it usually would take for someone to
litter
that's how far apart we need our bins to
be so that
people don't do it in our park yeah um
so he was very much part of the integral
kind of feel of of all the
he was reported to the police for
stalking on multiple occasions wasn't
he you might drop litter because you're
trying to create a distraction from the
man who's been following you
around the park for the last hour so i
can't believe we've never mentioned this
system the utili door system
uh it's short for utility corridors and
it's part of the backstage area
so this is another stealth feature of
disneyland
and it was because they're they're so
strict at disney
with maintaining the fiction that all
the star characters so all the staff are
called actors
and they're on stage when they're in
front of the public and backstage is
when they're not in front of the public
and you can never see them traveling to
their destinations and you can never see
them taking out the rubbish
for instance and you're never supposed
to see someone crossing the wrong
kingdom so you should never see
dumbo crossing the mickey mouse kingdom
or however it's arranged
it feels like a gang system
that's why they have all the weapons so
what they have is and especially under
the magic kingdom is a system of
underground
tunnels and that's for the staff to get
to certain places
and so i think it's the largest wardrobe
department on earth because it's where
they also keep all the costumes and it's
one of the world's largest utility
tunnels
and so if you have to sprint to a
destination as a member of staff you
have to go underground
or in fact weirdly at the magic kingdom
it's on ground level and then the whole
kingdom is built above it on top
oh really yeah that is insane
it's weird isn't it the staff have a
really odd
rule about names there as well so there
was a tradition
that rumor has it started with walt
disney himself which is he never wanted
to be called mr disney he was walt if
you met him hey walt
and so first names is a thing however
there's a rule
that if say they have an andrew already
andy you were working there and i
arrived and i was called andrew
i have to change my name because we
can't have andrews
why don't we do that in our office since
james rossen arrived
i'm forever getting his emails if he was
called derrick
would be no problem yeah exactly well
yeah so disney is your
best place to go and work james because
if you keep getting like
there's not gonna be another james there
come on
sorry derek
but i mean they have quite a lot of that
they're called actors but quite a lot of
actors now sure have they reached really
obscure nature
yeah yeah i'm guessing it must be
specific
like there must be sub-category officers
right within there it must be like
you're part of the rides you're part of
the
janitorial staff you're part of the
creepy following people see how much
they put rubbish on the ground
stuff you know that kind of thing i have
to say dan it feels like a less good
system than the system we have which is
surnames
did you know that this is a problem um
which is that disney has a haunted
mansion ride does you know lots of the
disney's have a haunted mansion don't
they because there are theme parks all
over the world
but uh this is the california one the
original
every so often the staff discover a pile
of uh mysterious powder
on the floor of the haunted mansion and
it is said
that this is stuff take cocaine
[Laughter]
it's said that it's people leaving their
loved ones ashes oh
wow so this is because people love the
haunted mansion and they love to
go on the ride and it's great um now
this has been furiously denied by disney
we should say
uh i found a guy who's called rob
doughty he's the spokesman he seems to
spend about half his
professional life just denying that
there are piles of ash in the haunted
mansion
and they they interviewed a member of
staff who said all these people that
think their loved ones are going to be
in the haunted mansion forever
well grandma's getting vacuumed up into
a vacuum and getting sent
out to the landfill somewhere wow where
is it yeah where is this haunted
landfill that
there was a big big controversy at the
start of the haunted mansion design over
whether it should be funny or scary
there was proper arguments between the
designers and they were called the
imagineers there were nine of them
and there's one left who's called rolly
crump which is just
such a strong name he got there last
after everyone else
the names have been taken i mean neither
of those is a name but okay i'll take it
but
he was uh his ideas were all sort of too
mad for the ride so there was supposed
to be this museum of the weird
to house all of his crazy ideas um but
anyway
one of the things that he recounted
doing at the time
was he recounted the fact that they the
designers also had to clean the haunted
mansion
every night instead of cleaners because
cleaners refused to clean it
and the reason was to be fair they only
had themselves to blame
the reason was that the cleaners said do
you mind leaving the lights
on when you leave because it's a bit
scary all these animatronics and these
crazy ghost sounds and these horrible
figures
so can you just leave the lights on for
us to clean it overnight and so what
rolly and pals did was they complied
but then they installed motion sensors
that at certain moments would extinguish
all the lights and turn on all the
ghosts
thank god that's amazing
he said the next morning they went in
and the ghost effects were still running
there was a broom lying in the center of
the floor
and they got a call from personnel
saying the janitors would not be
returning
wow um disneyland also has
stealthily placed all around what they
call smellitizers
and the idea is that they emit a certain
smell so that everything feels fresh
wherever you're going so if you pass
something that looks like a baking shop
they'll have the smell of
fresh bread being pumped out from the
side of the basically poo pourri
[Music]
no one's pooing on the walls in
disneyland get removed pretty swiftly
ah you can be removed for lots of stuff
um
they've just uh banned loose ice what's
loose
ice it's just ice that's loose
you know i thought it was like a it was
a really cool street slang for some new
drug that i'd never heard of
it's just literally frozen water you
can't turn up with a cup of ice and get
over there have you guys heard of jeff
wright's r-e-i-t-zed um
his twitter account was at disney 366
and it said uh i have been to disneyland
every day since january the first 2012.
uh he was an honorary disneyland citizen
and an honorary mouseketeer
and basically he and his friends joked
that
disney had this um advertising campaign
during the leap year of um 2012 saying
you can go to disney
one more day this year and then him and
his friends are like well
you only get to go one more day if you
go literally for all the other 365 days
right and they went wait a minute we're
unemployed
why don't we just go to disneyland every
day for a year
and so from january the 1st 2012 uh jeff
wright's
and a friend went to disneyland every
single day
and his friend eventually kind of gave
up but he carried on
and he carried on all the way until
march 2020
at 2995 day streak
of going to disneyland until it closed
due to covid
oh wow and he just left them in there
and they said are you going to go back
when it reopens and he's like no it was
a streak it was like a
everyday thing and now that i've missed
it every day i'm just gonna start going
that would make it pointless
he really enjoyed it he said he someone
said to him will you ever get sick of
disneyland he says no i don't think i
will get sick of disneyland
because i like to change things up and
do different things each time
wow i like him i like this guy the
training to work at disneyland
is called the traditions and
it sounds people seem to be okay with it
it's like a cult so it's done repeatedly
i was reading an interview with one
employee who was saying that
every so often you'll be walking around
in your in your costume
and someone will walk up to you and give
you a card that summons you to the magic
kingdom for more sort of happiness
training
they're taught to seem happy it's called
emotional regulation training and the
idea is that you have to stay in
character whatever happens so
for instance i was listening to some
people who went to go on the new star
wars ride and the ride broke
and customers were furious because
they'd been queuing for days and there
were thousands of people on this app
trying to get on they were so excited
about it
so they went and complained to one of
the actors
who remained in character so kept on
saying
well i'm afraid that's kylo ren's fault
who's the bad guy in star wars
apparently
you better talk to kylo ren about that
sounds like they're
dastardly dealing and you know people
screaming and swearing and crying
let me get my line manager this is donal
[Laughter]
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is my fact
my fact this week is that whenever
stephen king couldn't find the audio
book of something he wanted to read
he would put one of his three children
into a room with a tape recorder and
would get them to read out the whole
thing for him
wow yeah so he is a sadist because you
do wonder if he's a sadist when you read
his books and it turns out he is
that is cruel i love him i think he's
amazing he
he's a big big big reader i mean stephen
king basically if you ever hear him talk
talks about books
he loves reading books and he lives in
maine in bangor maine
and there's a lot of roads he does a lot
of driving and he hates the idea that
he's wasting time
while he's behind the wheel not reading
books so audiobooks was a massive thing
for him and back in the 80s obviously
prior to the internet it was very hard
to get your hands on audiobooks and so
if he was unable to do that in the 80s
one of his three kids
would be shoved into a room with this
little recorder
and they would have to sit there and
read out the whole thing and they were
reading stuff that was definitely not
appropriate for their age
so his daughter naomi when she was 12
had to read a book called raven
which was the definitive journalistic
account of the jonestown massacre
she also had to read anna karenina for
him oh what happens in the end of that
uh
anika james i think she gets hit by a
train i've only seen the disney version
where she gets hit by a ride
well we've really leaned into spoilering
this in a
setting i feel really bad about it i
feel like because we've already
spoilered anna karenina that we can get
away with spoiler ring
again and again you're right i think and
we don't spoil her anything else we'll
just spy loretta yeah
and it's one i think at the end of every
show we should close with we'll be back
again next week and anna karenica gets
hit by a train
see ya goodbye i still
don't feel okay about this and i'm
signing out of the plan
but i do want to hear a 12 year old girl
attempt to pronounce
[Music]
but the kids have become really um they
are now writers aren't they
or a lot of them are not writers i think
he's got a few kids two or three
children
one of them is it right yeah yeah he's
one of my favorite writers by the way
i've read four of his books
i love him he's awesome but the kids are
now so into it
that when they were dating owen king is
one of the king children
and his wife they swapped manuscripts to
make sure they didn't hate each other's
writing style before the relationship
got too serious
i think it's really sweet wow
yeah but yeah he did i mean they did
sort of breed good writers out of them
via
having them read these great works of
literature they also used to at bedtime
the kids would tell them
tabitha and stephen bedtime stories as
opposed to the other way around
they used to sit around the dinner table
and pass around the latest book that
they were reading as a family so say it
was the hobbit or narnia
and they would all take turns reading
passages around the table
i mean it's i as someone well we all
love books i i think that sounds really
cool i might
do it with my kids yeah i couldn't
believe about stephen king
and maybe this is just because i cannot
work to any noise at all he listens to
loud rock music while he's writing well
i listen to really loud j-pop music when
i'm writing
do you but the difference there is and
the distraction is english
versus japanese lyrics yeah so you your
mind gets taken away with english lyrics
which i find the stephen king thing
so hard to believe whereas yeah i
listened to andreia bocelli
for example but i wonder if because it's
loud rock music sometimes you don't hear
the lyrics
as easily right yeah yeah yeah he does
it sometimes affects his word choice
that's never his style
so maybe all this time he's been trying
to write like really nice
children's books but jane austen jane
austen only wrote romances because the
music available at the time was romantic
yeah
if she'd had access to the battle of los
angeles it would have been a very
different
career yeah so just a super quick
background on stephen king obviously one
of the most prolific living authors that
we have
he's sold over 350 million copies of his
books
since he first debuted carrie um and
he is someone who also has had probably
more adaptations of his books into
movies than any other living author
one thing i really liked about him that
i learned if you go on stephenking.com
he has a page of dollar babies these are
really cool
so these are stories that he's written
which are not under contract for movies
so if you're a like a young movie maker
then you can buy them off him for like
just one dollar or something
and then he'll let you make that story
um so if you want to make a story such
as the man who loved flowers
that's one of them the man who would not
shake hands that's all of us actually at
the moment
and another one is called that feeling
you can only say what it is
in french i don't know what the story's
about but that's the title
i suppose the story is oh
yeah so i it's really cool i've been i
was reading up a bit on his house and
just the contents of it so yeah he has a
shelf of original audiobooks from his
kids he's got the dollar baby's shelf
where he keeps all of the movies that
have been made off his short stories
one thing i really like is that he's
been very active in the community in
bangor
with helping to fund the community to
have
for example a baseball stadium that was
built proper size really good and
functioning
and so he's really active in that
community but one of the things that he
insisted with the baseball
stadium is that the positioning
of the of the scoreboard had to be
placed at such a position
on the stadium that he could see it from
his window i read
and i can't find out whether that's
definitely true or not he definitely
paid for the stadium that's for sure
yeah but do you think he did that that's
amazing if so that's really
it feels like a thing that he would do
but i agree he's also so shrouded in
myth
because he's this this horror character
that people
think is a frankenstein-like character
himself that he sort of walks around and
weird things happen he once stayed the
night at john grisham's house
they're very good friends those two
authors and they had the same agent and
john grisham's wife was so petrified
that stephen king was in the house that
she was furious that john grisham went
to sleep she was like what are you doing
going to sleep
and then he said out of nowhere their
alarm system at 12 a.m
just beeped a color it's never beeped
before and she was like i told you
and they got really scared then they
heard this crazy crow
and they were like what is that they ran
downstairs and two cats they don't have
cats were fighting right outside their
window
and having this massive blood bath of
the thigh so she sat up the whole night
in the loud drew freaked out and as soon
as i got boarding she woke john grisham
up and went get that man
out of the way like it's not his fault
cats are fighting outside his house
to when el james came around to my house
and then there are a load of foxes
having sex outside my house all night
i was like get that woman out of my
house
um something quite creepy he did in
australia was
uh it was in alice springs and he was in
dimmick's
bookshop in australia and he basically
the alarm was raised
another alarm he's got a history of the
lungs because one of the other customers
noticed a
strange man sort of fiddling around with
the books graffitiing in them
and then leaving so alerted the manager
and the manager went over to the books
and checked and saw that they were
stephen king's books and
in fact they were stephen king's
autographs inside the books so
they went out of the shop to look for
him and he was across the road in a
grocery shop
that is an anti-climactic ending to this
spooky story anna
dan's had a lot more you know pizzazz in
it than john grisham thing
didn't end with him bikes
i know stephen king but there's another
link between
king and tolstoy apart from the fact
that
king made his daughter read anna
karenina on audiobook
which is that tolstoy's grandmother
owned
a serf who was blind who was a human
audiobook
what yeah his name was lev stephanic
he was a professional storyteller and um
tolstoy remembered as a boy
he would go to his granny's bedroom um
lev stephanich
was there he was sitting in the
windowsill waiting for her to arrive she
would
undress in front of him because he was
blind so there was no risk of
impropriety and then tolstoy would be
tucked up in bed next to his granny and
lev stephanie would read them a story
well that's really cool his name sounds
a bit like led zeppelin as well which is
yeah it does
distracted me at the very start
um how was the uh blind man
reading a story you would have thought
the audiobook is useful to be read to
the person who is blind which in fact
was this subsequent news but he
he memorized it presumably it's coming
for he's reading it from his own he's
memorable he's memorized the story i
guess
anna yeah oh cool but you're right about
the early audiobooks they did come
because
was it a lot of people have been blinded
in the war or something they became
useful
yeah i think so some americans were
blinded uh um
in world war one and i think a guy
called ian fraser set up a team to
make audio books because he loved
reading and couldn't do it anymore
and experimented with lots of different
machines and one of these machines
apparently according to the
rnib the royal national institute for
the blind
said that it turned letters into musical
notes
as a possible way of creating audio
books for the blind
which sounds to me i don't know how that
would work do you have to distinguish
between all musical notes and then make
them currently you only need 26 notes
so you just go that's more than we have
really that's a good point
you could go up an octave card yeah
you've got you've got that's what three
three octaves in a bit so you just go
you know hey
and then said and then it's either going
to be a very slow read or it's going to
sound like an extremely hardcore piece
of list
the speed of which you're gonna have to
play that book there was a guy who
invented a language that was all
musical and he thought it was around the
time when everyone was inventing
um new languages like esperanto and
stuff like that
and he thought if we could come up with
a language where all you needed was the
tones
then everyone in the world would be able
to speak it and it would end all wars
and stuff i can't remember his name it
was in that book that i mentioned a few
times called bambard's folly
which you always asked about but yeah
it's really he's really interesting
i can't remember anything more about him
sorry
i think it means everyone will
understand each other better everyone
will understand each other's insults
there'll be lots more wars actually oh
really
yeah because that was the idea of all
these universal languages that it would
end all conflicts but i suppose no one
had your insight that actually
naturally humans are just
conflict-ridden species
the esperanto wars of the early 1920s
were fiercely savage
um just on audiobooks um
there's something uh there was a great
hero of audiobooks was a guy called roy
louis dauteris or dot rice i'm not sure
his name is pronounced
okay so he died in 2017 he was 94 years
old
but he had a guinness world record for
his audiobook reading because
he read the audiobooks for the first
five game of thrones
books and he had to read so many
hundreds of characters
so the first book has 224 characters in
it he has to do a different
voice for every single one he was
actually meant to be in the game of
thrones series
in the actual tv series yeah and he was
offered a role and he turned it down
because he was having medical issues at
the time
so he thought i just can't play this one
role so it's quite nice that he then
ended up playing
224 yeah i did read an audio book actor
saying that one of the things one of the
tricks
is that when you get the text in advance
you check for what she called active
attributions
and that is if you have some speech and
then after the speech it says like
she shouted or he whispered you have to
check ahead for that
text i i would love to do
to write a book where on the very last
page
you know you've had dialogue all the way
through and on the very last page of the
book you say
he said in his trademark
glaswegian
just one more thing about audiobooks
which is so interesting you know we were
talking
about how they were for blind people and
the first lps lp records were made in
the early 1930s
but the only people who were legally
allowed to buy them
between 1934 and 1948 were blind people
wow wow
so it's not amazing they were why
you couldn't they weren't good enough
quality to get good music on
but you could read audio books and so it
was this great service for the blind
where you'd ask for a book on audio
you'd listen to the lp you'd send it
back
but they had to sign contracts with
authors saying we promise we'll check
someone's blind you have to send in your
blind person certification
so that we don't give free books out it
was that guy was he called ian fraser
did you say he and fraser yeah and he
came up with the technology where you
basically make the grooves narrower
but you can kind of and you play it
slower but you can fit more on a record
and that was like the lp technology that
later became your
thirty-threes and ah cool yeah that's so
cool
yeah because you'd really seriously have
to abridge
anna karenina to get it on an lp when
you just cut straight to the main
incident
[Music]
stop the focus stop the podcast hello

following three
okay on with the show on with the show
[Music]
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that
is james okay my fact this week is that
in the 14th century
a weapon was invented that was
essentially a windmill which flung out
beehives from each of its arms
oh my goodness we talked about some
scary things already on this podcast but
what about that
it's so amazing thinking of what this
would have looked like and how it would
have functioned
yeah i mean i doubt it probably existed
i'll be honest
it was there was a guy called walter the
milimet
and he was a scholar and uh queen
isabella of france commissioned him to
write a tree ties on
how to be a good king for her son and
part of this how to be a good king was
going to have all the different
like new weapons and stuff like that
that are out there
and he in fact gave us the first western
illustration of a gun
we didn't have anything before that uh
or if we did we've we've lost it
uh and one of the things that he had was
this um siege weapon
which was a windmill with beehives
flung out at the enemy and whether it
existed or not it was that
definitely existed in people's minds
enough to be included in the
tree ties it's like a really cool
concept uh warship or something you see
those all the time these days
you know this is this is the warship of
tomorrow this must have been the thing
everyone was really excited about in the
14th century like the hoverboard
yes where's my beehive windmill
do you think they had those kind of
demonstration days where it's like an
expo
you go and see the latest definitely
yeah that is amazing so we don't know if
it ever was deployed in war
we don't know and i suspect it wasn't
because i suspect if it was we might
have a lot more
people writing at the time about this
amazing windmill beehive thing
i don't know bees seem to be deployed
quite often though maybe it was just so
run-of-the-mill
run of the windmill um but bees do seem
to be a wartime weapon
so that's you know just standard i was
reading about the kishay people the
mayan people who have the popal vu which
i think we've talked about before which
is their
book of their history and they used
beehives
to frighten away the enemy in fact they
used kind of scare crow
come halloween pumpkins and they
described it as surrounding their
citadel with these effigies
that were built to look exactly like
people so with armor and arrows and
shields and stuff
and then they had huge headdresses and
then they had gourds i think as
heads or possibly beside them it's not
clear
in the text and then they stuffed their
heads with wasps and hornets and stuff
and then you smash it open when the
enemy comes along it's like a terrible
pinata on a horrible birthday bit like
that movie where the bees come out of
the guy's mouth which i have candy man
yeah andy man it's also i was thinking
it's a bit like home alone where kevin
create creates a party out of cardboard
cutouts yeah
it's kind of like that well all these
things were inspired by
this mayan text richard the lionheart
when he went on the crusade um he had
enough beehives to fill
13 ships according to people
writing at the time doesn't sound very
likely but that's what they said
how many ships did he have 14
it's just
more modern times still deploying the
bees
oh yeah so bees were used in the vietnam
war
and it was particularly when the viet
cong would be hiding and they'd be
watching the americans and watching the
trails that they used
and then they would plant bee hives
along these trails so they took behind
some elsewhere planted them on the
trails rigged them up to explosives
little explosives and then they'd
explode them under the hives as the
americans ran past
and you just get a horrible sting rusty
did you read about the yellow rain in
the vietnam war i mean that's a
really interesting thing so the idea was
that were all these reports that yellow
rain was coming down
and it was believed to be chemical
warfare so the americans the secretary
secretary of state alexander haig
accused the soviet union of using um
t2 mycotoxin which would then be dropped
over the people and they were all
getting burnt and stuff and
there's been so many it's still ongoing
as a dispute about whether or not it
really was that because what most people
who've studied it think it was
is honeybee feces and that's what they
believe
was being dropped on them basically not
by the soviet union
but huge flocks of honey bees that were
traveling around together and defecating
at the same time the sort of mass
defecation
and that's what the yellow rain was and
there were so many reports have been
continuing on and on where people
are saying that it was chemical warfare
locals saying that they were burnt and
stuff
other people saying it wasn't it's very
embarrassing to have to backtrack saying
you're a chemically attacked and
suddenly you were just shot on by a bee
i wouldn't accept that if i were the
locals but yeah they've studied the
substance haven't they and found that
yeah can only have come from these bees
and apparently it's when it gets
particularly
hot so it's on hot days that that it
would rain yellow
and it's because the bees get super hot
in their hives so they have to go out
and lose mass because the more mass
you've got the more heat you generate
so you all go out and do this mass mass
[ __ ] cools you down
but one of the theories then was in
order to disguise that they were using
chemical warfare
the soviet union had actually gone to
vietnam collected
all of this brought it back mixed it in
to the actual chemical
warfare stuff because it it helps it to
have more of an effect supposedly this
pollen that would be within
the chemical i mean it's bizarre the the
rhodes people have gone down
how would you collect the bee feces you
need to mix it into your chemical
weapons you get
13 bolts of bees
and i found one other roman bee use
in war and this is in uh appian
appian as a roman historian he described
this thing in the third
mithridatic wars there's 72 bc um
basically the roman army were besieging
themselves which is a city
um i think it's south of the black sea
and basically the roman army were
besieging a city that's all you really
need to know
but the inhabitants um cut openings in
the ground because the romans were
tunneling in as part of the siege
that's what you do in a siege dig
tunnels but the inhabitants apparently
cut openings from above
into the tunnels and they would thrust
down bears and other wild animals and
swarms of bees
into the openings so if you're a roman
soldier in the tunnel
and you felt something going down from
above it might be a small bees or it
might be a bear
oh my god it's like a lucky dip yeah
yeah
it's like one of those which would win
in a fight between a thousand bees and
one
bear yeah it's like what happened in the
northampton branch of boots
on february 2020.
there was also um in the first century
there was and this was in
asia minor um there was the idea of
using and we've spoken about mad honey
before but using
mad honey so this is this is honey that
has a poisonous
element to it which a lot of people if
mixed in lightly into a drink can drink
it
and have a high off it but quite a big
amount could actually cause you to have
huge stomach problems possibly even
fatal to some people and supposedly
this was used as a way of taking out an
army that was advancing
onto this um city of heptap commit
commodities have
have tap committees never heard of it
sorry yeah i
tried to look for a um pronunciation on
mine was that where a lot of
pep cats lived
hepta commodities is that it had
captains
uh h h e p t a k o m e t e s
all you need to know is it's a town in
asia minor
yeah just saying so there's a town in
asia minor that being um advanced on by
a roman army and there was about a
thousand of them and the story goes and
this was written by a philosopher
called strebo he said that basically
they had taken
this honey and they'd mixed it up but
they'd left them in pots
and the idea was they would see it on
the way and it'd be like finding a
bottle of water
on the way if you were advancing on
somewhere and you needed it badly
um it's a honey trap
yes it's a heavy thread yeah
it was a big build up you made dan do
for that i know are you giving me all
those big words what are you doing
did we get to the end of it oh it kind
of like with your story
about the windmills it's sort of a lot
of these histories about this stuff are
quite disputed we don't fully know
there's a lot of people who've
extrapolated what they think
then happened like the army was then
taken out we don't we don't actually
have any written evidence that it
actually had any effect on the army
whatsoever
right i think i think mad honey has well
certainly people have claimed that
they've used it so there was empress
olga
in 946 olga of kiev who
offered the enemy mead to drink and it
was full of mad honey
and what it does is it kind of knocks
you out like if you take a strong
hallucinogenic you just passed out it's
stupefied
and then they massacred 5 000 people i
think
and then again ivan the great i think
just left bats of spiked mead
spiked with mad honey in his own camp
and then he and his soldiers left
and yeah the troops came and like you
said down they came in and thought oh i
wonder why this has been left here
let's drink it all and then drank it all
fell asleep
and we're massacred why can't they
resist don't they know
they're not winnie the pooh they don't i
know
[Music]
i might be wrong about this but was she
the one where um
they killed her husband and to get her
own back
she's kind of got her army to this town
forced them to all give her a pigeon
and said okay give us a pigeon or i'm
gonna do you in and they went okay we'll
give you a pigeon so everyone in the
town gave her a pigeon and then she tied
some
fire stuff to the legs of the pigeons
and they're all homing pigeons so they
all flew back and they burned
the town down oh was that all good i
think so she was full of wacky ideas
she should have been employed by disney
to build the haunted mansion she was the
dick bastardly of her day
can i just quickly mention one last
thing uh before we wrap up which is
that um i discovered animals in war
and accusations of people using them for
their benefit in 2007 the british forces
had to actively deny rumors that they
had released a plague of ferocious
badgers
into basra really
yeah major mike shearer the uk military
spokesperson say we can categorically
state that we have not released
man-eating badgers into the area
and this had been uh claimed by a lot of
the locals
um that they had been seeing and killing
uh these
large giant honey badgers and um
oh honeybee was that his trick when he
when he was denying it he was like
no we haven't done any badges here
okay that's it that is all of our facts

[Music]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
here with james harkin
anna toshinski and andrew hunter murray
and once again
we have gathered round the microphones
with our four favorite facts from the
last seven days
and in a particular order here we go
starting with fact number one and that's
my fact my fact this week is that in the
1910s
animal dances including the camel walk
the turkey trot
the crab step the chicken flip and the
kangaroo dip
was so controversial they were banned at
the white house condemned by the pope
and warned against by doctors wow why
were they so bad
were they sexy i bet they were sexy
dancers they always aren't they
i watched the turkey trot you could
argue there's a bit of sex in there but
ultimately you just look like an idiot i
think i mean what could sound sexier
than the crab step
it's very raunchy stuff
the chicken flip they're all these the
sloth squeeze was another one
yeah the bowl weevil wiggle that was
another one
it doesn't exactly sound like twerking
it's it's
they're quite they're very tame from
they were
but they were sort of that moment where
it felt like people were liberating and
this was seen as
as people going out and having a wild
time and they really did take it
seriously so
a number of u.s cities really crack down
on it and in boston
um john f kennedy's grandfather who was
the mayor
ordered it as ordered it so that there
was a matron and policemen posted to
every dancehall in the city
and they would crack down on anyone they
saw doing that they had people
um just police forces out arresting
whole groups it was a bit of a mania
a lot of the reports at the time said
they were to be fair to the people
banning them
actual imitations of the sex acts of
these animals
now it is quite difficult to believe
that when you watch for instance a
turkey trot
which sort of involves jumping hopping
to one side and then hopping to the
other side and then flapping your wings
a bit
but they were meant to be kind of
reenacting sex between these creatures
it feels to me that if that's the way
turkeys have sex then
we'd all be going hungry at christmas
because
there will be not many baby turkeys
around well as no doubt people
would mention i don't think any turkey
that we eat
has sex does it i think oh my god
imagine
imagine if the turkey truck dance was
someone extracting some semen from
your penis and then putting it in a
little test tube and then shoving it
into
your partner it would be the turkey base
instead of the turkey trot
as a dance i really like what you said
about the white house dan this is
amazing
that in 1913 there was going to be an
inaugural ball for president woodrow
wilson
obviously very exciting and then it was
cancelled because
just because of the risk that people
might start doing the turkey trot
and he denied that but the ball was
cancelled it didn't go ahead
and so there was no chance for anyone to
do the grizzly bear
yeah he denied it probably because it
wasn't true charlie that wasn't the
reason
it was on the front page of the new york
times so the headline was wilson band
ball fearing turkey trot
and that was on jan 13 1913 and it was a
big story but obviously yeah he
he denied that that would happen but it
was it was a real story
it was from white house insiders so it
was just i reckon he probably did ban it
because of that it was probably like i
don't love spending all this money
and he might have been specifically
worried about his daughters who were
massive fans of animal dances
so he knew he knew the underworld of
animal dancing
so one person who intervened in this
debate was the ex-president of the
university of missouri's medical school
he was a guy called dr s grover and he
claimed in 1915
that it led to insanity to do these
dances
he said many of the cases of insanity
developed in the united states within
the last few years
may be traced to modern eccentric dances
one-tenth of the
insane of this country have lost their
mind on account of troubles which may
commonly be traced to modern dances
that's why one in ten they also said
that it would give you some kind of
foot illness didn't it it was like there
was like a turkey
trot photo turkey trot in step or
something like that which would
make you lame if you did this too much
um but then some doctors
said it was good for you so there was a
doctor called dr a.a
brill who sounds like a really good
doctor
and he said that modern dances should be
considered beneficial and they're
soothing to the pot place as rocking is
to an infant
oh good so like when you're rock and
rolling you're also kind of being rocked
like a baby
it's like everything it's probably best
done in moderation isn't it
i'm sure if you did dance for 14 hours a
day you would actually get quite sore
feet
and i think that's absolutely fair
enough i just think it's unlikely many
people were doing that
yeah and it was i think it was tango
foot was the precursor
to that which was a big scare and there
was a really nice news article from 1914
which pointed out that no sooner has a
new entrancing diversion come in then
someone appears to forbid
it and it pointed out that tango foot is
the modern version of bicycle knee and
automobile face which i think i feel
like we may have talked about those
before
also movie eye he said people used to
tell us we'd all get movie eye from the
cinemas and we haven't
and it was quite a good article to
remind you that whenever there's a new
trend everyone always says this is gonna
ruin us yeah i always get pokemon shin
and
fortnite anus
[Laughter]
we've got anyone binging us watch out
for podcast earlobe
oh yeah i want to know what fortnite's
anus is well the problem is people sit
down playing
video games for too long right and they
sit in the same place
and it can give you problems like miles
and hemorrhoids
no i'm no no no i'm making it all up
oh okay i've just started playing
fortnite and i need to know
if for no more than two weeks
after that it's a problem um one of
these animal dances survives today which
is so exciting because i've never heard
of the bunny hug or the
there were others called the uh like the
buzzard
look there was one called the fish walk
did you hear that
i mean that is the one thing that fish
don't do yeah insane
but the the one that survived into the
modern age is the bunny hug because
it kind of became the fox trot and the
foxtrot was coined and popularized
around the same time as all these other
dancers
and it was refined a bit and you know
there are various sources as to who
exactly came up with it but it's
basically a slightly more
neat version of the bunny hug but it's
not named after the fox right it was
named after a guy called fox that's what
most people think these days
i didn't know that yeah there was a guy
called fox who was
like the guy who popularized the fox
trot and they think
although it makes much more sense if
there was a you know a grizzly
jump and a funny hug it makes sense that
it would be named after a [ __ ] all these
dancers were named after people the the
turkey trot was named after
leonard turkey and yeah well the bunny
hug
there is a famous version of it being
danced in a movie starring a man called
john bunny
but he didn't invent it i think that
just happened to be a question oh really
yeah he's one of the most well-known
comedians of his day in america i've
never heard of him
uh but he's got a huge position called
john bunny
not jack benny he just misread it
yeah john bunny so speaking of band
dances have you guys heard
of the cushion dance
no i have this this is this is the 16th
17th century version
of the turkey trot because it was a
scandalous sexy dance
and what it is is you run around the
place with a cushion for a bit you dance
around holding a cushion
and then you put it down in front of a
woman
and she will kneel on it and then you
give you a [ __ ]
no you
give her a kiss on the cheek
and then you pick up the cushion and you
dance around a bit more and it's very
innocent not as sexy as i thought it was
going to be no
i sort of assumed the blow i mean that's
what you're led to believe by the
description
it's a completely innocuous dance but it
was very scandalous at the time
oh god i'm blushing over zoom
take your camera down did the woman get
to get up before you took the cushion
out or was it a sort of tablecloth trick
thing where you spun her off the camera
i think she's i don't know maybe she
gets the cushion then i do
i haven't actually got the full
mechanics of it worked out maybe it's
like past the cushion and then she gets
to put the cushion down in front of
someone else who gives her lingus no
okay
we have to stop this but there was a
worry right i read about this
this uh cushion dance which they were
saying the story that in 1633 the idea
is that it would lead
to sexual acts and a couple were accused
i think after maybe having done this
dance and taking it a bit further
of having sex against the village
maypole and
against the people going to be
uncomfortable
yeah you're going to end up with may
pollinators
the only reason they were found out was
because apparently there was a bell on
top of it which they didn't know about
which was alerting the neighborhood
if i had to write that up in a 16th
century newspaper i would make the
headline maple sauce
okay so it's like a pun on maple sauce
but it's the saucy thing happening up
against the maple did they had maple
sauce back then
no they didn't i guess it wow so you
would have been going to what yeah
what's that
1633 yeah they had maple sauce
really it's always called maple syrup so
i don't know why we're even talking
um the animal dances were part of the
ragtime
genre really weren't they uh it was just
part of the much broader ragtime era
which is
basically the the first jazz or the
precursor to jazz
it's the first time you started having
syncopated ragged rhythm
and the story of ragtime is just it's
kind of cool it's this scott joplin
who's the king of ragtime
he'd been born to a former enslaved
person who used to play the violin
for plantation parties so that's where
he got his musical skill
and he died eventually in 1917 i think
of syphilis
and he died really upset that he'd never
been able to be famous
for a serious music and today he gets
200 000 listens a month on spotify
which is just such a nice thing to not
be able to tell him yeah and he he
will be i guess he'll be able to earn 15
cents from those 200
000 but luckily at the turn of the 20th
century that will have bought him a lot
of stuff
absolutely so the problem is not that
spotify isn't paying people enough
it's that they're not paying people a
hundred years ago oh
well i think we're just about guaranteed
we still get to be hosted cool
um the conga was illegal in cuba
for a while uh i don't think it still is
might be
this was due to a politician called de
sidirio
anaz ii uh and the reason was
because it had come over to cuba from
africa
uh and they thought that it had lots of
immoral gestures and semi-naked people
doing the conga everywhere yeah like at
weddings
yeah that congress you know where you
hold onto the waste of someone behind
yeah now we do that blow a job
[Laughter]
um so it was banned by this politician
but then the politician ended up being
put in prison like politicians often do
in some countries
and the son of the politician called
desi anas
he fled to america and then became
like the king of the conga like he went
around the whole of america
touring going on tv going to all the
different cities teaching them the conga
and what i like to think is that when he
went from one city to the other
everyone just followed him and did the
conga with him from
you know la to san francisco to seattle
you can see the king of conga coming
from a long way away if you're on his
way into town
very impressive if you managed to make a
living out of teaching people to conquer
because i would say it is at maximum oh
one lesson dance
and that's what's going on yeah but i
lost it 300 million people in america
that's a lot of lessons
yeah and you didn't even know you're
supposed to take your clothes off
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hey everyone this week's episode of fish
is brought to you by
manscaped manscaped yes now
do you have hairs in your ears do you
have hairs in your nose we all do but
are they so long you need to escape them
out of your
manliness very nicely put james um and
the answer is
i think we all know in this fish team
that yes i do have hair in those places
i am
a full-time gardener uh effectively so
this is a glorious product for me
well you know what you're probably not
as bad as anthony victor because he had
the longest ear hair
in history now do you think that ear
hair was longer or shorter than the
shortest snake in history
[Laughter]
uh it's got to be longer surely it was
longer not very much it was seven inches
just over versus just over four inches
now if you have that kind of hair or
actually even if you have completely
normal hair that you want to keep
in check then you should go to manskate
they have nose and ear trimmers that
have a proprietary skin safe
technology which helps prevent nicks
snags
and tugs that's right they got this
thing called the weed whacker
and it uses 9 000 rpm motor powered 360
degree
rotary dual blade systems it's like

please don't ride in doctor who fans
okay on with the podcast on with the
[Music]
show
okay it is time for fact number two and
that
is james okay my fact this week is that
there is a type of pasta
that only three women in the world know
how to make
um well we have heard of it is it
foosilly
it's not gonna be spaghetti is it it's
not gonna be
they're amazingly productive like
kingpins
you will have heard of it because you've
spent the last couple of days
researching about it
but i think that people at home will not
have heard of it so
this is called su philendo
literally threads of god and it's a
sardinian
pasta and it's made once a year for the
feast of san francisco
and there is basically a group of women
who have always been able to make it and
they pass the recipe down
to their daughters who pass it down to
their daughters who pass it down to
their daughters
um but there are only three women left
who know how to do it
really um one of them is a lady called
paula abrahami
and her niece and her sister-in-law all
know how to do it
but her daughters aren't really that
interested they kind of know the
technique but it's really really
complicated
and they're not particularly good at it
and because all these
three women who are um doing it are all
kind of
i wouldn't say old but getting that way
you know in the 50s and 60s
and the people are a little bit worried
that this might die out
so we need to get more people learning
quick and we tried to
teach jamie oliver but he just couldn't
hack it well this is
this is the weird thing about it it's
that it's not even like it's a secret
recipe
it's not something that they're hiding
they're constantly trying to teach it to
people
including jamie oliver and after a few
hours of like nah [ __ ] i'm not doing
this i'm
sorry it's that jamie oliver's trying to
try to learn yeah he tried to do it he
tried to do it for two hours and gave up
wow it's so for the people at home i'll
tell you how to do it because i know how
to do it
basically you get some semolina wheat
you get some water you get some salt
you need it and need it and need it and
then at just the right moment
which is the main difficult part then
you put it into loads and loads of
really really really fine
strings you get 256 of these
filaments and you put them all together
and then kind of mesh them all up
and then cut it up and then that's your
pasta and then you put it with some
tasty
sheets broth and some pecorino cheese
bish bash bosch
that's basically a hello fresh recipe
that i've given you there isn't it yeah
well a bit jamie oliver at the end when
he's a bishop
bosh
[Laughter]
it's like that that is the thing if you
do get a hello fresh
and it is the um philando
meal it will take you exactly 48 years
to do yes although it wouldn't be it
would be one of those annoying recipes
because that's just the prep so it would
say cook time 12 minutes
and then at the very end it would say
prep time 10 years
so actually lots of people know how to
make it it's just the fact that only
three people can make it yeah it's
really really difficult because you just
need to get it
exactly the right moment it's the
elasticity of the dough that you need to
get perfectly right
because if you don't do it perfectly you
can't make these threads
thin enough and you can only do it from
playing with the dough and just knowing
from generation on generation and
generation and knowledge to knowledge to
knowledge just knowing the exact moment
to do it but the other thing is it's
given an impression that it's much
harder to learn because
you know jamie oliver stopped after two
hours i think it's fair enough that he
didn't master it in two hours this has
been
a generational thing that's passed out
that's you know you need to because if
you're jamie oliver
if you're jamie oliver you can in that
time you could have made eight of your
15 minute meals
[Laughter]
i did read because these women they're
as you said james right they're in the
same family
so one of their male relatives is
currently one of the
luke skywalker figures who is in the
process of learning how to make it today
um he's called he's obviously also i
guess sardinian he's called leo
gilcimino and he's aussie um
well he's australians in australia yeah
i mean he's in his
their family so i i don't know when he
moved to australia or when the family
moved but
yeah they they've given him a little
master class and um
he has a certificate but i think he's
still in the yeah so
that basically it's kind of a tradition
where they have these kind of
matrilineal or matriarchal cuisines
which you do pass on from mother to
daughter to daughter to daughter
but because they're so worried about
this dying out
they have recently said okay we're going
to let men do it as well
and they are trying to teach more and
more people i actually read this
article in the bbc i think it was in
2016
so it could be possible that few people
have picked it up since then
but if they have they won't be nearly as
good as these three women who absolutely
smash it every time
because they don't have the special
sense is that you know what we've done
how um
you know we have more than five senses
is the
special ability to feel pasta
i don't think that's an x-men character
we're going to see covered up
in marvel movies actually i just thought
of something which is
um that you know how we were talking
about maple sauce earlier on andy
yes well the related food maple syrup is
also
um was traditionally a thing that passed
from mother to daughter to mother to
data
because in the first people's tribes
of um canada you the men would often go
out hunting and the women would be in
charge of
all of the planting and stuff like that
and the maple syrup
came in that territory and so
you would as a woman you would go to
your maple grove and you would get the
syrup every year which would give lots
of energy to your
to your tribes um but you would pass on
the knowledge to your daughter and you
would even pass on your groves to your
daughter as well so
wherever your grove of naples was that
would be yours through generations
through generations through generations
so there are quite a few of these kind
of matrilineal
cuisines around the world and you'd pass
that would be you pass on the knowledge
of you make a hole in a tree and wait
for the stuff to come out of it
because i like did the women tell the
men it was a really complicated process
the equivalent
of a dozen ingredients
[Laughter]
no because actually there's more to it
with maple syrup oh you gotta
concentrate it a little bit
you gotta lose some of the fluids you
have to leave it out overnight so it
freezes and all the water comes to the
top and then you skim off the water and
then you boil it to get rid of more of
the water it's like
that's what my mum told me anyway
just on pasta shapes oh yeah do you do
you guys know
you know the tortelloni the little
wrapped up
parcel thing um
oh i'm sorry tortellini sorry sorry
tortellini that
shape is supposedly based on lucrezia
borgia's navel and you know the crazy
aborgia of the famous
poisoning aristocratic borgia family she
was staying in an
inn uh in italy and the innkeeper um was
so excited to have this beautiful
aristocratic lady in his end
that he crept up to the keyhole to have
to have a perv
but all he could see was the navel
through her navels
but what a naval floor and he rushed
down to the kitchen to recreate it
that's a terrible outie she had isn't it
it's an absolutely [ __ ] up umbilical
cord cutting right there
and he um also the next day he went up
and saw her husband and invented the
belgian sausage to be
do you know why pasta has so many
different shapes
um no well i i think people think they
know
or the theory is that the reason it does
and it is a ridiculous number so there
are among
300 pastor shapes and i think 1300
different past and names
and it's partly because it was so
it was such a rivalry throughout italy
so some of the earliest italian gills
were pasta guilds the vermicelli
and the macaroni and um you'd have
lots of little different localities
trying to rival each other's pasta
quality with their own pasta and so you
made it into one into a bow tie
and then you'd make your own spiral to
be like our spirals are better than
their bow ties
and it was very heated and they used to
get so i mean they got so competitive
that the pope had to step in a few times
i think between pastor gills
and he ruled in the 1400s
he ruled that pastor making illegal
pastor making would be punished by a
fine and three lashings of a whip
because you know if you're not allowed
if you're not in the guild that's
allowed to make that twirly pasta
then you're going to be beaten i'll tell
you what i didn't really appreciate
until
we did the research for this episode how
busy the pope's life actually is
he's just constantly banning pasta
shapes or turkey trot dancers
the guys yeah the guy's furious calling
out stuff
he's got a lot on yeah there was
actually um with what you were saying
with these sort of
um these guilds and so on it went a bit
further in the renaissance courts
there was there's one particular pasta
shape which is
corzetti which um the idea is that
it's imprinted with the coat of arms of
the royal families that would eat it so
you would have
these these pieces of pasta that would
each have the coat of arms
to where you were eating on your plate
which is pretty extraordinary
i love that as well yeah because they're
all they're all very there's this great
book
um called the encyclopedia of pasta i
don't know if you guys read about it in
the course of this research
uh by oretta what's it about
uh is her name
and she's went round italy just asking
every local person from a different town
city village
about the story behind a different kind
of famous local pastor
and she created this encyclopedia so
it's a real first-hand encyclopedia and
it's got all the stories about how the
shapes came about
there's the uh ave maria pasta
which is a great little one that's
simply it's not anything to do with the
shape
it's about the timing of what you cook
it for so you chuck it into the boiling
water and if you say a hail mary that's
how long you cook it for the ave maria
and there's a apparently a whole trinity
of different pastas
with the different lengths that you say
the prayer to that will be the perfect
cooking doesn't
feel like a particularly long amount of
time to cook
pasta say that that's i don't know how
long it takes to say a hail mary
okay hail mary follow grace the lord is
with the dressed outdoor books women
invest in the fruits of thy womb jesus
holy mary mother of god pray to us
sinners now at the hour of our death
amen
[Laughter]
james will be the most annoying priest
as he's powering through the entire
sermon i had to go to a lot of
confessions in my time and had to get
through a lot of hail there
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
andy my fact is that every hour the
buglers of krakov have to climb 272
steps
play five notes then walk back down
again
and this is a a job that you can have
if you're a bugler and you live in
krakow um
they have this church called mary's
basilica and since 1392
uh on and off they've been doing this
thing where every hour there's a bugle
call from the top
um it's called mary's fanfare it's only
got five notes in it so actually it's
it's not
it goes up and down a bit and it takes
about i don't know half a minute to play
so it goes up now but only on those five
notes
um and you play the tune to each point
of the compass
and um and then you stop and then you go
back down again and then the next hour
you climb back up again
actually don't you stop the fourth time
you do it you stop halfway through
i read um that's because in
1241 there was a bugler who was one
like telling about some mongols who were
attacking the city
and he was shot by an arrow uh halfway
through his bugle and so in honor of
this guy
they they kind of stopped the last bugle
well
that's the story yeah there's a lot of
stories about krakow i learned
yeah which we might get to in a bit but
go on well
it's first recorded in 1928 and
from 1241 there's obviously quite a gap
before anyone wrote it down
so and it's first recorded by an
american author who
may have been locals may have played a
trek on him but it might also have been
an oral legend before that it's just
that there
isn't much written record but there was
actually a trumpeter
who did die on duty in 1901
so only about 20 years before this guy
wrote the story down
and he had played the tune three out of
four times because you do it to each
point of the compass
so he did it three times but then he
died of a heart condition before he
could play it the fourth time
so that might be where that sort of fed
into local
myth and yeah yeah that must have been
such a weird moment for the town
when you're waiting you're so used every
hour to hearing these four
and you're like what yeah it go but i
thought wasn't it even
um did you say the first mention of the
bugler
is 1928 or the first mention of this
legend is 19 the mongol thing the bugle
thing's been going for
donkeys yeah because i read that the
bugle thing even they only used to do it
sort of once a day
until the until the 20th century and
then suddenly
they decided to torture this guy by
ramping up to once every hour
so i think you do you have to be a
fireman by the way to have this job
that's just part of the conditions for
entry these days so
the reason this is um current now is
because they just announced they're
recruiting for a new one
and they've had their first ever
application from a woman for the
position
so great social progress is being made
now if she gets it
if she gets it yeah if she gets it um
but it's for the audition process
yeah it's crazy insane you got to in
order to become a bugler for
uh for the church you need to go through
a whole process of doing chin ups
you need a beep fitness test um they
have a medicine ball tossing thing that
you need to do and you need to scale a
20 meter ladder at an angle of 75
degrees
to ensure that you're not afraid of
heights but i would have thought that
all these things if you're a fireman you
probably would already
be able to blow up ladders wouldn't you
no you would yeah that's true
yeah i gotta say i have been to krakow
on a stag do once
and but i think i might be right right
about saying this is the square is
basically just a load of bars all the
way around there
with mostly when i went there just full
of stag dudes
so that just that's that seems to be the
only people who are enjoying these
bugles
is it market square is it the main
square isn't it
i think i remember hearing it when i was
in krakov market square was the biggest
square biggest medieval square in europe
i think wasn't it it was
unesco heritage sort of was one of the
very first places to get unesco heritage
i think
yeah it is beautiful it's really big and
really cool and this saint mary's tower
is quite famous because it's got two um
towers that are slightly different
heights
uh and i know andy's gonna tell me this
isn't true now but i'm going to tell the
story of why this happened
so they had the church there and
there was a guy who was in charge of
krakov at the time he was called
duke borislaus the modest okay and he's
like
we need some new towers here not too big
because i'm modest but we need some new
towers here we need two new towers
and they tried to find the people to do
it and they got two brothers
um one of whom was going to do one tower
and one who would do the other tower
one of the brothers did his tower and
then the other brother
did his tower slightly bigger and the
brother with the shorter tower got
really jealous
and so killed his brother um for doing
such a bigger tower
and then he could have made his tower
back to the equal height but then he
felt so guilty about killing his brother
that he didn't do it anymore
you're going to tell me that's not true
either andy i'm not going to say that no
way
no it's probably not true
well crackers it doesn't make up for
killing your brother i'll tell you that
if i was murdered but then i found out
that the person didn't actually go
through with the stupid bet we had
it's still not okay to murder you no
you're right
but there are great stories of krakov
and i'm james the only reason i'm not
going to tell you that your one isn't
true
is because the only other one i know is
about
of krakow is about the dragon who lived
under the hill
and there's a medieval story of krakov
and the dragon loved eating virgins
um they all do don't they
it's the whole species yeah there was
only one virgin
left after this huge virgin eating
rampage that the dragon had been on
anyway this poor cobbler filled up a
sheepskin with
sulfur and salt and then left that
outside the dragon's cave
anyway the dragon eats it and it's so
full of salt that he
feels so thirsty he drinks so much water
at the dragon that he explodes and dies
and then the cobbler uh is rewarded by
getting married to the king's daughter
who happens to be the last virgin in the
city
okay that's the story yeah and and the
dragon's bones
now hang out of the front of varvel
cathedral which
is in krakow it's the big cathedral
there the bones hang
from the door
[Laughter]
some bones some bones are there bones
i wish they'd study them so they're not
allowed to take them down right because
there's this idea that if they fall down
then the world will end immediately
so they're hung up by these chains which
are constantly checked
which is kind of a shame because
apparently the bones belong to some
creature from the pleistocene
then mammoth or maybe maybe a whale and
we just won't know because the only way
of checking them
involves the world ending at which point
i suppose you can't check the bones
it's a real catch 22. no they've done an
awesome statue of this dragon
it was first put up i think in 1972 um
and they decided on to have it brief
fire
huge like like a flamethrower and it
used to do that every five minutes or so
but actually they've started a new
service whereas you're walking by you
can text the dragon and ask it to
breathe fire
and it will do it on command so it can
actually
go every 15 seconds if it needs to the
15 second intervals between three
um polish leaders of krakov have had fun
names
over time i realized looking into the
history of krakow i particularly like
the 1200s where the duke of krakow
was called tanglefoot that was in 1210
and he died and was replaced by spindle
shanks
i think there's someone in between and
spindle shanks replaced him and actually
spindle shanks ended up getting killed
by a german girl that he was trying to
sexually assault so
well done well she killed him so well
yeah it was a bad start to the story but
you know
you guys come up with a happy ending i
thought those shanks would have been
killed by voldemort by the sounds of him
this one enemy was henry the bearded
tanglefoot and spindle shanks were on
the same side and then henry the bearded
was their enemy wow eventually became
duke of krakov
oh that's great it does sound like a jk
rowling plot isn't it i really like king
zigman the old
uh because him and his wife bonnard
spotzer
um brought soup vegetables to poland
in the 16th century that's what they're
famous for i mean
what's james i don't want a quibble but
all vegetables soup vegetables
well they brought she was uh bona
swanson was italian
and so they brought a lot of um
vegetables that didn't grow naturally
in poland and they brought them over but
that's what they're famous for tomatoes
i suppose you wouldn't get tomatoes in
poland
but you wouldn't get them in anywhere in
europe but she rather they market them
as soup vegetables is that how they got
themselves that's what they're known as
now
like polish soup vegetables i guess
um their daughter was called anna
jaguelon and she was the last female
ruler of poland
uh and she was basically part of a
family where she was like the youngest
daughter
and everyone thought that she was like
an old kind of spinster who would never
get married kind of thing
and then suddenly everyone else in her
family died
and she was going to be the ruler of
poland and suddenly she became the
hottest ticket in town
and um ivan the terrible wanted to marry
her and
um henri valjean france wanted to marry
everyone wanted to marry all the
habsburgs wanted to marry her and stuff
i think this would make a great kind of
1990s teen comedy of you know
like the overlooked girls suddenly
becoming the
hottest girl in class kind of thing yeah
you need to
i think you'd need to rewrite the bit
where sort of all her siblings were
brutally
murdered or died in horrible ways for
the teen comedy audience but she's
a poster she's surrounded by soup
vegetables and she's looking to the
camera and going
i like it she eventually married
a hungarian prince called bathury but
they didn't really get on very well
he refused to learn polish and so they
spoke through an interpreter for the
rest of
his life uh and then eventually he died
and um instead of taking over herself
she pushed her nephew who was called
sigmund the third passer who became
actually like one of the great leaders
in
in polish history that's your sequel
exactly but he was actually the one who
moved
the capital of poland away from krakow
to warsaw so
you know thumbs down from this episode
episode in a hundred years yeah he's a
hero
oh by the way for americans you call it
krakow just in case you've been
wondering all this time what we're
talking about
but we call it krakow um thousands of
americans
just going ah
[Music]
um everything we said they're like
that's so weird they have that in crack
hours
i found a thing which is that america is
running out of buglers
and they desperately need them they need
them because
in two in 2000 at the beginning of 2000
a new law was passed that if you were
an army veteran and you had died you
were entitled to a military funeral
and so what they would do is they would
have to send out three people to be
their present and do a few military
um uh regalia type things
one of which is they would have to play
taps on the bugle taps being that song
burp
[Music]
i'm i'm murdering that song but it's
it's you know the classic american tune
um now the problem is is they don't have
enough buglers
to go and play this song so what they've
had to invent is a ceremonial bugle
and the ceremonial bugle has inside it a
sound system
with the song pre-loaded so what you end
up having
is these people playing the song but
what they're doing is once they press
down on one of the buttons
it just plays the song through a speaker
system that is at the top of the bugle
and they just pretend that they're
playing it because
that's the best way in order to
commemorate
yeah dan i read about it it's so weird
it seems like it's this little black box
that you shove into the end of your
bugle
and then you just press a button on it
and then you just hold the bugle it's
really bizarre
it's quite controversial isn't it
because some people are like well
surely you should have a proper bugler
at a funeral
but then other people say well you know
what if we there is a shortage like dan
says so if we don't do this we're just
gonna have to have a boom box with
playing the tap so
that's gonna be even worse um but then
the other argument
again is that you know when dan really
murdered that
tune a few seconds ago that's kind of
part of it
so it's not really supposed to be
perfect note for note when you play the
taps
it's supposed to have emotion in it
because the person who's played it is
quite upset and so
the the notes are supposed to be
slightly off and a bit shaky and stuff
like that and you obviously don't get
that with the recording
they'll get used to it it's like
remember when taxi drivers first started
using sat nav and it was really
disappointing
and then you do you realize that it's
actually fine it's a bit like that
yeah being taken three miles around the
houses
and that's part of the ritual and the
tradition it shows the emotion in the
taxi driver that you're being charged an
extra tenner
because he's not gonna ask what exactly
where this which postcard you meant to
be going to
yeah i accidentally researched you know
the band uh the bugles who did
video killed the radio star the buggles
exactly
i only realized that about an hour into
my research i
spent genuinely an hour looking at every
song they did to see if a bugle had ever
been played by the bugles
and uh as far as i could find it hasn't
but it doesn't matter anyway because
that's not what they're called
the buggles did have a member called
trevor horn
so they'd get one thing out of it that
wasn't weird
stop the podcast stop the podcast hi
everybody just wanted to let you know we
are sponsored this week
by linkedin that is right
yes linkedin is the enormous community
of professionals
employers and employees looking to match
up
it's enormously popular there are more
than 30 million members on linkedin in
the uk alone and if you're not one of
them
what are you doing that's right
basically linkedin is a fabulous place
to recruit new employees you can target
exactly the right people for the role
and because there are so many millions
of people on there you can find people
who may not even be looking for a job
but will be perfect for the role that
you have in mind so it's a much better
way of recruiting than traditional job
ads
that's right stop poaching sneakily if
you happen to be looking for the perfect
fourth person to be on a podcast because
of a recently fired member for instance
linkedin's got it it's got everything
andy we need to talk after this by the

fish okay on with the show on with the
podcast
[Music]
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that
is anna my fact this week is that when
the conservationist amy dickman booked a
dentist appointment in namibia
she neglected to mention to the dentist
that the patient was a leopard
how did the appointment go do we know it
actually went quite well yeah it was a
series of appointments in the end as
often happens with the dentist
and this is it was on the bbc
website a while back i think and it was
an interview with her and she was saying
that she works in
various african countries with
threatened species she was in namibia
and she found a leopard that
got into a farmer's trap because farmers
trap them to stop them killing their
livestock
and she saw it had a broken canine so
she anesthetized it
and she called the local dentist and
just booked an appointment
and then she said she arrived and
they're obviously lots of people in the
waiting room who are frightened enough
already because they're in a dentist
waiting room and then a leopard gets
carried through
and apparently the dentist really took
to it after a while and
she explained it's okay i've
anesthetized it so it's not going to
wake up and eat you
and so the dentist was like how
brilliant and they had to make a
specially hard tooth for the leopard
because obviously they do much more
tearing of their food than we do
so he plotted using titanium and steel
and silver to make this tooth
and it was basically okay exactly not a
scary moment at the end when it when it
happened again
repeated fittings and on the very last
appointment
she said she thinks it was a dodgy
anaesthetic and all these crowds had
gathered around to watch at this point
because they've got quite a name for
themselves for having this leopard in
the dentist
so there are crowds of people in the
room the dentist said i'm pretty sure
the leper just blinked at me
and they said don't be silly it's
anaesthetise 30 seconds later it that
massive raw and then climbed up off the
table
she said the crowd she's never seen a
crowd disappear from a room so fast
jumped out the windows and stuff and uh
they had to chase it around and
anesthetize it again which she then
pointed out i'd only ever really worked
on cheetahs
which apparently who knew have very
prominent veins so very easy to um
to vaccinate to anesthetize difficult to
catch
though but one of the things they had to
do as well so the
the the um the line had got up and
sorry the leopard had got up and it was
walking around and
the the dentist was too freaked out and
didn't want to help with the grappling
of it
and they were all freaking out and some
of them ran out onto the road and by
chance
the vet was walking down the road and
they're like
that get here now and the vet was like
what's something we've got a leopard
that's awake and he ran in
and helped hold down the leopard and
they they reanisized it but like just
total coincidence
as they ran out that this guy was just
probably going to the shops that's
something that wouldn't believe this
in a film he'd be like what are the
chances he's walking by at that moment
not realistic i think anesthetizing the
animals is
one of the main problems of these kind
of veterinary
dentists isn't it because you know
anesthetizing animals is just a
difficult thing to do i was reading
about one in 20 of four which was a
jaguar called hibalba
who needed five root canals and um
they gave it anaesthetic um but
unfortunately
the jaguar went into cardiac arrest and
stopped breathing
because it reacted badly to the
anesthesia
and so the dentist who is called namiac
said
that they tried a quick yank on the
cat's testicles and he was awake
just like that and the
jaguar completely recovered that's yeah
dentists do that
that's normal isn't it yeah yeah you um
you swallow you rinse you spit the dent
just gives you a quick gag down there
and then you go oh you get the sticker
[Laughter]
it seems like you have to have nerves of
steel to go into this kind of
dentistry the animal world dentistry i
was reading about a guy called peter
emily he's 82 years old and he's a
pioneer in this territory he says that
he's operated basically on everything
with a mouth
so he's done kangaroos he's done
ferrets he did sigrin royce he's done a
river
and in this article he was operating on
a lion's head
so you can imagine if that line wakes up
it's going to be terrifying while he was
operating on the lion's mouth can we
just say that as a dentist most of the
work he does is head based isn't it
yes true but my point of saying that
though is at the very same time
someone's down at the other end
removing the line's testicles so it was
it's a scary procedure yeah if he woke
up that's one pissed off line
and then as he's doing that procedure
they bring in next to him
a black leopard which is just laying
perpendicular on the table next to
this lion so he's just surrounded in
animals that if i
could and i asked would just rip his
head off why did they decide to take the
testicles on the teeth out at the same
time
i don't just have one of those yeah i
have to say
no complaints
in this case they were they were using
them to um grow stem cells so it was two
different
things happening from two different
people it wasn't yeah in order to
help out with the tooth i guess if
anesthetizing is hard which it is and i
guess you don't want to do it too often
so i suppose you sort of take what
chances you get while you've got a
knocked out lion so
there was a guy a zoo dentist in the uk
called peter another peter actually
peter kirtege of paint and zoo he is
again one of the only
zoo dentists in the world and in 2008 he
did an operation on a gorilla
at paint and zoo and it it took about 10
people to remove the gorilla's tooth
because you've got people positioning
the gorilla you've got people monitoring
the anesthetics
you've got all sorts of activity
happening around and there's this huge
you know 300 pound gorilla sitting
in the chair completely dead to the
world and he's having to operate on it
and he said peter peter cates was
interviewed and he said
people often ask me if it is fun working
on gorillas and tigers
it certainly is not fun it is very hard
and serious work
oh what a killjoy he's having fun i just
sat next to him at a
yeah oh tell us about the gorilla it's
not fun
[Laughter]
oh my god what a cool job wow it's
actually
horrible okay moving on
um in terms of dentistry it's not even
just the teeth that they have to deal
with so
um this guy that i was talking about
peter emily he also
works on bird beaks as well and he's
pioneered
a speciality which he calls ortho b
kicks
and big braces right i think he's the
guy who does bird
braces for beaks if you've got i think
the condition is
called scissor beak technically isn't
you know when you get a faulty pair of
scissors and the you can imagine the two
bits
not faulty processors sorry a
functioning pair of scissors but the two
bits don't crash into each other like a
beak should
they slide over each other and so that's
what
scissor beak is um so he has braces for
birds that they have to wear and
eventually it wrenches them back into
place
but they do get bullied at school and i
just say if it's a cross build they're
supposed to be like that
oh no do you think he's ruined loads of
cross builds they're just called bill
yeah um rats
if anyone has a pet pet rat uh they
sometimes perform dentistry on their
owners
oh and this is a thing
that people let them do as i i find rats
quite gross
uh as i think a lot of us do but what
they like to do is inspect each other's
teeth for spare
food so they often get food stuck in
their teeth and their mate will have you
know a bit of
dairy milk stuck in it too so they'll go
and lick the food off and
if you own a rat and you show it your
teeth no it will lick
between your teeth and lick the food out
and who needs a toothpick
when you've got a pet rat and people
have been doing this
i mean how many is this a common i have
a friend who had a pet rat
i'm not going to tell you who it is
because you know them
i don't think that they will have done
that james is that is this
is this rare enough that we can make fun
of it and shame the people who do it
or is it very common and we should be
careful is it so common
that i need to rethink my friend's group
[Laughter]
they also have rank teeth anyway rats
sorry no offense to rats but they
grow faster than human nails so they
have to be constantly gnawing so you
need to give them stuff to chew all the
time
and they grow in spirals at an 85 degree
angle so if their teeth come out their
mouths and they don't know enough then
they grow in this big spiral
and when they're chewing the masseter
muscle which is the muscle that controls
their
jaw is positioned behind their eyeballs
so if you watch videos of rats chewing
they do a thing called boggling at the
same time which is when they're eyes
that's dad's favorite band isn't it the
buggles
sorry what did that what is it boggling
sorry anna it's known as what you think
their eyes pop in and out of their heads
as they chew can i give you guys a fact
about just
general dentistry you know how we all
love
nominative determinism yeah well i have
got off it a little bit i have to say
after reading this fact
and i think that it might not be true
because i read that the first woman to
qualify
as a dentist in england was called miss
fanny payne
and i think if nominative determinism
was real she would have been a
gynecologist
yeah funny there should be something
called nominative anti-determinism or
something
where they've gone the wrong way um so
she um qualified in 1914 there were um
there were a few dentists before her
because a few people qualified in
scotland before that uh female
dentist i should say but like in the
19th century
really you only had male dentists and
then there was
fanny payne and there was another woman
called lillian lindsey
who became the first female to qualify
as a dentist in the whole uk because she
did hers in
in scotland uh and it was so
looked down upon um that when she tried
to join the national dental hospital
in great portland street um the dean
who's called harry vice
harry harry harry she's very advised
harry voice yeah that's what causes the
fanny pain
[Laughter]
he was called her advice harry weiss
harry vice
and he refused to admit her because she
was a woman and then when she really
insisted
um he would only interview her on the
pavement outside the school because he
didn't want her to distract all the
other dentists who were inside
wow but yeah eventually they did and now
i think um
it's more than 50 of dentists in europe
i think are women
people are trying home dentistry now are
they and are being advised not to
so is this a coronavirus thing yep the
economist reported on various dentists
saying that they're very worried because
a lot of their patients are saying
they're doing things
like uh using needles to burst their own
abscesses
in their mouths they're using knives and
forks to take their teeth out and nail
files to cut down broken teeth
i would i've actually been doing this
myself at home and it's a
real nightmare because i've been having
to yank on my own testicles when i'm
finished
[Music]

[Music]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with anna toshinski
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again we have gathered round
the microphones with our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in no particular order
here we go starting with you
james okay my fact this week is there is
only one mosquito in iceland
poor lonely mosquito how'd it get there
well
we think it maybe came over from
greenland
on a plane right because it was found in
the 80s
by a guy called professor gizly ma
gizlassen from the university of iceland
and i wrote to professor grislinson and
he wrote back
and he said he boarded a flight at
keflavik airport in
1986 in june and the plane had come over
from greenland
and it was making a stop in iceland and
it was going to germany and he was
walking down the passenger cabin
and he saw this mosquito and he thought
what's that doing here
and he's like i need to catch that
mosquito and so he legged it along the
aisle chasing this mosquito
and he managed to grab it and then he
was going to work
at karlsruhe at the university for three
months but he had this mosquito and he
knew it had to go to iceland so he kept
it for three months
but he killed it by this point it was
dead i think it probably died when he
grabbed it
so he then kept it in his uh room in
this university for three months
and then when he came back to iceland he
gave the specimen to the icelandic
institute of natural history
they put it in some alcohol and they
kept it behind the scenes as this one
icelandic mosquito but and this is where
it takes a dan brown kind of twist in
2016 the new york times interviewed him
and asked him about the single mosquito
and they went to look for it in the
institute of natural history and they
can't find it
so we know that it exists we know it's
in iceland somewhere but we don't know
exactly where it is it's probably in the
draw somewhere but we don't know where
it is
i think the real story here is this
guy's eyesight
if he's walking along the island of a
plane and he spots at a distance a
mosquito
yeah he calls it as a mosquito not just
a fly exactly this guy he smashed it
he's like yeah i know a mosquito when i
see one
but i don't get it because the mosquito
was on a connecting flight to germany
and still went to germany
where they have mosquitoes so is it
because it had landed
initially in iceland that he thought
that counts
definitely it counts because it's in
certainly an icelandic airspace isn't it
it was in keflavik airport so i've been
like you know when you do this where you
count all the countries in the world
that you've been to i do that sometimes
to try and beat my wife
and the way that i beat her is by
counting countries where literally we
just landed and then we took off again
and i never got off the plane like
bangladesh
i went to bangladesh and just stopped
there i never got off the plane but i
count that as going to the country so i
think this
mosquito should do the same do you think
this mosquito had one of those scratch
maps
and you just rub off your country every
time you go
i'd love to see james your bangladesh
photo album
like just all shots of the inside of the
plane
are we sure the mosquito wasn't
someone's emotional support animal
a really good point ruined their trip
completely
yeah but the thing is there aren't any
mosquitoes in iceland and it's one of
the very few countries where there
aren't any
pretty much every other country in the
world has them and that includes
greenland which is
colder and it includes other countries
like in a similar
area to iceland such as great britain
and things like that you know all these
places have got mosquitoes but iceland
doesn't
and the reason is that they are cold but
they're not always cold they have lots
of changes of
climate all the time and so it gets
really cold and then it gets
kind of not too cold and then it gets
really cold again and stuff and the
changes are so rapid that mosquitoes
don't have time to complete their life
cycle because they have a particular
life cycle
whereas in greenland it's much colder
but then they do have areas that are
a more steady climate and they can
survive in places like that
yeah in greenland they're massive aren't
they as in their massive in size
they're huge in size and reputation oh
yeah i think they are particularly big i
mean they heard
deer how impressive they are they heard
caribou in greenland but they don't
really do it deliberately so they're
particularly vicious ones apparently
because they don't have access to that
much blood so there was one researcher
who said only about 15
ever get a blood meal and they need a
blood meal to survive the females do
and so they're super vicious and they
harass caribou
and if a caribou baby gets attacked by a
load of mozzies it can kill it
but the adults they see the aussies and
they run away and actually apparently
this is quite useful because mosquito
harassment
i read is a big factor in making sure
caribou don't over graze
they just move them along to stop them
overgrowing the land
apparently they run to the top of
glaciers they have to go that far to
avoid
mosquitoes chasing them wow that's quite
shaming when you're that big it's like
an elephant and a mouse
um i was about to say have you heard of
the seychelles um yes which is
oh cool okay yeah well i've been there
well you say you've been there james
did you leave the airplane it's
scratched off on my map
so you know we don't need to go into the
details then
but basically it has all the right
conditions and all the islands near it
have
mosquitoes and malaria the temperature's
quite warm it's very biodiverse
but it doesn't have mosquitoes and they
think the reason why is that it doesn't
have any native
mammals that walk around on land it has
it has bats which are
mammals but apparently mosquitoes need
the mammals they feed on to walk around
i don't know why and scientists keep
searching and they they spray the
interior of every plane with insecticide
because they're really happy not to have
mosquitoes and occasionally once or
twice in the whole last century they've
got in
but they just you know spontaneously
disappeared so they haven't got them
well it's good to know where
they are because i hadn't realized up
until researching this fact how
dangerous they have been a few numbers
have been crunched together and they
believe that
52 billion humans nearly half of all of
us have ever lived have been killed by
mosquitoes half of all humans ever
i'm unclear but i think that that might
be a useful misconception to debunk
because i think that estimate is often
stated but
i was reading a thing that actually
crunched the numbers and it was
basically saying
maximum it's probably only about seven
percent of the population
that's still a lot it's a hell of a lot
but i don't know i i don't no one really
knows where that original estimate came
from so it may have been someone who is
doing
some better number crunching well the
place i was
reading about this was in a book called
the mosquito a human history of our
deadliest predator by a guy called
timothy c
weingart and to be fair as awesome as
the book sounds and as awesome as he is
he does say a few things that make you
think i think you're giving the mosquito
a bit more credit than
uh yeah than it deserves well he also
says the extinction of the dinosaurs is
down to the mosquitoes now obviously
we've all heard the famous story about
the asteroid hitting the earth
but he says up until that moment 70
of regional dinosaurs had been made
extinct by mosquitoes and they probably
would have taken out the rest but the
pesky asteroid got in their way the
asteroid just
finished the job the mosquito had
started is that what he's saying
took the credit yeah it's like the
americans swooping in at the end of the
war
he's been plugging away for six years
um yeah they aren't they are bastards
they kill a hell of a lot of us and
they've got so many different ways of
doing it
and i hadn't quite realized how recently
it was that we realized that
certain diseases were spread by
mosquitoes so it was really the turn to
the 20th century
um yellow fever but in humans for
thousands of years 3000 years at least
and only in 1900 did people put it
together that that was mosquitoes
we used to think that mixomatosis was
caused by mosquitoes but that was
proved not true in the 60s and it was
found
not to be true by this amazing
entomologist called day miriam
rothschild and she basically worked out
that it was
fleas that did it and she did that by
just carrying plastic bags full of fleas
around with her in a bedroom in a house
she had just had all these fleas around
and she worked out the life cycle of the
flea
and then she worked out that it was
controlled by the sex hormone
of rabbits which would let it finish its
life cycle and that's where the mixed
mitosis came from in the rabbits
but she was amazing she worked at the
enigma project at bletchley park
and during the war she had a lab in
plymouth with all of her fleas and stuff
and it got bummed and she lost seven
years of work
uh she's gonna say she lost seven fleas
they don't mention that much when they
do the statistics in the water they
the seven fleas that were lost um
in 1952 she wrote a book called fleas
flukes and cuckoos
which she started writing while pregnant
and marooned in the channel due to a
storm
um living off a diet of boiled potatoes
and she's all she had was a pen
and a piece of paper and some boiled
potatoes and so she had the potatoes and
started writing her butt
and um her later book which is called an
atlas of insect tissue which came out of
the 80s
on the jacket illustration it has the
close-up illustration of the vagina
of a flea which she claimed made it
unique in the publishing world
as the only book with the vagina flea on
the front cover
yeah seems likely um how is she stranded
in the channel
what's happened there she was on a boat
going either from the uk to europe or
the other way around and there was a
storm
and they couldn't go to part and was it
stranded for so long that they were
reduced to living off potatoes
you know people are reduced to living
off certain things when they've been out
for weeks
it feels like she was looking for a
great origin story for her book
i thought this is finally a cool enough
circumstance someone's just brought
around the potatoes
it's true i mean it does sound like one
meal doesn't it it sounds like
a waiter brought around chips on the
ferry yeah as they were refueling
uh do you know another thing that
mosquitoes are responsible for that we
can thank them for
is the creation of great britain that's
true yeah
now this is according to timothy c
weingarten
the human history of our deadliest
predator okay and he says that in 1698
scotland was attempting to colonize the
americas and really set themselves up so
they sent out five ships and these ships
got to panama and the mosquitoes of
panama gave them
all malaria and so on they got really
really sick and it turned into a huge
financial crisis so england stepped in
offered to pay the scottish debt and in
doing so
scotland had to forfeit sovereignty and
that was when they united
with england thus mosquitoes created
i think great britain in fairness to
your guy that that one is pretty much
true
i'm pretty certain that's true the scots
what they were trying to do is
like all the colonial powers around the
world like spain and portugal and
england
were all going around finding these
countries to subjugate and take over
and the scots thought we're gonna get in
on that and they decided to go to this
place called darion not realizing that
it was just full of midges and
mosquitoes and i think there was like
some con man who'd gone to edinburgh
telling everyone that it was this
amazing was it called gregor mcgregor or
something
and he told everyone that this amazing
place that they could all go and live
and
and stuff and it was just a complete
swamp such a good story
um it's actually really unpleasant for
mosquitoes feeding off our blood
i know it's quite unpleasant for us as
well but it's really hot
because they're insects they actually
don't have such good thermoregulation as
we do
and so when they feed off our blood
which is obviously at our warm blooded
body temperature
they get boiling hot and the only way
that they survive it
is by urinating all over themselves as
they do it
and kind of bleeding on their bums
really
yeah what so wait a minute so the food
is too hot yeah so you got some hot soup
and instead of blowing on the soup you
urinate over your whole body
it's another option james just next time
you're at a dinner party
yeah it's worth trying and it looks cool
you should look it up so
scientists are really confused about why
they'd waste fresh blood they'll drink
your blood and then you'll see a little
droplet of blood
sprouting out of their anus and they
obviously haven't got the nutrients out
of it
and that's because it's getting so hot
that they need to excrete some of that
liquid so that it evaporates off them
and carries the heat away it's a bit of
a shameful experience
um if you're a mosquito researcher do
you know how you get
mosquitoes to mate with each other um
it's very sexy stuff what you have to do
you start off by decapitating
the mail and then you have to
anesthetize the female
right and then you have to grab the male
and insert his still-protruding genitals
into the
female and then they will lock together
and sperm will be transferred between
the two and the female
will become pregnant and some people can
do that without a microscope
what how do they decapitated do they
have like a tiny little guillotine
they have to put it through a show trial
first though yeah
also how come the female's the one that
gets the anaesthetic isn't the male
they're going i'm being sodding
decapitated
[Laughter]
um yeah it's a good point it's really
i don't know it feels like there's a lot
going on there we're really the only
important bit is you get the male
genitals and you put them inside the
female
it doesn't i don't know why you have to
decapitate the male that's something i
really don't get
it feels like a lot of that stuff is
being done for fun by the researchers
um we found out a new way of
transporting mosquitoes
uh because this is quite important so
let's say
you've got a load of mosquitoes that are
sterile and you want to put them in an
area where they have disease problems
like malaria or zika or something
and you put the sterile ones in there
and they can outperform
the non-sterile ones and then it
hopefully stops them from hurting humans
but how do you get them from a to b
because mosquitoes
they don't really go on really long
flights unless they get on the
is 192 from god that's keflavik they do
but normally they only go about you know
100 meters from where they were born
and so we need to get them from one
place to another and a lot of
researchers have found out that the best
way to do it
is to squish as many as you can in a
little vial
because it turns out they're not that
fussed about it and
they kind of stay alive whereas if you
put fewer of them in the vial
then they might kind of bash around and
stuff like that and they might not
survive whereas if you
put something like you know 1200
mosquitoes in the space of a teaspoon
is what i'm talking about 240 mosquitoes
per cubic centimeter
and you squish them all right down they
have this kind of exoskeleton that can
almost like fill in all the gaps and so
there's no gaps in between them all
which means they can't wriggle around
they can't hurt themselves and only
maybe the ones at the very top and the
very bottom would get injured and the
rest of them when you let them free
they're okay
nice it's like a jigsaw like yeah or
getting the london underground
i've definitely been in a situation
where i've seen jigsaw positions
but it definitely is i thought it was
like london underground because i
remember feeling safe when there are so
many people you don't need to hang onto
the railings
right because you just all sway in time
against each other no one can
fall that's why you always went on the
tube with 12 really buff bodyguards yeah
juana who just kind of
gathered around you yeah it was very
expensive catching the tube actually
having to pay those salaries
did you guys know that mosquitoes are
responsible
for the magna carta is this another of
your
done according to timothy c weingart
right author of the mosquito a human
history of our deadliest predator
he says that louis v siege of damascus
was during a malaria season
in 1148 the downfall of that the fact
that it couldn't happen
led to his separation from eleanor of
aquitaine
and that led to horror marrying henry ii
of england which then
led to the birth of king john who was
then having all those battles with his
barons that led to the magna carta so
really
mosquitoes again have shaped history in
ways we've not given them credit for
all right then if we're doing tenuous
things that we can thank mosquitoes for
we can also thank them for gin and tonic
which
i think there may be one fewer
connection here jin its reputation was
ruined
start of the 19th century because you
know all like the scummy gin houses and
it was making people behave very badly
and then it became a bit of a heroic
drink because this was around about the
time that the brits were colonizing
india
and they realized that the only way to
stave off malaria was with quinine
and so they started making tonic water
with loads and loads of quinine
and so queening became this great heroic
drink because it was saving the
british colonizers in india from getting
malaria and it was brought home they
chucked it in gin
and suddenly jin went from being a
scourge on society
to being a patriotic thing to drink when
you paired it with tonic water
and thus the gin and tonic was born they
also spread christianity
listen i'm telling you the mosquito
human history of a deadliest predator is
fascinating according to timothy c
weingartz
it's because people were dying of
malaria that people who were pushing the
christian faith were going out to help
the sick
and in helping the sick they were able
to spread the message more so
malaria was leading to actually a huge
burst of advertisement
so if people were dying of other stuff
then the christians would have gone now
it
if it's it's not mosquito related i'm
not interested
exactly could have been a very different
world but once again the mosquito
has forced the course of history that
we've ended on yeah
they shouldn't call it the butterfly
effect should they they should call it
the mosquito effect
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the focus
hey everyone this week's episode of fish
is sponsored by
hello fresh yes as i'm sure you know by
now hello fresh is essentially the best
way to
eat they deliver recipes along with
ingredients to your door so you can make
fantastic meals
but it's the best way to eat in tons of
ways so
for instance if you're worried about
where your foods come from about the
impact that it might have on the
environment
or the ethics of what you're eating
which you should be if you're not get on
it then hello fresh is also the best
choice so all of their recipes are 100
sustainable that's right and they're
also going to become 100
carbon neutral their recipe boxes
themselves are going to be 100 carbon
neutral
so you can eat both healthily for
yourself
and planet earth so that's pretty
exciting that is right and speaking of
planet earth you can sort of travel
around the world
with hello fresh recipes because they
always have global options so
they'll have a mexican version i think

that's right so we're sponsored by
harry's and the word paraphernalia today
on with the show on with the podcast
okay it is time for fact number two and
that
is andy my fact is that in the early
20th century japan had
secret propaganda underwear which you
would only show to your close friends or
family
okay so wow so this
is a kind of clothing they were common
in japan in the early 20th century
basically they're a kind of kimono there
are lots of different kinds of komoda
and also lots of different
things to do with kimono so there are
under kimonos there are
miamira kimono which are kind of
swaddling kimonos for babies
all sorts of kimonos and around about
1900 japan started producing
various artisans started making really
stunning
modern kimono prints which were you know
art deco and they were cubist and they
had all sorts of
you know beautiful modern patterns on
them and they had cities and ocean lines
and skyscrapers and
trains and planes and everything and
they were secret because you wouldn't
obviously be flashing your undergarments
or the linings of people
unless it was to people you knew quite
well um
but yeah to be honest we probably had
known each other three or four months
before you started flashing you're on
the garments of me
exactly you got you got into what i call
the inner circle i
wish you hadn't called it that
those things sound not propaganda though
you know it seems harsh if you're
brandishing some art deco
though or like artistic expression i
think it's more what we call it isn't it
that's like the term that people call it
propaganda
they did make a slight twist into more
outright propaganda territory when
the government became a bit more
militaristic and a bit more fascistic as
well so you could get mussolini uh
underpants as well to unders as well
really yeah yeah
they had um because they had hitler they
had yeah
they had hitler ones too anti-aircraft
guns on your
under kimono so yeah it did it did go in
that direction the
scene is slightly embarrassing now but
they didn't start out that way i bought
some pants in um
japan once but they were godzilla on
them so that's not the same thing is it
well though it is still slightly
embarrassing
these ones that you um these propaganda
ones you were mentioning andy
the really interesting one was the one
that was made for kids that you
mentioned the mayamari
that was made for infants that were
going to a shinto shrine for the first
time to be blessed
and when they were doing the propaganda
ones they were quite
full-on they had soldiers preparing to
dash through a field of exploding shells
and children on the garment sleeve so it
was all about children in war
largely when you saw these things it was
it was really
pushing the idea that kids should be
believing in battle as well
yeah it definitely went a bit goebbel's
direction didn't it they're very much
trying to suck up to the fascists it's
one point of their underwear making
industry
and there is some shame attached to it
now this is what i thought was really
interesting about the article that you
sent around andy which i think was an
atlas obscura piece
was the woman who first revealed it was
this woman called jacqueline atkins
who i partly liked that she was a
fulbright scholar in japanese textiles
which i didn't realize they did
fulbright scholarships in but um
she tracked them down she started she
went to japan and she started seeing
these
propaganda slightly fascistic kimonos
and she asked people about them and they
wouldn't tell her anything and she found
this woman who had a collection
and she really didn't want to speak to
her because you know she was like it's
really embarrassing my family don't know
that i have these
no one knows there's no written records
of them the history has been really
suppressed because
you know it was it was very militaristic
putting pictures of fighting children on
children's
underwear but yeah so it's only come out
recently hasn't it
this whole thing i love that they the
kimono itself
roughly translate as thing to wear yeah
yeah it hasn't got
it's just such a random and even these
propaganda ones that were designed
they were called omoshi regards and
omashi regard just means
interesting or amusing design so just
thing to wear with interesting or
amusing design
but these days like to get a really good
kimono they're unbelievably expensive uh
we went to a kimono shop when we're in
japan and tried to buy one
thinking that it would be expensive but
not that expensive
and they brought you in the shop like
you know you're in a car showroom
and they showed you all of these amazing
prints and stuff and then only at the
end told you it was going to be like 20
grand for one of these
wow i know and like you know you can't
get them for all different price ranges
but if you go to these specialist shops
that can be
the amount they're so expensive were you
like you were trying to leave the shop
but you didn't want to seem like you
didn't have the money so you bought
something anyway and just went god you
know i'll just go for those godzilla
underpants
how much five grand
they are really artisan there aren't
they the people who are designing them
there's one
family that has been making kimonos and
still to this day and i think they're
the last surviving of the sort of
historical makers of it
so they're called chiso and they were
set up in 1555
and it was initially set up by a guy who
was making it for some monks
and all these four centuries later they
are still
making it with the same family it's the
descendants of the same family it's like
the pastor we were talking about the
other week of just it being handed down
it's a company that has over 600 people
designing these things and putting them
together
yet still they only make 25 kimonos a
year
that's how precious and time-consuming
and dedicated it is yeah
they're slow aren't they they're slow at
making them i'm sure it's a very
difficult process
but they say a standard kimono takes
three to four months this is just this
company
but it's not unusual for it to be a year
and a half for one kimono so if you're
thinking emergency for the party at the
weekend
you're not in luck they once spent 10
years developing one specific kimono
trying to get the indigo die exactly
right so
you might have changed your mind about
whether you want it by then i mean
you'll have changed
you might have changed like your idea of
what color you want you're like actually
you know i'm not really
i don't i was thinking more violet
rather than indigo
the thing is if you change shape doesn't
matter that's a giant kimono right
you can go up to 45 50 stone and because
it just wraps around
just wrap it around a bit looser
everyone looks good in the kimono
washing them is an absolute nightmare as
far as i can tell
hey it looks like it's extremely
expensive time consuming
but also you just can't do it on your
own so in order for you to wash a kimono
the whole thing needs to be taken apart
into seven different parts
and then you need to air dry them and
then re-stitch the whole thing back
together
there's special kimono washing stations
in order to do it
they have a huge process to do it they
wash it by hand with soapy water they
then lather it with seaweed paste
they hang it on these panels to dry it's
such a long process but you have to
literally take it
it's like going to a car wash and then
taking your car apart to wash it
back together it's mad i'm not really
surprised if it takes 10 years to make i
would be staggered if there was a label
inside saying just bung it in on 60
for an hour that's true i think just
soap under the armpits for a couple of
minutes and you're fine
when you're putting on your kimono make
sure you always
bring the right side over the body first
and then pull the left side over
the right side um because the opposite
way is the way the japanese dress the
dead
and so if you do it that way it's a big
faux pas or someone will just think
you've died
probably but yeah um you've won one
haven't you james
have a very fetching image well what i'm
looking at now and why i said that is
because i was given
a um three steps to wearing a kimono by
the
hotel which made us wear these kimonos
and said if you don't wear it you're not
getting dinner this evening
that's what they said and then women
would put the sash
around their waist and men would put it
over their hip bone slightly lower down
so that's the difference between men and
women's that's how you tell the
difference
yes exactly you know is that a live man
or a dead woman you can tell by just
looking at the kimono
i was speaking of wearing kimonos during
dinner james i was reading that in order
to make sure that you don't have to go
and have your kimono washed you often
have to do preventative things for
example wearing an inner kimono
part of that is so that it doesn't touch
the body and take on the odor so
you have to protect in that way if
anything gets onto the kimono
immediately get cleaning on it because
obviously the nightmare
i know i'm just thinking actually when i
had that dinner i shouldn't have ordered
the spaghetti bolognese because i got
sauce
all over my kimono and it's going to
take them three years to wash
oh yeah exactly i mean that's i was
reading this lady on korra who said
exactly that that when she sat down
to dinner in her kimono the waiter came
over
and immediately padded her entire body
with towels and napkins
for fear that she would be getting it
dirty
yeah james just say the spag ball is a
representation of a traumatic war scene
this is the song okay
they used to have magic eye kimonos that
you could get and these are
300 years ago yeah they're really wow
okay i'm really
now look when i say magikai no hang on
everyone calm down a bit i was just
thinking
right just hear me out here if you were
to have
a pair of trousers which were magic eye
and then people stared at them and then
it looked like
a bulge was coming out of the groin to
make your genitals look bigger that
would be quite clever wouldn't it that'd
be really good
if you wanted to be arrested
why would i be arrested when people are
staring at my genitals
good point it's not a fair system james
yeah that's what the flashers say don't
they
not forcing you to look
sorry okay so when i say magikai
basically it's all about the way they
changed the perspective
so there is a kimono from the 18th
century but
it has hawks on the bottom half of it
right hawks the birds of prey
and on the top all around the top half
of it there are these japanese
characters
which looks like they're referring to
different birds of prey
but actually it can be read in two ways
and actually if you read it in the other
interpretation it's all about visiting
prostitutes and that's it's a kind of
naughty sex kimono
i love it very cool i was trying to find
other kinds of kimonos i like going to
wikipedia sometimes and and pressing the
button that gives you
their surname is kimono were there
anyway what i found is
um did you know that there is only one
band called kimono in iceland
nice yeah yeah very strong go on and how
how did they get there were they chased
down the aisle of a plane
taken to germany first actually they're
pretty cool they were formed in 2001
and they've had a bunch of albums and
one of their members actually
left them recently moved to london and
joined the vaccines
really yeah so one of the vaccines
members used to be in kimono
in iceland yeah cool so here's an
interesting kimono i read about this in
the new york times in 2007
this was because in japan there is still
and there definitely was
a worry of women being assaulted um when
they're walking down the street
and so this thing was invented where you
would get your kimono
and then you would almost turn it inside
out and there was a few flaps and stuff
and then you could stand by the side of
the road and it would make you look
exactly like a vending machine
so you would walk past and you would
think oh it's just a vending machine but
actually
it was a woman who turned her kimono
inside out to make her look like a
vending machine
james i can't believe i'm going to say
this to you what are you talking about
this is a thing it was invented by
someone called miss
sukiyoka who's a 29 year old fashion
designer
in tokyo and that was the idea i'm not
sure
i don't think they were commonly came
into use after 2007
and if you if you ever go to japan
you'll see there are vending machines
everywhere like that is one thing about
it so
it is are there we don't know exactly
that's what i thought when i went to
japan i thought there's so many vending
machines but no women in this country
aren't you more likely to be touched by
a man who's thinking he's using a
vending machine than you would if you
were just standing being a woman
that's a really good point yeah i
suppose you know yeah
maybe your vending machine should look
like an empty vending machine
or maybe like one of your twixes should
be just hanging off so anyone who sees
it goes oh that's the dodgy one that's
not going to give me
i don't know if there's one i mean the
worst case scenario is when you are a
bit cheeky and you stick your hand into
the vending machine to try and
i'm just saying a
i'm not saying it's a flawless system
i'm just saying it's a thing
that at least in concept form existed
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
anna my fact this week is that fish get
the bends
if you reel them in too quickly oh i
know
poor little things and they get it worse
than we do
stop reeling fishing yeah i'll reel them
in very slowly
this is a genuine problem because in a
lot of recreational fishing you throw
the fish back into the water you know
you don't want to deplete the supplies
you don't want to kill the fish
but actually i read one estimate that in
western australia
70 of certain fish are thrown back into
the water
and someone estimated that about 50 of
those will actually die
because they've got the bends from being
reeled in and so the benz
is the sort of very painful consequence
of like if you've been diving very very
deep in the water and then you come up
far too quickly
there's this extremely quick decrease in
pressure that you undergo
and nitrogen bubbles are released into
your system and it's very painful
it's called the benz because of the
position that it renders you
into you're sort of bending over in
agony yeah and
yeah fish get it too and with fish it's
more like they
often just get bigger and like bulgier
and their eyes pop out
sometimes their stomach bulges out their
mouth yeah and there's a few ways to
stop it being a problem so you can vent
them
if you can somehow kind of put a hollow
instrument
through their body into their swim
bladder wall it can release some of the
gases
and that can help unfortunately you have
to be a bit of an expert to do that
don't just shove a burrow in because
that's like
most people who try and do it it doesn't
work i just think it's amazing that
method that you can
do mini surgery yeah fish like a
tracheotomy just
but it's incredible it is really amazing
that that can happen yeah
the other thing that you can do is you
can put them in a fish elevator um
which is a word for basically a milk
crate with a rope attached where you put
the fish in and very slowly weigh it
down so it goes back to where it came
from
as in if you threw the fish back in it
wouldn't know to go back down to the
depth too no dick well
i don't know if it knows even knows it's
a fish but it would like naturally try
and go down to the bottom
but the problem is it's full of this gas
so it can't go anywhere because it's
like
it's floating i mean you need to somehow
get the gas out of it
or get it back down to where it was
before so that the gas
changes under pressure but that's
basically because they have this swim
bladder isn't it so actually it's worse
because when they have gas bubbles in
them the whole swim bladder inflates
like it's literally like an inflatable
yeah and so they're just stuck at the
top
there is another method you can have to
bring them down which is attach a
descending device to them which is
basically a weight that you put onto its
lip and you just sort of clamp it on
there
and it just tugs the fish back down with
it and then it comes off you can set it
to release at the particular depth
that the fish should be swimming around
at wow i know
um when anna you say that the name the
benz comes from when you bend over
because you're in so much pain
i found this really interesting it's
actually named after something called
the grecian bend which i'm sure you all
read about which is incredible
so people do bend over in pain because
they have this
but at the time in the uh 19th century
there was this thing called the grecian
bend
and it was a way that women walked where
they kind of
stuck their bums out because they had a
big bustle and they stuck their chest
out
and they kind of look like they were in
a bit of an s shape
you'll see it if you see like
illustrations that are kind of taking
the piss out of the way women dressed in
the 19th century you'll see that people
dress like this
and basically when people started going
into mines or diving
and they started having this problem it
was around the same time that the
grecian bend was a really fashionable
way for women to dress
and so people said well you're you're
bending over like you're doing the
grecian bend
and that's why it's called the benz
those women kind of enjoyed being made
fun of though
oh they didn't care because it's fashion
like you don't care if you're
fashionable you don't give a if
people are saying oh what an idiot look
at you with your big
you know godzilla pants or whatever
you're like right i don't care these are
fashionable mate like
i don't know i'd be sensitive to it if
any of those women had had a way of
disguising themselves as some sort of
common bit of street furniture
um just while we're talking about the
benz did you guys read about john scott
haldane
oh i know about him yeah what a guy so
this is this is the person who started
studying the idea of why
you would get the bends as you were
coming up and in 1905 he was
tasked with trying to find this out so
haldane was a very famous scientist in
his day and actually just a quick bit of
background about this guy
he's someone who helped to create the
gas mask that we had at the first world
war
by literally going to the front line and
finding the gases and diagnosing what
they were and then coming back and
making the masks he was someone
who threw himself into experiments to
make sure he could understand what was
going on
in the case of decompression and working
out the bends
he was tasked with trying to do that and
he used groups of animals to begin with
to try and do it
but they all weren't matching humans so
eventually he worked out goats
with the perfect match they weren't
quite perfect it was like 1.7
goats would make up the human but they
were close enough and so
he had 85 goats come to this one spot in
london
and he would put them in these big
chambers and then release them into the
fields
outside and watch how they responded
and that's where they started learning
about the stages of decompression
so all these experiments eventually led
to haldane working out what we still use
today as the standard
decompression stages that you would use
if you were a scuba diver
still to this day and was based on 85
goats
um just a little note on that they then
moved to live trials on humans and the
ship which they did live trials on was
called hms spanker
here's the thing about who might get the
benz sometimes
scientists now think that ancient sea
monsters
also got the bends yeah do they this is
incredible
so have you heard of a mosasaur it's
like a dinosaur but they were a
different kind they lived in the scene
like a there are pterosaurs which those
winged ones
so it's a dinosaur adjacent so
scientists have found fossilized
vertebra
of mosasaur and they were about four or
five meters long and really big
animals but they found a strip of dead
bone
in an otherwise healthy bone now i don't
understand what that means because it's
all obviously fossilized dead bone
but they somehow found a bit of the bone
is different from the other bone and
they
think that decompression sickness is the
only possible cause of why you would
have that sudden
layer all the way through the bone
interestingly though if they found the
dead bone inside the living bone that
suggests that they had the problem but
then they
survived it because then the lipping
bone grew around it doesn't it
yeah they've figured out the
decompression stages thousands of years
before we did so
maybe it's i feel like i've been tricked
into saying it but yeah
i think dolphins get it as well but have
actually worked out the decompression
stages
they believe so people found something
similar
in dolphins have been washed up on a
beach recently which was that
they had little pockets of air in their
blubber
which shows that they obviously are
suffering from something like the bends
like the air is accumulating
but it is thought that what they do is
they come to the surface and if they
feel like they've got the symptoms
then they dive back down again really
deeply to sort of re-equalize and they
keep coming up and going down until
they don't die which is sort of how
people used to do it before
haldane came along i believe you just
have to dive back down to the bottom and
start again until it works
it's crazy that must have been just the
worst
mustn't it yeah and you're in so much
pain they're like well you're just gonna
have to go back down again mate yeah
oh really that's what caused the problem
in the first
place no that's the way it's so bad now
though now that we do know
it's almost as bad if you're diving
right there's this egyptian diver called
ahmed gaba
who beat the record for the deepest dive
in 2014
dove 332.35 meters down
that took him 14 minutes to get to that
depth
he then spent 13 and a half hours
getting back up to the surface
decompressing along the way
ah gotta say when you're going down if
you see like a nice shipwreck or a nice
load of fish or something you just don't
look at them you just go down as quick
because otherwise you're spoiling
the whole way back up aren't you you're
right you've got time on the way back
for that title exactly yeah
but don't they have chambers that you
can i remember watching an episode of
baywatch years ago where david
hasselhoff
very bravely swam to the bottom of the
ocean to save someone a scuba diver who
was trapped
and then brought them right back up and
the whole episode is basically him
inside a decompression chamber
back on the surface now don't we have
those can't you just swim up and just
get into a yeah but it just is slightly
more expensive to provide every amateur
diver with an entire decompression
chamber but you're right for this guy
actually you would have
you're breaking a record i agree stingy
but if you come back up
dan wouldn't david hasselhoff have got
the symptoms and then have to be put in
a decompression chamber to kind of
yeah you'd have to get hasselhoff into
the chamber
as quickly as possible really yes all
the time this uh nitrogen's trying to
get into your body but
if you could get back under pressure as
quickly as possible you might be okay
yes
yeah but i mean that's a tough good
because you don't want to rush him he
hates famously being hassled isn't he oh
boy
but at the same time baywatch was a big
show back then with a big budget so they
probably could afford one of these
machines unlike
amateur divers um yeah yeah on the
lesser production home and away probably
couldn't afford that
that's why there are so few deepsea
diving plot lines in home well there was
that do you remember there was the whole
nine months of when they were all coming
back to the surface
oh you just saw you just saw a flat bit
of water with a few bubbles coming up
the show was just called away for that
seriously
[Music]
stop the stop the podcast
hi everybody just wanted to let you know

exercising or whatever it is
wow yeah really exciting i went up to
intermediate last week
i know pretty amazing but if you

james what is the russian for
intermediate i have no idea that's
you only learn that when you get to a
much higher level very nice
okay i'm with the podcast on with the
[Music]
show
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that in 18th
century london
professional boxers would challenge
opponents by publishing requests to
fight
in the letters columns of newspapers wow
so i stumbled on this fact while reading
a book called the london monster by
an old buddy of ours john bonderson
great historian and
has nothing to do with the london
monster which was all about a sort of
precursor to jack the ripper
but in there he was talking about
interesting things that happened in
newspapers at the time
and he mentioned that boxers would sort
of publish
challenges to each other and they would
tease opponents and they would propose
fights and where and when and so on and
then would wait for a response to come
through maybe in the next day's
newspaper or
the following days to say yes i accept
and then
you would know a fight was on such a
weird way to communicate with each other
were they rude would they say you know i
will be kicking your head in at three
o'clock tomorrow
bundeson says polite but he also says
that they would often put in some barbs
and teasers
along the way i think sometimes it was
quite insulting i've read a few of these
there was one for instance
this was the first ever i think really
professional fight between
two women in the uk it was elizabeth
wilkinson versus hannah highfield
and elizabeth wilkinson put a
advertisement in the newspaper saying i
elizabeth wilkinson of clark and well
having had some words with hannah
highfield
and requiring satisfaction to invite her
to meet me on the stage and box me
that sounds quite polite it's quite
polite but maybe for the day it was a
bit
unpolite right because there was another
one she was fighting someone called anne
field who was an ass driver from stoke
newington
and she said in that one yeah an ass
driver
an ass driver you know what that's
whatever is so like let's say
you've got a monkey driver yeah yeah so
someone who has a load of asses
and wants to get them to market and so
has a stick and kind of walks into
market and hits them and makes sure
they're going the right direction
cool it just took me a while to put
donkey has the meaning when you said ass
driving
that's where i got confused yeah she was
um trying to get a fight with this ass
driver from stoke newington called
anfield
and she told anyone who read the
newspaper that the blows which i shall
present her with
will be more difficult for her to digest
than any she has ever given her
asses yeah so you know that slam does
work better when you say asses instead
of donkeys well exactly
just an implication of kicking your ass
that you need
that's what she should have said i'm
gonna i'm gonna kick you and then i'm
gonna kick your ass
[Laughter]
yeah apparently the elizabeth who was
one of the people in that fight
uh she also used to have couples fights
like couples
would be pitched against each other
which sounds quite fun
so cool but it was mixed doubles wasn't
it so it was i think it was men
fighting men while the women fight the
women it was very i don't think it ever
happened that men would fight women in
the same
it's that's not really like mixed
doubles because in mixed doubles
the man can serve to the woman right
it's not like
you don't just hit it so the man or the
woman hits it to the women
so it's like yeah i would watch a mixed
doubles where there were two balls in
play at the same time and
it can only go between the same sex yeah
yeah
so hang on she was called stokes right
this um is it elizabeth
she's called elizabeth wilkinson also
elizabeth stokes because she got married
halfway through her career uh but she
would say
nay won no stokes or nay will connect i
didn't want to say which one was nay
because i couldn't
no the the donkey was the day probably
it was it was the brain
um but yeah they were um they were like
almost professional
boxes and the way that they told the
difference between a professional and a
non-professional was that they wouldn't
fight topless
so you would have like prostitutes doing
fights
where they were all topless and this
would be like a way of making money
because they would get lots of people to
watch them and people would bet on it
and they would make money and stuff
whereas
these people like elizabeth wilkinson
they were more proper boxers really
yeah i read a description of those more
bawdy uh
i bet you would happen in the streets
yeah so there was a guy called william
hickey who wrote about it he saw a fight
in a tavern in drury lane in 1768 and
his description of it was the whole room
was in uproar men and women
promiscuously mounted upon chairs tables
and benches in order to see a sort of
general conflict carried upon the floor
two she devils for they scarce had a
human appearance
were engaged in a scratching and boxing
match their faces entirely covered with
blood
bosoms bear and the clothes nearly torn
from their bodies for several minutes
not a creature interfered between them
or seem to care a straw of what mischief
they might do to each other
and this used to happen a lot apparently
these these fights that were going on
but
women fighting was a thing that
elizabeth wilkinson was desperately
trying to make normal because you would
almost think that female professional
boxing was not a thing back then but
actually
it started in 1722 and it was very
popular and
it was not only seen as let's let's beat
each other up but let's try and empower
women it was a real
movement they even tried to at the
arenas which would usually be the bear
gardens
in london where you would usually go to
see a bear fighting a monkey which was a
massively popular thing back in the day
they even tried to set up galleries
where women could go and watch it
so the upper-class women could come and
see it and say oh this is a womanly
thing as well as a male thing
wait so women could go and watch the
bears fighting their monkeys
the women fighting the women could any
bears and monkeys go and watch the bears
fighting the monkeys are i think that
was the last bears of monkeys
all right okay lord byron's bear would
have gone yeah
i think stokes had an amphitheater later
in life as in she must have been really
successful because i think she and her
husband ran a boxing theater
because i read an advert for it which
advertised that there would be bull bear
and ass
baiting but also sorry is that is that
like donkey baiting is that that is
documented right yes
um donkey baiting sounds even bar rude
doesn't it
yeah the farmer was caught donkey
baiting
um but the final event or i don't know
if it's the final event it's
the the words of the advert say a dog
will be dressed up with
fireworks to augment the diversion of
the spectators i mean
it sounds unbelievably cruel yeah well
we touched on this in our
vinyl when we released a vinyl i think
james your james's fact i think was
about
boxing yeah yeah oh yeah but
you're not gonna hit anything else this
is a bit like one of those um porn sites
where you give it a 30 second teaser
and then you cut them off you can't know
anything else about that fact unless you
buy the vinyl
yeah you do just like a trailer for a
double movie
a bit like that as well it's like lots
of things
if you want to go high brown feels like
a very pent-up episode of the podcast
we've been with our houses for almost a
whole year
we all need to go away and have a bottle
of whiskey
and we should say that it was all
illegal right we keep saying
professional um
boxing but until quite late it was all
kind of illegal even though it happened
all over the place
i think the main way you can make a
living from it was in boxing booths
which i didn't really know about which
is odd because they lasted until the
1970s
and of course you were born in 1940 and
so really weird that you weren't there
for them
yeah well they sound fun these came
about in the 1700s and it was a way that
boxers uh sort of professional even
though it was illegal would travel
around with fez
and anyone who attended the fair would
challenge the boxer to a fight now i
don't know why anyone did this because
that's a professional boxer inside the
booth and you're just a pleb
but that's what they did and you know
you pay
pay a bit of money to do that or to see
it and i think the famous one was tom
hickman
he was in the 1820s and he was known as
the gaslight man
because he he told everybody he won when
he hadn't actually won
i'm the champion of the world
[Laughter]
he put your lights out oh very good
yeah but actually boxing booze the
reason that
there's a more relevant association with
them in the modern day
is that in the 1930s there was
a minor who'd lasted three rounds in a
boxing booth with a professional boxer
and so he won a bit of money used that
money to buy a wedding ring for the
woman he fancied
and they had two sons bobby and jack
and sir named charlton so without boxing
booths
to credit another spurious link without
boxing booze
england would not have won the world cup
it's no wine guard connection
i don't think he would have put that in
his book uh just on um
betting on whether you could beat boxers
uh there was one
quite weird trick which was round turn
of the 20th century
um in texas there would be a circus
would come into town
and there would be a woman outside the
tent promising fifty dollars to any man
who could
stay three rounds in a boxing ring with
her
and then people would go yeah no problem
and they pay their five dollars
and then they'd walk into the tent where
very conveniently all the lights were
extremely dim and you couldn't really
see what was going on
and then found themselves in the ring
with a
male boxer wearing a dress
who would beat the crap out of them
right i thought you were going to say
that the lights were all extinguished
but she'd been eating carrots from a
very young age
wow have you guys heard of daniel
mendoza
i'm sure he came across him in your your
reading he was done
no he was really famous
uh for his style of boxing he basically
um
he was five foot seven he was about 70
kilos he was relatively he was a sort of
middleweight rather than a heavyweight
but he was still a champion boxer
despite that
um and i i've read that he basically
came up with the idea of avoiding
being punched before that
you just sort of take the hits and hope
that you could hit the other guy harder
and he came up with a style of moving
and basically avoiding being hit really
hard
that that sort of revolutionized boxing
yeah and he was really really tough he
wrote his memoirs later in life
he wrote in his memoirs he was so tough
that he once got in three fights on his
way to a boxing match
because he was so angry firstly someone
cut him up in a carriage so he got the
fight with them
then a shopkeeper tried to cheat him
allegedly and then third someone just
looked at him in a funny way
and so he he arrived at the boxing match
he sounds lovely
yeah i don't know if you can claim
you're so tough if you've invented the
tactic of avoiding being punched
i think he was compensating with that
story
um i was reading about one very famous
fight between
bob fitzsimmons and jack sharkey and
this had been organized uh by william
randolph hurst who was the newspaper
magnate
and these two were the biggest boxes of
the day this was gonna be a huge huge
fight the the amount of money they could
win was going to be huge there was so
much gambling on it and everything
then halfway through the fight
fitzsimmons hit sharky a low blow
and according to the associated press it
left sharkey lying on the canvas
unable to move his legs though he
clutched spasmodically at his groin with
his gloved hand
so he's basically can't carry on because
he's been hit below the belt and it was
a really obvious
shot but the referee apparently didn't
see it
because we think william randolph hearst
had bet twenty thousand dollars on
sharky to win
uh and the referee happened to be a
friend of his whose name
was wyatt erp no the famous wyatt
yeah the white earth the white herb
actually worked as a bodyguard for
william randolph hurst
and he was like well we're gonna need
someone to referee this uh match who's
gonna you know
help me to win all my cash with the
betting thing and so he got wired up to
be the referee for the match
i'm really shocked because i thought
whiteout was a good sort of upstanding
lawman i know clearly not but wasn't
that a thing
that followed him around more so than
the gun battle at the okay corral
it was it was in his obituary it was
sort of he became a
byword for if you did something dodgy
you were pulling
an earp or something like that yeah it
became like a humongous
car celebra of him being the biggest
cheats of all time and yeah wow
really really it spelled his reputation
as if that could happen
but yeah so funny it used to not be
illegal though to hit someone
or certainly to grab them below the
waist it used to be just you know
that's boxing you could hit people when
they were down that was just not against
the rules
i was really really rough until about
the mid-18th century that's ufc isn't it
i guess
hitting people while they're down it
pretty much is and um
you know gouging and all sorts of
vicious practices were just allowed
until this guy jack broughton came along
and he devised the broughton's rules
some people say it's after he
accidentally killed an opponent in the
ring he said
maybe we should professionalize this and
i think that's when gloves were
introduced
i did read the with broughton who
actually codified the first boxing rules
in 1743
it was actually the case that in most
fights you didn't kick people when they
were down
it all punched them when they were down
or attacked them when they were down
even though it hadn't been codified but
the way that the rules upheld was just
by the masses
and so in reports you'd have instead of
an umpire this massive crowd around them
and i think there was in 1726 someone
recorded for instance the
laws were very strictly observed because
basically if you didn't obey the
unofficial rules then the entire mob of
being people
descended on you and attacked you well
that's a good way of doing it isn't it
it's a good way of referring a match
yeah
um i got something on modern day boxing
yeah definitely throw in
did you know that there is only one
professional
male boxer in iceland oh come on
is that true yeah that's absolutely true
wow
he's undefeated in his home nation isn't
he which is great
yeah so professional boxing got banned
in iceland
something like 64 years ago it's been
banned and so no one has ever done it
professionally but this one guy
called colbin christensen he's the only
person that has taken it on and he goes
internationally
to fight people and he's finding it
really hard because he's got no funding
there's only about four boxing rings
that are in iceland
oh wait wait wait yeah i would look for
foxy rings in iceland
yeah but you've got four times more
boxing rings than you have boxers
you can't find it hard to ring up and
get a booking at any of them
how's your schedule looking but it only
allows
amateur boxing so no one no one's doing
it no one's professional he's he's doing
it professionally he's setting up
matches
overseas he's going to berlin he's got
coaches that he's trying to
get he's having to fund his own matches
which he loses he's not he's not very
good
so he's been losing the matches so he's
broke and
um yeah so he's and he finally was
getting onto a roll because he signed up
with the trainer of tyson fury who's
been looking after him
suddenly getting into it and he's now
gone pro and he's winning all
his matches and then covert hit so he's
had to go back to iceland and just be
the only professional boxer with no one
to punch can i just say
what's the name of this guy colbine
christensen okay i just want to say mr
christensen
if you're listening that dad thinks that
you're but i think
you're probably an extremely talented
boxer who deserves respect
so if you're reading the letters pages
of the icelandic news
you'll see a polite invitation
okay that's it that is all of our facts
thank you so much for listening if you
would like to get in contact with any of
us about the things that we have said
over the course of this podcast we can
be found on our twitter account
i'm on it schreiberland james at james
harkin
andy at andrew hunter m and anna
you can email podcast.qi.com yep or you

no such thing or
our website no such thing as a fish.com
we've got all of our previous episodes
up there there's also
links to bits of merchandise that we've
released over the year like a vinyl why
not check that out
uh anyway we're gonna be back again next
week with another episode we'll see you
then
[Music]
goodbye

[Music]
hello
and welcome to another episode of no
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk my name
is dan schreiber
i am sitting here with anna toshinski
andrew hunter murray
and james harkin and once again we have
gathered round the microphones with our
four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in a particular order
here we go starting with fact number one
that is andy my fact is there is a
scientist at imperial college who's been
studying the same bag of dust for 15
years
are you grassing him up now for being
lazy is that what's happening here
yeah that's right he's clearly taking
his time over it you know i'm not
accusing him of swinging the lead out
right but
then again he is analyzing every single
speck of dust in his bag so i can see
why it's taken time
he's called matthew genge he's a
planetary scientist at imperial college
and he specializes in micro meteorites
which is basically
grains of dust from other worlds and
they they land on earth all the time
he's got a bag which he collected in
antarctica in 2006
it took him five minutes to collect but
that was the easy bit
because then he has to go through it
spec by spec
and just work out which specs are micro
meteorites which the exciting ones and
which ones are just dust
and yeah he's got 3 000
of them so far 3 000 particles he's a
really good guy
out of this bag yeah that's that's not
good going at all yeah wait he's been
doing it for 15 years and he's only
managed to get a 3 000. look he's got
other stuff on i mean he's got he's got
to eat you know he's probably other bits
of work on
i think i could count 3 000 grains of
dust within
a couple of days max wow you're just
saying
absolutely not it's not okay sorry he's
not counting to three thousand
that would assume that every single
grain of dust was a winner he has to go
through everyone and analyze it there's
a lot of regular dust in there as well
so he's separating it it's not as if
it's a big bag of cosmic dust who's
going
he's not the count from sesame street
he's he's analyzing
every single dust particle that comes
out of there
how does he work out the difference
between a meteorite and a non-meteorite
a meteor wrong like we've called them
before
oh yeah glad you asked andy well thanks
dan anna do you want the other day
well i was gonna say you two seem so
sure about how difficult this work is
and yet when i ask you how it's done uh
you need a microscope that's
guaranteed oh you hang it with the naked
eye um i mean you can clearly identify
what they're made of with the
scope and i think that's how he does it
well definitely because it's the way
that they're made isn't it when you get
a micro meteorite it's made in space and
it comes down through
the earth's atmosphere and it gets
really really hot so they tend to be
really really round with like filaments
coming off them
and also they're made of something
slightly different are they because
they've come from space so they tend to
be metallic
um so there's lots of different ways
that you can tell i think so
yeah you can just uh skim a magnet
around a random surface
right that's how anna does it that's how
i spend my weekends
this is actually a tip that i read for
if you want to find your own
and this is from this amazing guy that
i'm sure you all read about this
norwegian jazz musician called john
larson who doubles up as a scientist
and he basically has proven that
ordinary plebs like us
are able to collect our own little bits
of space dust
and yeah he does his with a magnet so he
went all across the roofs of a city
magnetizing bits of space dust up and
studying i love this guy his
band were called hot club de noveg in
fact they're still called that but he's
retired and he was one of the best
known jazz musicians in the whole of
norway and then whenever he was on tour
he would go around looking for micro
meteorites just collecting dust and
looking for them
and then he would keep sending them to
this guy professor genge
say here's another one here's another
one again should just be like oh for
god's sake
mate i don't tell you how to play the
jazz trumpet or whatever why are you
doing this
and eventually he was like okay fine
i'll look at it and he looked at it and
he realized that this guy john larson
was actually doing really good work
and between them they were the first
people to ever
announce that you can find micro
meteorites like anna says just in your
gutter or wherever
well i do know as a lockdown project
matt parker
our buddy whose festival has spoken nerd
he went up into
his roof's guttering and he grabbed a
bunch of stuff and he's been doing this
as well he's been trying to find cosmic
dust
yeah landing in his gutter very
dangerous don't try it at home
really i mean they're very weak gutters
aren't they but the good thing if you
can get up to them is that they have the
newest dust
uh it's the most up-to-date space dust
you'll get because apparently they get
cleaned relatively often compared to
most surfaces you'll bumble into
and so that's dust that has recently
landed and if you want really fresh dust
check the um weather forecast but for
space and find out when the next meteor
shower is
in the space weather forecast press the
red button when the normal weather
forecast is on
it goes it takes to the secret space any
aliens who are watching the bbc
now press the red button and we'll tell
you what the weather's like in your
solar system
anyway look look for a meteor shower on
your alien weather forecast
and then wash your roof because that
will get rid of all the old past it
space dust and then when the meteor
shower comes
then and this is another one of rockstar
john larson's tips he says
then you'll just get the debris from
that exact meteor shower so you'll know
exactly which space does together
yeah that is really cool do you know
that matt genge
might one day find a particle of a
meteorite
also named matt genge oh yeah isn't that
cool how will he know he's
like it's not gonna have his name on it
is it it's not no i guess maybe it just
have the m
if it's so small but you gotta be
careful because eminems have an m on
them as well
you don't want to mix them up imagine
that that'd be a great prank wouldn't it
just
put some eminence in his dust and he's
like oh my god i found one of my meter
right
well he's a big deal in the cosmic dust
world and such a big deal that there is
actually an eight kilometer wide
asteroid
near mars that has been named in his
honor for his contributions to the
science so
one day he could yeah he could pull out
is it the revenge
is it the more famous you are the bigger
the comet that would be named after you
is does it is i don't think so because
then like whatever meteorite's about to
hit the earth is necessarily going to be
named after
either the queen or mick jagger which
doesn't really seem fair does it
it'd be cool if it was a mick jagger i
wouldn't mind us being wiped out by mick
jagger's meteorite
more of a flying stone than a rolling
one nice
um have you heard of penelope
vozniakovic
so she is another space dust expert and
she went to the marshall islands to find
space dust
because every square meter of earth gets
about 10 particles
a year of space dust that's the average
right 10 particles
i don't fancy matt parker's chances of
finding them
you're right it's every once a month a
square meter will get one particle and
it's quite a lot in aggregate it's 30
000 times an aggregate but obviously
that's because the world is quite big
but problem as you guys have all been
saying is that it's really hard to find
among normal dust and there is so much
dust in most places or
sort of random dirt but if you go to
places with zero dust you have a much
better chance and the marshall islands
are a thousand
miles away from the nearest land so
there isn't
you know wind blows less random crud
into the land
and so that is a really good place to
find the dust there's obviously a long
way to go
it's not like your gutter but once you
get there you have better chances
okay and the way you find it is you
get a brush and you have a single hair
on that brush it's like a paintbrush but
with one
hair and some scientists even use a
single eyelash
they just take one of their eyelashes
and they strap it to a brush handle
and they use that to pick up the
micrometeorite and look at it
how do you strap an eyelash onto
anything yeah so do all these
micrometeologists have no eyelashes
that's how you spot a really successful
one yeah um we should say
with um micrometeorites is they're not
the same as a small meteor right
because a micrometeorite is made of
different stuff that meteorites
so meteorites we think come from
asteroid belts
but it looks like micrometeorites
probably come from comets
because they contain little bits of
water which meteorites don't contain
what's interesting about that is there
is a hypothesis that all of the earth's
oceans
came from these tiny tiny tiny
meteorites just millions and millions
and billions and billions of them
landing on earth over years and years
and years and years and years
and eventually tiny bits of water
becoming more water becoming more water
becoming our oceans
that's incredible isn't that cool
incredible yeah
so matt parker's gutter might flood
wow yeah that matter if you're listening
over the next 4.5 billion years that
must be so boring at the early stages
when you're just looking into the beds
of the world's oceans waiting for it to
fill up like you know when you're trying
to fill a paddling pool and it's taking
a really long time
but it's amazing isn't it how much
enters our planet every day in fact
what's
actually peculiar is we're not quite
sure how much it is but it could be up
to 300 tons
a day it could be as little as five as
well as the other calculations so it's
somewhere in between
but it's an extraordinary amount and
it's really important for
our planet particularly our oceans like
not only did it as you say james maybe
seed
the oceans all together but also a lot
of animals a lot of
organisms actually rely on these micro
meteorites because of the
iron and so on in them they sort of feed
them they feed their nature
there is one theory that if there's
anything that lives on mars
which we don't think there is but if
there's anything that lives in the soil
of mars then they probably eat these
meteorites because they contain bits of
like
saying nickel and metals and things like
that it's really wild
um just a thing about dust dust
there is a dust library in ohio state
university
now all libraries are quite dusty aren't
they that's a good point but
those ones have books and this one has
no books it just has the pieces of dust
this is from a new scientist piece in
2011 and they were studying the
different bits of dust because when you
look at them that you know depending on
whether it's a bit of
a thread of cotton or a piece of soot or
carbon or whatever they look really
different under the microscope
anyway it only had 63 particles in 2011
so i don't know if they've got way more
now
well sorry this library has 63 grains of
dust in it
yeah but that is every other library has
way more
i know but i think these are categorized
and then it's not a lending library this
library has the fewest
bits of dust in the whole world of all
the libraries and yet it has the goal to
call itself a dust library
is it being stalked by this henge
character by any chance
one bit of dust a year oh my god um nasa
has a problem
with fake fake space dust
fake space dust is a thing which is
space dust that's
simulated it's actually called simulant
that's made on earth for scientists to
do experiments on so
if you are going to land a rover on mars
or if you're thinking about
you know astronauts going and living on
an asteroid or whatever
then you've got to order in some fake
space dust to see how that would work
with that all around it and so companies
manufacture this
but there's an issue because there's
lots of dodgy space dust
out there so for instance there are
about 30 moon simulants available
but some of them are below par some of
them are based on old models
some of them are specifically for one
thing but won't work for another
and this is a proper issue and nasa's
finally got this company
who mines asteroids to get actual dust
off asteroids bring it back and exactly
are you saying there are 30 companies
that make fake dust
i mean that's just fake moon dust sorry
that is mind-blowing isn't it
did they make money do you think because
i reckon there might be 31 after this
podcast the way
he's looking mundus by the way was a
real worry for nasa when
the apollo 11 astronauts came back
because they weren't sure
if they were bringing back an alien dust
form that was going to you know send a
plague around the planet so
once aldrin and collins and armstrong
got back they were quarantined in a room
but they weren't on their own they were
also quarantined with a bunch of animals
that were in surrounding areas
so they basically they fed lunar dust
that they brought back to german
cockroaches
no to yeah to japanese quail brown
shrimps
oysters shellfish horseflies and they
were injecting it into mice and they had
to watch how they reacted
to the lunar dust to see if there was
anything that went wrong
because if anything went wrong yeah how
close were the quail and the shrimp
to the guys were they in the same
trailer because they were yeah i
quarantined i assume
that it must have been in surrounding
areas because i think they quarantined
everything into
one place but everything survived except
for the oysters but they don't think it
was to do with the moon dust
they think it was more to do with the
fact they were being tested during
mating season
and i guess it was stress levels that
got to them and they died
but um yeah they were really worried
about that and they kept doing that
until i think apollo 14 i believe it was
so some space dust in future might be
dead people
and so this is about how we would
dispose of corpses in space if ever we
produced them
and so for instance if you're on the iss
you sometimes have to do drills
as to you know what happens if someone
dies where do you put them
and actually nasa hasn't really worked
out how to deal with
dead bodies at the iss and so they've
come up with a number of ideas and they
commissioned a company to
figure out how best to dispose of them
and the idea the company came up with
was the body bag
that is that you put the body once the
astronaut dies you put a body in an
airtight bag
and you send it out into space but on a
lead from the international space
station so you still got hold of it
so the whole body freezes over the
course of about an hour like putting a
bottle of wine in the freezer or
something
and then you you reel it back in and
then the bag gets
vigorously vibrated and that makes the
body shutter
into a fine powder and then you store it
in a container
just outside the iss you bring it back
in on re-entry and then you can present
back to the family
there to be fair in powder form but
still body of their deceased loved one
that's what they think they might do i
don't leave it too long like a bottle of
wine if you leave a bottle of wine
overnight in the freezer
that's that body explodes all over the
iss yeah i think but part of the idea is
that they think people would find it
emotionally
taxing to spend you know six months on
the iss with a dead body just there
in body form but just if you're looking
out the window and you're seeing steve
bobbing along on his lead
that's probably also emotionally taxing
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hi everybody just wanted to let you know
we are sponsored this week by
babble yes babel is a language teaching
app that teaches you via real life
conversations you can learn through
interactive dialogue speech recognition
technology it's the most advanced way
that you can learn a language without
talking to another human it's so good
and actually well a lot of the time dan
you are talking to another human because
there are these lovely lessons that you
can eavesdrop in on
so i'm using it to learn german at the
moment and you can listen to hans and
julia
talking about the embarrassing incident
at the chemist or about the great party
that they're intending to plan on friday
night the conversations are
genuinely funny and you sort of anyway i
i feel like i've made friends
um there are 14 languages you can learn
you can learn as well as you know
spanish french italian portuguese you
can learn
turkish if you want you can learn
indonesian you can learn norwegian there
are so many
lovely languages on there and if you're
planning travel
after all this malarkey is over this is
a way of getting
in ahead and feeling like you are
already sunning yourself on the beaches
in portugal or wherever it might be you
are starting to prepare
for your post malarkey trip i'm calling
it malarkey from now on
um it's really fun it's really useful
and you feel like you're learning
very rapidly as in fact you are and you
can now get
six months free if you get a six month
subscription all you have to do is go to
babel
b-a-b-b-e-l dot co dot uk
forward slash play and put in the promo

that's right so go to babel dot co dot
uk forward slash
play use the promo code fish and get six
months subscription
with that promo code okay on with the
show
on with the podcast
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that
is anna my fact this week is that every
year
power line repair workers have to pass a
test where they rescue a 12 stone dummy
from the top of a telegraph pole
wow being a line worker is a lot more
fun than i imagined
turns out so this is people who they're
like outdoor electricians so that the
guys who work
on telegraph lines electricity lines
cables pylons all those things and i was
reading in kent
online an article about rod lurie who's
been
a power line worker for 56 years
and he said yep every year you have to
do the poll rescue test so he's in his
70s now
still does it you climb a 15 meter pole
there's a 12 stone dub he's sitting at
the top
and you have to carry it down and as if
you're up there with your co-worker and
they get an electric shock or they have
a heart attack or they fall asleep and
you have to carry them down so it's to
prepare you for that
yeah makes sense what if they're more
than 12 stone i mean
i don't that much i mean do you have to
strip them
nude to take them down to get them as
light as possible
yes the problem is all those meteorites
landing on them all the time it gets
heavier and heavier doesn't it old matt
guends would be there for 40 years
magnet is a really eminent scientist i
don't like the way he's become a byword
for
hanging around doing things
anna did you read the name of the dummy
i think it's the right dummy that i'm
thinking about because this is a us one
as well which is called rescue randy
yeah that's it that's no way the english
one is called rescue randy
he's a whole barbie he's like a ken doll
there are all these
different versions yeah and accessories
you can get accessories here as well
exciting earrings on him a nice hat
you can buy shredded rubber to stuff
inside him you can buy special overalls
and he's got this whole family so
there's rescue jennifer
there's rugged randy and there's trauma
randy rocket randy it's not like the
particularly attractive co-worker you
have in case
you have to carry a double you have to
hide your enormous erection as you're
doing so because he's so fit
but which pole do i climb
[Laughter]
anna did you read about drama randy
though no what does tom randy do trauma
randy is what i call you
randy andy for me
trauma randy comes with four bleeding
wounds
wow i know but i think the top of the
range is casualty care rescue randy
who costs 19 grand which is a lot
he holds four liters of blood and you
can do actual surgery on him and he has
a i'm quoting here a manual foot
operated pumping system which allows
three wounds to bleed simultaneously
these guys they must be used for other
things they can't be a company that just
sells these dolls just to go up
telephone it is james there are 30
companies which make fake dust we don't
know the world anymore
um telegraph poles yeah there's loads of
them in america isn't there which is why
i kind of think that i can accept that
this company is selling all of these
things because
in america like obviously all the places
are quite spread out compared to britain
for instance there's a lot more of them
but they weren't even supposed to be
there the first ones because um samuel
moss who invented the telegraph
he wanted to show that he could get a
message from washington dc to baltimore
which is about 40 miles or something
like that but he wanted to go under the
ground with his telegraph wires
he did that but it didn't work and they
had to kind of really quickly
think oh [ __ ] what were we going to do
and they erected all these poles to put
their
telegraphs across and then when he did
his famous like what have god
wrought telegraph message that he did
that was going through the air
that was going through the air yeah i
guess it's not obvious yeah under the
ground is a much better place for them
well that's what some people think for
sure they couldn't sell them in france
you know
the telegraph system that moss invented
because they already had an
optical telegraph which is like where
you go on top of the hill and you have a
big sort of stick which does a semaphore
and someone's on another hill who can
see it and they pass that message on to
someone else on someone else onto
someone else
and that was really massive in france at
the time it was invented by a french
chap
called claude chap it was french
[Laughter]
in the um until the 1850s it was the
main way of sending messages in france
and it was so
good and so useful that you couldn't
sell anything better to them you could
but they decided that they wouldn't
accept it so right we've already brought
the technology to its absolute peak
you haven't guys you're waving flags
from mountaintop
[Laughter]
bt open reach they have a telegraph pole
training academy which is so cool
it's just a big field in peterborough
which is full of dozens of nine meter
poles
yeah and that's the sort of dojo
where their engineers train they seem um
like a vaguely fun company actually open
reach this is based on some of their pr
materials
so they uh released an article where
they said that their
500 strong team of engineers in 2020
climbed more than 11.5 million meters
close to a round trip from london to the
north pole
no anna hang on it doesn't they're
comparing apples and oranges there
because
walking to the north pole is obviously
very hard but it's not as hard as
climbing 10 million meters up into the
air which would be
really hard so i read that article and i
thought let's compare apples with apples
and so i reckon that the open reach
engineers
every two weeks do the equivalent of
climbing to the iss
that's really good yeah wow pretty cool
but that's
that's between them right so there's
only one person who gets there there's
one poor person on the very bottom
hold their weight um you know we were
saying about um whether
sometimes you want to transmit the
signals above ground and sometimes
underground and obviously today it's
preferable to do it
underground and in fact it always has
been but it's just that it's really much
more expensive to install wires
underground
than in poles but if you go to new york
well if you're in manhattan at least
you don't see a single electricity pole
or a single radio transmission pole
and that is because in the 1880s when
edison was working on electric
transmission and new york was kind of
his test case
new york became this huge mass of wires
and it looks
insane you can't see the sky it's just
you know
thousands of wires above your head and
there was a blizzard in 1888 this great
blizzard of new york
and the whole city went into blackout
because it brought down the wires
and the mayor in 1889 who came in after
that who was mayor hugh grant uh
in his
in a charmingly stammering speech
i really think shouldn't we be getting
rid of
these that's what he did
and he taught them into it and they
brought them all down
and so now it doesn't happen they're all
underground thanks to hugh grant
nice in bits of africa and south africa
there is a height restriction on how low
you can have
your electricity poles do you know why
that is well
do you mean like they have to be a
certain height so that you don't yeah
so that people well actually i've just
heard anna say giraffes and that sounds
good
that is correct oh miss oh this is my
answer
i was going to look at my paper a bit of
whimsy there but never mind
sorry wow so for giraffes yeah they've
got to make sure that they don't get
tangled up because that did happen a few
times in a few of the countries so
a restriction of height was put into it
so yeah the lines will always be taller
than the tallest giraffe
the lions will be taller the lines the
power lines oh lines sorry
that's a frightening dystopia the
world's exactly the same except
all the lions are bigger i suppose in
africa you have linesmen but also lions
men
and you don't want to get that because
not these in the old days you could
calculate how fast your train was going
between birmingham and derby
because the telegraph poles were exactly
the same distance apart
so i just imagine if we sat next to you
on a train now andy
jesus christ they were 352 feet apart
each exactly and you can count how many
you passed in a minute and that would
help you calculate the speed of the
train
i all we've proved for this conversation
is how unpleasant it would have been to
sit with you on a train
period was when was it any time
anytime in history we've all been there
and it's not nice
look andy i think i know somewhere that
you'll fit in and
that is the telegraph poll appreciation
society
oh and i've bought your membership it's
free it was
it was founded in 1997. i spent a long
time on their website their motto
is very catchy if it's tall wooden
sticky uppy and got wires coming out of
the top then we appreciate it
did you see the pole of the month
section i had a little looking for the
month yeah did you appreciate it
i loved it november's poll of the month
was particularly beautiful and they
really like to give a good description
of the poll of the month so
it was november 2020 uh this sumptuous
right angled double stack of three
cross-armed pole i would hazard a guess
is on the road between bidford and
elmscott
it's uh and then they have beautiful
photos and they have people who send in
all their polls um yeah you know there's
a pylon appreciation society as well
yeah you didn't find it anna you should
check it out it's run by a lady called
flash bristow she lives in east london
and she's one of the pylon spotters of
the uk
and she's got 530 photos 36 different
countries
absolutely obsessed with it and there is
the famous
pink pylon which uh has actually its own
appreciation website pinkpylon.com
don't go on that website if you're
listening to this yeah rugged randy's
pink pylon i think i've read that book
actually
we're so appreciative in the uk this is
what i've learned in this podcast
pilots onto the real meat
pylons oh my goodness well
don't call them pylons don't call them
pylons don't call them pylons
because they're not called pylons i read
this on the science museum website it
was a guy who works in the industry who
says
major faux pas so pylon in engineering
is a structure
that holds something that's suspended
from another structure to it
so the pylons on a pylon are actually
the bits of metal that hold the wires up
a pylon itself is actually called a
steel lattice tower
so if you really want to impress your
friends and you see one say
that's nice steel that is tower isn't it
because the name actually comes
from ancient egypt doesn't it pylon so
when they first started going up they
were just called whatever
lattice structure you called the banner
but
they just found tutankhamun and a few
other mummies quite recently and
egyptology was really really fashionable
and so they were looking for a name and
they just thought oh um
if you go to a pyramid they have these
obelisk
shaped towers on either side of the
doors and they thought well
you know what a great thing to name it
after they're called pylons let's call
them pylons
but i really like the egyptology
connection because i think in ancient
egypt they were
a gateway to the sun well that's maybe
what the word means and that's kind of
what an electrical pylon is you know
you're harnessing
power and it's kind of like a gateway to
the sun you get light
and you know okay everyone's going with
that cool
it's such an absurd statement i think we
just chose something
i've been picking on you a little bit
too much in this section and i feel like
i can give you a few passes now
thank you and i outright just believe
that so
yeah so um just have a few things on
electricity polls right
they can be used and this is a tip for
anyone who gets stuck
out in the wild and they're thinking i
have no way of sending an sos to anyone
they can be used for you to be tracked
down so there was a guy in saskatchewan
who was rescued after having disappeared
for a few days
by noticing that there were power poles
around him so he had an
axe on him because he got lost in his
boat and he chopped four of them down
by chopping pour them down
there's just a slight break in logic he
had an accident because he was lost in
his boat
no he had an r on him or he had a sail
on him or a life jacket
he was out in the wild he was obviously
doing some chopping at certain points he
was in his boat
and he got lost he got lost in a storm
so he has no idea where he was
and he found these four poles so he
chopped them down
and then the local power source people
would alert it to these poles oh
because it took out an entire town and
the surrounding communities were all
their electricity was knocked down so
[Laughter]
yeah i dan i thought you were going to
say because he had his axe on him he
chopped down the poles and he arranged
them in the ground into the shape of the
word help
he only chopped down four though so he's
got h and the first part of an e
it just looks like he's saying hi
then the helicopter comes down it just
goes high and it flies up again
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
james okay my fact this week is that the
most expensive cow in the uk
is called posh spice rude
it's just the name of the cow no
aspersions on anyone else who has that
name
really hard to google because you [ __ ]
you keep finding stories about victoria
beckham saying i'm not a moody cow
[Laughter]
well this is an organism who's proud to
be a cow
i don't know what that her mood is like
um but she was sold very recently
for 250 000 guineas
uh which is 265 000 pounds but they
still insist
these farmers on saying that everything
was sold in guineas i don't know why
they do that that really confused me are
they accepting pounds or is
guinea the currency that they get paid
in it's in pounds
a guinea is a pound and a shilling so
it's just like
it's another way of saying 265 000
pounds
it's really weird it's i think you read
this and you think
am i in the 18th century again why does
this news come through a time tunnel
it's so bizarre
yeah but what's interesting about this
cow is that actually
in the past and still at the moment but
it's usually the bulls as in the male
cows that get sold for the most amount
of money but recently due to
breakthroughs in
ivf methods a lot of cows are starting
to get sold for a lot more because
due to ivf they can have lots more
children whereas normally you would just
get your bull and
it would be able to have as many
youngsters as you like but now that's
also true
to a slightly lesser extent but still
true of the female cows
and so yeah they've sold it for just
over 200 grand
and the reason that you buy it is
because it's such a
good cow for breeding that even the
embryos of posh spice will be able to
solder several
thousands of pounds if you if you're
just
tuning in at this point then go back
maybe a couple of minutes to know what
i'm talking about when i say that
she's not fashion line
and the reason uh this cow is called
posh spice is because her mother was
called ginger spice
and they never acknowledged that in the
band did they they never looked after
they were
mother and daughter i think we should
not
keep making hilarious mistakes and
getting this cow and this singer mixed
up
but she's a limousine heifer and i
didn't know that limousine is where you
get the best cows in france it's a place
it's in the foothills of the massif son
trail
and that's where the living zone come
from yeah and that's where limousines
come from i think they were named after
a carriage weren't they
and the carriage was named after maybe a
monk because it had a hood over the top
these monks would have huds
i think and they lived in lima i think
that that's very cool that's a cool
thing
remember that so i think that this might
currently be the most expensive cow in
the whole world
but certainly historically it isn't
because there have been cows in the past
uh that have been sold for over a
million dollars in the us
in fact in the 1980s there was kind of a
fashion for buying
cows for more than a million sorry
what's that dollars
guineas
[Laughter]
these new fangled americans honestly
there was
a tax loophole that came in in the 80s
that meant
if you bought some really expensive cows
you wouldn't have to pay as much tax and
so you had hollywood
stars and wall street bankers just
buying these cows
they wouldn't keep them in their like
hollywood homes they would own a part of
them and they would live in the farm if
you know what i mean
it's like an investment yeah they
weren't like on the red carpet for all
the premiers or anything
brad pitts showed up with his latest
account
david beckham's brought the wrong posh
spice
he always confuses them and then there
was one called
missy who was a bit after that maybe in
the late 80s early 90s i can't remember
exactly when it was but she sold for
well over a million dollars
but the people who bought her they'd
already had 3.23 million dollars
worth of pre-signed contracts for the
embryos of this cow
so you bought it knowing that assuming
it you know nothing goes wrong
um you'll be able to definitely recoup
two three four times that amount of
money that you paid for it wow
i read about missy there was a kind of
it's a slightly weird press release
about what a great cow missy was it said
she's extremely tall long and stylish
she walks on great feet and legs and has
a great mammary system
it does sound like it's been copy pasted
from page three doesn't it
and um poshvice of course they did
describe her as well
she has a larger loin depth reduced fat
cover
and a greater meat tenderness and again
if you're just tuning in at this point
please do go to the start of this fact
james who are these people do you
imagine you were just tuning in
it's not a radio show
classic listener let's start 20 minutes
into the show
i love their third and fourth facts but
i've always hated the first two
um i was looking into cows that were
sold for lots of money
so i found a really odd one that i just
want to quickly mention and
this was a cow that wasn't actually
particularly special it was a cow that
was
designated to be slaughtered there was a
cow called minimu
and minimum was a cow that had a very
odd pattern on the side that looked
exactly
like minnie mouse's head so the little
three the two ears and the
and the head so the niece of the owners
of this cow
wrote to disney and said this cow is due
for slaughter but we think you might
like it and they saw and went yes so
they bought it for an undisclosed amount
we don't actually know and
minnie was taken over to the magic
kingdom where she was in the petting
farm she was later moved
to another petting zoo that disney owns
and she was really big and she kind of
for disney sparked off a really
big moment where people started sending
in pictures of their pigs and dogs
that had little patterns on them some
people had potatoes
that had a little bitty bounce or mickey
mouse look at things
yeah so they were inundated i must have
really turned around the fortune don't
sound like a big moment
you can just imagine minnie as she was
being driven away
turning around and giving her two middle
fingers up at the cow she was leaving
behind can't you
because she did live then until 2001. um
she was with right by 15 years yeah um
the most expensive pig ever sold
was a yorkshire bar which went for 270
000
in 2014 and it was raised
by the western illinois university
school of agriculture professor
mark hoagy and his family and the name
hoagie comes from an old anglo-saxon
word
meaning someone who keeps pigs oh
that's so good is that that's what we
get hulk presumably yeah exactly and
heard as well
hogs and herds all come from that old
word
chickens can be very expensive another
expensive farm animal are we gonna guess
oh no i don't actually have a specific
price so you could i would be able to
tell you
okay i was going to talk about the
chicken bubble of the 1840s
do you guys know about this no this is
when chicken suddenly became incredibly
sought after it's when i think
in the west we suddenly discovered loads
of asian breeds of chicken and
imported them queen victoria got
obsessed with chickens she built an
aviary
she used to spend hours sitting in there
with her chickens
talking to them she used to send
individual eggs to her royal relatives
all over europe
and so this got really fashionable to
collect chickens and their price went
through the roof
it's so weird isn't it all these things
that go in bubbles and just become
really expensive for no reason like
tulips
and chickens and yeah like yeah it's
almost worth just having one of every
random thing in your house just in case
massively
one cosmic dust particle you never know
one bitcoin and that would have worked
that wouldn't work
so did she probably start the poultry
craze then anna was it you started the
poultry craze yeah or very much
fired it people used to hire bodyguards
to protect their chicken coops
but then suddenly bubble burst as these
bubbles do
and the good thing about that is that
there was this enormous number of very
exotic
weirdo chickens which now no one could
sell for anything and so darwin brought
them all up
and this is 1855 and he bought them and
he interbred and interbred and interbred
them
and this was how he developed loads of
his theories about interbreeding and
this is how he showed that actually they
still had a shared answer
wow and they weren't it's not handy
that's really good
so you sew these bubbles you know it's
worth it um
i looked up the term because i was
thinking cows are now turning into cash
cows
like with this new ivf program that you
were mentioning yeah so i just thought
cash cow where does that come from do we
know who
came up with that and turns out we do
there's a guy called peter f
drucker and peter of trucker was sort of
the father of management thinking he
wrote lots of books where he talked
about how to run companies and how to do
management and so on
and one of his words which he came up
with in the 1960s
was cash cow and he's a guy who sort of
he wrote so many books and he wrote a
couple of novels
but i guess to the public he's kind of
dropped out of
he was he was a big name back in the day
we don't really know him now
except for in japan where he is
quite a big name because in 2009 a novel
was written which was called
what if the female manager of a high
school baseball team read drucker's
management
and it was massive it sold 1.8 million
copies in its first year it was the
year's best-selling novel in japan
and it has since been turned into a
live-action film
it's been turned into an anime he's sort
of a household name there
in japan at the moment and yeah that's
the guy who came up with the term cash
cow
there's another famous cow or bull
rather it happened
in february this year a texan beef
company
started giving out free semen from one
of their cows
because and james would know about this
and this year the tampa bay buccaneers
yeah did they won the super bowl they
did
it's time tom brady plays for them and
this texan beef company
owns a bull named tom brady and
to celebrate the win of the team which
contained the player after whom their
cow
is named or bull rather they gave out
three orders of semen to anyone
who had requested it okay
wow yeah yeah wow who was it to anyone
could i call up and said like some semen
i don't think it could have been to
anyone i think you must have to say
it's going to a good cow i don't think
they just send you some bulls even in
the post
well you could say it's going to a good
cow and how are they going to check
very good point just send a photo of a
random cow
tom brady
[Laughter]
can i just say for anyone who's just
tuned in
andy says tom brady seaman go to the
start of the fact
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the focus

okay on with the podcast on with the
show
[Music]
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show and that is my fact
my fact this week is that the person who
has acted in more batman movie reboots
than anyone else
is also the third in line to be
president of the united
the person states acted in more batman
movie reboots gets to be the third in
line
we know so it goes the succession of
line into the presidency
is kamala harris nancy pelosi and then
batman uber fan patrick leahy he has
other titles doesn't he he's not just
he does have other titles yeah yeah he's
an amazing senator
he is a massive batman fan and he has
appeared in
five different batman movies but he's
appeared
in batman movies that have stretched
across the whole modern
cinematic history of batman so his first
cameo was in batman forever
which was the movie that starred val
kilmer and then he was in batman and
robin when
it was george clooney and then he went
into the christopher nolan series where
he starred in two of the movies the dark
knight in the dark
sorry you've got to stop saying stardom
i haven't seen any of these movies so
maybe he does
he gets menaced by the joker the heath
ledger joker i mean it's pretty
that's high values green time it's not
just he's a guy in the background or
anything
so he has lines does he have black he
does he has a line he says to heath
ledger's joker we're not intimidated by
thugs
and then he replies you know you remind
me of my father
and he said it was really scary because
i don't if you remember but heath ledger
really went method on the acting of the
movie there
and he had a knife in his hand and it
was pressed up against the senator's
face and he thought this guy's pretty
unhinged
so he was a bit scared but he loves it
he loves doing it um
this guy leahey patrick leahy he's not
only a batman super fan
but it's incredibly sweet the story
because he started reading
the batman comics when he was a little
boy and he's he's roughly the same age
as batman batman's just about 80 now and
he's a bit younger than that
but all of his fees from the films or as
he calls them his
bat earnings um they go
they go to the library where he first
read the stories when he was a little
boy himself
and he financed the children's wing of
the library okay fine
fine i'll let him off his bat earnings
if he's giving it all to
children's charities he worked with dc
comics
uh because they were making a batman
comic about landmines and that was used
as part of a campaign
uh when there was a bill coming up to
ban landmines and he distributed it
among the
the other senators so he said that
he um he decided not to be in the reboot
which with robert pattinson which i
think is coming out maybe this year
and he explained that the reason is that
he just doesn't have time
with covid and appropriation bills and
the like
although i'm not totally clear that
anyone asked him to be in it there was
never
he was requested well in the last one he
was in
he was blown up it was in batman versus
superman
so it's possible he's not in a new
reboot because
they finally killed off his character
because he does play himself in a couple
of the movies
does he sometimes not play himself yeah
he sometimes plays a different so how do
you explain
in this batman universe that you've got
someone who looks just like a senator
who's in a different movie batman says
he actually has a line at one point he
says oh it's funny you look just like
that other senator i met his classic
lady but you're not here are you he says
no is he i mean he's pretty cool do you
think they might as well bump him up a
couple of
places in the line of succession no you
can't
you can't do that you can't have batman
in charge of the
white house and the reason i say that is
because i was looking into seeing if joe
biden had been
in any movies he hasn't really but what
i did find out which i didn't know and a
lot of people might do is that his
middle name is robinette
isn't that cool robinette joe robinette
yeah joe robinette's biden so it's a
robin as in the
sidekick of batman with e-wte at the end
and apparently um the robinettes came
over to america with lafayette
um you know during the late 18th century
and they never went home and so he has
descended from
there and it was his mother's maiden
name and he took it as a middle name
wow do you know the rubber nets they
actually only came over to america
because lafayette said he might need a
rhyme for him
[Laughter]
so batman is apparently the batman that
i like the most is the one that everyone
hates
i learned and i guess it's just the one
that you've seen in your childhood when
you're a kid which i appreciate as a
six-year-old i probably wasn't the best
judge but
do you know it's batman forever and
people blame
it's badness on mcdonald's so apparently
it's all mcdonald's fault that it's not
as good
and this is because so the first two
batmans which were batman and batman
returns were
tim burton making them and they are good
and i have seen them they are excellent
and they are
tuned in next week for another movie
review from alexinski
both good films very dark very violent
and
mcdonald's uh decided to promote them in
their happy meals
because they were like batman's this
long-running tv series very happy clappy
and fun
and so they signed this big old contract
saying we'll put all these characters in
our happy meals
the films came out and the films were
going to be like 18 adult rated they had
to really fight and cut loads of scenes
to get them down to pg-13
now mcdonald's happy meals are targeting
exclusively the one to ten age range
so they were promoting a film that they
were all too young to see
and basically they were pulled the films
came out and mcdonald's went to burton
and the filmmakers and said look like
the penguin what's this gross black
stuff coming out of his mouth we can't
promote any of this
and after that there was this
controversy about how they were too dark
and too depressing
and burton was given the boot and then
who was brought in to direct i think it
was joel schumacher
joel schumacher who got a lot of stick
but basically he had to make them more
child-friendly
not too friendly to include nipples that
was the main talking point of the film
with george clooney is that there are
bad nipples on the front of his back
costume
yes but the reason for that is that
i read about this because i haven't
watched any of these movies uh despite
them all being
good now i know they're good i might
watch them
but in the original batman's the suits
were made by a guy called
bob ringwood but when they made the new
suits the
uh techniques of being able to mold
rubber were way way more advanced
and so they wanted to show off how
advanced they were
so they decided the way they were going
to do that was to make them more
anatomical
and so how do you make a chest more
anatomical
apart from putting nipples on it on the
nibs and that was they were made by um
jose fernandez or jose fernandez i can't
remember how to say his first name but
um he is the guy also who did the
helmets
for that punk yeah he does those helmets
he's done loads of like stuff for
hollywood over the years and he also
designed
these spacesuits for spacex
yeah do you remember elon musk wanted
some sexy spacesuits
and they were invented by jose fernandez
i'm not sure if they have nipples on
them or not because i haven't seen them
but
i think it's really unfair to slam the
bat nipples
because bats are mammals yeah the point
is that they have nipples
and so batman accurately he'd have loads
of nipples yes
are they angry there's not enough
nipples you should have them in his
crotch like where don't bats have them
in their their armpits
yeah crotches and armpits are two very
different things though andy i don't
know which one
i must see my tailor i always wondered
why you wore your trousers like that
so batman first appeared in 1939
march 30th and as you were saying andy
very close to the birth of patrick leahy
who was born
a year and a day later and it was
created by
bob kane and bill finger um bob kane
being the person who's taken all the
credit for it bill finger sort of
in the background no one really knows
much about him but he lost all the
credit
but they um they both went to the same
high school in the bronx in new york
which was called dewitt clinton high
school
and another student who went to that
school was stan lee
creator of spider-man and so on around
the same time was that oh it's about a
six year difference
so they might have been there at the
same time yeah it's quite possible
wow that's amazing bill finger great
batman as you say and he was completely
uncredited until after he died
when uh he was almost reluctantly put in
some of the memoirs
but he came up with the name bruce wayne
i think apparently it was him who
decided to do that and bruce based on
robert bruce
robert the bruce as you may incorrectly
know him as in
scottish patriot king warrior and that
was because they thought he should have
noble blood
and he his ashes were scattered in the
shape of a bat
wow they could have done it in the shape
of a finger as well couldn't they if
they wanted
much easier yeah
um but yeah no one knew when he was
alive so that was kind of his secret
identity you could say
hmm i would say the real batman
um guys do you know how many batman's
batman weighs uh one
uh i'd say one yeah i don't understand
the question
i i i do i'm trying to work it out um
i'm gonna say 16. yeah it's
29. anna what are you talking about
sorry so
batman is a unit of measurement and it's
an old
ottoman unit of weight in ottoman and
kind of the steps
area you still get the batman region in
turkey as the batman river
and yeah it's actually been in fact dan
might have been working it out based on
one of the different
weights it had because throughout time
it's been cited as being
you know various different weights but
in 1599 in english it was seven pounds
and five ounces
and the comic books say that batman
weighs 210 pounds
so i believe he weighs approx 29
batman's
in case you're wondering okay in batman
weight terms would you be able to rescue
him
from the top of a telegraph pole if you
were a trained open reach engineer
i guess heavier than 12 stone is what
anna was saying yeah
you definitely have to get him naked
i mean if batman can't get down from a
telegraph pole something's gone really
wrong
oh just speaking of other uses of what
batman could mean so in the batman
movies and
in the whole series generally batman
obviously has his trusty butler alfred
with him who's a
key part of every single movie and comic
and so on
but interestingly during wars like world
war one for example
you used to have a batman by your side
who was your butler
the batman in war was the alfred of the
lieutenants
of war and the idea was yeah you would
be assigned a batman
who would go and they would make sure
that you had your personal equipment
they worked as a valet if you had to go
into combat they acted as a bodyguard so
i think they would sort of
stand in front oh come on no way
that is a waste of manpower if every
soldier has to have a bodyguard
well what it said is acting as the
officer's bodyguard in combat so i
assume that's what it is that you sort
of
yeah they would dick they would dig the
officers foxholes and
sometimes and this was particularly for
the british once the war was over if you
had a batman during war
they would continue on as your butler in
real life they would
they would be hired by you and go on
that is so insane i tried to find some
notable batmans um peter yustenov was a
batman
um the famous actor peter yusenov and he
was a batman
to david niven during the war so the
word bats means it's like a bag that a
horse carries
uh that's why your batman would be the
person who put all the stuff
like kept all your stuff together and so
you would have a batman
and he would also have a bat horse and
the bat horse would be the thing that
carried the
bags on it and the bat horse might carry
the guy's bat money
which is what you would pay a batman so
in
war you might have a batman with a bat
horse containing his bat money
that's it that's so cool
um there was bat woman of course now
there is batwoman uh that woman first
appeared in the dc comics as a love
interest for batman to dispel
suggestions that he was homosexual um
because he kept
kind of i think this is a meme in batman
that he keeps almost getting married and
then never quite gets married
and anyway there was a lot of um kind of
suggestions that he was homosexual
and in the senate at the time this was
in the 50s there was lots of worries
that comic books were causing
problems with children causing juvenile
delinquency of various things like that
and so they brought that woman in as
kind of a way to
show that batman was not gay but then
batwoman has since
openly come out she is now gay since
2006
she was introduced as a lesbian of
jewish descent
uh who found love interest in former
gotham police detective
renee montoya in your face the 1950s
yes it's quite funny saying well oh
we're terribly worried batman might be
gay so let's give him a normal
relationship with a woman who is also
obsessed with dressing up as a bat
that's is that family values
uh just quickly i was watching a youtube
clip of
from a dc official site and on it they
say this thing which i find hilarious
because they haven't
put this in the movies but batman is
always signaled to
by commissioner gordon by the bat signal
the famous bat signal goes into the sky
now apparently according to dc the
reality behind it is is that
commissioner gordon
or any police officer is not allowed to
turn that on because by doing that that
would be qualifying an official
endorsement
of the city's government for this
vigilante that was going around he's not
allowed to do it
so apparently the police office has a
civilian
on site at all times so that as soon as
gordon needs to switch it on he goes you
get up here
and they have to go up and switch it on
on his behalf so that he's had no hand
he's still giving an instruction yeah
exactly that is not even a loophole
yeah what you need is someone to to be
in the office and you say gosh i wish
someone would call batman like really
subtle so it's deniable
yeah yeah and then you go out for see
like i'm going out for
lunch yeah you're back in like minutes
have my lunch on the roof
[Laughter]
just one more thing that was sent into
the podcast email actually
about a year ago a couple of years ago a
fan called daniel braga
who i believe is brazilian and he
informed me that in 2019
police arrested in one go batman
spider-man
and green lantern um so was it like
people on a stag do who were all dressed
like this
or was it that's good i don't know it
actually wasn't it's this really
interesting thing i didn't know they had
which is in brazilian towns they have
fun trains
which is people are paid to dress up on
these fun trains that's any train when
you're sat next to andy
absolutely as long as there's a
telegraph pole within 352 feet
and we're between birmingham and derby
they were arrested for assault but they
were led off because they were
assaulting a man who kept banging on
about telegraphic
no they were so there are these people
who have paid to dress up as superheroes
and like knock off
uh some cheap versions of famous kids
characters to entertain children
and a police officer ended up arresting
three of them who dressed up as
spider-man
green lantern and batman and they were
put in prison for
vandalism and possession of loads of
firearms and stuff like that
but the person who arrested them was a
female police officer
called thanos no way
[Laughter]

[Music]
hi everybody just wanted to let you know
before we start this week's podcast we
have
such an exciting announcement to make
this is the biggest thing we've ever
done
are the most terrifying it's going to be
awful for us but amazing hopefully
that's right you know that every week we

once we've started doing 20 hours we

okay on with the show
hello and welcome to another episode of
no such thing as a fish
a weekly podcast coming to you from four
undisclosed locations in the uk
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
here with anna toshinski
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
and once again we have gathered round
our microphones with our four
favorite facts from the last seven days
and in a particular order
here we go starting with fact number one
and that is anna my fact this week
is that 19 states in the usa have banned
the banning
of clotheslines
it's a double band does that mean close
lines as in things you put clothes on
or is this like a wrestling term where
you kind of
almost decapitate someone surely the
wrestling movie is covered by other
legislation
in wrestling are you allowed to strangle
people with a clothesline
no well yeah you are you are i mean you
know it's modern wrestling it's a
metaphorical clothesline
that i'm talking about forearm yeah you
open up your arm
you run towards them and you hit them
across the neck with your arm
and that's the clothesline it's like
it's a type of tackle in american
football i think and then they turned it
into a wrestling movie
interesting see i knew about the you
know sometimes someone will turn up with
a steel chair or hit someone else at the
table but i didn't know there was a
laundry
rack or a laundry line that could also
be drafted into service and wrestling
matches this makes more sense
me neither all my research on
clotheslines did not come across the
wrestling move uh
stuck to clotheslines themselves and
they're quite controversial
turns out so a lot of rental
associations housing associations
banned them because they're sort of
unsightly they've got a bad
image they were historically associated
with poverty in the 50s when
people were getting electronic washing
machines and dryers so it was like if
you hung your clothes out
it showed you're not in a posh
neighborhood and so
housing associations say don't do it but
of course with the environmental
movement everyone's gone what are you
talking about it's much better to hang
your clothes out on a clothesline and so
in about 2012 there was this big
movement and a bunch of states arizona
maryland
massachusetts wisconsin etc said you're
not allowed to ban them anymore
it is weird when you think about it
though it's the only thing that's really
intimate to us
that we just take out of the house to
show everyone you know we're not showing
it to them on purpose but
i don't hang my books outside or the
contents of my fridge for people to see
what my diet's like yeah but you've got
to stop washing your books
that's just odd you know we hang
underwear outside i get it i get the uh
banning of it
yeah but then after second world war
when they were trying to get more women
in the workplace
it was kind of a new form of modern
living
where you know everything was done by
machines and stuff like this especially
in america and so
um and also they wanted to sell
electricity so they kind of thought that
really
it's almost a patriotic duty to have a
machine doing all your washing
rather than your wife doing all your
washing uh in america and if you had it
hanging outside it was like a symbol
that you were part of the old times when
people used to do that you weren't part
of the new times
they're slightly different in the uk
because uh less than half of people in
the uk have a tumble dryer whereas in
america it's like
i don't know like 80 or something like
that yeah it's
huge i was on money saving expert
in the uk and maybe this was you dan
there was someone who said i've just
moved to a new place and i'm the only
person who hangs my laundry on the
balcony
is it okay and the first response was
not acceptable at all who wants to see
your shabby clothes hanging out on the
balcony do you think the architect
envisions that
balconies are the same as broken cars in
front gardens have some pride in where
you live
i really like that uh so this gets
called the right to dry
which is a catchy phrase um but and like
anna says most
lots of states nearly half of them have
banned it but utah hasn't
utah has passed laws which allow
local authorities to forbid people from
banning clotheslines but they have not
passed a law
themselves so they have legalized
the banning of the ban but they have not
just banned banning
directly so confused sorry
they've legalized the banning of the ban
they've said it's okay to blow people
from banning them they've legalized
they've passed laws saying local
authorities in utah can ban
bans but they haven't stepped in
themselves and banned bans directly
it feels like you can remove at least
two of the bands from that sentence
i'm not sure i've tried it doesn't work
it's really exactly as i said
oh yeah wow i know the most powerful
uh room in america is a laundry room the
white house is like yeah
yeah well it used to be it used to be a
laundry room so
franklin roosevelt actually moved the
oval office from where it used to be it
was used to it used to be located in the
center of the white house
and then you prefer to have it put more
by windows and there was an obvious room
for it to go to
and that's the room where they used to
hang all of the laundry in and dry it up
there
they had that removed and then the oval
office was placed there
and it doesn't smell nearly as nice now
presumably that would have been what
attracted him to the room
very disappointing when they took the
clean laundry out when you see that
center shot of a president behind the
desk they have to crop it because just
next to him there's a closed horse
it's just packed with everyone's washing
clothes house do you guys call it a
clothes horse
that kind of thing what do you call it
andy i was just like a laundry rack
laundry rack i don't know what do you
call them a clothes ass
okay mine's a bit smaller than your
average one so
because i call them uh clothes maiden
right
yeah and i was googling this because i
wanted to know where the word came from
and then
it from my google it seemed to imply
that this is not what anyone else calls
it
i've never heard it it's really
definitely the sexiest version
well it's so strange it's like you know
when you have these words that you think
are so common and everyone uses them
and then you say them and then
everyone's like what on earth are you
talking about
well this is it but maiden is like uh
what people in lancashire would call
i think what dan called a close horse
and then he called a clothes rack
and we'll gloss over what anna called it
and i think i couldn't find out why
they're called maidens but i reckon
it's because in a spinning machine you
would have
two bits of wood that held the kind of
spool
and they were called a maiden or they
were called maidens and they would stick
upwards and then they would have a bar
coming across them and then you would
hang things on there
and i reckon that that's why they call
it because obviously lancashire was like
a spinning area
yeah that's right it wasn't the case
that historically unmarried women used
to stand with their arms outstretched
for hours on end with
clothes draped over them it was a
simpler time and a happier time
[Laughter]
um do you know why laundry smells nice
it's specifically air-dried because you
put soap in your clothes
the soap helps definitely but um
that's specifically i think the
difference between air-dried
you know line-dried towels supposedly
smell nicer than them
than machine dried towels or whatever
and scientists
last year published a paper examining at
the molecular level why these
smells so damn good and um they got a
load of samples and they used ultra
purified water and then they hung the
things out to dry
and then they sealed them in a bag for
15 hours once they were dry
and then sampled the air that was being
given off by these things
and compared the chemical profiles and
la la la and um
after things have been out in the sun
they emit specific
organic molecules and one of them is
called octanel
uh and one of them is called i think
it's pronounced non-anal
non-anal but it's not non-anal yeah
and non-anal smells of roses apparently
and it's possible that exposure to ozone
outdoors
transforms these chemicals and makes
them smell lovely
roses do you think um if it was cold
anything other than
non-anal it would still smell as sweet
[Laughter]
i understand that reference thank you
very good yep
it's from annika reddit um
it's the final line
you know you were saying james that it
was the electricity
movement this push for electricity that
meant people weren't supposed to hang
their clothes out anymore do you know
who the face of electricity was in the
1950s
um not edison he was dead longer 50s
yeah
yeah his face looked awful by that point
is it like a john wayne is it like a
famous
person yes actually you're really close
with john wayne think of the budget
version of john wayne
oh um i know reagan it was really good
yeah was it very strong oh how sad that
i said budget version of john wayne and
you did get reagan from that
point so he must have loved the oval
office he would have felt right at home
in there yeah with all the laundry
yeah maybe that's why he went for
president um although actually no he
wouldn't have liked it because he was
all about anti-clotheslines so he was
the face of the live better electrically
campaign
and there are great adverts you can
watch online which show him
with his wife and his child uh sitting
around a table
and his wife just talking about how
great it is that she doesn't have to
slave over various
things anymore because she now has an
electric souffle maker
an electric coffee percolator an
electric combined toaster and grill
a lot of stuff that we do not have
anymore as standard in our homes
that's so cool you know what i would
have done if i was the advertising
executive for that
uh i would have had him with a weapon
which fired bolts of electricity that
turned things
electric so they'd be like an old kettle
and he'd get his weapon and fire some
electricity at it and it would turn into
an electric kettle
and he would be called ronald reagan
that is good that is wow yeah there's a
career in marketing
and advertising opening out before us
and i like to see it
it's hard to see you go but you're going
on
i can imagine you guys sending me off a
one-way ticket to sachin
sachi and then be arriving at the front
door of them go sir
sorry we don't know what you're on about
we've just given you a big piece of
slate with ronald reagan written on the
front of it
speaking of electric and uh laundry you
can now get a smart clothespeg
which is pretty exciting oh that's
exciting yeah what's it do
it detects uv light and humidity and
temperature and then it tells you when
it's going to rain
um and also is it just one
or do you need to put it on each of your
imagine that you'd need to buy
a hundred people yelling at you
i don't think yeah text you when the
clothes are dry so if you've got 150 of
these i think you've got 150 texts
saying it close the dry so
yeah because if one of your clothes is
dry there's a decent chance the rest of
them are at least nearly dry
exactly unless your garden is so big or
your laundry is so
extensive that's really cool do you well
i wonder if um
hackers could get into those smart
because usually when you have a smart
thing the hackers yeah
into it so what and find out what kind
of knickers you wear
well yeah you know the internet that's
the kind of thing the internet's into
isn't it i've read it you're right
but i think some clothes do take much
longer to dry than others so i think you
would need one for each item oh
gosh shanna right surely you just put
the smart peg on the thing that takes
longest to dry
oh god i've wasted so much money on a
thousand smartpens
do you when you're doing the laundry and
you put stuff outside you just
go out and you take one oh this is dry
i'll take this in
every five minutes
you know uh washing detergent can be
quite dangerous in war
so the army actually has a list of
banned detergents that they are not
allowed to use
because they contain optical brightness
so imagine you
you were saying but if you use daz and
your clothes are whiter than white
you're going to be spotted
no this is this is all to do with sort
of you know
infrared and so on you know if you have
um
optical brightness in it it'll go
slightly fluorescent your clothing and
that can be picked up by night vision
goggles and so on so they have a very
strict list of what you're allowed to
wash
your clothes in wow so funny but that is
another idea for james to take to
saatchi and sochi i think for the next
house ad
i think so bright that you will die in
all situations oh yeah so the ad is just
one there's like 50 of them
and they all get gunned down except for
the one guy who then holds up a daz
box that says don't get it he's the one
who does get
shot oh the dad's guy is dead yeah
what you actually need is loads of like
people in a battle loads of different
sides
and then they all want to give up and so
they all get a white flag
but nine of them are really dirty white
flags because they don't use daz
but then one person is used as and they
have a really shiny white flag and
they're the ones that survive
that is good is the
is this you know white flag means i cert
i surrender i surrender it's a dirty
flag made [ __ ] you
what are you gonna do what are you gonna
do clear signal
i don't deserve clemency because i have
no hygiene
that's what it means i've used this flag
so many times it's dirty
i don't think dads have advertised on
british tv for some years now
but if they've been saving up in their
war chest for the next big campaign this
is it
yeah um you know um
who i can't believe this fact that i'm
about to say but
queen victoria had a special train for
her laundry
[Laughter]
okay so there used to be a royal laundry
in richmond
uh in london or did one and a half tons
of laundry a day so not all hers it was
you know palace yeah she was large by
the end of her life though
it's true but and she wore a lot of
layers um yeah
but um and basically wherever she was
apart from if she was in scotland which
would have been
insane for the laundry to come down from
there but even if she was on the isle of
wight
or if she was at um windsor or or you
know
london palace at buckingham palace i
guess um the railway
handed over all these items and i've
seen sources saying like this is the
thing i really
believe that it was a minute a special
miniature train which
took her but she
she would have had to build a special
railway light like a special narrow
gauge railway line for a miniature train
and i cannot believe that she should
have just got
a washing machine in both of her palaces
yeah she wouldn't ever
have to keep shipping it back all right
ronald reagan
[Laughter]
uh there was speaking of railways uh we
as a group have discussed the
underground railroad before a few times
but
it's never been on this i don't think uh
and that was the
um idea that you would take enslave
people from the south america
and you would sneak them out of places
where slavery was legal
and you would get them to places where
they were safe
and there is a theory or there's a story
that you'll see a lot online
that people got messages through quilts
on the underground
railroad and that is that you would put
quilts
on washing lines all the way along and
then you would see it and if it had like
a zigzag pattern you'd know that this
was a safe way to go and if it had like
a stripe pattern it'd be like we'll turn
left here and stuff like that
and this story is all over the internet
but according
to national geographic quilt historians
and
underground railroad experts have
questioned the study's methodology
uh of the original study and apparently
it was invented by
a woman called azala mcdaniel williams
who was a quilt salesperson in the 1990s
and wrote a book about quilts
and she came up with this idea that this
happened in the underground railroad
and it's not it does make sense that you
can send there are examples of people
sending messages using washing lines um
that happened in the american civil war
i think but this particular thing
i think possibly not true that's a shame
it's a bit it's a it's someone trying to
make the quilt a bigger part of world
history against inequality then it
really is
it's a bit like what was that mosquito
expert that dan had whined something
timothy c weingarten she is like the
timothy c winegard of quilts oh i love
that man

okay on with the show on with the
podcast
[Music]
okay it is time for fact number two and
that is my fact
my fact this week is that canadian
engineers are part of a
secret order designed by rudyard kipling
this is uh this is called the ritual of
the calling
of an engineer and it is a secret ritual
that most not all but most are asked to
take part in
once they're sort of graduating to be
officially
a professional engineer and this little
ritual
um started in the early 1900s and the
people who set it up
wanted a really good thing to read out
at the ceremony
and they couldn't do it on their own so
in 1922 they approached roger kipling
author of the jungle book
and they asked him to write this thing
and it's still going on to this day
you can still see and this is how you
know if a canadian engineer is part of
this secret order
look at the pinky finger and if there's
an iron ring on it
they are part of this secret set and
there's not too much that we know about
it by the way it is genuinely they have
the ceremony no friends are allowed to
come no partners are allowed to come
and only a few people have spoken about
it publicly and telling us what goes on
at these ceremonies
and it all sounds really tame not dark
at all like really boring i don't know
why they don't just tell us about it
maybe then the people who came
out like the one or two people who've
told you about it and said oh yeah it's
really tame
i mean that's what they want you to
think isn't it exactly yeah
very true very true there is a there's a
very dangerous cabal
going on in canada we need to we need it
i need to break it open it's amazing
that they just got the most famous
writer in the world at the time
as he was to do this for them i guess so
powerful aren't they these canadian
engineers it's like
not surprising they probably could have
got anyone really yeah you're right
my very good friend is an engineer and
she worked in canada for a year last
year
a year before last um and so i messaged
her about this
and she finds it pretty gross so she's
like it's kind of disgusting because you
go into the office and everyone else has
this weird ring on their pinky
and she also seemed to have an issue
with the fact that um
kind of anyone can get it according to
her so
uh you don't actually have to be
chartered you only have to graduate from
university in the uk you don't get
anything to get charted
much longer process and then you get an
a3 certificate
not the same so it's kind of like piece
of piss she was like any engineers can
get it by the way even the ones who
design
air conditioning units well right it
sounds like your friend is
simultaneously very angry this exists
and very angry she's not part of the
club
so badly she has a certificate
i don't know what else she needs
yeah i'm as you say andy like he was a
really
popular writer in that time so it is
bizarre that he
was writing for them yeah i think
someone said i think he
was probably the richest classic author
that britain's ever had
he was so bloody successful he bought
himself a mansion with his
proceeds there was one single story
which
ended up earning 31.5 million pounds
no hang on wow richard osmond eat your
heart out
and that's a short story that's what he
wrote in those days that can't be in the
money of the time because he would have
been able to buy
the entire country with that sorry is
the equivalent of 31.5 million 250 000
pounds a story
well it's a slight sheet it's called the
absent-minded beggar and
it was the daily mail was running a
charity fundraising
thing as part of an appeal to give money
to soldiers in the bull war
and this is 1899 and kipling wrote this
poem sent it to them and said
use this as you see fit to raise as much
money as you can
and so they did and all the proceeds
that were raised from it went to the war
effort but it really
took off it was a sensation so it was a
musical anthem arthur sullivan of
gilbert and sullivan put music to it
and people bloody loved it cool yeah he
did a lot of that kind of um
writing writing with a slight element of
influencing public opinion behind it
as in he was a campaigner he seemed to
um dislike a lot of
things and a lot of people um so
you know that's um people he is viewed
variously as either a really
you know these days extremely
old-fashioned jingoistic imperialist
colonialist racist
lots and lots of you know heavy
criticism
kind of kicked off by george orwell who
pointed out that people have been hating
kipling
pretty much since he was writing since
he was really popular lots of people
have really disliked
um freddie kipling but then again he you
know he also has written these fabulous
books which are very observant about
human nature and all this stuff so it
kind of keeps the reputation going
um but one of the things that he wrote
was the phrase known unto god
which went on gravestones of
unidentified servicemen after the war
ended
and that he was you know after he lost
his only son in the
first world war and he was on the
imperial war graves commission he played
a big role in that and that was the
phrase that
uh that he thought was most fitting he
was um
he was always arguing that rich family
shouldn't be able to erect loads of
statues to their own children uh because
he thought that everyone who died in the
war really should have an
equal remembrance uh and that was a huge
thing there was like there's a family
called the cecils who were like one of
the richest families in the whole of
britain and he really stood up against
them because they wanted to do these
statues and he was like nah everyone
should have the same
that's interesting but yeah he was a
massive racist so
that's another thing i mean he really he
was a white supremacist
so yeah he's such an interesting
character so he his first language is
hindi
uh born in india of course like first
years in india
and said apparently he wasn't very good
at english when he learned it because
they
learned it in translation from hindi so
you'd learn it in like a really stilted
sing-song way and he said that when he
came to britain so he came to britain
when he was about six
and was sent away by his parents and
then he returned to india when he was
17.
and he wrote that when he returned he
found himself speaking in vernacular
sentences whose meaning i knew not
he just found words coming out of his
mouth that he remembered from his
childhood not even knowing what he was
saying
apparently bizarre yeah he came up with
the phrase the oldest profession to mean
prostitution
so lots of people said oh that's the
oldest profession but before
kipling they were talking about lots of
different professions so there was you
know tailors
uh were described as the oldest
profession that's probably the first
time anyone said this is the oldest
profession that's the oldest oldest
profession
uh murderers were claimed as being the
oldest professional arguably not a
profession but still
and there was this weird crossover
period where lots of people were still
quite innocent of the phrase
so but we're using it and then other
people would think well i'm not sure
that's what you mean so graduating
cadets might be told you are now
entering the oldest profession in the
world
and not you know the old buffer who was
doing the ceremony might not realize
what he was saying
apparently he coined a few other terms
and words um so some of the words
include lunchless classic
that that describes someone who has no
lunch brilliant just uh
he was apparently he coined write oh
apparently that's his that's the first
first use of write-o
it is for you andy but yeah most people
don't use it quite as often as you do
the sun rarely sets on a date but i
haven't said write-o at least a few
times
[Laughter]
squidgy as well and stinky did he do
because he i know he coined squiggly as
well and it seems like a cheat to coin
squidgy and squiggly i don't know if you
count one if you've done the other
oh they're very different words that
they one of them describes something
that's soft and the other one describes
something that goes in lots of
directions
yeah that's a good point actually you
wouldn't say i've just enjoyed a lovely
moist
squiggly bit of sponge cake would you no
you wouldn't say i've just drawn a
squidgy line
no but we all say write-o
he was so famous that towns named
themselves after him um
so there were two towns in i think
michigan which named themselves rudyard
and kipling after him
um and there's a place in saskatchewan
called kipling
and that is an interesting place for us
because it's the town where a canadian
blogger called kyle mcdonald
traded his way from a paper clip up to a
house do you remember this guy
i do yeah yeah he started with the paper
clippers traded it for loads and loads
of things this is in about
the early 2000s and he ended up with a
house in kipling
and the town now has to commemorated it
with the world's largest paper clip
they've got a paper clip to come up
that's cool
well of course we've said before he was
named after a place a place where his
parents met roger lake
also quite an interesting place because
that was a massive tourist attraction
so that's a lake in staffordshire and
i discovered that as well as being uh
the reason that roger's called rudyard
it was also the place where the african
blondin
as he called himself a guy called carlos
trower in 1864 walked a tightrope 100
feet up
above the lake wow and it sounds great
and thousands of people used to go to
this place every day apparently so
i think apparently 20 000 visitors a day
would visit this
tourist attraction at its peak and they
watched him
and he did it carrying an 11 year old
boy he did it backwards and forwards
with his hands and feet shackled which
i've had no idea how you walk a
tightrope like that
and then at one point he was in the
middle of the tightrope above the lake
and then he went back to the edge
picked up a stove brought it back to the
middle and cooked himself ham and eggs
which i don't i also don't know how you
cook on a stove
in the middle of a tightrope isn't isn't
he the guy who
he did niagara falls as well isn't it
london blondin
he named himself what's this guy's name
oh great okay yeah
about because blondin also cooked in his
uh walks as well doesn't he so he's a
total tribute act
yeah that's really cool he's a tribute
act but over a lake
staffordshire as opposed to over niagara
falls
which i don't know i really like
staffordshire as a county but i'm not
sure it has quite the same gravitas
it's not gonna
no but there is another thing that
happened at lake rudyard which is that
matthew webb
who the first person to swim the english
channel
he went to lake rudyard to host a grand
aquatic fate where he recreated his
channel swim
again i have no idea how impressive that
would have actually been
watching him to splash around in a lake
for a bit what i wonder what the
difference is between recreating a swim
across the channel
and just swimming like how does he make
how does he make it does he put like a
cross-channel ferry next to him
or or what like you're absolutely right
details are frustratingly vague because
this was
you'd have to make have people generate
waves he probably had lots of people in
there kicking and splashing because it's
very strong currents
in there but a few
i'm sure they had them 20 000 visitors
jane some of those tourists
are kids that's true um
kipling often associated with swastikas
because he was um very much into them
obviously growing up in
india and they were a symbol of uh peace
etc until those dastardly nazis got in
on the act
in the 30s but there was a guy in 1984
called tom driver who ran
a bookshop and he wrote to the kipling
journal
um saying that whenever anyone comes
into his shop
all they ask about is kipling and the
swastikas
because they had lots of old editions
and the old editions of kipling all have
the swastika on them and then later
editions didn't have them anymore of
course and he said we have recently kept
a record
and we averaged once a day when a
visitor asked us some question about
kipling and the swastika
usually at the back of it is a thought
that kipling was a nazi uh and he said
that they always tell them
that you know that this is an old peace
sign and that's it and he said yeah but
that's
what basically every single day someone
was coming in saying
why the swastikas on this i've got a
couple of
um pre-1933 kiplings and they
have the swastika on them yeah well i
did my dissertation on kipling so yeah
oh wow yeah yeah yeah oh you didn't lead
on that's sort of a
cheating isn't it sorry yeah very much
cheating in advance in preparation for
this project
well um next week we'll be doing
scanning tunneling microscopes
which was what my dissertation was on
good luck
okay it is time for fact number three
and that is
andy my fact is that when mcdonald's
launched the felio fish sandwich its
main competition was
the hula burger which was a slice of
pineapple in a bun
with cheese yeah um yeah it was popular
it was so unpopular um basically there
was a bit of
cincinnati where 87 of the population
were catholic
and as a result didn't eat meat on
fridays and um
as a result the cincinnati mcdonald's
took zero money on fridays because they
didn't have any alternatives to their
you know burgers
and the owner said right i have come up
with an idea called the filet of fish
sandwich it's gonna revolutionize the
way we trade on fridays it's going to be
great
and he really needed this because he was
a kind of franchise holder so he needed
the business to earn money
and ray kroc the founder said he said in
quotes you're always coming up here with
a bunch of crap
didn't like the idea for the fellow fish
said my ideas mine is much better
the hula burger we'll take a slice of
pineapple
we'll grill it put some cheese on it put
it in a bun sportingly break rocks
didn't just steamroller the owner who's
called lou grown he said look right
we'll have a competition good friday
1962.
demand for meat can be very very low
because of all the christians so
we will stock both in certain stores on
a given day and we will see who wins
and the felio fish sold 350 and the hula
burger sold six
they went with the fellow fish and when
did you say this was this was 62.
so this was really the heyday of
pineapple and cheese being a fashionable
dish
and even then yeah you're right the
canopies yeah yeah yeah it just didn't
work wow
yeah you've got to put it on a stick i
mean it sounds good to me does it sound
bad to you guys
i i wouldn't mind it i think i
think the problem is the slightly grainy
texture of the bread
with the smooth texture of the pineapple
i'm really
one of my biggest fans is textures i
really struggle with certain textures
and i think that would
that would be the main problem yeah
interesting that might be why you hate
mushrooms so much because they do have a
very distinct
meat jelly stuff like that i can't can't
deal with that
oh that's i didn't know that you didn't
like meat joey that's pies ruined for
you it's basically all of russian
cuisine brewing for me as well
it's like yeah i think jelly should be
sweet
personally and i think my mcdonald's
should be
savory
so you're on the philly of fish sauce i
think i am really yeah
because i think dan even though i agree
with you look if someone put in front of
me
pineapple and cheese in a bun i would
eat it but if someone gave me the choice
i'd definitely go philly a fish would
you think you'd choose the pineapple
no no i'm just saying there's a lot of
options on the menu and um
it doesn't stick out as a weird
mcdonald's one for me it just might not
be as popular as
one of their biggest most popular
burgers also catholics
tend to eat fish on fridays as opposed
to eating pineapples on fridays so if it
was
to for the catholics yeah
you're right now yeah you don't see
jesus
having two pineapples and 12 loaves do
you
he would have only fed the 200 if they'd
had the choice
but maybe that was a secret maybe there
was another messiah at the stall
pineapple diet oh that's a cutscene from
life of brian
surely but yeah pineapples they were
i mean they were massive weren't they
well they were the same size
as they are today are similar size but
they were really popular
and it was because they were so
difficult to grow
and so um they just became really
exclusive
yeah and you couldn't grow them here
that was oh it was really hard to grow
them here wasn't it so
it was a coat it was a sort of code that
you were incredibly wealthy
and so you can kind of date whole bits
of um
you know british design and architecture
to when they were built because
if it's got a pineapple on it's probably
from that time in the 18th century that
everyone was obsessed with pineapples
gateposts and railings yeah but all of
this stuff
by the way i just want to give a shout
out to fran bowman's book which is
called the pineapple
king of fruits which is possibly
my favorite book on a single tiny weird
subject that i've ever read in my entire
life so people should definitely read it
um but she basically says that once you
learn
how amazingly popular pineapples were
for this short time
wherever you go you'll start seeing
pineapples because like candy says
they're absolutely everywhere
yeah it's really tough and like i can't
believe we've never said before but
people used to rent them
so if you couldn't afford them which a
lot of people couldn't so there was a
again it was a brief time i think it was
the start of the 18th century
um they would cost of 10 000 pounds in
today's money as much as a carriage so
you'd rent one for a night and you'd
carry it around like a bag
or you'd put it on your table if you're
hosting your dinner party
and someone i think it was fran bowman
who pointed out was terrifying if you
were the servant who had to transport
the pineapple around because that's the
equivalent of carrying a briefcase
stuffed with banknotes yeah but who's
going to know that you've got a
pineapple
under your cloak it's not you wouldn't
just randomly mug someone in the hope
that they'd have a pineapple that's
jackpot for the mugger didn't people
used to
didn't the rich used to hire people to
sleep with their pineapples was that a
thing am i making that up
yeah they used to for what to protect
their pineapples at night
um yeah from any poachers or any animals
yeah exactly if you were growing them
what do you say am i making that up have
you
have you read that somewhere we don't
know if you're making it up well i i
read fran bowman's book years and years
ago
and it's a memory from that james just
bringing that up yeah
okay i know um charles ii used to sleep
with a pineapple
um he'd sleep with anything though
pineapple yeah what
well you know his mistress barbara
villas he called her my sweet pineapple
okay so yeah he slept with a pineapple
and barbara billy is amazing
isn't she like she was like um she kind
of became the
king's like favorite mistress and then
after
the king died she just went completely
off the rails uh
and at one stage the absolute worst
thing that she did was um biting the
penis off a recently exhumed bishop
i think as far as going off the rails is
concerned
i mean pete dougherty's got a lot to
learn hasn't he
what if he'd run out of pineapple
charles ii
he also commissioned a painting of
himself being given a pineapple by his
gardener that's how much he loved
pineapples
and it was kind of to prove a point so
he ordered a pineapple because the
french ambassador was there
and um barbados was an english colony at
the time and they were arguing over who
got to own the nearby island of saint
kitts
and he was basically asserting primacy
because you could grow pineapples in
barbados
and he was saying look we can do this
with our pineapples here so it makes
sense that we should have this
neighboring bit of land as well okay
and that i think that was why he
commissioned a painting of himself just
getting a pineapple off his gardener
right wow
i was thinking how awful it must have
been when the very first king received
pineapple that was king ferdinand
so pineapple was brought to europe after
columbus's voyages the late 15th century
and uh king ferdinand of spain was the
first person to eat one and he said the
flavor exceeds
all other fruit but um it was the only
one that survived the trip
and so imagine how awful that is you
know when you run out of something
delicious and you have to go back to
this
oh yeah it's the most delicious thing
you've ever tasted in your life
and that's it yeah because they all like
he did have loads of them but they are
just all
ended up squishy and rotten didn't they
apart from one of them
which makes me think that perhaps the
one probably wasn't
in the absolute best condition if all
the others have got it's a bit like the
washing on your line going dry if all
the others are rotten then that one's
probably a bit rotten as well
all the others went squidgy but this one
happened to go squiggly
[Laughter]
have you guys ever been on a cruise yep
no
okay so james you're the only one who's
been on the cruise when you were on the
cruise
did you ever see on anyone else's door a
sticker with the pineapple on it
no i didn't go on a very high class
cruise it has to be said
oh that's fine because this doesn't
apply on high class this is the
there is a myth among the cruising
community that this
indicates or if someone has a pineapple
magnet or whatever or something
or that they are swingers and they are
interested in
is that right but well i
i was i know because when i went on the
cruise the whole time i was sat on the
deck reading fran bowman's book about
pineapples so god knows what they all
thought
um yeah it's the thing is the system is
a poor one
because obviously i mean assuming this
is not complete bollocks which it may
well be
but you would only see a few doors don't
you because you normally you know you
have your corridor and then you go up to
the
yeah but if you're a swinger you're
probably checking a few more dollars in
the average person
aren't you that's good i think so yeah
you walk up a couple of corridors you
don't know who's behind the door either
i mean the worst thing would be if
you've got sticker on your door and
someone knocks on the door you open it
and they say
oh sorry i think i've got the wrong
sorry nothing never mind you'd probably
dress
as like a i was gonna say cabin boy but
more like a
waiter or something and so you have to
out like if
if they knock on the door and you don't
fancy them you can say oh sorry i just
come to collect
your dream service that's good that's
it's a that's i think the best possible
solution but that feels like a long
now you've got to pack your cabin boy
outfit where you're going
i just think so many things have to like
come together
at once to make this work that i can't
believe it's ever happened in the
history of
the universe it's like you have to be
they have to be other swingers on the
boat you have to be on the right
corridor you have to know about the
pineapple rule
and they have to be attractive enough
for you to accept yeah do we as
if anyone's listening if you've ever had
a successful pineapple-based cruise
experience
we won't hear about it yeah hey um i was
looking into
other ways of presenting pineapple for
meals and i came across a dessert i've
never heard of before have you guys
heard of candle
salad you ever had a candle salad no i
haven't
i'm part of the electric generation so i
just plug my salad in at the water
so candle salad it's a fruit salad um
although you do have lettuce in it as
well as the base
but the idea is you take a ring of
pineapple
and you place through the ring of
pineapple at the base
a banana a peeled banana so it sits up
i can see why the swingers would like
this kind of thing
it has a red cherry on the top and then
and
by the way this supposedly is for
children this is a great
way to get kids to eat fruit it's got
this cherry on the top it's a banana
sticking up
through the pineapple and uh you use
either
mayonnaise on it or cottage cheese
you do not put mayonnaise on it
i swear to god you put it on and you put
it right at the tip
of the banana what is the real thing
about it
it's a kid's food and it looks like
erect penis that's just orgasm
stop feeding this to your children yeah
come on dad which soft play area have
you been to where they give you this
halfway through dan is no longer allowed
to go to any
children's softball area what where are
you getting it from like it's not i've i
never saw this in my childhood put it
this way it was
and i was i was a catholic
[Laughter]
it was big in the 1920s in america um
and
it's still it still is around and if you
google it there's plenty of pictures
people love popping their pictures up to
show you
how they how their candle salad looks
and you know has a full-on wikipedia
article
telling about its history it's it's a
real thing everything's got a wikipedia
article mate there's always some nut job
out there willing to write wikipedia
articles
how do you balance a cherry on a banana
with
that's easy potted cream or whatever it
was yeah with mayonnaise
james mayonnaise sorry that's the
implausible bit i was just trying to
think of anything scenery
i can't remember what it was cottage
cheese makes a lot of sense cottage
cheese famously goes with pineapple
yeah mayonnaise like i say stop feeding
it to your kids
[Music]
stop the podcast stop the podcast
hey everyone this week's episode of fish
is sponsored by expressvpn
that's right expressvpn as i'm sure you
know by now if you've listened to these
adverts before is a vpn
service and a vpn service will stop the
world from knowing
exactly where you are in the world when
you're on the internet
so you'll be in your home uh but it will
be in an
undisclosed location that's right uh and
actually it's very useful
isn't it for being able to access hidden
materials
that are sort of hidden in other
countries around the world so for
example if you're watching say netflix
and you're like hang on where's all the
other adam sandler movies
i need more well if you change your
expressvpn to say i don't know papua new
guinea or
the united states of america suddenly a
whole new plethora
a whole new filmography appears before
you of adam sandler movies
and you can enjoy 50 first dates you can
enjoy happy gilmore
it's it's limitless what you can enjoy i
actually watched happy gilmore for the
first time in my life the other day
uh really in which country where are you
well i can't disclose that dan i'm sorry
to say
because i use expressvpn and if you
would like to use expressvpn
then the best way of doing that is to go
to expressvpn.com
fish and when you do that you can get
three months extra for free that's right
so go
to expressvpn that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn
dot com slash fish and get yourself that
three
extra months all for free okay on with
the podcast
on the show
okay it is time for our final fact of
the show
and that is james okay my fact this week
is that there is a professional
footballer called
naughty naughty he has never been sent
off
i mean the headline that could have been
oh well
he might be naughty might still be
because he's very young
um well he is young compared to me
he was born in 1994. how old does that
make it yeah it's pretty good
yeah um so basically
this guy i known about him for a little
while uh he was played for chelsea as a
youth player
uh and then he's played for a few
non-league teams like charlie and dover
um but recently he's gone to play for
queen of the south
in scotland uh and last week he scored
against inverness caledonian thistle
and i was watching gillette soccer
saturday with jeff stelling uh
and jeff stelling said that this guy
called naughty naughty had never been
sent off
and i checked and as far as i can see
it's true and
you know we get a lot of our facts from
books or from scientific papers or stuff
like this and i just thought
why can't you get facts from gillette
sucker saturday on sky sports
am i right facts you can find facts
anywhere can't you i've always said
there should be a
not opposite of nominative determinism i
reckon i've said this in the podcast and
if he's not evidence of that i don't
know what is
yeah um so on football is being sent off
oh yeah so i thought
naughty naughty never has been there
have been some wonderful soundings off
in the history of english football oh my
god
so i the earliest ever sending off um
was a sunday league match in 2000 and it
was between
cross farm park celtic and taunton east
reach wanderers
right the referee blew his whistle at
the start of the match very close to a
player called lee todd
who was a part-time bricklayer who had
his back turned the ref blew his whistle
very very loud
told todd exclaimed [ __ ] me that was
loud the referee stopped the game
two seconds in and sent him off for
abusive language
it's just a glorious story like there
are so many crunchy details about it
like he was also
banned for 35 days and fined 27 pounds
but then in the meeting about that he
went [ __ ] me that's not very much
another 35 days mate
he was tracked down 20 years after this
match last year he was tracked down by
the website sport bible
and he's still slightly annoyed about it
he said [ __ ] me i mean if anything he
was wearing it himself
true yeah yeah unless it could like
maybe the referee took it as a request
oh yeah he did have a pineapple sticker
actually
do you know what the record for being
booked with a yellow card is
how quickly that was done uh it was
three seconds and that was vinnie jones
who most people
globally will know as an actor uh but
used to be a professional footballer
yeah he was booked after three seconds
um and he beat the previous record for
yellow card by two seconds so
it was a five second was the previous
record and that was held by
vinnie jones who smashed his own record
yeah
the red card was invented by referee ken
aston
after the 1966 world cup he could be
sent off before then but they didn't
have card system
uh because and what happened was in the
quarter-final
um of the world cup which was between
england and
i think argentina um it said in the
newspapers the next day that both of the
charlton brothers had been booked
but they didn't remember it happening
and so england went to the um
to fifa and said it says in the
newspapers that we've been booked but we
have no idea what happened
and it turned out they had been and they
hadn't noticed but then
ken aston having seen this happen
thought well we need a more
obvious symbol of someone being sent off
and apparently he was driving down
kensington high street
and he saw a traffic light and the
yellow he thought meant take it easy
and they're ready to stop and so he
thought well that's a good idea let's
have yellow and red cards so i guess
the trap knights aren't yellow they're
amber are they so they should be amber
and red cards maybe
but it's a real it's literally a light
bulb moment because what do you have in
traffic lights yes you have light bulbs
but it's also an extremely obvious theft
to us now
as in it's so obvious that i don't know
it's
what do you mean to get to get red and
yellow and green well i heard about that
canasta you should be given
everyone should be given a green card at
the start of the match that would be a
really nice
america that was before the 1994 world
cup in america they all had to have a
green card
in the match with the most ever red
cards given
only one person was sent off oh
this was anna's corner
[Laughter]
it was valentine's day and they all got
a load of red
cards which said happy valentine's day
on them
exactly oh it's such a good answer james
and i'm going to give you a bonus point
for that but it's
not correct okay um 36 people got red
cards but it was in 2011.
it was vaguely famous the referee was
this guy called damian rubino
and one player was sent off in the first
half because he just got two yellows
and he came returned in the second half
to stand in the crowd in his home
clothes
and cheer the teams on and then at the
end of the match this guy had been sent
off in the first half came onto the
pitch
and just punched one of the opposition
players in the face for reasons
unknown to anyone but there's a huge
brawl started so everyone chased him he
fled to the locker room
everyone's favorite place to be and then
there was a big fight in there and then
they came back out to the pitch big
fight there and eventually the referees
gave red cards to everyone on both teams
plus all subs
plus a coach or two as well but he was
into he's been interviewed this ref and
he was like i've got no idea why
this guy just jumped out of the stands
and went and punched someone in the face
and years later he bumped into him at
another match
and the guy said sorry about that
incident we actually had some personal
beef
off the pitch but
yeah we never know what it was
we'll never know you can only speculate
yeah
a
the first woman to ever be sent off an
official football match for fighting was
called lily parr
um she is very famous she played for the
um dick kerr
ladies who are some factory workers from
preston who we might have mentioned
before actually one of the yeah we must
have
probably the most successful women's
team of all time uh anyway she
had a shot that was so hard she once
broke the arm of a professional male
goalkeeper
that's how good she was she's got more
than a thousand goals
during her career above the thousand
goals uh 34 of which were in her first
season when she was only 14 years old
oh wow how good does she sound what a
product
they did used to play with bowling balls
back there much easier to break an arm
is is nanny a famous player yeah yeah
played blue
luis is his is his name and nanny's his
name
is played for united as james says in
2013 he was sent off in a match against
real madrid
and watching at home one of the united
fans was so
outraged and enraged by this that he
phoned the police he called 999.
and he he was a young lad i think he
caught he was just
so angry about the setting off he
thought a crime has been committed
and then the police turned up and the
car was going
if he didn't get red for time wasting
but that's he apologized later on he's
it was
he said it was bad judgment to find the
old bill
i found a naughty manager naughty
football manager
oh yeah yeah someone very famous jose
mourinho
so jose mourinho was given a two-match
ban
once um and he found that horrible
because he wasn't able to consult with
his team
in the locker rooms so he snuck in
and he managed to give his team a big
talk but then the problem was he got in
there early so he wasn't seen
but by the time he'd finished with his
team the whole place was crowded
with uefa people and and he needed to
somehow get out
so they popped a kit man popped jose
mourinho
in a laundry basket no
and yeah and wheeled him out so that he
he left a sort of the lid bit of it open
so that he was fine he could breathe but
suddenly when they were in the in the
sort of corridors they could hear uefa
people and he got really nervous the
kick guy got really nervous
so he slammed the lid down on top of the
laundry basket problem is is
mourinho is claustrophobic and freaked
out inside
and he thought he was dying and he was
just thrashing about and
and eventually when they got out they
opened it he was like
and came out and it was a big scene for
him
yeah the problem was he ended up on the
isle of wight and queen victoria were
like who the hell are you
such a good story incredible wow did you
also have that as research for the
laundry section
i did yeah yeah yeah you've got to
double that up
um james and anna i think it's fair to
say that you're the two
of this podcasting team who are more
interested in football
yeah if we're ranking well anna's a
newcastle fan but
you know yeah you can't really call it
football now i kind of bit that
that's from a tram mere fan over there
okay well i'm gonna look up all these
references later so thanks for those but
um are you guys familiar with the the
idea that it's harder to play against
10 men than 11. is this the thing that
people say like people say it
usually you're expected to win against
10 men because they have one fewer
player
but a lot of teams do struggle
interestingly yeah
is it the psychology of it well it's
either that or
this is just from what i've read is that
a team with 10 players retreats and so
they're going to be guarding them
very carefully but anyway it's been
studied and it's absolutely
nonsense it's much easier to win more
points and more goals against 10 men
than it is against 11.
the stats that's what the stats say yeah
it's pretty hard to play against 15 men
this was a problem that arsenal had in a
game against dynamo moscow in 1945
it was a friendly game so not too bad
but it was played in extremely heavy fog
so that no one could really see what was
happening on the pitch
uh and at one stage the moscow dynamo
played uh made a substitution but they
didn't take a player off they just
brought someone on
and put no unnoticed uh and fans who
were watching
reckon at one stage they had 15 players
on the pitch at one stage
uh arsenal had a player sent off and the
player
snuck back onto the pitch for the rest
of the game
and in the end arsenal lost 4-3
but probably one of the reasons was
because the goalkeeper knocked himself
out
accidentally running into a goal post
because he couldn't see because of the
