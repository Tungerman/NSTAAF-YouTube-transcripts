[Music]
01:34
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:38
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:41
this week coming to you live from bars
01:44
to po
01:51
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
01:53
here with anna tashinsky andrew hunter
01:55
murray and james harkin and once again
01:58
we have gathered around the microphones
01:59
with our four favorite facts from the
02:01
last seven days and in a particular
02:03
order here we go starting with fact
02:06
number one and that is james okay my
02:09
fact this week is
02:11
that when the bird poo import industry
02:15
first reached the uk
02:17
the smell was so bad in southampton that
02:20
the entire urban population fled to the
02:23
hills
02:25
was it in one go you know when you watch
02:26
movies like deep impact or armageddon
02:28
where you just see people flocking away
02:30
from cities was there you just got one
02:32
guy with a cold gun in the other
02:34
direction what the are they doing
02:36
um so this is um it's guano so um it's
02:40
in the olden days you would get this
02:42
bird poo and it would get brought into
02:44
the country and they would use it as
02:45
fertilizer and there is a english
02:48
historian called frederick pike who
02:50
wrote the modern history of peru so he
02:52
was writing about the peruvian guano
02:54
industry and he said that the stench was
02:56
so miserable that the entire population
02:58
of southampton left the town it might be
03:01
true it might not be true this is what
03:02
the historian says so it's quite a good
03:04
source it certainly feels like it's an
03:05
exaggeration though isn't it it doesn't
03:07
i'd eat my all of my clothes right now
03:09
if every human in southampton evacuated
03:12
and went up a hill
03:14
well surely we'd know about that it's
03:16
true but have you ever been to
03:17
southampton
03:19
i have and i don't know what you're
03:20
saying about it but i'm going to say i
03:21
don't agree no i i don't agree with
03:23
myself i kind of say i'd eat all of my
03:25
clothes right now it's an incredible
03:27
escalation if i'd eat my hat
03:32
i did find was in massachusetts there is
03:35
a place called woods hole and there was
03:37
a company called the pacific guano
03:39
company and i've seen some very good
03:42
evidence that whenever the weather
03:44
changed the wind changed in a certain
03:46
direction the entire town would have to
03:48
be evacuated from the smell so it was it
03:51
is very smelly bird poo when you have it
03:53
on such big amounts yeah yeah and the
03:55
reason it's so smelly is that it's not
03:58
just any bird poo isn't it it's bird poo
04:00
of
04:01
specific birds that have been eating
04:03
specific fish and the reason that guano
04:05
is was this incredible wonder substance
04:08
in the 19th century is that it it has
04:10
lots of what is it nitrogen and
04:11
phosphate and potassium all of the
04:13
chemicals that just act as rocket fuel
04:15
for plants and so it suddenly acts as
04:17
this incredible fertilizer but the
04:19
reason it smells so bad is it's so full
04:20
of this very very oily fish so what so
04:22
there's yeah so there's the fish guano
04:24
which is very important but that guano
04:26
as well uh is very important but what
04:28
are the bats eating they're not eating
04:30
fish right they'll eat insects bats okay
04:32
and the juice is the same because those
04:34
are the most important sea birds and
04:35
bats
04:36
i didn't know batsons uses fertilizer it
04:38
can be i think mostly it would be used
04:41
they would use it as um like to make
04:44
gunpowder and stuff i think they used it
04:45
but like the fish one when they first
04:48
found these islands off the coast of
04:49
peru which had all this tons and tons of
04:51
bird on that kind of changed the
04:53
world a little bit because it was the
04:55
first mass-produced
04:57
fertilizer that wasn't coming let's say
04:59
out of humans yeah yeah well they had
05:02
islands just off peru where the the
05:04
guano had built up for all those years
05:07
that they were like 200 feet yeah i've
05:09
been there actually have you been to
05:11
those guano islands yeah um i tricked my
05:14
wife into going there because
05:16
[Laughter]
05:18
there was a um there was an excursion to
05:20
swim with sea lions
05:22
and i noticed it was on the guano
05:23
islands and i was like oh you've always
05:25
wanted to swim with sea lions haven't
05:26
you and she hadn't
05:28
yeah
05:29
but we went down there and i kept asking
05:31
the guy who was in charge about the
05:32
guano i'm like oh you know is there
05:34
still guards here and stuff like that
05:36
and he didn't know anything about it
05:37
really he only knew about sea lions
05:40
i don't i think you weren't cheated
05:42
there i think that's fair
05:44
i think one of the reasons as well that
05:46
it was so useful and i think this might
05:48
be why bat guano was the other famous
05:50
one i suppose um is that it's all
05:52
together so the reason you can use
05:55
background for let's say gunpowder and
05:57
this is that sea birds all flock to one
05:59
spot and then they everywhere bats
06:00
are obviously all in one cave they
06:02
everywhere if it was pigeon guano that
06:04
would be hell right because you'd have
06:05
to crawl around the streets of london
06:06
scraping up individual pigeon poo after
06:09
pigeon poo you wouldn't get anywhere
06:11
yeah and also those islands it hardly
06:13
ever rains so it's always quite overcast
06:15
but it doesn't really rain very often
06:17
and so it never gets washed away it's
06:19
just kind of layers and layers and
06:20
layers it was me so there's a newspaper
06:22
advert i read from the 1840s and it just
06:25
read guano guano guano and then in caps
06:28
lock guano it was so impressive and it
06:32
was this kind of wonder substance so
06:33
there was a story that the san francisco
06:35
journal printed in 1857 and it was about
06:38
a shipment of guano making its way
06:40
across the atlantic and the ship's
06:42
hatches were left open by mistake and
06:44
the guano got wet and the account is
06:47
that the timbers of the ship started
06:48
growing and sprouting in all directions
06:51
the rudder of the ship grew into a huge
06:53
great oak they had to start pruning the
06:55
ship every couple of days
06:57
and apples were growing on the pump
06:59
handle worst of all the ships
07:00
cockroaches all the cockroaches on board
07:02
had got into the guano and they got so
07:04
big and powerful that they were able to
07:06
pull up the anchor of the ship whoa
07:09
i mean it's not true
07:12
it's such a well it's printed in the san
07:14
francisco journal why did they print it
07:16
as a fable it was it was a humorous myth
07:19
sailor's tail potent guano was yes
07:22
so strong if you chug a cockroach out it
07:24
grows the size of a person and then
07:27
you'll go away going wow do you know
07:28
what the senator senators told me yeah i
07:30
really would
07:32
i mean it was super impressive stuff
07:34
isn't it and
07:35
people
07:36
really valued it massively back in the
07:38
day so in 1850 president fillmore it was
07:42
part of his union address that he was
07:44
promising fairer prices for guano and
07:46
that was like a big deal
07:48
we don't appreciate it now as much
07:50
because it's a bit harder to get it
07:52
because all the islands where the sea
07:54
birds were pooing on they've kind of
07:56
been depleted and also we don't need it
07:57
that's the main reason really that right
07:59
it doesn't exist anymore is that we
08:00
managed to invent fertilizer around
08:02
about the turn of the century and we
08:04
turned the 20th century and so suddenly
08:05
it wasn't necessary anymore and so it
08:07
was the 19th century when this massive
08:09
rush happened right but that was when
08:12
britain and the new migrant americans
08:14
discovered it but it had been used for
08:16
many centuries before that in south
08:18
america so in the 17th century in fact
08:20
when europeans first got to america they
08:22
said that um the peruvians used it so
08:24
much that it looked like they had loads
08:27
of snow-capped mountains in the regions
08:29
because they just had huge mountains of
08:31
guana that they had stocked up that's a
08:33
very disappointing ski trip isn't it
08:38
but yeah the incas were very into it so
08:40
and the incas had a cool communist kind
08:42
of a system with guano where every town
08:45
every inca town was assigned its own
08:47
guano island and then every household in
08:50
the town was assigned its own like bit
08:52
of guano or a bit of share of that
08:54
island and that was how much you had and
08:56
it was according to how much you needed
08:57
and that meant no one could get a big
08:58
monopoly no one could come in and raid
09:00
it all and it was all working very well
09:02
all right jeremy corbyn has checked into
09:05
the podcast
09:07
but lots of lots of britain was built on
09:09
guano effectively or built on the money
09:11
from guano so there was a guano
09:13
millionaire maybe the first one a
09:14
millionaire called william gibbs and um
09:17
he was the subject of a musical song
09:19
which ran william gibbs made his dibs
09:21
selling the turds of foreign birds
09:26
there's a local link with him which is
09:27
that there's a church in exeter called
09:29
michael uh and all angels church and
09:32
that has this big memorial to william
09:34
gibbs because he was such a big noise
09:36
and funded so many churches and chapels
09:38
with the uh with the mining um keyboard
09:41
college oxford was that their chapel was
09:43
you know it's a huge thing it was
09:45
completely funded by by bird poo
09:47
basically right funny don't use this in
09:49
their pr isn't it built on bird ships
09:51
yeah yeah
09:52
well the conditions in which it was
09:54
mined were not great either and there
09:55
were lots of kind of indentured labor
09:58
where you know workers were shipped over
09:59
from china and it's pretty horrible
10:01
stuff to work on because if you don't
10:02
have a really really good mask um you'll
10:06
be inhaling kind of dust from it oh
10:08
you're covered with it yeah they don't
10:09
really bother with masks as well do they
10:11
no
10:11
yes there were no masks um coolest thing
10:14
that i think guano has given us is that
10:16
there's an island called nauru which
10:18
made
10:19
so much money from guano from the
10:21
selling of it and so on and they decided
10:23
to invest a lot of that money in a
10:26
musical called leonardo a portrait of
10:29
love the story of leonardo da vinci oh
10:32
sorry
10:33
leonardo da vinci and mona lisa and how
10:37
they had a relationship i mean it was
10:38
completely factually inaccurate and it
10:41
was pretty much a flop i think it had
10:43
like one or two shows that went well in
10:45
oxford also bring it back
10:47
yeah i'd love to see a musical yeah not
10:49
iguano i can live without ghana
10:52
what about the um the guano islands near
10:55
peru in 1865 when it was the real height
10:58
of it
10:59
spain decided they would send a
11:00
scientific mission to south america to
11:02
kind of look at this it didn't belong to
11:04
them okay but they just wanted to see
11:06
what was going on
11:07
so they sent a scientific mission of
11:09
about a dozen warships
11:13
and basically then they forced a
11:16
situation where some of their soldiers
11:18
were attacked and there was a full
11:20
all-out war um for bird wow
11:23
basically chile got involved bolivia got
11:26
involved the whole of south america
11:27
against spain they all blockaded the
11:29
spanish and eventually the spanish
11:31
disappeared with the tales between their
11:33
legs but really there was that was the
11:35
start of quite a lot of battles over
11:36
these bird islands wow what must
11:39
the birds have thought
11:40
so weird one year to go back to this
11:43
deserted island you've always shat on to
11:45
find warring nations yeah desperately
11:48
holding their hands up to your
11:50
going clean
11:52
just a morsel
11:54
oh my god bewildering it was in the u.s
11:57
civil war as well guano featured in the
12:00
american civil war it didn't change the
12:01
outcome but the confederacy had been
12:03
blockaded and so they had to mine bat
12:06
guano to make their gunpowder so they
12:08
went to they went to the bat cave uh in
12:11
order to try it
12:12
yeah that's robin's job isn't it
12:16
on the weekdays he's just scraping
12:18
batman's poo off the walls oh my god
12:20
that's how bruce wayne became a
12:21
multi-millionaire we never really
12:23

13:43
show
13:48
it is time for fact number two and that
13:52
is anna my fact this week is that
13:54
scientists have made a tv for fish but
13:57
if humans want to watch it they have to
13:59
wear sunscreen
14:00
bizarre
14:04
yeah good point yeah just hovering above
14:06
the sea um no this is a scientist at the
14:08
university of queensland and they
14:12
wanted to know about like the visual
14:13
capabilities of fish they started with
14:15
clown fish often very good for
14:17
experimenting on and they were looking
14:20
at what they can see in the uv spectrum
14:22
so fish can see in the uv spectrum where
14:24
we can't and so they developed a screen
14:26
display that just includes the violet
14:29
and the ultraviolet spectrum
14:31
and they had the fish kind of peck at
14:34
target so they have targets in certain
14:36
uv wavelengths on it and they'd reward
14:38
fish if they pecked at certain ones to
14:40
see if they could see and distinguish
14:42
between the different uv wavelengths and
14:44
they could but the thing is of course is
14:45
giving off lots of uv radiation and what
14:48
do we know about that it's bad for us so
14:50
you've got to wear factor 50 and
14:51
sunglasses
14:53
and also i don't think it's very good
14:54
programs
14:56
no if it's just like uv light and you're
14:58
just pecking on it all the time yeah
15:00
yeah um but yeah they can all see uh in
15:02
fact loads of animals can see things
15:04
that we can't i really like the idea
15:06
that they're all
15:07
seeing completely different stuff like a
15:09
rainbow never thought about it that's
15:11
not just red to violet right that goes
15:13
to infrared in one direction so if you
15:15
can see an infrared spectrum then you'll
15:17
be able to see all the colors that we
15:19
can't
15:19
and then the other side like if you're a
15:21
bird looking at a rainbow so all birds
15:23
can see uv you'll see loads more colors
15:25
i guess beyond violet wow do they see
15:28
did they do we know if they see rainbows
15:30
as in yes yeah they must do right but
15:32
they're but their eyes but their eyes
15:33
are on different sides of the head often
15:34
if they're prey animals if you're
15:36
looking at a rainbow and you close one
15:37
of your eyes does it disappear i've
15:39
never tried and i'm not i'm not i'm not
15:41
gonna follow this line of inquiry any
15:43
further you put me off it
15:45
um fish aren't the only animals that uh
15:47
tv's been created for
15:48
there is well there's dog tv um which is
15:51
a channel okay which is uh
15:53
actually tv shows made for dogs and i
15:56
spent a lot of time on their website
15:57
today and um what did they watch um it's
16:01
a it's a range of shows to inform
16:03
educate and entertain it's very
16:04
wreathing
16:05
it would be like eastenders but all the
16:07
characters are dogs
16:09
do they watch animal-based tv well great
16:11
british bake off but all the contestants
16:13
are dogs yeah no i get where you're
16:15
going with it james well like it could
16:17
be like the football match but all the
16:18
footballers are dogs i think
16:21
i think it's not exactly that i think it
16:22
could be cruft but all the contestants
16:24
are humans
16:28
it's um i think sometimes there's a
16:29
squirrel on the screen but um that kind
16:31
of thing but it's mostly it's to sort of
16:33
it's to entertain your dog when you're
16:35
not around but the faq section of the
16:36
website is unbelievable because it costs
16:38
about the same as netflix but it's just
16:40
for your dog um
16:41
so one of the questions the faq is it's
16:43
called petflix
16:45
brilliant it should be um it's called
16:47
dog tv
16:48
i think probably due to a legal issue in
16:50
that place
16:51
but one of the epic uses it seems like
16:53
my dog is not watching this and i've
16:55
paid for it um and the answer is well
16:57
you have to understand dogs don't watch
16:58
tv the same way that humans do
17:00
um it won't happen dogs you know some of
17:03
them like the visuals some just lie
17:04
there and feel calmed by the relaxing
17:06
music either of those methods is great
17:08
and when you're there with the dog he
17:09
will always be more interested in you
17:11
than the tv screen so that's basically
17:14
right you're never going to see your dog
17:16
relax to this channel if you're in the
17:18
room it can only relax when you're awake
17:20
one really interesting thing about dogs
17:21
with tv is that until probably i'm going
17:24
to say about 10 years ago they would not
17:26
have enjoyed watching normal tv any kind
17:28
of tv and that's because the number of
17:30
frames per second and the speed in which
17:33
they see those frames it would kind of
17:35
look like a slideshow to them
17:37
if you know what i mean
17:38
i mean we did a slideshow in our first
17:39
half today and i think everyone enjoyed
17:41
it so you don't necessarily not enjoy
17:43
something because it's a slideshow yep
17:45
fair enough but they wouldn't get all of
17:47
the nuances that we would get from
17:48
watching breaking bad for instance sure
17:51
but like um they need about 70 images
17:53
per second in order for it to look as if
17:55
it's a continuous movement and these
17:58
days your tv does have that but until
18:01
around 10 20 years ago it didn't look
18:03
like that so recently they'll have been
18:05
looking at this box in the middle of the
18:06
house that kind of just flashes these
18:09
pictures and then suddenly it was like a
18:11
proper tv
18:12
channel that's pretty cool you remember
18:14
the day don't you where all dogs changed
18:16
overnight they all seemed so much
18:17
happier
18:18
but it also means that they wouldn't
18:20
want to go to the cinema because all
18:21
cinemas have still got the same old
18:23
frame rate because people prefer it okay
18:25
that's interesting they do i think they
18:27
should um make this dog tv for humans it
18:29
shows dog surfing it is you're right it
18:31
is pretty much all dogs because they've
18:33
done experiments and it turns out all
18:34
dogs want to watch self-involved as they
18:36
are is other dogs sounds like baywatch
18:38
but all the characters are dogs
18:40
that's what it is i i'd watch a show of
18:43
dog surfing for 10 minutes i reckon yeah
18:46
yeah i think that's a good point god i
18:48
read the craziest thing about the tv
18:50
show skippy today this is just this
18:53
we're talking about animals on tv it's
18:55
quite disgusting so i'm very sorry if
18:56
i'm gonna ruin any skippy lovers here
18:59
but um skippy on screen always used to
19:01
have the ability to open up doors and
19:03
stuff like that so this is like a
19:04
kangaroo right excuse me the bush
19:06
kangaroo oh my god yeah what am i doing
19:07
i'm talking about a show that's been on
19:09
tv for 50 years let's move on to our
19:10
next no no no no
19:13
it's a good point
19:16
kangaroo it's like glassy but he's a
19:17
kangaroo but he's kangaroo yeah yeah
19:19
what's that skippy kind of thing and so
19:21
skippy would be on screen as the
19:23
kangaroo but he was a really grumpy
19:25
kangaroo and he would never probably
19:26
enjoy it and so when he had to do things
19:28
like opening the door he couldn't really
19:29
do that so what they did was they had
19:31
kangaroo hands that were from i think a
19:34
dead kangaroo with sticks on them my god
19:37
so when you see skippy opening doors
19:39
they would lean in with the stick and
19:41
just have a count it's horrible
19:43
isn't it god that is i don't know why i
19:46
told you guys i sort of pulled this i
19:47
thought you were going to say he opened
19:49
it with his pouch or something cute like
19:50
that
19:52
bluetooth birds they get tv as well in
19:54
one experiment that they did and um they
19:57
worked out that blue tits make better
19:59
dinner choices at a buffet after
20:01
watching tv footage of other birds
20:03
making bad decisions what are you
20:06
talking about what is a bad dinner
20:08
decision
20:09
a bad dinner decision might be something
20:11
that is dead that has just a foul taste
20:14
to it that you might not have eaten as a
20:16
blue tip but if presented to you in a
20:17
package you might go for it and so they
20:19
would see these blue tits eating um this
20:22
food and then going blah blah and
20:24
spitting it out and then later when they
20:26
then presented them with that food and
20:28
other options
20:29
in most cases they would avoid the one
20:31
that they saw on tv it was a bad
20:33
reaction yeah so tv can teach it's very
20:36
wreathing very clever
20:38
and pigs can play video games can they
20:40
yeah properly now they used to play them
20:44
but like with touch screen well they
20:45
used to play
20:46
pong and now they're playing fortnite is
20:48
what you're
20:49
implying yeah i think it is actually
20:51
still pong but they're using a joystick
20:54
this is leaps and bounds for pig world
20:56
um this is this year uh scientists have
20:59
put pigs in front of a video game and
21:00
they've given them a joystick to operate
21:02
with their snout which is harder than
21:05
with a hand and they realize that they
21:08
connect what they're doing on the
21:08
joystick to what's happening on the
21:10
screen and then they connect what's
21:12
happening on the screen to rewards that
21:13
they get and so you know they can chase
21:15
the right thing and catch it knowing
21:17
that they'll get a reward just using
21:18
this joystick thing
21:20
that's clever very very cool yeah i
21:23
think the thing with pigs is like
21:25
they're quite intelligent and you need
21:27
to give them stuff to play with don't
21:28
you i think even by law you need to give
21:30
them stuff to play with so it doesn't
21:32
have to be a ps5 it can just be a ball
21:34
but
21:35
um
21:36
uv light this fact is about these um
21:39
these fish that can see uv light um
21:41
there was a thing so there's a there's a
21:43
condition where some people can see
21:45
ultraviolet light which is
21:47
uh very strange it's a condition called
21:49
aphakia and it's where you don't have a
21:52
lens in your eye so the lens has been
21:54
removed for whatever reason that is um
21:56
and it means that you can sometimes see
21:59
ultraviolet light but this actually
22:02
there's a rumor and it's not completely
22:04
confirmed that this was used in the
22:05
second world war uh which is bizarre
22:08
it's that
22:09
uh military intelligence recruited
22:11
people who had this condition of fakia
22:12
to watch the coastline for german
22:15
u-boats signaling to spies on the shore
22:17
with uv lamps now i don't think it's
22:20
true but it's i love the idea of it but
22:22
i don't yeah here's a true thing you can
22:24
buy ultraviolet trousers
22:26
these are really cool i want to get
22:28
these so um ultraviolet will glow in a
22:30
black light right so if you go to a club
22:33
and you have a gin and tonic uh it'll be
22:35
glow slightly because it's under the uv
22:37
light okay um these trousers will look
22:39
like normal trousers when you're walking
22:41
down the street no one will notice and
22:43
as soon as you walk into a club
22:45
party in your pants wow they're glowing
22:48
in all sorts of different colors wow
22:50
that's amazing i hope you don't say that
22:52
sentence when you walk into a club
22:54
party in my pants
22:56
[Laughter]
22:58
um we're gonna have to move on guys to
22:59
our next fact oh can i just one piece of
23:02
a technology created for animals yeah
23:04
that i liked is
23:05
chickens uh we also like to look out for
23:08
well some farmers like to look out for
23:09
their chickens welfare and chickens
23:11
apparently like physical contact with
23:13
their farmers when they know them so
23:14
they'll hold them and they'll stroke
23:16
them when you've got lots then you can't
23:18
do that every single day and so they've
23:20
developed a chicken jacket and chickens
23:23
wear it and it allows humans to give the
23:26
chicken a virtual hug even though
23:28
they're not present so a farmer will
23:30
stroke a chicken model in his sitting
23:32
room and then the chickens wearing the
23:34
jacket will feel the farmer stroking can
23:37
you do it for a thousand chickens at the
23:39
same time so they're all wearing the
23:40
jacket and they all go ah
23:43
i guess that would work right yeah but
23:45
then they look at each other and like
23:46
what he's doing to you as well
23:51
um we do need to move on to our next
23:53
fact it is time for fact number three
23:55
and that is my fact my fact this week is
23:58
just like how we have ice cream truck
24:00
music in the uk
24:02
in taiwan they have garbage truck music
24:06
how cool is that so this i mean this was
24:08
a gym
24:10
they must be different tunes it's still
24:11
green sleeves that's the amazing thing
24:14
no but it's it's um it's beethoven it's
24:16
uh
24:25
okay after three one two three
24:28
[Music]
24:34
yeah so this was this was a genius
24:35
concept from taiwan taiwan was an
24:38
incredibly garbage ridden place it was
24:41
just steaming with it it was called
24:43
garbage island everyone knew it was that
24:45
and they needed to do something and they
24:47
worked out that in and this was in 1997
24:50
they started a thing called the trash
24:51
off the ground movement and basically
24:53
like an ice cream truck coming out and
24:55
everyone running out to get an ice cream
24:57
kids running out in taiwan they
24:58
abandoned the idea of you stocking up
25:00
your garbage and then putting it out on
25:02
one single day these trucks would go
25:05
around four or five times a night and
25:06
they would have their song playing and
25:08
you would run outside and you would
25:09
throw your garbage directly into the
25:11
truck and it became a social event most
25:14
people who've reported about it said
25:16
this is the time that i got to properly
25:17
meet my neighbors as we were out there
25:19
excitedly holding our trash can bags and
25:22
chucking them in and and as a result the
25:24
the pollution problem in taiwan has gone
25:27
extraordinarily down i mean it's a model
25:29
for how countries really should be
25:31
operating for recycling and garbage uh
25:34
oh i'd love to see them attempt that in
25:35
britain or america no one would do it
25:38
they'd be right immediately there's no
25:40
way i would do it another bottle of wine
25:41
another bottle of wine
25:44
you've got to adapt your laws to the
25:46
people in your country it doesn't work
25:48
extremely well there yeah you said it
25:50
was 1980 1998
25:54
before that even in 1987
25:56
there was a group of 10 taiwanese women
25:58
and they started something called the
26:00
homemakers united foundation
26:02
and they were kind of the first group of
26:04
people who really wanted to make a
26:06
difference in taiwan and they were
26:08
responsible for the yellow trash trucks
26:10
which kind of started going around
26:12
taiwan around that time yeah and now if
26:14
you go to a tube station or something or
26:17
a metro station in taiwan you'll see
26:20
these old ladies just kind of picking up
26:21
trash and putting it in the bin it's
26:23
really good let's hope they never get
26:25
ice cream trucks otherwise they'll
26:27
realize what fun is really like
26:30
but they do crazy things as well like
26:31
there's public shaming so if someone
26:33
hasn't done it probably or tries to
26:35
cheat the system um they
26:37
they film them the cctv footage and that
26:40
gets circulated in their area but they
26:42
blur their faces because of but everyone
26:44
will know exactly
26:45
i saw you in that shirt that's dan's
26:47
shirt yeah exactly
26:49
yeah well because they have quite
26:50
convoluted recycling policies don't they
26:52
which again they demand obedience so the
26:55
recycling truck i think follows
26:56
basically behind the garbage truck and
26:58
you're obviously incentivized i think
27:00
like we often are here to recycle rather
27:02
than throw rubbish away so it costs less
27:04
you know it's free for the bin bags and
27:05
stuff like that but there are 13
27:07
different types of recycling bin and you
27:10
have to sort your recyclables into all
27:12
those 13 different types and if you fail
27:15
to sort them you get fined 200. i can
27:17
only think of red wine white wine and
27:19
rose
27:21
your champagne oh yeah but they sing a
27:23
different song they have a song called
27:26
any empty wine bottles for sale blasting
27:29
out from them which sounds fun and is an
27:31
incredibly sad song
27:33
from a film called papa can you hear me
27:35
sing
27:36
but i recommend looking it up it's quite
27:38
nice but fur elise was apparently chosen
27:40
because the head of the environmental
27:42
protection agency his daughter at the
27:44
time was playing constantly on her piano
27:48
you think he would want a break from the
27:50
song if his daughter was learning it on
27:52
the piano or maybe she was so bad it was
27:54
like this is what it's supposed to sound
27:55
like yeah even the bin truck can play
27:58
this better than you but you know it
28:00
happens so much this music around town
28:02
and it actually pisses off a lot of
28:03
people as well like they because there's
28:05
now an app that you can get where you
28:07
can see where the trucks are gonna be
28:08
and so some people try to work out where
28:10
they can move where it happens less
28:12
because between six and eight pm
28:14
sometimes four or five times you've got
28:16
beethoven just playing in the streets
28:18
and you're like oh my god it's just so
28:19
annoying yeah and there was this one guy
28:21
who wrote a blog who said he was out in
28:22
the countryside and suddenly he's
28:24
hearing the song play and he's like oh
28:27
my god i can't get away from this song
28:28
and then he realized there were no
28:30
trucks there and he thought what is
28:31
going on and he investigated it and it
28:33
turned out that the local birds
28:36
started mimicking yeah
28:38
and so people started throwing garbage
28:40
at them
28:41
so he went out to investigate and he's
28:43
got this whole blog where he's trying to
28:44
prove that there's a species of bird out
28:46
there that is currently mimicking
28:49
beethoven imagine when beethoven wrote
28:51
that song
28:52
could he ever have thought that it would
28:53
translate then into a garbage truck song
28:55
that then got picked up by a species of
28:57
bird that would just fly around saying i
28:59
think you'd have to explain a load of
29:00
concepts
29:02
[Laughter]
29:04
just on bins oh yeah the dumpster
29:07
was invented by a man called dempster
29:12
he named it after himself but he got it
29:14
wrong no he just named it slightly
29:16
differently but he was an incredible guy
29:18
he was called george dempster he was the
29:20
mayor of a place in the usa called
29:21
knoxville and uh he was
29:24
you know an interesting man he used to
29:26
work on the panama canal when he was a
29:27
young man and later in life he created
29:29
the dempster dumpster and it was the
29:31
first ever waste container that could be
29:32
emptied onto a truck so this was a huge
29:34
adv you know it's a leap forward in
29:36
taking rubbish away um yeah
29:39
dump obviously meant still to dump
29:41
something didn't it so that it was a fun
29:43
pun for him yeah he didn't change it for
29:44
no reason he didn't invent the word dumb
29:46
no no but he did he did create the dumb
29:48
stir i read about this guy dumb dumpster
29:51
and he was um the mayor of knoxville
29:54
and he got into a feud with the editor
29:56
of the knoxville journal the editor of
29:59
the journal criticized him and then
30:01
dempster decided that he would get the
30:03
town police to follow the editor around
30:05
towing his car at every opportunity wow
30:08
and then in retaliation the guy from the
30:10
newspaper uh cropped him out of every
30:12
single newspaper picture
30:15
it was absolutely amazing and then
30:17
dempster organized a police raid that
30:19
caught the journalist with a large
30:21
supply of illegal whiskey wow isn't that
30:23
amazing this feels like abusive power in
30:26
a lot of ways by both of them
30:29
but then the knoxville news
30:32
last year claimed 2020 as its own for
30:35
knoxville and they said that 2020 was a
30:38
complete dumpster fire so since we
30:40
invented the dumpster we now own this
30:42
yeah yeah
30:44
you can have it guys um do you guys know
30:45
what the french for bin is french for
30:47
bin
30:48
yeah do you know why it's called poo
30:51
bell because it's got poo in it no it
30:53
kind of not that it's named after
30:54
someone called mr poo bell no so many
30:57
bins are just named after people who
30:59
invented the bins yeah it's weird so
31:01
many people want to put their name to it
31:02
you just thought of all the things you
31:03
want your name stamped on i actually
31:05
don't know if it was him who did the
31:06
dubbing on this occasion because he was
31:08
the police chief of paris eugene renee
31:11
poubel and he ordered that everyone had
31:13
to have a rubbish receptacle outside
31:15
their doors in the 1880s and they got
31:17
called poo bells and that's where the
31:19
frenchwood bin comes from wow that's so
31:21
cool
31:22
yeah um just on um on words then suzy
31:26
dent wrote this amazing book where she
31:28
showed the slang language that
31:30
that exists within every different
31:32
culture so you know butchers will have
31:34
slang terms that they use that they'll
31:36
all understand police officers and
31:37
garbage bin uh workers also have that
31:40
same thing they have words that they
31:42
know so i was reading about in america
31:44
coney island whitefish in new york what
31:47
would that be do you think coney island
31:49
whitefish okay so coney island there was
31:51
a big sort of fun fair there yeah so
31:53
lots of flavor you won't get it from
31:55
that really um it's it's used condoms is
31:58
what they would call the coney island
32:00
white fish uh disco rice okay so discos
32:03
are fun places where people wear really
32:05
cool trousers
32:07
yeah there's parties in your pants um
32:09
disco rice maggots
32:11
oh
32:19
this one's quite literal someone throws
32:21
rubbish at your head from new york they
32:22
would throw it from the windows into the
32:24
garbage truck in the open
32:26
and so on yeah that's cool yeah
32:28
great i love i love those kind of slang
32:30
cultures do you know we have a rubbish
32:32
bin called dame foodie dench
32:36
a food bin in this country in bracknell
32:39
forest council called it it's like
32:41
officially called it uh yeah a rubbish
32:43
truck sorry i should say um
32:45
so and but not only this this is in
32:47
berkshire and there are a bunch of
32:50
trucks uh the fleet of trucks they have
32:51
they're called truck norris binderella
32:54
and then for some reason just hank
32:56
marvin which i spent a long time looking
32:58
at thinking am i missing something what
33:00
is that though because like that's slang
33:02
for being starving so maybe because it
33:03
eats the garbage oh that's good
33:06
that's a very compelling theory all
33:07
right i'll accept that but dame foodie
33:09
dench uh received a video message from
33:12
dame judi dench thanking it for the
33:14
honor she said she'd never been called
33:16
foodie dench before which is sort of
33:18
like you're not being called foodie
33:19
dench now you've missed the point
33:21
but she'd never been called foodie dench
33:23
before and she was very proud of the
33:25
accolade i've got some from thorac
33:27
council they got their school children
33:29
to name their lorries uh one of them is
33:31

35:26
on with the show on with the show
35:31
[Music]
35:33
it is time for a final fact and that is
35:36
andy my fact is that in 1956 the bbc
35:39
broadcast a magic show which involved a
35:41
woman being sawn in half unfortunately
35:43
the show ran out of time and it ended
35:45
before she was put back together and the
35:46
bbc was then inundated with complaints
35:49
from people who thought they had just
35:50
witnessed a murder
35:53
what a way to commit a murder it was
35:55
exactly prime time television it was
35:58
this was so weird it was on panorama
35:59
which feels like it must have been a
36:00
very different show back in the day um
36:03
this was a magician called pc saucer who
36:05
was an indian magician who's born in
36:07
bengal and um
36:09
he he was over it was one of his first
36:11
big international gigs he he so he saw
36:14
his assistant in half she was called
36:15
dipty day and then uh but the show was
36:18
running really short of time and it was
36:20
all it was all live so they just ran out
36:23
of time and he was he was sort of
36:25
standing over her saying oh dear what's
36:26
going on here and then the show was just
36:29
completely out of time so richard
36:31
dimbleby who was hosting stepped forward
36:33
and said well that's all we've got time
36:35
for so now it's time for the news the
36:37
phone lines went crazy at the bbc the
36:38
bbc has set up a special phone operator
36:41
to divert calls to but with just this
36:43
poor operator having to say no she is
36:45
fine no she is fine um
36:48
but of course the theory is that uh pc
36:50
source i knew exactly what he was doing
36:52
and he would never have mistimed his
36:54
trick so badly yeah and it was a
36:56
publicity thing for him but what's
36:57
amazing is so
36:58
1956 right so all the newspapers the
37:01
next day where you know girl cut in half
37:03
shock it was all it was all probably you
37:05
know it was a confusion whether or not
37:06
this happened he was doing a run at the
37:08
duke of york theater and as a result of
37:11
this stunt he sold it out completely
37:14
as if people just needed the answer like
37:16
was she going to be there was definitely
37:18
a publicity
37:19
like you say the newspapers if you look
37:21
at the british newspaper archives you
37:23
can see always like woman cut in half
37:24
and whatever but if you go to the stage
37:27
newspaper which was a newspaper for
37:28
magicians their headline was sorsa is
37:31
publicity magician and it was all about
37:33
how he was a publicist and how he'd done
37:35
this before yeah he was great at that
37:37
wasn't he self-promotion
37:39
even from the start of his career where
37:42
he started out in bengal he
37:44
called himself the world's greatest
37:46
magician immediately before even really
37:48
starting his career and shortened it
37:50
bizarrely to tw's gm the world's
37:54
greatest magician which feels like a
37:55
really complicated weird non-acronym
37:58
it's weird to do an acronym where there
37:59
had to be an apostrophe s in it like
38:02
that and he did call himself that he was
38:03
mtw's gm
38:05
yeah of course he then came over to
38:07
europe and everyone's like well you're
38:08
not the greatest magician
38:10
but his idea was well
38:12
india is the home of magic and i'm the
38:15
best magician in india so therefore it's
38:17
fine that i call myself the world's
38:19
greatest magician but basically all the
38:22
other magicians really didn't like him
38:23
very much and they started like writing
38:26
pieces and newspapers about how bad he
38:27
was and there was one where they called
38:29
him a pakistani illusionist this was a
38:32
time when india and pakistan have been
38:33
at quite a lot of war in the previous
38:35
few years and he felt like everyone was
38:37
against him
38:38
someone who didn't like him was
38:40
schreiber helmut schreiber
38:42
don't know if he's a relation
38:44
[Music]
38:50
he was the one who i think turned people
38:53
onto um this this magician piece pc
38:56
saucer because people didn't like him
38:58
but then hitler's favorite magician came
39:00
along in 1955.
39:02
it feels a bit late it feels a bit late
39:03
to be trading on the hitler's favorite
39:04
magician label there at that point i
39:06
think maybe he was trying to abandon the
39:07
label at that point but these things
39:09
stick don't they um so
39:12
yeah people knew was as a favorite they
39:13
were mostly toured in argentina didn't
39:15
hear that stage yeah it was very
39:16
successful he was very good at making
39:18
former senior nazis disappear
39:19
[Laughter]
39:21
he he performed in front of hitler um he
39:24
once conjured 150 reichsmarks into
39:27
hitler's jacket
39:29
he made eva braun's diamond-studded
39:31
platinum watch disappear and then come
39:33
back but he was after the war he was the
39:36
first german entertainer to get
39:37
permission to perform abroad
39:40
and they said well you were part of the
39:42
nazi party weren't you and he's like no
39:44
i don't know what you're talking about
39:46
and some people said that he was the
39:47
houdini of coming to terms with the past
39:50
yeah right
39:52
and there were rumors that he'd taken a
39:54
lot of the kind of nazi gold
39:57
and so when he died his widow kind of
40:00
went back sort of desperately trying to
40:01
find where all the money was and all she
40:04
found was seven keys to seven different
40:06
safes
40:07
but didn't find the safes
40:10
oh she found the keys yeah
40:11
how does she know they were safe so they
40:13
have little labels on them saying say
40:15
yeah
40:16
but to be fair i'd have just bought
40:17
seven keys for a laugh and labelled them
40:20
full of gold number one
40:22
i'm gonna do that i'm gonna do that well
40:24
that's the houdini of coming to terms
40:26
with the past i'm sorry i'm really
40:27
struggling with this
40:29
who manages to escape from the past
40:31
exactly so he kind of he he was part of
40:34
the nazi regime but he managed to
40:36
convince people that he wasn't so he
40:38
escaped from his dark past
40:40
look at this cv of mine i'm going to
40:41
make it completely disappear
40:43
okay like that yeah it sort of works
40:46
um do you know that jonathan creek was
40:47
based on a real person
40:49
alan davis no sorry no
40:53
no jonathan creek was played by a real
40:54
person alan davis you're absolutely
40:56
right oh that's how tv works i'm afraid
40:57
so you should get on this tv for dogs
40:59
thing you'd love it
41:01
no he was a magician called ali bongo
41:04
and uh that was him yeah did he say this
41:07
he is famous yeah david renick um the
41:10
writer of jonathan creek said he was
41:12
based on ali bongo um this guy pc what
41:14
was he called
41:16
um one thing about him is that he had a
41:19
rival called gogia pasha who was another
41:22
indian magician they were real proper
41:24
rivals and there was a lot of argument
41:25
that maybe saucer had stolen some of his
41:28
tricks uh and there was another magician
41:30
called k lal and he told the author lee
41:34
cycle when he was writing about
41:35
magicians that sauce had once bribed a
41:38
member of his crew 10 000 rupees to
41:40
sabotage a sawing in lady and half magic
41:43
trick that's a risky one to sabotage
41:45
isn't it i would just sabotage the
41:47
rabbit in the hat
41:49
and yeah basically what he did is he
41:51
bribed this guy a load of money to make
41:53
this trick fail and at the last minute
41:56
this guy pasha realized what had
41:58
happened and so he ran over and he put
42:00
his finger in a little hole in the trick
42:03
and managed to stop the blade from sort
42:05
of going towards her wait did he lose
42:07
the finger uh he didn't but he was badly
42:10
wounded he was like what a hero cut to
42:12
the bone they said yeah oh my word so
42:15
that's one of the reasons why people
42:16
didn't like him so much yeah i mean
42:18
that's quite a good reason isn't it fair
42:19
enough wow
42:21
david copperfield saw himself in half
42:22
once
42:24
i think that was really impressive yeah
42:25
did he put himself back together uh yeah
42:28
wow
42:29
yeah how do you do that though he was i
42:31
think it's so i think it's quite a
42:33
famous one he's tied to a table isn't it
42:34
and it's just like goldfinger where
42:35
there's something you know it's amazing
42:37
coming down towards him and he doesn't
42:39
get away in time and that's the you
42:41
think you're watching a trick where he
42:42
he's going to show you and escape but
42:44
you don't and he gets all in here and i
42:46
think it's very bloody no it's not at
42:48
all and i think the black but it's a
42:50
version of the sawing someone in half
42:52
trick where it's meant to look like it's
42:54
a mistake so
42:56
so david copperfield as it's happening
42:58
the box is up and this huge as andy says
43:01
this incredible drill which i believe
43:03
was owned by orson welles who was trying
43:04
to get into magic so it was he bought
43:07
orson welles's yes citizen kane's orson
43:09
welles he bought this big thing off the
43:12
estate or maybe even personally from him
43:14
so it comes down and as it's coming down
43:16
the the box that he's in flips open so
43:19
you can see him laying there and it goes
43:20
through him and that's meant to be the
43:22
big it's meant to be the sawing trick
43:24
that goes wrong i just remembered
43:26
actually on q i in series h we chopped
43:29
daniel radcliffe's head off do you
43:30
remember yeah yeah and i had to do that
43:32
in the rehearsal had to pretend to be
43:33
daniel radcliffe having his head chopped
43:35
off and there was a massive argument
43:37
afterwards about whether we would
43:39
show afterwards that he was fine or
43:40
whether we would just say i'm sorry guys
43:43
we're going to have to stop the trip i
43:44
should have said oh we've run out of
43:45
time on the show yeah
43:47
that would have got the publicity in
43:49
yeah david copperfield there's a story i
43:50
read about him which was he was walking
43:52
after a show with a couple of his
43:54
assistants from the show and they all
43:56
got mugged in the street and the mugger
43:58
went give me all the stuff that you have
43:59
you know give me your wallet give me a
44:01
and so
44:02
yeah so the so the two assistants took
44:04
out their wallets and their their
44:06
airplane tickets and their passports and
44:07
gave it david copperfield who also had
44:10
his phone his wallet and his uh airplane
44:12
tickets on him
44:14
went into his pockets and then did a
44:16
trick where it looked like he had
44:18
nothing so he was like i don't have
44:20
anything on me and the guy was like okay
44:23
that's fine and went away
44:25
he risked this guy's worth over 800
44:27
million dollars
44:30
if he pulled out a load of flags and
44:32
then
44:34
maybe a few dogs that would have been so
44:36
good
44:37
you've got to use it i'm sorry if you've
44:39
been training to do you've been training
44:40
for that moment your whole life if you
44:42
don't then whip out the tricks then when
44:44
are you going to do it oh like carry a
44:46
saw on you and chop the guy's head like
44:48
do
44:48
something that's actually gonna save
44:50
your life what happened to me in
44:51
nuremberg that time when we were on tour
44:53
i don't know if i said it so we were on
44:55
tour and i was i was dressed in like a
44:57
yellow and black suit and andy said that
45:00
i look like a magician which in fairness
45:02
i did look a bit like a magician so we
45:04
decided to put some magic tricks on and
45:05
i had this kind of cane that's just
45:07
appeared from nowhere and i had like the
45:10
kind of the
45:11
handkerchiefs that would come out anyway
45:13
we finished the last tour of the gig and
45:15
then i had to go to nuremberg to see my
45:17
in-laws the next day and i didn't have i
45:20
couldn't put stuff in the hole so it was
45:21
all hand luggage and so i had all of my
45:23
tricks with me in my bag and this like
45:26
cane that appeared from nowhere just
45:28
looked like a bomb basically and so we
45:30
went through the airport and they were
45:31
like what's this what's this these
45:33
german guys and i'm like oh oh it's
45:35
magic it's magic it's magic and they
45:37
went what i said it's magic it's magic i
45:39
said let me show you let me show you and
45:41
so then i did a load of magic tricks in
45:43
front of them in security uh and they
45:45
were like oh okay okay and i was just
45:47
about to go there no no stop stop stop
45:49

45:51

45:53

45:55

45:57
may be doing magic tricks in front of
45:59
the mall
46:00
[Music]
46:01
just a winding place to be questioned
46:03
nuremberg isn't it
46:06
just while we're on tour stories on our
46:08
previous tour we had a guy who was our
46:10
own manager called daniel and he lives
46:12
in wales and just on on mugging he was
46:14
walking home one night in wales and he
46:16
was going under a bridge and a guy
46:18
walked up behind him and tried to mug
46:20
him so he went oi
46:22
and daniel turned around and daniel's a
46:25
really big guy and he's he's from
46:27
america and he's quite an intimidating
46:29
character if you didn't see the front of
46:31
him so he turns around and this guy's
46:34
holding a knife at him but he looks at
46:36
daniel and sees the size of him and the
46:38
look of him and goes
46:40
wanna buy a knife
46:45
and daniel wait
46:46
yeah it looks good and he bought it off
46:48
him no yeah for 20 quid
46:52
and he has that knife he brought it on
46:54
all of our tours it's what he uses to
46:55
