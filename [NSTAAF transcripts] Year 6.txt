on with the show on with the podcast
01:13
[Music]
01:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:22
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:24
this week coming to you from upcom
01:31
my name is dan schreiber and i am
01:33
sitting here with
01:34
anna chazinski andrew hunts and murray
01:37
and james harkin
01:38
and once again we have gathered around
01:40
the microphones with our four
01:41
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:44
and in no particular order
01:45
here we go starting with you
01:48
james okay my fact this week is that
01:51
there is a man in nepal who can lick his
01:53
own forehead
01:54
[Laughter]
01:57
and the reason i'm laughing to myself is
01:59
because i know what he looks like
02:02
so if you're at home listening to this
02:04
uh then do google it and if you're in
02:06
ofcom
02:07
sat in front of us then here's what he
02:09
looks like
02:15
we we told you at home it was worth
02:16
googling
02:17
[Laughter]
02:20
so it's amazing what's so bizarre about
02:22
him is that when you're here you can
02:23
look his own full
02:24
head you immediately think oh my god he
02:25
makes his tongue really long and little
02:27
do you know he makes his face
02:28
really tiny yes well it's a little bit
02:32
of both because he does have a really
02:33
long tongue you can sometimes see
02:34
pictures where he sticks out it's really
02:36
really long
02:37
he's basically he's a 35 year old bus
02:39
driver from urlabari in nepal
02:41
and he says that he tries not to do this
02:43
too often because he scares the children
02:46
yeah well he says he's not been allowed
02:48
to do it at work when he's on the bus he
02:50
says the a the children get scared and
02:52
then with
02:52
uh he talks about adults he says even
02:54
adults can lose consciousness
02:57
when they watch me in action oh
03:00
but can you guys lick your nose with
03:02
your tongue no
03:04
it's quite rare isn't it that oh wow
03:07
wow again at home just google
03:11
pictures of people licking the clothes
03:13
with their tongue then you'll see what
03:14
that is
03:15
um i didn't realize it had a name so
03:16
percent of people can do it including me
03:19
um it's called the gaulin
03:22
sign didn't know i had a medical term
03:24
have you ever tried doing the um the
03:26
full forehead
03:28
i think i have to work up to that it's
03:31
really interesting though because it it
03:33
so this is this guy is kind of gurning
03:36
yeah we're saying it's you know gurning
03:37
the sport where you scrunch your face
03:38
into an amazing
03:39
shape and you surprise people and win
03:41
awards you know learning the sport
03:43
gunning yeah the olympics
03:46
yeah um so at the british
03:50
and world obviously earning
03:51
championships because nowhere else does
03:53
it
03:53
um makeup is banned but manipulation of
03:56
false teeth if you have them is
03:58
permitted
04:00
and it really helps if you don't have
04:01
many teeth so this guy
04:03
uh in nepal has only one tooth i believe
04:06
oh how's he okay yeah yeah okay yeah and
04:09
there's a
04:09
gurning world champion called peter
04:11
jackman not to be confused with peter
04:14
jackson
04:14
um who he's won the championships four
04:16
times and he had all of his teeth
04:18
removed
04:19
so that he could improve his technique
04:21
yeah really
04:22
yeah there's an organizer that said age
04:24
definitely helps in the competition
04:26
because your skin is much looser when
04:28
you um when you
04:30
age it allows you to manipulate and
04:32
crease up in ways so you have an
04:33
advantage if you're older
04:35
and i should say this world championship
04:37
or british championship
04:38
for the whole world but only british
04:39
people take part um
04:42
and in fact only people from cumbria
04:44
take that
04:46
even the people of devon looked down on
04:48
them
04:51
you know in 2014 the two runners-up were
04:53
both swedish
04:56
but it takes place in the egremont crab
04:59
fair
04:59
and they say it's been happening since
05:02
1267.
05:04
uh the fair it seems might have been
05:05
happening since then on and off because
05:07
um we know that king henry the third
05:09
granted a royal charter for affair
05:11
we think probably the gurning hasn't
05:13
taken part for all that time although
05:15
there is a newspaper article in 1852
05:17
that says it's an ancient practice
05:20
so it has definitely been going on for a
05:21
long time
05:23
yeah i was reading an obituary of a guy
05:26
called lenny wells this is in a picture
05:27
in the guardian and he died in the year
05:29
2000
05:30
and he was known for guerning in various
05:32
tv adverts he was very good at girling
05:34
it said although he was also a keen
05:36
rugby fan and devoted
05:38
family man it is for the unique
05:40
rubberiness of his lips and cheeks that
05:42
he will be most fondly remembered
05:44
and there was one uh there was
05:47
then they were interviewed people who'd
05:49
taken part in contests with him and one
05:51
of the guys said
05:52
uh this one time gordon blacklock
05:54
another competitor i'm sure you've heard
05:55
of
05:56
another gurner gordon blacklock was a
05:58
head-on point but then lenny stepped up
06:00
and pulled a face like a rhino's anus
06:14
[Laughter]
06:15
love to hear the commentators i'd like a
06:18
ladies coming up the back
06:23
i think the greatest champion of all
06:25
time is anne woods who has won the
06:27
woman's gunning title
06:28
28 times that's 28 years of gurning
06:32
she missed one crab fair when she uh
06:35
was expecting a baby and probably
06:38
pulling a lot of faces then as well
06:39
i guess right and in 2010 she collapsed
06:44
after four minutes of intensive gurning
06:46
and had to be rushed to hospital
06:48
so there are injuries that happen in
06:49
this sport and actually um ann woods
06:51
died
06:51
quite recently as well she died in 2015
06:53
and i read her obituary
06:55
and it said that she always entered the
06:57
gurning arena to the tune of your
06:59
gorgeous by baby bird
07:02
arenas like how many people are going to
07:05
watch this thing
07:06
we've mentioned before um mr ugly from
07:09
zimbabwe so there's an annual mr ugly
07:10
competition in subway which is very
07:12
similar to the to the guerning
07:14
um and in 2015 there was a huge
07:16
controversy because the
07:17
the guy who won it um the runner up who
07:20
was a previous winner and had been
07:21
thinking he would win it again
07:22
the runner-up said it's not fair his
07:24
ugliness is based on the fact he's got a
07:26
lot of teeth missing whereas my ugliness
07:28
is natural
07:30
and the winner said you know yeah suck
07:32
it up you know
07:33
they said they should just accept i am
07:34
uglier than that he can only suck it up
07:36
if he's no teeth
07:37
[Laughter]
07:39
get your teeth removed have some
07:40
commitment like you know aforementioned
07:42
champion yeah
07:44
get them out um on tongs because this
07:46
guy can lick his own forehead
07:48
um there's some new research has found
07:49
that weightlifters have stronger tongues
07:52
and runners have better tongue endurance
07:54
than normal people
07:56
wow isn't that amazing why
07:59
are they do they i've actually never
08:01
watched weightlifting do they have a
08:02
little tiny little weight that they look
08:03
for their tongue
08:04
while they're doing the big ones with
08:05
their arms what they thought is perhaps
08:07
it's because you're
08:08
working out more your all of your
08:10
muscles are stronger but actually having
08:12
good tongue muscles is really
08:14
important because it keeps your airways
08:15
open so if your
08:17
tongue is stronger then it means it
08:18
keeps your airways open and maybe it's
08:20
better for running better for keeping
08:22
more oxygen in your body
08:23
stuff like that i think it's a very
08:25
specific thing the way you pronounce
08:27
tongue um from your part the world and
08:28
it just takes so long to get over the
08:30
fact that it's tongue and you're just
08:31
thinking
08:31
my fire tongues are perfectly strong
08:35
do you genuinely own fire tongs of
08:37
course i don't have a fire
08:39
i just jab the radiator with them
08:41
sometimes
08:46
um giraffes have good tongues really
08:48
good tongues they their tongues are half
08:49
a meter long
08:50
and at least i think half a meter so
08:53
that's what
08:54
that's longer than my forearm wow how
08:56
much do we see is that is that outside
08:58
or
08:58
no no it's not outside so quite a lot of
09:00
it goes back into them i think but you
09:01
know there's a decent amount outside
09:02
have you seen a giraffe
09:04
you know liquor leaf off a tree can
09:09
yes and they're also black or purple
09:12
their tongues and they think that's
09:13
because they spend 12 hours a day with
09:15
their tongues out
09:16
and they would be sunburned on them if
09:18
they didn't have sun protection so
09:19
that's why they have black tongues
09:22
i'm just really self-conscious about
09:24
saying that word now
09:25
[Laughter]
09:29
there was a doctor in the i think the
09:31
19th century there was a big debate over
09:33
how you could prove that someone had
09:34
died and there was a i think he was
09:36
french
09:36
doctor called labord and he said
09:39
that you can save people who only appear
09:41
to be dead you know
09:43
they fall into a swoon or they might be
09:45
unconscious but they are revivable
09:46
and he said the way to do it is to pull
09:48
their tongue rhythmically
09:50
for three hours
09:54
imagine doing that for two hours and 59
09:56
minutes and then
09:58
[Laughter]
10:01
he swore he swore that he'd done this he
10:03
he said he'd save people doing it he
10:04
said
10:05
he said he'd saved an unconscious cow
10:06
and a bulldog that had swooned
10:08
um and he invented a tongue-pulling
10:10
machine
10:11
which was you know which pulled the
10:13
machine and there was an assistant whose
10:14
job was to turn the crank and pull the
10:16
tongue for three hours oh my god i know
10:17
so he he resigned because he was bored
10:19
and he was replaced with an electric
10:21
tongue pulling machine
10:22
so wow there's a hockey player called
10:25
brad uh
10:25
an ice hockey player called brad
10:27
marchand and he has been ordered to stop
10:30
licking his opponents right
10:33
uh he's done this more than once but the
10:36
most recent
10:36
person he licked was opposition player
10:38
ryan callahan
10:40
and a merchant has been described in his
10:42
official biography as
10:44
the little ball of hate so is that the
10:47
sort of the liquor or the licky that's
10:48
the liquor who was
10:49
that and basically it's his job to kind
10:51
of start fights and stuff like that that
10:53
happens in hockey
10:54
but the guy who he licked said i don't
10:56
know what the difference is between
10:58
spitting in someone's face and licking
10:59
it which is quite a good point i think
11:01
and then the person who did the licking
11:03
said well he punched me four times in
11:05
the face you know how you stick your
11:14
tongue out when you concentrate
11:16
or you may have done as a child i
11:18
definitely did and it's much more common
11:19
in children
11:20
and i was reading a uh article by a
11:23
neurologist who said he thinks he knows
11:24
why we do this
11:26
and it's partly because if you're really
11:27
concentrating number one is because it
11:29
stops the distraction of taste or
11:31
texture
11:31
within your mouth so if you just hang
11:33
your tongue out i guess it's not really
11:34
touching anything it's not tasting or
11:35
touching anything
11:36
but number two he said it's because
11:38
breastfeeding babies stick their tongue
11:40
out to push their mother's nipple away
11:42
when they're full
11:43
and so that's what we're doing when
11:45
we're concentrating we're saying leave
11:46
me alone
11:47
i've got stuff to be getting along with
11:48
now wow
11:51
i'll be honest next time i stick my
11:53
tongue out i won't be able to
11:54
concentrate quite as much
11:59
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:01
that is
12:02
andy my fact is that in 1903 you could
12:05
buy a gramophone record
12:06
made of chocolate which you could play a
12:09
song on and then eat the disc
12:13
and somehow we have lost this technology
12:17
but i think the technology was never
12:18
great to start with was it you could
12:20
play a song on a piece of chocolate that
12:23
you can play a couple of times i mean
12:24
there weren't great turntables either
12:26
because they were designed for chocolate
12:27
records but
12:28
so it was it was this was made by a
12:30
company called the stalwark chocolate
12:31
company
12:32
and there were tiny turntables and small
12:34
chocolate records it was for children
12:36
basically it was a children's toy
12:37
and you could play the song a couple of
12:38
times and then when you got bored you
12:40
could just eat the song
12:41
and i think did they put they put foil
12:43
on the chocolate didn't they and it was
12:44
the foil that they put the ridges in
12:46
which acted like the record
12:48
and then you could peel it because you
12:49
don't want to be you know degrading your
12:51
chocolate as you play your record no
12:52
quite and
12:53
you say that it was a children's toy um
12:55
it was advertised in the french magazine
12:56
la nacho
12:58
and it specifically said this is not a
13:00
toy
13:03
what kind of miserable person do you
13:04
have to meet pretend your chocolate
13:05
gramophone record is not a toy
13:10
did it take off no
13:13
presumably you don't have any chocolate
13:15
records did you think you were the only
13:16
one in the world who hadn't picked up on
13:18
this technology he's got a massive hot
13:20
chocolate record collection
13:22
i'm from australia maybe it hasn't
13:23
reached yet maybe we're getting it next
13:25
year
13:26
it's no but you know sometimes in the
13:27
annals of history you can have 50 years
13:29
of
13:30
chocolate records you know the beetles
13:32
were released on chocolate and then
13:33
and then it goes i think it might have
13:35
been sort of a limited edition
13:36
thing and they tried lots of other
13:38
chocolate based things this company so
13:40
they also produced stolwook they
13:42
produced a chocolate clock and a
13:43
chocolate train
13:44
which i think train was a toy
13:56
i'm afraid there's more delays someone's
13:58
eaten the mode of transport again
14:02
there must be a better way
14:05
all the sleepers are twixes and there
14:07
are kitkats over the main rails
14:10
and there are little maltesers puffing
14:13
out of the tray
14:15
nice okay it's nice we all want to live
14:18
in this world now don't we
14:20
yeah very cool it's not real it's not
14:22
real
14:24
but there weren't toy trains i'm not
14:25
quite sure how they worked but yeah a
14:27
chocolate clock i don't know
14:28
how that works because that's not very
14:29
useful clock that's not going to last a
14:30
long time
14:31
no no uh so this is why they didn't take
14:34
off
14:35
i actually i didn't even look at what
14:37
the oldest piece of chocolate still
14:39
existing is there must be some they keep
14:41
finding you know bits of chocolate from
14:42
the antarctic expeditions the antarctic
14:44
expeditions um
14:46
just back to gramophones there is a
14:48
gramophone that still is in antarctica
14:50
it's been there for over a hundred years
14:53
scott of the antarctic
14:54
took a two gramophones with him two
15:08
it's like we're so cold and hungry can
15:10
we eat the grama first
15:13
you brought the chocolate one right
15:17
what was he thinking he brought hundreds
15:19
of records that's disgusting yeah and
15:21
so the idea was because obviously they
15:22
were in the hut for ages so um
15:24
sherry uh guard who wrote the worst
15:27
journey in the world
15:28
he said that after dinner every night
15:29
that's when the records would go on
15:31
and one was left there and one made it
15:33
back i've seen it there was an
15:34
exhibition at the natural history museum
15:35
in london i went to see it
15:37
and um they've actually made an album
15:40
of the best of songs uh that went along
15:42
as a record
15:43
but they couldn't play the records when
15:45
they were out in the middle of nowhere
15:46
because they had no
15:47
no because they they had scott's hut so
15:49
it was in the hut so it was before they
15:50
went probably out in the middle of
15:51
nowhere
15:52
you could have lined up gramophones as
15:53
well no there's a windings okay
15:55
the captain oates i know your hands are
15:57
very cold but would you mind taking them
15:58
out of those gloves to wind up the
16:00
gramophone just one last time
16:02
and then i promise you can go outside
16:05
so this is uh this is quite a cool thing
16:08
uh you know the new five pound notes the
16:09
plastic ones
16:10
yes yeah you can play a gramophone
16:12
record with a five pound node
16:14
as the stylist you mean yeah so you set
16:16
the record spinning
16:17
there's a there's footage online and
16:18
someone doing it and um it doesn't
16:20
produce a brilliant sound
16:22
and you need a you know you need a an
16:23
amplifier and stuff but you can do it
16:25
you could probably use that five pound
16:27
note to buy an actual stylus
16:28
[Laughter]
16:31
do you know that i couldn't believe this
16:33
there were basically
16:35
ipods in the 1920s
16:38
i don't believe that either yeah well
16:40
the word basically did a huge amount of
16:42
heavy lifting there isn't it
16:44
what did they have these were things
16:46
called mickey phones or microphones they
16:48
were little music players 180
16:50
000 of them were produced in switzerland
16:53
and they were basically they were
16:55
tiny little music players like
16:56
gramophones or phonographs that you
16:58
could carry around in your handbag and
16:59
they
17:00
measured two by four inches and the only
17:02
tiny thing about them was that
17:04
they measured two by four and just when
17:05
they were packed up but then whenever
17:06
you got somewhere
17:07
it was quite a complex assembly job to
17:09
build a ten inch record player
17:11
so it couldn't play straight away but
17:13
even so these are portable
17:14
that's really cool entire music players
17:17
very very cool yeah
17:18
edison when he um sort of came up with
17:21
the phonograph which was the precursor
17:22
to
17:23
to gramophone records i guess he thought
17:25
that their main use would be
17:27
one of their main uses would be
17:28
phonographic books which will speak to
17:30
blind people he said without any effort
17:33
on their part
17:33
basically a podcast it's an audiobook or
17:35
a podcast yeah
17:37
wow the phonograph recorded as well
17:40
didn't it as playing
17:41
i think that was a point of that uh and
17:43
one of the main things they used it for
17:44
was to record the last words of the
17:46
dying
17:47
wow that's so much pressure on someone
17:49
who's dying to nail your last words
17:51
yeah and then what if you don't go for
17:52
another hour you just got to sit
17:54
silently
17:56
it would also make you very paranoid
17:58
wouldn't it if you just felt a little
17:59
bit peaky
18:00
and then your wife started getting the
18:02
gramophone rigged up in the corner
18:06
honestly darling it's a cold
18:11
okay we need to move on to our next fact
18:12
it is time for fact number three
18:14
and that is chozinski my fact this week
18:17
is that in the early 1700s the most
18:20
popular
18:20
british guide to the history language
18:23
and culture of taiwan
18:25
was written by a man who didn't speak
18:27
the language had never been there
18:28
and knew nothing about it uh this was in
18:31
1704
18:32
and this well i'd say taiwan so it was
18:34
formosa then
18:36
uh which was what it was called it was
18:38
called the history of formosa
18:39
and it described in huge detail the
18:42
practices that these
18:44
people who would have seemed so foreign
18:45
to the people of britain the practices
18:47
that the foremost and people got up to
18:49
their language and everything it was
18:50
written by a guy called george
18:52
salmanitza and it was completely fake
18:55
he was a white blonde head blue-eyed
18:58
frenchman who'd never left europe
19:00
and no to this day we don't really know
19:02
what his background was or what his real
19:04
name was because george samantha was a
19:06
was a fake name
19:07
and he just made this up he he convinced
19:10
them that his pale
19:11
skin and his appearance of being of like
19:14
french and his french accent
19:16
because in formosa the upper classes
19:19
live in underground palaces so they
19:21
never see the sun
19:22
which so he'd never got that's a good
19:24
excuse though isn't it
19:26
really quick thinking yeah yeah he's so
19:28
he had this big showdown with the royal
19:30
society of scientists
19:32
and they were all questioning him for
19:33
ages about right so okay if you really
19:35
are from formosa what about this so uh
19:38
edmund haley of comet fame
19:40
asked him how long does the sun shine
19:42
down your chimneys
19:44
because and that's a really revealing
19:45
question but no come on like if you went
19:47
on holiday to
19:48
spain and they said to you yeah but andy
19:51
are you really from england
19:52
how long does the sun shine down your
19:54
chimney
19:55
i'd be stuffed wouldn't i exactly yeah
19:58
so how is he supposed to know it because
19:59
because that answer would have revealed
20:01
if he knew
20:02
where it was on the planet did he have
20:03
an answer to it he said we have bent
20:06
chimneys so the sun doesn't shine down
20:08
yeah that's a good answer
20:10
brilliant spiraled wasn't it it was
20:12
spiraled chimneys yeah
20:13
yeah he's amazing characters he said of
20:15
formosa that the men walk
20:17
naked except for a gold or silver plate
20:19
to cover their privates
20:21
he said that they executed murderers by
20:23
hanging them upside down and shooting
20:24
them full of arrows
20:26
and annually they sacrificed the hearts
20:27
of 18 000 young boys to gods and priests
20:30
to eat their bodies
20:31
yeah which people did say to him uh if
20:34
that
20:34
is true and they sacrificed that number
20:36
of people you're not gonna have any
20:37
people left on this small island
20:39
and he didn't have a good answer to that
20:41
but he said formosans always sleep
20:43
upright
20:43
and he actually then saw this through
20:45
because he had to live the habits of
20:46
them
20:52
yeah he used to i think he sort of sat
20:54
so he said a lot of foremost in sleep
20:56
standing up
20:56
and then he used to leave a cantalon in
20:58
his room so everyone could see that
20:59
overnight he was still
21:00
erect in his chair because he was
21:02
foremost so he couldn't sleep in a
21:04
normal bed
21:04
bizarrely he said that they all eat food
21:08
raw things like fish raw and he was
21:10
saying that um
21:11
formosa was part of japan which is a bit
21:13
weird because it was actually belong to
21:14
china then but he said as part of japan
21:16
so that's strange that he kind of
21:18
predicted sushi yeah 300 years before it
21:20
happened
21:21
well so he got basically formosa was his
21:24
third
21:24
go at trying to convince people he was
21:26
from somewhere else so he was originally
21:28
from france
21:29
his first bash at it was saying he was
21:30
irish so he would go around saying i'm
21:32
irish but the thing is
21:34
everyone knew the irish so they'd be
21:35
like oh so what are you and he was like
21:36
i have no idea
21:37
so he quickly that stuff up on him oh
21:39
have you been to the dog and duck in
21:41
dublin
21:41
yeah then he said he was japanese
21:44
right and then that failed on him as
21:46
well because japan was getting too much
21:48
people been traveling there too much he
21:49
needed to find somewhere else
21:50
formosa was the third one that he
21:52
finally landed on which was
21:54
useful to him another time in formosa
21:56
there was a lot of jesuits
21:58
um catholic missionaries uh and they
22:00
knew everything that was happening there
22:02
and so when he came along they were
22:03
going no no really that doesn't happen
22:06
but weirdly because no one trusted
22:08
catholics at the time
22:09
they all trusted this one guy over all
22:11
the jesuits who are saying no this is
22:13
[ __ ]
22:14
well at least the reputation of the
22:15
church has recovered
22:18
but we should emphasize that this was a
22:19
big deal this book he wasn't just a
22:21
weirdo with a pamphlet this was a book
22:24
that was so believed
22:26
that he lectured he was invited to
22:28
lecture on formosan culture and
22:30
language at oxford university so he
22:32
invented the entire language
22:34
alphabet and all completely new alphabet
22:36
a linguist
22:37
studied it to see how consistent it was
22:39
and agreed it was definitely a language
22:41
to the extent that it remained in lots
22:42
of language books until the mid-19th
22:44
century and people were still saying
22:45
this people weren't doing gcse foremost
22:50
can i tell you quickly just something
22:51
amazing about formosa yourself
22:54
so formosa now taiwan if you were in
22:57
formosa taiwan
22:58
and you dug through the ground and you
23:00
dug all the way through the earth
23:02
onto the other side the antipode as it's
23:05
called
23:06
you would land in a place called formosa
23:10
argentina is that right yeah no total
23:13
coincidence not by a coincidence
23:15
by coincidence yeah there's no relation
23:17
that as far as we can see between the
23:19
two places that you would land
23:20
yeah there's a place in argentina called
23:22
formosa i mean let's all definitely
23:24
google this after the show
23:28
that is incredible if that remains in
23:29
the episode that means it is true
23:31
and that is unbelievable if not
23:34
you're welcome everyone an
23:37
exclusive it would be around argentina
23:40
so that just makes sense
23:42
so we're in devon at the moment and it
23:44
seems like devon is a bit of a hotbed
23:46
for absolute fantasists
23:48
oh yeah yeah so andy you definitely know
23:50
about tuesday lobsang rampa don't
23:52
you know he was from devon was he yes so
23:55
he was
23:55
he um did a fraud saying he was a
23:58
tibetan monk
23:59
and that was still happening in the
24:00
1950s he was saying that
24:02
um he said that he came from tibet he
24:05
made up a language
24:06
um when they gave him actual tibetan and
24:09
said why do you not recognize this he
24:11
said that he'd been so badly tortured
24:13
during the war he'd blocked out all
24:15
knowledge of the tibetan language
24:18
um and and then afterwards when they
24:20
realized he wasn't actually tibetan he
24:21
said oh no no no
24:22
actually i was possessed by the spirit
24:24
of a tibetan monk
24:26
after i fell out of a tree in london
24:28
while trying to take a photograph of an
24:30
owl yep he was
24:33
his name was cyril hoskins and he was an
24:35
unemployed surgical trust manufacturer
24:37
from devon
24:38
who claimed to be an incredibly ancient
24:40
and powerful tibetan monk
24:42
and he wrote 15 books he wrote um
24:44
travels with the llama
24:45
and um like llamas in dalai lama and
24:47
then he wrote one
24:48
living with the llama which was dictated
24:50
to him by his cat
24:52
[Applause]
24:53
mrs fifi grey whiskers and then he
24:56
moved to he later he moved to ireland
24:59
and then canada
25:00
blatantly for tax reasons
25:04
yeah he was great yeah and then back in
25:06
the 18th century you had someone called
25:08
princess
25:08
caribou who was also from devon okay and
25:12
she turned up at someone's house near
25:13
bristol
25:14
speaking a fake language and said she
25:17
was from somewhere in the east
25:18
and again she was from devon and she
25:20
made the whole thing up she was from i
25:22
looked into it i spotted that as well
25:24
today
25:24
she was from somewhere that is a 30
25:26
minute drive from where we are right now
25:28
a little place called with ridge oh
25:30
hello
25:33
yeah but even the people of cumbria
25:35
looked down on the people of witheridge
25:38
but it was a sort of tradition that
25:40
travel writing merged into fiction
25:42
uh from about 1600 to 1900 you couldn't
25:45
quite tell there was basically three
25:46
categories there was gulliver's travel
25:48
style
25:49
this is a fictional travel account and
25:50
then there were proper travel journals
25:52
and there were loads of people who were
25:53
just kind of making stuff up but
25:55
pretending it was true
25:56
and there was the travels officer john
25:58
mandeville actually said this was
26:00
this was much earlier but he was almost
26:02
the precursor to all of these
26:03
these appeared in about the 1360s
26:06
and they were taken as legit travel
26:09
books for
26:10
over 300 years so christopher columbus
26:12
used them as a complete reference book
26:14
like all the great travelers of later
26:16
ages did
26:17
and they covered china india present-day
26:19
indonesia
26:20
and they told these amazing stories of
26:22
like uh ireland's first hand account of
26:25
people who had the bodies of humans in
26:26
the heads of
26:27
dogs or people who whose mouths were so
26:30
small that they had to suck all their
26:32
food through reeds because they just had
26:33
a tiny hole for a mouth
26:35
um and he said all the mongols eat their
26:37
fathers as soon as they die
26:39
they went okay great that was the thing
26:41
that salman claimed
26:42
he claimed that he said he was um
26:45
divorced and that he was a reformed
26:47
cannibal
26:47
because in formosa husbands were allowed
26:49
to eat their wives if
26:52
if there was adultery that had happened
26:54
if there was a committed adultery
26:55
there was always a lot of cannibalism
26:57
going on in these stories weren't there
26:59
it's like the idea of weird foreigners
27:00
would eat humans although the
27:02
the guy who you're talking about john
27:03
mandeville he found one group of people
27:06
whose only source of nourishment was the
27:08
smell of apples
27:12
and he also found he said that in
27:14
ethiopia um
27:15
all the people had only one foot but
27:17
that foot was so large that it shallowed
27:20
them from the sun
27:21
oh come on does that work wow they would
27:24
lie on their back and hold their massive
27:26
foot
27:27
wow it was awful when they wanted to go
27:32
bowling
27:34
that's pretty cool we should we should
27:36
evolve like that
27:37
this is slightly off topic but uh pl
27:39
travers
27:40
the writer of mary poppins she was she
27:42
had one massive foot actually
27:44
she was into a lot of esoteric stuff and
27:46
she went on a trip at one point with a
27:49
spiritual guru who she looked up to
27:50
where they were searching the earth for
27:52
a giant footprint
27:54
that was said to be made by an
27:56
intergalactic
27:58
giant who used earth as a stepping stone
28:00
as he was hopping through the universe
28:02
and she was convinced there was a giant
28:04
footprint that would be
28:06
a comic i don't know sorry when was she
28:08
writing what
28:09
30s 40s 50s yeah but she was she was
28:11
part of a very big spiritual
28:13
very lobster uh believed any [ __ ] didn't
28:16
they until
28:17
almost now yeah you're right everyone's
28:20
making really fact-based sensible
28:21
decisions these days
28:24
thank god we've come so far it's time
28:26
for our final fact of the show and that
28:28
is my fact
28:29
my fact this week is that ahead of
28:31
breeding season
28:33
iceland publishes an illustrated
28:35
catalogue of the country's most eligible
28:37
sheep
28:41
yeah so this is called the ram registry
28:42
it's an annual catalog that they make
28:44
available it starts online then they do
28:45
a physical publication
28:47
and um it profiles in this in the last
28:50
year that's gone 44 rams
28:52
they do color photos they do pedigrees
28:55
breeding it's all these stats it tells
28:57
you everything you need to know
28:58
um it's a 52 page uh catalogue
29:01
they have an obituary section for rams
29:04
that have passed away who were
29:06
i think if tinder had an obituary
29:07
section it would be more interesting
29:11
yeah it's true but it has stuff like how
29:13
many how many they're expected to sire
29:15
it's just it's the ultimate guide that
29:17
you need for when it's breeding season
29:19
you want
29:19
i want that and that's how they that's
29:21
how they spend their money
29:22
this thing is 20 years old this registry
29:24
is so well established
29:26
but there's a ram in this year's called
29:27
stromper and
29:29
stromper they say the farmer who owns
29:32
him says
29:32
stromper he is aware of his environment
29:34
and knows exactly what's expected of him
29:38
he doesn't call himself a stripper he
29:40
calls himself an exotic dancer actually
29:42
[Laughter]
29:44
but they get they get created for
29:46
leadership as well
29:47
so there are these there are these sheep
29:49
which are called flock leaders
29:51
and they automatically act as leaders to
29:53
the rest of the flock and they um that's
29:55
very important because they go off into
29:56
the mountains and you need a
29:58
um ram in charge who sort of um
30:01
you know when the weather's going to be
30:02
bad or when they can force all the
30:04
weather
30:04
so when they think the weather's going
30:05
to be bad they lead the flock to shelter
30:07
and safety
30:08
yeah and the sheep which are the
30:10
particularly intelligent sub breed are
30:12
called icelandic
30:13
leadership because they show leadership
30:19
i don't think that's why but it's a very
30:20
nice coincidence
30:22
and then but the thing is unlike day
30:24
snaps they never get to meet the
30:26
lady um sheep do they because basically
30:29
it's a sperm donor kind of thing
30:32
so even when their swipes on they're
30:34
just like oh no all you're going to get
30:35
is my
30:36
sperm oh my god my god tinder doesn't
30:37
rub like that
30:39
i've never used tinder but uh is that
30:41
not horrible i used to but i never just
30:43
popped my sperm in the post where i said
30:45
i swiped right on me
30:47
i think that might be a relief for a lot
30:48
of women on tinder
30:51
thank god a cup of sperm there's a
30:53
picture of me with a lot of stamps
30:55
i'm ready first class mail
31:01
wait is that first class mail both ways
31:03
around hey
31:05
but they're they're into sheep aren't
31:07
they in iceland
31:08
have three times as many sheep as people
31:10
and they have this amazing ceremony
31:13
every
31:13
uh every winter so basically the sheep
31:15
in iceland they have this weird farming
31:17
system where
31:17
all different farmers different herds of
31:19
sheep are free to roam with each other
31:21
up on the mountains
31:22
so they all intermingle which is a
31:24
massive hassle when it comes to bringing
31:25
them back down to put them in your pen
31:27
because they're all mixed up
31:28
and so they just recruit everyone so if
31:30
you're a tourist in iceland
31:32
at you know penn time and uh it's got a
31:35
name i think it's called retire
31:36
time uh and then you go and you help
31:38
round up sheep
31:40
and you have to shimmy them down the
31:41
mountain you put them into this big
31:43
enclosure
31:44
with a central bit in the middle and
31:46
then you
31:47
uh they've got little marks on their
31:48
ears that show which farmer they belong
31:49
to and if you see a mark you grab it by
31:51
the ear or by the scruff of its neck you
31:53
lift it up and you chuck it into the bit
31:55
of that enclosure
31:55
you lift it up and chuck it up and throw
31:58
it and it's very
31:59
strong all right the sheep are really
32:02
like they're really perfect in iceland
32:04
aren't they they don't have any kind of
32:05
other jeans they're like
32:07
they've been there since the vikings and
32:09
they've never had all right captain
32:10
aryan over there
32:14
no one sullied these genes well this is
32:17
what they think they think that because
32:19
they've been there for the whole time
32:20
they're not sullied by any other blood
32:22
and
32:22
um in 1878 they imported a single
32:26
english ram
32:26
into iceland and they had to kill sixty
32:29
percent of icelandic flocks
32:31
because they spread disease and
32:33
parasites to the flocks
32:35
english tourists best of the world
32:39
they love eating the sheep as well
32:41
obviously because you know cheap are
32:43
eaten
32:43
um but they there's a thing called which
32:46
is
32:46
half a sheep's head that's a delicacy um
32:49
and they make sour testicles and brain
32:52
jam
32:54
well they so i found the best way to eat
32:56
the boiled sheep's brain which is
32:57
something that
32:58
is a real delicacy and this is because
33:00
there's an mp i think he might have been
33:02
the foreign minister
33:03
or the home sector or something he's a
33:04
guy called uh
33:06
why didn't i practice this name before i
33:07
came on stage uh he's called ossa
33:10
scarfionsen oscar scarfionton
33:14
well i think he's safely anonymous
33:15
that's the main thing
33:17
he's not sat at home going why are they
33:19
talking about me is he
33:20
[Music]
33:21
wouldn't want to be that guy but he was
33:25
in 2013 he would serve some sheep's
33:26
brain at a party
33:27
and he said this is amongst the best
33:29
boiled sheepshead i've ever had
33:31
they stuck to my gum as proper heads
33:33
should and so that's what they're
33:34
supposed to do they
33:35
stick to the gum and then he was asked
33:36
really but was it the best and he was
33:38
like okay look it wasn't the very best
33:40
the head should have been more fermented
33:41
because we from the west fjords prefer
33:43
our sheep's head so fermented that we
33:45
can drink the eye
33:46
out of the eye socket
33:50
so that's the that's what you're going
33:51
for wow goodness in 2018
33:53
two men in iceland summoned the police
33:55
and the coast guard after they'd seen a
33:57
polar bear
33:58
on a peninsula and that's obviously
34:00
incredibly dangerous because they really
34:01
don't come near humans very often
34:03
eventually after a lengthy search the
34:05
search was called off and the men
34:06
admitted it may just have been a large
34:08
sheep
34:14
it's just a lot closer than they thought
34:16
it's understandable
34:20
i know how to artificially inseminate a
34:22
cow based on researching for this
34:24
podcast
34:24
cool uh so this is obviously about
34:26
pairing sheep up with each other
34:28
uh so they can mate properly and dairy
34:30
cows you do the same thing so i think 75
34:32
of dairy cows in this country uh when
34:36
they have to be inseminated they get
34:37
inseminated but just by semen rather
34:39
than the actual bull
34:40
and for some reason i found myself
34:42
reading this really in-depth farmer's
34:43
guide to how to do it
34:45
and what i didn't realize was you so you
34:46
get a semen gun
34:48
uh which you put the the semen in
34:51
and where did you bring your seven gun
34:53
to a gunfight
34:56
damn it you bring your semen gun to the
35:00
insemination fight and
35:02
but what you do is you have to uh so
35:04
there are two
35:06
entries into a cow uh so as much as
35:08
humans
35:09
yeah you've got that oh sorry
35:13
there are three oh sorry
35:15
[Laughter]
35:19
something tells me you are not the
35:21
biggest expert in this room
35:24
are the number of ways into a cow
35:28
i know the people never know all these
35:29
secret ways but there were two entries
35:34
there were two entries into the back of
35:35
a cow officially um and so
35:37
you know one is the erection uh as as we
35:40
all have
35:41
professor let me write this down
35:47
children will you be quiet you've got
35:50
the wrexham and then you've got the sex
35:51
tubes and they're different
35:55
all right the cervix um and but what you
35:58
do is
35:59
amazingly when you're inseminating a cow
36:00
you obviously have to stick the gun in
36:02
the cervix
36:03
but the way you navigate the gun into
36:07
into the uterine horns as they're called
36:10
um is you have to put your other arm
36:12
that's not holding the gun
36:14
into the rectum
36:17
and so you it's so amazing and they say
36:20
you shove your arm into the
36:21
insert your arm into the rectum get
36:24
someone else to hold the cow's tail
36:25
aside while you do this
36:27
that would be a bold farmer who tried
36:29
using one foot
36:30
to pin the cow's tail
36:35
this is the worst game of twister i've
36:37
ever played
36:42
it says left-hand sex tubes
36:45
anyway look it just feels like this
36:48
lesson isn't gonna end so
36:51
you essentially use your rectum arm to
36:53
navigate your semen
36:54
gun which is in the vaginal canal
36:58
and you push it through so you you got
37:00
your arm in the rectum
37:02
and it's pushing against the other canal
37:04
so that it gets into the uterus and it's
37:06
called recto vaginal insemination
37:08
and that's a lesson over enjoy
37:14
okay that is it that is
37:17
all of our facts thank you so
37:20

00:15
hello
00:16
and welcome to another episode of no
00:19
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:22
this week coming to you live
00:23
from the hammersmith event
00:31
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:34
here with anna chazinski
00:35
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:38
and once again we have gathered around
00:40
the microphones with our four
00:41
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:43
and in no particular order
00:44
here we go starting with you james
00:48
okay my fact this week is that in the
00:50
18th century
00:52
london plays written by david garrick
00:54
and starring david garrick
00:56
would often be shown in theaters owned
00:59
by david garrick
01:01
they would then be reviewed by david
01:03
garrick
01:05
in newspapers owned by david garrett
01:07
[Laughter]
01:10
amazing guy wasn't he he was a man of
01:12
many talents
01:14
apparently according to the reviews i
01:16
read
01:19
so yeah i mean he ran the drawing lane
01:21
theater he was a great actor a lot of
01:23
you will have heard of him
01:24
he also had the saint james's chronicle
01:27
and the public
01:28
appetizer in the chronicle it said mr
01:30
garrick was
01:31
most extraordinarily accurate in every
01:34
syllable which he uttered
01:37
and his spelling is really good
01:40
he was a really exciting character for
01:42
theater he was someone who brought in
01:44
the old he championed shakespeare but he
01:46
also
01:46
was looking at new technologies to make
01:48
plays more interesting so for example
01:50
when he played hamlet he designed a wig
01:52
that when the ghost of his father walked
01:54
in
01:54
stood up on edge no yeah he did change
01:58
the way
01:59
people acted weirdly so um
02:02
before garrett came along then for
02:04
instance spectators would be on the
02:06
stage you guys would be up here with us
02:08
like during the performance
02:10
intermingling um and he said let's not
02:12
do that because
02:12
no let's not do that let's definitely
02:14
not do that let's do that
02:16
he made actors he made actors come to
02:18
rehearsals which really pissed them off
02:20
um he he abolished the practice of
02:24
people audience members coming in
02:25
at the interval for half price so people
02:28
would come in the middle of hamlet
02:30
and then spend the whole time going so
02:32
who's that guy
02:34
why is she so upset but actually that
02:38
was really really controversial wasn't
02:39
it there were riots because of that yeah
02:41
so um when he decided against the
02:43
half-price thing he came on stage
02:46
and all the people in the pit so it used
02:48
to be that you have rich people in the
02:49
top and you have really poor people in
02:51
the pit
02:51
or poorer people in the pit
02:52
[Applause]
02:55
let's hear it from the rich people up
02:56
there
02:57
[Applause]
03:00
they're all the same prices
03:04
he came on stage and the people in the
03:06
pit said that he had to stop this
03:08
half-price thing
03:09
yeah i'll bring it back i should say and
03:10
he said he'd have to consult his
03:12
business
03:13
partner and he was booed off stage was
03:16
his business partner david garrick
03:19
that's him in a massage and then the
03:22
actors came on
03:23
and then they were also booed off stage
03:25
and then finally
03:26
according to the article from the time
03:27
that i read at eight o'clock the ladies
03:30
were asked to leave so the house might
03:31
be
03:32
burnt whoa
03:35
oh that's so thoughtful it's really
03:39
like the theater was a risers place so
03:40
the gary the sitting on the stage thing
03:42
that was the result of a 15-year
03:44
campaign
03:45
it took 15 years to get people to stop
03:46
sitting on the stage um and there was
03:49
also gary the way he changed acting as
03:51
well was very cool because
03:53
before garrick and there was another guy
03:54
called macklin who was
03:56
a huge rival of garricks but before that
03:59
actors would basically stand with their
04:00
feet at ten and two
04:02
shouting essentially shouting and
04:04
garrick was such a good actor
04:05
because he paid attention to the other
04:08
people he was on stage with
04:09
rather than just waiting so james
04:14
um but the reviews would say things like
04:16
he even acts when he's not acting
04:20
i just blew people's minds what does
04:21
that mean yeah it means well it means
04:23
like
04:23
he pretended to listen to the other
04:25
people on stage he was playing a part he
04:27
stayed in character
04:28
rather than just going back to standing
04:29
neutrally like a dummy waiting for his
04:31
turn to shout out
04:31
okay right or what wandering off stage
04:33
when it's not your line you just go and
04:35
get a coffee
04:35
exactly come back in yeah so acting did
04:38
used to be
04:39
very different as we said beforehand the
04:42
leading actor the greatest rival to
04:44
garrett was a guy called james quinn who
04:46
was known as the bellower
04:47
and he was london's best actor because
04:49
he had a very loud voice
04:50
and also he was very good at
04:52
gesticulating so there were three
04:53
hallmarks of great acting
04:55
number one very loud voice number two
04:57
excessive gesticulating
04:59
and number three incredibly long pauses
05:02
so
05:03
actors at the time were schooled in
05:05
three different types of pools
05:07
you had moderate longer and grand
05:12
wow wow he sounds like very much like
05:14
brian blessed doesn't he he's that kind
05:16
of person
05:17
but did he not was he not famous for
05:19
killing people
05:20
he was in a lot of jewels quinn yes
05:23
right yeah i read that he um
05:25
he killed a fellow actor who
05:26
mispronounced the word cato as quito on
05:29
stage
05:30
what i think that's fair enough dan you
05:32
would not have lasted five minutes in
05:33
the scene
05:36
but that was like that did happen so you
05:38
were you mentioned um andy charles
05:40
macklin
05:40
who was um garrick's rival i think and
05:43
um macklin once killed a fellow actor
05:45
for borrowing his wig
05:46
that's harsh well because he had that
05:48
one that stood up and not many people
05:49
had
05:50
that's true um so we mentioned the riots
05:52
briefly oh yes
05:53
i just had one theatrical riot i wanted
05:55
to share with you guys so this was
05:57
in jury lane it was it was in 1755 and a
06:00
swiss
06:00
ballet master had brought a festival to
06:02
drury lane very exciting
06:04
and the press were furious because he
06:06
had brought frenchmen and french women
06:07
onto an english stage
06:09
and they were delivered so someone in
06:11
the gallery cried out that the dancers
06:13
were disguised french soldiers which
06:15
obviously they were not
06:16
uh it was a ballet festival and one of
06:19
the actors shouted back i'm not french
06:21
i'm swiss
06:22
and one of the protesters then shouted
06:23
back swiss what the devil do we know of
06:26
swiss a swiss is a foreigner and all
06:28
foreigners are frenchmen
06:32
so this went on for a few nights and
06:35
then on the fifth night they just
06:36
started the spectators just started
06:37
ripping up the benches and destroying
06:39
the chandeliers
06:40
and destroying the scenery on stage
06:42
constantly we're doing it
06:43
tearing theaters apart i don't know how
06:45
any theaters are still standing
06:46
i think one of the most famous theater
06:49
riots was in 1809 and that was the
06:50
covent garden theater riots
06:52
basically the cov the common garden
06:54
theater had been burned down and they
06:55
thought we'll use this as an excuse to
06:56
rebuild it and put up prices
06:58
and they also rebuilt it so that if you
07:00
were in the upper tears you could only
07:01
see
07:02
the legs of the people on stage and this
07:04
really annoyed people
07:05
and they properly rioted so they had
07:08
this chart which was old prices old
07:10
prices
07:10
uh the noise was so bad that soldiers
07:12
were constantly having to be sent up
07:14
uh to restore order the writing lasted
07:17
three months and the audiences did
07:18
things like they would bring live pigs
07:20
into the audience
07:21
they brought rattles they brought
07:23
trumpets uh they bought pigeons
07:25
very often and released them into the
07:27
auditorium and
07:28
they wore these badges with op standing
07:31
for old price
07:32
it was quite nice bit of merch for the
07:34
rioters
07:36
in the same year as the swiss riot
07:38
garrix theater posted an advert in the
07:40
press to try and find out
07:41
who it was that flung a hard piece of
07:43
cheese of near half a pound weight
07:45
from one of the galleries last tuesday
07:47
night and greatly hurt a young lady in
07:48
the pit
07:51
yeah oh my god was it spelt greatly like
07:53
gr80
07:57
do you know that he um he went to when
07:59
he was at school he was taught by samuel
08:01
johnson
08:02
yeah yeah yeah he was and this was in
08:04
litchfield and samuel johnson had to
08:06
start a school
08:07
basically because he was not allowed to
08:09
be a part of an already existing school
08:11
and the reason that they said is it was
08:13
feared that the way that he was able to
08:15
distort his face all the time
08:16
would scare the children so they're like
08:19
your face is too scary you can't teach
08:20
here
08:21
so he set up yeah he set up his own
08:23
school and there were only three pupils
08:25
at it one of which was david garrick
08:27
and then after school they went to
08:29
london together
08:30
um that's the school shut down didn't it
08:32
because it had three pupils
08:34
so then they went to london yeah can i
08:35
just one more thing about a very
08:37
exciting event in the 18th century
08:39
theater world uh another big thing was
08:41
1749
08:43
at the haymarket theater there were
08:45
adverts all over london that the bottle
08:46
conjurer was going to be performing and
08:48
no one knew who this was
08:49
it's a mystery to this very day but what
08:52
was advertised was that various things
08:54
it said that um
08:56
you could give him a walking cane on
08:58
stage and he would tap it and play the
08:59
sound of any instrument you liked with
09:01
his tapping
09:02
uh you could wear a mask and even if you
09:05
wore a mask he'd be able to tell you who
09:06
you were
09:07
and then the fiesta resistance was he'll
09:10
have a common
09:11
wine bottle uh on stage he will go into
09:14
it
09:15
and sing in it and then he would climb
09:18
into the boat
09:19
climb into the wine bottle yes and sing
09:22
in the wine bottle and during his stay
09:23
in the bottle any person may handle it
09:25
and so although i've seen some of your
09:29
wine bottles and they are pretty big
09:32
why do they make the neck so tiny
09:34
otherwise i'd go in myself
09:37
but this huge audience turned up because
09:38
they were like it was a quart so which
09:40
um i think it was about the
09:42
a bit bigger than a normal wine bottle
09:43
elite or whatever but a massive audience
09:45
turned up including the king's son
09:47
lots of nobility it was obviously a ruse
09:50
he wasn't going to climb inside a wine
09:52
bottle
09:52
and so people got really pissed off and
09:54
so they went and he didn't turn up
09:56
no one came on stage and the benches
09:58
were torn out this is the haymarket
10:00
theater big theater
10:01
scenery totally destroyed debris was
10:04
dragged out of the theater and all of
10:05
the
10:06
stuff inside the theater was set on fire
10:08
and one newspaper explained this the
10:10
next day the fact that the guy hadn't
10:12
turned up and climbed inside a wine
10:13
bottle
10:14
explained it by saying he had given a
10:16
private audience beforehand
10:18
and where upon receiving a demonstration
10:20
of the trick the viewer as in that
10:22
private audience had
10:23
corked up the bottle and whipped it in
10:25
his pocket and made off
10:33
um okay it is time for fact number two
10:36
and that is my fact my fact this week is
10:39
that
10:40
the main source for sigmund freud's work
10:42
on paranoid schizophrenia
10:44
was the memoirs of a man who made
10:47
unbelievable and ludicrous claims
10:50
that man's name was dan schreiber
10:55
daniel paul schreiber was his name
10:59
this is a guy who lived from 1842 to
11:01
1911
11:02
and he wrote a serie well he wrote a
11:04
memoir um memoirs of my nervous illness
11:07
and in it he was kind of trying to show
11:09
what it was like from the inside of
11:11
someone who was having all of these
11:13
um thoughts and so on published the book
11:15
and freud picked it up
11:17
and never met him they lived at the same
11:18
time but didn't want to meet him because
11:20
he didn't want to be influenced by it he
11:21
just used the book and that was the
11:22
basis
11:23
for a lot of his freud's work he's
11:26
daniel schreiber's book is still
11:28
in publication if you go into book shops
11:30
that memoir it's how important it is
11:32
so shredder thought that um there were
11:34
little men living inside his feet
11:36
that were taking out his genitals and
11:38
then putting female genitals in so he
11:40
could have god's child yes
11:42
putting female genitals into his feet or
11:44
into
11:45
into the place where they normally are
11:47
oh yeah otherwise
11:49
very hard to walk yeah
11:52
he was mad wasn't he freud freud
11:56
was yeah yeah not this guy with the
11:58
vagina in his foot
11:59
i think he was fine there were just so
12:02
many things that are wrong about what he
12:04
thought so
12:05
he had a lifelong fear of trains sigmund
12:07
freud
12:08
and that was based on a experience he
12:11
had in his early childhood which he
12:12
explained
12:13
in a letter 40 years after the event
12:16
and he explained to one of his friends
12:18
that when he was three years old
12:20
he'd moved house his whole family had
12:22
moved house not just him
12:23
um and they'd move gone by train
12:26
and he explained that he'd seen his
12:28
mother naked on the overnight train
12:30
and he thought you know from that
12:32
experience he'd been permanently
12:33
traumatized by the
12:34
seeing his mother naked and obviously
12:36
being sexually attracted to her um
12:38
so so there is an idea that he had this
12:40
theory of the oedipus complex
12:42
and now it's thought that maybe maybe he
12:44
had one but
12:45
it's not true that everyone has one you
12:47
know he was almost not a psychiatrist
12:50
um he first started the first paper that
12:52
he ever published was on eels and it was
12:54
his attempt to locate their testicles
12:57
that was what he was doing he dissected
13:00
400 eels looking for their testicles
13:03
just was obsessed he was like they got
13:04
to be somewhere and
13:06
at what stage do you go i've done 399.
13:10
yeah 400 400 was the same yeah
13:14
because he published the paper saying
13:16
didn't find him
13:17
but this was one of the great mysteries
13:19
of the age it was it genuinely was so
13:21
what no one knew where eel's bred and
13:24
uh male eels only have gonads when they
13:26
need them basically
13:28
so uh aristotle said that eels came from
13:31
nothing that was his
13:32
great theory um
13:35
like what a chance he sometimes said
13:38
they came for the guts of wet soil as
13:39
well yes
13:40
yeah and some people said they came out
13:42
of thatched roofs i mean no one knew
13:44
so but the thing was freud when he wrote
13:47
this paper he said well they must have
13:48
all been female that's the only
13:49
explanation i can think of rather that
13:51
he got it wrong and i read a great essay
13:53
online which asked you know what this
13:54
must have been very formative for freud
13:56
it said we know now that freud views
13:59
viewed most people's problems through a
14:00
sexual lens but was that lens tinted
14:03
by the set of testicles he couldn't find
14:05
a lifetime ago
14:08
did his inability to locate the eel's
14:10
reproductive organs proved so prominent
14:12
in his studies that he saw them
14:13
everywhere he went
14:15
in the manner that a rare car owner
14:17
begins to see his car everywhere
14:19
soon after driving it off the lot the
14:22
weirdest simile i've ever heard
14:26
he hated women though didn't he maybe
14:28
that's all about the eel testicles as
14:29
well
14:29
it was the heinous sexist so he said
14:32
that um women should be basically
14:34
avoided because they were too
14:35
susceptible to being seduced
14:37
he advised his friends against hanging
14:39
out with them at all
14:40
he said that they have an ineptitude for
14:42
serious life tasks
14:44
they are in unstable incapable of
14:47
grasping their own unimportance
14:49
and their people who he said nature has
14:53
inclined them to be vain and he said
14:55
the only thing that women contributed to
14:57
society are
14:58
plotting and weaving because women
15:00
traditionally were
15:02
they did do a lot of weaving and
15:03
planting and he attributed this to
15:06
obviously their desire to have a penis
15:08
and so
15:09
what he said was women are so upset
15:11
about not having a penis that
15:14
their plating is expressing their desire
15:16
to plat their pubic hair
15:17
in order to conceal the fact that they
15:19
have no
15:20
male genitals to conceal it what's
15:23
interesting is
15:23
um you say he didn't like women but it
15:25
was a woman who actually
15:27
helped him get to his biggest
15:29
breakthrough in psychiatry uh when
15:31
sitting with them and she was
15:32
appropriately called fanny
15:36
fanny moser was her name he was treating
15:38
her and
15:39
he used to do it through hypnosis but he
15:41
was a terrible hypnotist
15:43
um you're unstable you're weak
15:47
you wish you had a penis
15:48
[Laughter]
15:50
so he used to do the you're getting
15:51
sleepy thing and fanny moser said
15:53
actually i don't think i am and he was
15:55
like no
15:55
you are and she went i really don't
15:57
think i am so she just started talking
15:59
and she was laying on the couch
16:01
and kept talking and kept talking and he
16:03
thought hang on a second this is amazing
16:04
i'm actually getting stuff here that's
16:06
real and raw
16:07
and that was the game changer for him
16:08
that's when in a way the talking cure
16:11
was invented because a woman told him to
16:12
shut the [ __ ] up
16:13
because she honestly because he he
16:18
because funny basic he used to say his
16:20
theories to her and at one point she
16:22
just said
16:23
honestly please shut up because without
16:25
your comments i can properly let my mind
16:27
wander and work out what's going on and
16:29
he was like okay cool
16:30
i'll just step back yeah well he saw sex
16:33
everywhere didn't he
16:34
he thought anything that elongated such
16:36
as sticks or tree trunks or umbrellas
16:38
represented the penis
16:39
he said that walking up and down steps
16:42
symbolized the sexual act
16:44
you guys in the circle
16:48
sounds like it checks out what was his
16:50
day-to-day like that he just saw penises
16:52
everywhere
16:53
that was just it must have been so
16:54
distracting
16:56
um do you guys know what the first
16:57
freudian slip was oh no no
16:59
um so the first freudian slip was a
17:01
young man who said
17:03
xoriare ex nostras or sibus
17:06
ultor when as you all know he should
17:09
have said
17:09
exoria a liqueus nostris
17:12
ex oscibus ultor so i mean it's obvious
17:15
isn't it
17:19
[Laughter]
17:21
so basically it was the suppression of
17:23
the word eliquis
17:24
meant that he must have had some
17:26
association with that word so he did
17:28
a word association and said what does
17:30
that make you think of and
17:31
eventually got to a word which was saint
17:35
januarius and saint januarios kept his
17:38
blood in a file
17:40
which was supposed to have turned into
17:41
liquid once a year and then was solid
17:43
the rest of the time
17:44
and then the man confessed that his
17:46
girlfriend had missed her period
17:47
and so freud concluded that he had
17:49
blocked out this word from 10 minutes
17:51
ago
17:52
because he associated that with the fact
17:54
that his girlfriend might be pregnant
17:58
yeah you shouldn't give your blood in a
18:01
file it makes the cardboard soggy
18:02
[Laughter]
18:05
uh very good advice so it was right um
18:08
have we talked about the cocaine i don't
18:09
think we have
18:10
i don't know huge fan of cocaine he
18:12
experimented with it as a student
18:14
believing it would alleviate his
18:15
depression and anxiety and
18:16
great news it did um and he just started
18:19
posting it was this bizarre period where
18:21
you were just posting cocaine around
18:22
because it wasn't really illegal so he
18:23
sent it to his fiancee to make her
18:25
strong
18:26
she must have been platting like mud
18:27
after that
18:31
um he gave it to his great friend who
18:34
was called fleischel
18:35
because fleischer was addicted to
18:36
morphine and he said i know something
18:38
that'll cure your morphine addiction
18:40
try cocaine fleischer then became
18:42
completely addicted to cocaine
18:44
and freud said uh he claimed it had been
18:47
a success but it had not
18:49
one of the things he justified it with
18:51
when he was recommending it to this guy
18:53
whose life was ruined by
18:54
freud forcing cocaine on him freud said
18:57
the wonderful thing about cocaine the
18:58
best thing about it is
18:59
there is absolutely no craving for the
19:02
further use of cocaine
19:04
after you first take it or even
19:06
repeatedly
19:08
about time
19:13
your seat number has been taken down
19:17
i was looking into uh with freud uh just
19:19
off the back of david garrick
19:21
i thought what did he do you know as
19:23
hobbies did he go to the theater for
19:24
example and i could only find one
19:26
example
19:26
and it was to see a guy who we've
19:28
mentioned very briefly on this podcast
19:30
before
19:30
called le petromaine oh yeah
19:34
the farter his act was to just fart on
19:36
stage
19:37
what's interesting is it wasn't that he
19:38
was eating generating gas and farting
19:41
he was sucking air up into his bum and
19:44
farting it back out
19:45
so he discovered this when he was in the
19:47
ocean and he was almost drowning he
19:49
notices the ocean getting very slightly
19:50
lower
19:53
as he was drowning he went it went both
19:55
in and
19:56
up at the same time and he was like
19:57
that's weird um he came back to the
19:59
surface he went to the beach
20:01
and it all flooded out of his butt and
20:02
he thought what's happening here
20:04
so highlights of his act they involved
20:06
the effects of cannon fire and
20:08
thunderstorms from his bum
20:09
um he could play osolomio
20:13
through a sort of rubber tube in his bum
20:15
i don't know that would you mind
20:16
performing
20:18
we know it as just one cornetto
20:22
yeah and that's who that's sigmund freud
20:24
the only example i could find of him
20:25
going to the theater was to see
20:26
the farting man yeah well he was very
20:29
into
20:30
defecation um he thought that was
20:32
extremely unfortunate
20:33
freud was all right so was he going
20:35
follow through
20:37
[Laughter]
20:40
no he was convinced that defecation
20:44
obsession with defecation and obsession
20:45
with money were related and he said that
20:49
he was obsessed with money himself he
20:50
said money is like laughing gas to me
20:52
he'd love being rich
20:54
and um he thought that being into
20:57
excrement
20:58
was something that transferred in later
20:59
life into being into money
21:02
and he said that like there's a constant
21:04
uh association with them
21:05
in our minds and because it's the
21:07
contrast he thought between the most
21:09
precious thing
21:10
which is money and the least precious
21:12
thing which is [ __ ]
21:13
and he also said it's because this
21:15
there's this perfect transition so when
21:17
you're in your youth you're
21:18
he thought erotically interested in
21:20
defecation but not money
21:22
and then as soon as that starts to
21:24
recede you become
21:26
erotically interested in money and so he
21:28
thought they were intrinsically related
21:30
pooing and money as we've entertained he
21:33
was wrong about
21:34
everything it is time for fact number
21:37
three
21:38
and that is jaczynski my fact this week
21:41
is that swordfish can speed up and slow
21:43
down time
21:44
with their minds
21:48
so this is this amazing thing that has
21:49
been discovered about swordfish quite
21:51
recently
21:51
so if you say speed up and slow down
21:53
time in the end time is about how you're
21:55
perceiving stuff right so
21:57
swordfish if hunting their time
21:59
perception is about the same
22:01
time as ours which means that they
22:03
basically are processing all the images
22:06
that are coming into their eyes and
22:07
their brain is pressing that as fast as
22:09
we do so they experience time in the
22:11
same way as we do
22:12
but if they're not hunting then time
22:13
goes about five times more slowly for
22:15
them it all slows down
22:17
and they can do this deliberately so
22:18
what they do is they heat up their
22:20
brains
22:21
and their eyes and that just makes them
22:23
be able to absorb
22:24
more information and so the faster you
22:26
can see light coming into your eyes and
22:28
all these images
22:29
then the slower time it's amazing and it
22:31
means that they can hunt better right
22:33
yeah exactly so it's like um a good
22:36
a kind of an analogy is if you swat a
22:38
fly or
22:39
you try to swat a fly then you're
22:41
usually unsuccessful
22:42
and that is because they are seeing way
22:44
more frames per second than you are
22:46
so you think you've got really close but
22:48
to them that like it's like
22:50
so easy like to a fly if they watch a
22:52
movie it's just like a drawing
22:54
and then a bit of a wait and then
22:55
another drawing a little bit of a wait
22:57
and another
22:57
that's why we say time flies no it isn't
23:00
yes it is
23:01
i'm pretty sure it is so what happens
23:04
because i've actually swatted flies
23:06
do i have access to faster time no
23:08
you're not a you're not
23:10
neo in this analogy yeah
23:13
no it means that they just didn't see
23:14
you coming but if they were to see you
23:16
coming it would be like neo isn't it
23:17
it's like in the matrix you kind of see
23:19
it slowing down
23:20
and coming towards you really really
23:21
slowly yeah right and the weird thing is
23:23
that um
23:24
they knew that swordfish did this thing
23:26
where they heat up their eyes
23:27
and their brains they found that out a
23:29
few years ago but they only just
23:31
realized why and they did it
23:33
uh by removing the retinas of freshly
23:36
caught
23:36
swordfish and they put them in a bath
23:38
and they
23:39
connected them to some electrodes to
23:41
measure their
23:42
like the response of those retinas to
23:44
lots of flashes of light
23:47
and they changed the temperature of the
23:48
bath that the retinas were in
23:50
and when it was in a hotter bath then
23:52
their response to light was
23:54
10 times faster so their response their
23:56
ability to absorb lots of information
23:58
and this is just a detached retina
24:00
fully detached from the fish which is
24:02
being eaten somewhere
24:04
and that retina responded 10 times
24:06
faster to the light that was being given
24:08
to it than if they were in a bath that
24:09
was much colder
24:10
it is amazing yeah do you know they
24:12
don't stab their prey
24:14
i sort of vaguely assumed that they were
24:15
because they have like a really long
24:17
sword
24:18
yeah and there's an upper jaw and i just
24:20
assumed that they would uh
24:21
kebab as it were yeah i think the
24:24
problem would be if you're a fish and
24:25
you could
24:26
kebab a fish you can't grab it with your
24:28
hands can you because you don't have
24:29
hands
24:30
if you were feeding others if you went
24:31
round as the kebab
24:33
if you are the kebab yeah yeah that
24:35
would be very nice
24:36
yeah yeah so for a couple of weeks
24:41
what a party that would be where the
24:42
waiter had all the food balanced on his
24:43
nose for you
24:44
yeah i'd go but the problem is they're
24:46
solitary fish so they can't do that they
24:48
can't eat off each other's noses
24:49
oh they're quite solitary but they do
24:51
yeah they're very solitary but what they
24:52
do is they did not know this
24:54
so they uh they do this sailfish do this
24:57
as well another fish with a very very
24:58
long
24:58
uh upper jaw they slowly put their bill
25:00
into a school of
25:01
sardines or other smaller fish and then
25:04
yeah yeah yeah they thrash their head
25:06
from side to side
25:07
like zorro and then they've they've they
25:10
injure enough fish in that yeah
25:12
yeah bit and that they can catch
25:15
them they can then just eat them it's
25:17
amazing how they do that with the noses
25:18
because they will slot their noses
25:20
into a big school of fish that they've
25:22
herded into a big cluster
25:24
and the fish don't notice so you can see
25:27
the swordfish or the sailfish's nose
25:29
sitting in amongst them just waiting
25:31
with all the fish swimming around
25:32
they they sweat out of their noses but
25:35
instead of sweating sweat
25:36
they sweat lube is there
25:39
what's the purpose of it well it makes
25:41
them really slippery
25:42
and it means they can swim really really
25:44
quickly
25:44
[Music]
25:46
there's no sexy evening where you go did
25:48
you bring the swordfish
25:51
and in sicily in the 18th century it was
25:53
believed that swordfish would dive out
25:55
of the way if they heard anyone speaking
25:57
italian
25:57
[Laughter]
26:00
so all the local fishermen spoke greek
26:02
the whole time
26:03
wow wow well we think what that actually
26:06
was
26:06
it was basically an excuse for not
26:08
catching them so
26:10
you haven't caught any swordfish oh it's
26:12
because you know um leonardo has been
26:14
speaking italian that's why we didn't
26:15
catch them
26:16
[Laughter]
26:18
um we're gonna have to move on very
26:19
shortly to our next fact just one last
26:21
bodily control thing
26:22
yeah so this is about heating yourself
26:24
up there are monks in tibet who can
26:26
decide how hot they are
26:27
just through meditation i mean really
26:30
yes it's been tested and it's not like
26:32
a huge difference it's not as though
26:34
they'll be dangerous to touch
26:36
um but they can increase the temperature
26:38
of their extremities just through
26:40
meditation they're
26:40
they train themselves for years and
26:42
they're quite good at it there is a
26:43
report
26:44
which says that if you put wet sheets on
26:46
them they could be dry within an hour
26:48
but i think that is not true i think i
26:50
think that's an exaggeration
26:52
also i think it's quite offensive to do
26:54
that
26:55
meditating okay it is time for our final
26:59
fact of the show
27:00
and that is andy my fact is that in 1986
27:04
waddington's invented a board game which
27:06
was all about trading cattle seamen
27:09
this is a real game it's called grade up
27:13
to elite cow
27:14
it sells itself as a game of skill and
27:17
chance
27:18
for dairy farmers and we
27:21
have a copy here tonight
27:26
that's good it says from two to three
27:28
thousand players
27:31
this was by the british friesian cattle
27:33
society
27:34
and it's basically marketing for cattle
27:36
farmers
27:37
it's like monopoly basically uh but
27:40
instead of property you collect semen
27:42
um so there are various squares all the
27:44
way around and there are risks and
27:46
rewards uh here's one of the squares
27:48
accident to seamen flask all your semen
27:51
is lost unless an insurance policy is
27:53
held
27:54
return all your semen disks
27:57
is incredible amazing has anyone ever
27:59
played this do we know
28:00
lots of people if you go online i
28:02
started googling so many people have
28:04
played it really yeah there's a there's
28:06
a great website called
28:07
boardgamegeek.com and they have a lot of
28:09
reviews and the review oh nice
28:11
cool but the the reviews are i mean they
28:14
no one really loves the game but they
28:15
love the idea of it so
28:16
one of the reviews was monopoly with
28:19
cows
28:19
and seamen now the rules are quite
28:23
complicated
28:24
you start with little cows and you go
28:26
around the board and that you know
28:28
there are various seamen companies and
28:30
there's one thing which is um
28:32
there's many pitfalls along the way as
28:34
you're going around so
28:35
um you can pick up those market cards
28:38
that you get sort of like monopoly yeah
28:39
uh which will state stuff like
28:41
this cow has persistent mastitis seller
28:44
at the market price
28:45
it's a thoroughly realistic game
28:47
basically
28:48
well yeah i think so i think that's very
28:50
deceitful you can't sell account
28:52
market price you ask persistent mastitis
28:54
i noticed you didn't do this in um devon
28:56
where we were last week we've been
28:58
kicked out of town that's true so is it
29:02
it's
29:02
is to help farmers it doesn't help
29:05
anything
29:06
really but there are but there are lots
29:09
of ball games where the point was to
29:10
help so they used to have very moral
29:11
purposes
29:12
um so the new game of human life was a
29:15
1790 classic
29:16
and the aim of that was to be the first
29:18
player to become an old man
29:21
that's it charlie whoever's oldest at
29:23
the start has an advantage
29:26
you have to move through the seven
29:27
periods of life and accumulate moral
29:29
observations along the way
29:31
yeah have you heard of trump the game no
29:33
no
29:34
that was quite a big one actually it was
29:36
launched in 1989 with the tagline it's
29:38
not whether you win or lose
29:40
it's whether you win
29:42
[Laughter]
29:45
it's so perfect i hope it's on his
29:47
gravestone
29:49
the head of parker brothers said it can
29:51
leave you exhausted and feeling like you
29:53
don't want to play again
29:56
words later attributed to stormy daniels
30:01
can i just you mentioned the game of
30:03
life i think the early version and i
30:05
used to play the game of life as a kid
30:07
and it's amazing but it actually started
30:09
in 1860 and at that time it was called
30:11
the checkered game of life
30:13
and it was made by this lithographer so
30:15
like a image printer an artist
30:18
called milton bradley and he was very
30:21
successful
30:22
at the game of life but the reason he
30:23
had to make it is because he'd been very
30:25
unsuccessful in another way
30:27
so if you've ever played the game of
30:28
life the reason it exists is because
30:30
milton bradley made lithographs of
30:33
abraham lincoln
30:34
and that was when he was a presidential
30:36
nominee he wasn't very well known
30:38
and he didn't have a beard they were
30:40
clean shavings wasn't it like a little
30:42
girl who told him to get a beard or
30:43
something it was
30:44
yeah so him and this little girl would
30:46
have beef so he saw these lithographs
30:48
really well and they were extremely
30:50
popular and then lincoln suddenly
30:51
thought i'll grow my distinctive beard
30:53
that everyone will associate with me
30:55
forevermore and the prince became
30:56
totally worthless and this guy
30:58
milton bradley went completely bankrupt
31:01
and then he created the game of life
31:03
and he was a very moralistic guy so the
31:05
game of life
31:06
if you've ever played it has a spinning
31:08
thing in the center
31:09
rather than a dice and that is because
31:11
dice were associated with gambling and
31:13
he was very christian
31:15
and dice were evil so he had a spinning
31:17
tee totem
31:18
then um it's not funny actually it's
31:22
evil and
31:25
that's what it has but it came it became
31:27
super popular
31:28
oh we this is something i think we may
31:30
have mentioned before so during the
31:31
second world
31:32
war mi9 which is like the cool version
31:34
of mi five and six
31:36
they smuggled escape kits to prisoners
31:38
of
31:39
uh you know allied prisoners of war who
31:40
were being held in germany they smuggled
31:42
them escape kits inside monopoly
31:44
and the other thing they did they had
31:46
they got in touch with another firm and
31:47
they distributed snakes and ladders kits
31:50
with genuine escape equipment hidden
31:52
inside the actual ladders you couldn't
31:54
escape yes
31:54
[Laughter]
31:56
no it wasn't this wasn't an actual
31:57
ladder you could if i were a prison
32:00
god and someone had a snakes and ladders
32:02
kit delivered with an enormous spade
32:05
within the box i would notice yeah but
32:08
they they genuinely did it amazing
32:10
you know the game uh guess who you've
32:11
played that yeah that
32:13
that was invented by one of anne frank's
32:16
schoolmates
32:17
yeah and um it was two people who
32:20
invented guess who they became a couple
32:22
they actually knew each other at that
32:23
time as well they used to walk
32:25
to school together in the morning but
32:26
didn't go to the same school and
32:28
they ultimately invented not only guess
32:30
who but over 100 board games
32:32
many of which we know the names over
32:34
might have played for various different
32:35
countries
32:36
but they started their very first thing
32:38
was inventing a thing for the borden
32:40
dairy company
32:42
so they started by working for yeah for
32:44
cows as well
32:45
but that couple they i think got
32:47
separated at one point
32:49
and they had to well the the guy had to
32:52
to
32:52
find her and you know he went to the
32:55
police station and they
32:56
said does she have glasses and he said
32:58
no
32:59
and they said well is she wearing a hat
33:00
nevermind
33:03
god that was a long winter
33:07
the soviet union had amazing games oh
33:09
yeah they were also very moralistic so
33:11
there was
33:11
the game tuberculosis a proletarian
33:13
disease
33:14
um that was look after your health the
33:18
new hygiene game um
33:19
the abandoned where you had to round up
33:21
homeless children and take them to an
33:22
orphanage
33:24
and my favorite healthy living where you
33:26
had to become the healthiest worker
33:28
possible
33:29
so basically it was the soviet union
33:30
trying to inculcate its values into
33:32
people
33:32
so you'd be penalized for consulting
33:34
folk healers or drinking a beer at lunch
33:36
or consorting with a strange woman
33:40
fair enough crazy we're gonna have to
33:41
wrap up soon guys there's a kickstarter
33:44
which you can get involved in at the
33:45
moment it's a board game and it's called
33:47
brexit the board game of second chances
33:51
[Music]
33:53
and third chances
33:56
and they say we invite you to relive
33:58
that historic referendum
34:00

34:11
you i invite you to relive that historic
34:13
referendum and this time you're in
34:15
control you'd be like oh cool this is
34:16
hell then
34:19

34:21
must-have game to make all this
34:23
political mayhem
34:24

34:30

34:32

01:30
no such thing as a fish
01:32
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
01:34
live from cambridge
01:38
my name is dan schreiber and i am
01:40
sitting here with anna chazinski
01:42
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
01:44
and once again we have gathered round
01:46
the microphones with our four
01:48
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:50
and in no particular order
01:52
here we go starting with my fact
01:55
my fact this week is that adult scooters
01:57
were invented
01:58
by a swiss banker who was hungry for a
02:01
sausage
02:04
that's um that's true this was in the
02:07
1990s
02:08
there was a man who was a dutch swiss
02:09
banker and he was called a
02:11
whim orbiter and um he was at home one
02:15
night and he suddenly
02:16
really wanted to a sausage um and he
02:19
thought
02:20
i could you know it's a it's what he
02:21
called a micro distance
02:23
it wasn't far enough to get in a car and
02:25
drive there and find car parking
02:27
what the sausage shop yeah he had a
02:29
favorite sausage shop and it wasn't
02:31
um it wasn't close enough that he could
02:32
walk to it he thought why is there not a
02:34
device
02:35
that i could use to get me there and
02:36
then he suddenly had the idea of
02:38
turning what was only available really
02:40
for kids kids scooters why not make
02:42
an adult version of that so he invented
02:44
that as a result but by the time he's
02:46
invented it he's not going to want a
02:47
sausage anymore
02:48
that's the sad bit of this story yeah
02:51
he's starved to death
02:52
in the manufacturing process
02:56
no he so when he eventually had a
02:57
prototype he took it down to his town
02:59
and everyone laughed at him because the
03:01
idea of an adult on a scooter was seen
03:03
as a really ridiculous
03:04
ten years later and with the support of
03:06
his wife he had the prototype made into
03:08
a real thing it started going to market
03:10
it went to
03:11
big sales and then in america it got
03:13
sold with the name razer
03:15
razor scooters which i grew up uh riding
03:18
and um that was him it was down to the
03:19
man wanting a sausage
03:21
and he said he gave them sex appeal
03:23
which is something
03:24
i haven't seen evidence of yet on adults
03:27
on scooters but he said he described he
03:29
was like the tiny wheels the polished
03:31
aluminium
03:32
and the foam handlebars the combination
03:34
of those three things
03:35
gives them more sex appeal than your
03:37
average kids thing i don't know if foam
03:39
handlebars are sexy
03:40
but maybe that's just me i've got weird
03:43
taste
03:44
um there was a kind of really really
03:47
really proto scooter which was invented
03:49
uh in the early 19th century so it was
03:52
it was called the dandy horse it was
03:54
technically called a pedestrian caracal
03:56
um so it was invented in 1818 was when
03:59
it was first patented
04:01
and it was it had other names it was
04:03
called a swift walker
04:04
or a pedestrians accelerator that was
04:06
the name that was given
04:08
i can't believe this this is three years
04:09
after the battle of waterloo was over
04:10
but it was for fashionable
04:12
dandies in town and what it was was um
04:14
imagine a bicycle
04:15
and just take away the pedals okay so
04:17
you sit astride it on the
04:18
saddle and then you just have to push
04:20
yourself along the ground on either side
04:23
this was the ultra fashionable device in
04:25
london to have you know
04:26
there were only about 300 of them made
04:28
but it's the bizarre thing about the
04:30
dandy horse
04:30
is hey it appeared as you say in it was
04:33
1817 it was invented it was probably
04:35
1818
04:36
and it's suddenly come back right so
04:38
that's what you see kids going around on
04:39
them today they're
04:40
called balance bikes or whatever and it
04:42
helps them cycle and also
04:44
it was fashionable for a year so
04:46
invented 1817
04:48
really fashionable in london 1818
04:50
disappeared by 1819
04:51
and you can find articles by the 1830s
04:54
you've got articles going god remember
04:55
the dandios
04:56
that was weird wasn't it but that's
04:58
actually true of the adult scooters as
05:00
well
05:00
yeah um they are coming back in america
05:02
especially but in 1999 they had four
05:04
million dollars worth of sales 4.5
05:07
in 2000 it was 70 million and in 2001 it
05:10
gone back down to 6 million
05:12
so it's just that one year where they
05:13
became absolutely massive yeah
05:15
and then quite a few people got injured
05:16
i think yeah well what yeah what
05:19
happened was is um
05:20
he the problem he had was he made this
05:22
new innovation you could fold it was it
05:24
could go in your bag
05:25
everyone got excited immediately every
05:27
country that had
05:28
um copies you know pirated copies made
05:31
got in on the action so the market was
05:33
flooded with all this stuff and as you
05:34
say
05:35
handles weren't made properly so people
05:36
were chopping their not chopping their
05:37
fingers off but damaging them one person
05:40
one person lost a bit of a finger due to
05:41
a cheap imitation yeah
05:43
exactly they made the handles out of
05:45
knives or something
05:47
that's sexy
05:48
[Laughter]
05:50
they're made now there is this uh the
05:52
town that it's produced in is a it's
05:54
just outside of zurich and it's called
05:56
um
05:56
kusnat and it's where they manufacture
06:00
or where the headquarters for this razor
06:02
company is um
06:03
without the name razer his original
06:05
company um and it's a really cool town
06:07
it sounds like there's a lot of amazing
06:08
stuff that's happening going on there so
06:10
notable people outside of this razor
06:13
that is there
06:13
uh from that town include julius maggie
06:16
who
06:16
invented the pre-cooked soup maggie
06:19
noodles from this tiny tiny town
06:21
uh carl jung was from there you should
06:24
have lived with carl jung
06:27
well how about this um tina turner lives
06:30
there since 1994.
06:31
yeah carl jung tina turner and the magic
06:33
noodle guy yeah very exciting you put
06:35
those in the wrong order
06:38
but it is bizarre that scooters even
06:40
though we're claiming that this guy
06:42
invented them they are not a new
06:43
invention and i really had no idea that
06:45
these motorized scooters that you see
06:47
today were first
06:49
properly invented in 1915 and there were
06:51
loads of pictures in the early 20th
06:53
century of people going around on them
06:54
and again it was short-lived
06:55
between about 1915 and 1922 they were
06:58
partly a response to
07:00
wartime gas rationing so they didn't use
07:02
up very much petrol
07:04
and it was in america and they would
07:06
come with head and tail lights and a
07:07
toolbox
07:08
and um policemen used them post was
07:11
delivered on them postman
07:12
wait sorry are these things like vespers
07:14
or are they things like
07:22
i did read a source that said they were
07:24
used by a new york gang called the bog
07:27
trotters the long island box rosters
07:30
no who did exist and this is written in
07:33
a lot of books i've struggled to find
07:34
the primary newspaper reports that talk
07:36
about the bog trotters disappearing down
07:38
alleyways on push scooters
07:39
but yeah apparently they were really
07:41
useful for getting away from police they
07:42
just do a motorized scooter down anyway
07:44
yeah that is possible i guess
07:45
if you commit a crime at the top of a
07:46
hill you're laughing
07:48
[Applause]
07:49
um i found something about uh sort of
07:52
development of new
07:53
kinds of transport okay similar wartime
07:55
transport innovation
07:56
um so motorized roller skates uh so
08:00
separate roller case with motors inside
08:02
them were invented in the second world
08:04
war
08:05
four people in the war well the
08:07
inventors suggested that that would have
08:08
been
08:09
i mean the war i'm not gonna say the war
08:10
is fun because war isn't fun
08:12
no but if we all had motorized roller
08:14
skates it would have taken the edge off
08:16
would have taken the headshot well the
08:18
guy who invented them was called tom
08:19
hancock he took the mower out of a lawn
08:21
mower
08:21
and he he he basically put these he put
08:24
these engines on these roller skates and
08:26
there's footage
08:27
pathe news footage of him scootering
08:29
around and he's even got a little
08:30
trailer on the back which his daughter
08:31
sits on and she's just sitting there
08:33
going along the road and he suggested
08:36
that soldiers could use them to save on
08:37
marching
08:38
and he was not taken up on his offer
08:40
basically
08:43
but they're coming back those are the
08:45
segway last year invented motorized
08:47
roller skates really
08:49
but they were not greeted with great
08:50
favor uh headlines included
08:52
segue is back and it's coming for your
08:54
last shred of dignity
08:57
uh segway's east gates are a whole new
08:59
way to look cool while falling over
09:02
and wired magazine named them the object
09:04
in the office most likely to kill you
09:08
yeah but these electric scooters they
09:09
are quite popular now in america in a
09:11
lot of cities
09:12
they have like a kind of uber thing or a
09:14
boris bike kind of thing where you can
09:16
you can take them for a small amount of
09:17
money and take them around can't you
09:19
lyme and bird are the two main companies
09:21
the problem is they're new and so
09:23
for instance the scooters that bird has
09:25
got um they're rebranded um
09:27
xiaomi devices which have a weight limit
09:30
of 200 pounds
09:32
when the average american man weighs
09:34
197.9 pounds
09:36
and a couple of weeks ago lime did an
09:38
official statement saying there was a
09:40
bug
09:40
that caused sudden excessive braking
09:44
and they said it's all right it only
09:45
happens when being ridden downhill at
09:47
top speed
09:52
excessive braking is not what you want
09:54
is it no basically you go down
09:56
downhill and you'd hit something small
09:58
on the road and the whatever's in the in
10:00
the scooter makes it think that it's a
10:01
massive
10:02
obstacle and just immediately stops oh
10:04
god they did say i should say for the
10:06
legal reasons that fewer than 0.0045
10:09
of all rides worldwide have been
10:11
affected that's that's covered
10:13
[Music]
10:15
um the segway has a chequered history
10:17
doesn't it and
10:18
the guy who invented the segue dean
10:20
caiman in fact thought it was going to
10:21
take over the world
10:23
so and he called it ginger after ginger
10:25
rogers because i guess they're so
10:26
elegant
10:27
but he also invented a bunch of other
10:30
things so he invented a robotic
10:31
wheelchair
10:32
which goes upstairs which is quite cool
10:34
so the wheels climb over each other so
10:35
you can get up the stairs
10:36
he also invented a person cannon uh
10:40
this is right technically called a
10:42
controllable launcher
10:43
and it's a cannon that fires its payload
10:46
as in the person that you put in it
10:48
onto the top of buildings so if you're
10:51
i mean that doesn't sound really cool
10:53
doesn't it
10:54
but hang on do you set the height of the
10:56
building that you want to get onto the
10:58
top of course you do
11:02
they're not all set ups with the size of
11:03
the shard
11:05
and then you've just got a one-story
11:06
house you wouldn't want to be going to
11:09
the top of the shard though because even
11:10
if you get right to the top you're
11:11
instantly impaled
11:16
what if you work on the 15th floor in
11:18
the building's 30 floors
11:19
you're still as far away could you open
11:21
a window and just get propelled through
11:23
that
11:23
wait what do you mean open window they
11:25
don't want to go inside the building
11:26
it's not just a quick way of getting to
11:27
work what are you saying
11:29
you were saying it fires you onto the
11:30
top of a building yes if you're if
11:31
you're sorry if you're a fireman or
11:32
something the building's on fire
11:34
if there's a terrorist up there it's not
11:36
just oh i'm too lazy to use the lift i
11:38
don't want to be without scum in there
11:40
just get my person camera if there's a
11:42
terrorist
11:43
i would have been a great scene at die
11:44
hard when bruce willis gets a lot to the
11:46
top
11:48
he said it was his potential uses were
11:50
anti-terrorism i don't remember when
11:52
terrorists have hidden on the top of
11:53
buildings and we haven't been able to
11:54
get to them
11:55
but this is what we need when they do
11:57
and apparently it would land you gently
11:59
at a safe impact distance
12:03
they thought the segway would be bigger
12:04
than the internet though they said this
12:06
is going to be the biggest thing since
12:07
the internet they said
12:08
this is going to render cars obsolete
12:10
and then the problem with it is that
12:12
they did it in massive secrecy so they
12:14
were really paranoid when they were
12:15
making it that
12:16
japan was working on something similar
12:18
so everyone who was making it had to
12:20
have all their blinds like nailed down
12:22
properly taped shut so no one could see
12:23
anything
12:24
but they couldn't test it because they
12:25
were so paranoid about other people
12:26
seeing it so they were astonished when
12:28
it was left outside and only weirdos and
12:30
nerds
12:31
used them um i've got four
12:35
well exactly i'm gonna have to move us
12:37
on in a second to our next fact i've got
12:39
one tiny fact this is just about sort of
12:41
little motorized forms of transport um
12:44
since
12:44
uh donald trump became the president um
12:47
the secret service has spent three
12:49
hundred thousand dollars renting golf
12:50
carts from him so they can protect him
12:52
while he plays golf
12:54
yeah just in case anyone was on the
12:57
fence about him at this point
13:00
okay it's time for fact number two and
13:02
that is anna
13:03
my fact this week is that goats have
13:05
been engineered to produce spider silk
13:07
because when farmers tried to get the
13:09
spiders to do it themselves they just
13:11
kept eating each other
13:13
and this is an amazing thing that goes
13:16
well engineered to do in the early 2000s
13:19
they have been genetically spliced with
13:21
the protein from spiders that makes
13:23
their silk
13:24
and apparently farmers have been trying
13:26
to farm spider silk for over a hundred
13:27
years
13:28
but it's a complete nightmare because
13:29
they're territorial cannibalistic
13:31
predators that will eat anything
13:34
[Laughter]
13:38
um so yeah it didn't work and then they
13:41
finally found out that you can put these
13:42
genes in goats which don't tend to eat
13:44
each other
13:45
unless you've got a very unhappy farm
13:47
and
13:48
they're what's called transgenic so a
13:50
transgenic
13:51
transgenic is when you have the dna of
13:54
something totally different
13:55
put into you and the it comes out in
13:57
their milk they're not just weaving
13:59
these webs you can't
14:00
see them
14:12
imagine if you got bit by a radioactive
14:15
goat of this kind
14:17
just the thing to explain your
14:18
superpower would be so long
14:20
and the reason i've climbed up this
14:22
apparently sheer wall of a dam
14:26
niche goat reference so the spiders at
14:30
the early versions where they did this
14:32
they put a spider in a tiny little
14:33
almost like the stocks you know if you
14:35
throw like um
14:37
did it have eight holes
14:38
[Laughter]
14:41
it was just for the abdomen and you put
14:42
the spider in there and then you'd put a
14:44
thing in and it would pull all the
14:45
spider silk out uh but the thing is they
14:48
kept all the spiders together
14:49
and eventually the spiders spun the webs
14:51
over the walls so it's completely
14:53
covered
14:54
which meant that no other insects or
14:55
mosquitoes could get in
14:57
and so they ended up not having anything
14:58
to eat which is why they all at each
15:00
other
15:01
and then eventually there was only few
15:02
left alive but they were all absolutely
15:04
massive because they'd eaten all their
15:05
mates
15:07
and that's why it never kind of
15:14
um just a thing on spider silk that i
15:17
didn't know
15:18
is how useful it has been already in the
15:20
past so
15:21
for instance it's been totally vital to
15:22
astronomy i don't know this so for 250
15:25
years
15:26
it was used in telescopes and it's used
15:28
in the eyepieces of telescopes
15:30
and it acts as a kind of as crosshairs
15:33
basically
15:34
so if you're looking through a normal
15:35
telescope you see these shadows of stars
15:37
you need some kind of references it's
15:38
amazing you never got that job at the
15:39
sky
15:40
of night do you think that's a common
15:42
complaint that they go
15:44
ah man it's too many
15:48
it was it's not there's too many is that
15:49
you can't pinpoint where they are
15:51
and so what you do is you need
15:52
crosshairs to act as a reference point
15:54
and the perfect crosshairs a spider silk
15:56
and so they've been used in telescopes
15:58
for hundreds of years they used to have
16:00
a spider silk collector at the granite
16:02
greenwich or the observatory until the
16:04
1950s and um there was i was actually
16:06
reading the astronomical guidelines from
16:08
the 1890s
16:09
about how to collect spider silk and it
16:11
says you have to stand on a stool
16:14
and you hang a spider from a piece of
16:16
wood and then as it drops you wind it's
16:18
thread with a fork
16:19
so you just collect its thread with a
16:20
fork so this poor spider thinks it's
16:21
dropping and dropping and it's just
16:23
staying in the same place
16:24
and then it sometimes says if arachne is
16:26
inclined however to be obstinate
16:28
gently blow on her with a full steady
16:30
breath
16:32
and she will weave but this is how
16:34
they've been pinpointing where stars are
16:36
that's incredible
16:36
it's amazing i can't believe that you
16:38
can collect it and store it like that
16:40
oh yeah well another thing was in war
16:43
it's very useful so in the second world
16:45
war it was used in gun sights
16:47
for the same reason you put it on the
16:49
lens of gun sights and it was exactly
16:51
that reason to help you focus
16:52
and there was a team of spider ticklers
16:55
who were in the lives
16:57
yep the us employed the main one was
16:59
called nan songer and a bunch of other
17:01
women
17:01
who tickled spiders she tickled so many
17:04
webs out of spiders that the us had to
17:06
appeal to mexico
17:07
for extra spider imports because she'd
17:09
exhausted all the web available in
17:11
america
17:12
i mean how many spiders are there in
17:14
america yeah she kind of tickled every
17:16
single one
17:16
she was pacing through those spiders you
17:19
you're on roller skates you
17:20
you're tickling spiders are we going
17:23
to win this war i think there's been
17:28
debate uh not serious debate but debate
17:30
nonetheless about what kind of
17:32
um spider bit spider-man
17:35
um the theory is that finally we got to
17:38
the big issue
17:41
spider-man uh must be one or another
17:43
kind of spider because it wasn't just
17:45
other spider that bitter was it so
17:47
so tarantulas probably produce silk from
17:49
their feet but that's oh yeah because he
17:51
doesn't
17:51
when he fires the silk it's out of his
17:53
hands he doesn't pull it out of his bum
17:55
doesn't he would if
17:56
yes if he had been bitten by a
17:58
radioactive house spider he would have
17:59
to laboriously
18:01
his costume would look very different
18:03
for example
18:05
and they really wanted to make the film
18:06
a pg so they were like
18:08
find me another species mate
18:11
um yeah i mean it's it's worth saying
18:14
that spider-man
18:15
has gadgets that shoot out the web it's
18:17
not actual
18:18
shooting out of his arms really when the
18:20
movies at least i don't know he can't
18:22
stick to walls county or does he have
18:23
flights he can success
18:25
i did not know that i haven't the thing
18:27
is the four people who know least about
18:29
spider-man in this room
18:31
on the stage everyone else is going off
18:33
for [ __ ] sake guys
18:36
um if you don't have any fishing bait
18:38
when you're going fishing
18:40
an alternative to use um particularly if
18:42
you're in the solomon islands
18:44
is spider silk um they have a fish there
18:47
which is called the needlefish and its
18:49
mouth is too small to eat
18:51
any of the classic luring bait that you
18:53
use so what they do there is they use
18:55
like a kite string so they throw that
18:58
out into the water
18:59
and they attach to it blobs of um rolled
19:02
up
19:02
silk from a spider's web and they will
19:04
just bounce it on the water
19:06
and what happens is that these fish come
19:08
up and they leap into it and they get
19:09
stuck to it
19:10
and then they pull them back and that's
19:11
how they catch them so that's their
19:13
that's their thing
19:15
couldn't they then just swim off but
19:17
with a mouth that stuck together
19:19
no because the guy's got the kite string
19:21
he's pulling them you got the clutch
19:22
string sorry
19:32
just sit by the side of the lake for two
19:36
hours
19:38
that's shown that fish i bet that's
19:40
really uncomfortable in its mouth right
19:42
now
19:43
that's fishing
19:47
okay we're gonna have to move on to fact
19:49
number three and that
19:50
is andy my fact is that when king george
19:53
vi
19:54
visited washington an american chemist
19:56
provided the royals with special
19:58
london water so they could have exactly
20:00
the same tea as they had
20:02
in britain and this was the first time
20:05
the king had
20:06
uh any king had visited a sitting u.s
20:08
president
20:09
uh because of all the unpleasantness uh
20:12
previously
20:13
can i ask this this water it wasn't that
20:16
they brought it over from london
20:18
what was it no they didn't they they
20:20
they made it up they sort of analyzed
20:21
the chemicals in it and a chemist called
20:23
bets offered to provide special london
20:25
water and the white house said that's a
20:27
very nice and hospitable thing to do
20:29
we'll have five gallons of it
20:31
and then halfway through the royal visit
20:33
bet's got another telegram
20:34
saying we find we will need far more
20:36
water than we asked for
20:38
would it be possible and could you be so
20:40
kind as to furnish us with 20 more
20:41
gallons
20:42
um because the royals evidently drank a
20:44
lot more tea than the americans have
20:46
bargained for
20:47
i looked it up if you if that was small
20:48
cups of tea the original
20:50
consignment would have made 120 small
20:52
cups of tea
20:53
and then they asked for enough to make
20:55
another 500 cups of tea
20:57
wow and he was only there four days or
20:59
something wasn't it yeah
21:01
so it must have been lots of people
21:02
drinking it no it's just the king
21:05
it was a big trip they um when they went
21:07
there they were received
21:08
outside the white house by over 250 000
21:11
people
21:12
it was it was mayhem everyone came out
21:14
to see that um they made
21:16
a lot of trips this was uh when the war
21:17
was about to kick off so
21:19
it was very symbolic the trip that they
21:20
were doing and georgia 6
21:22
went to visit the tomb of uh george
21:25
washington
21:26
um who obviously was a foe of his great
21:29
great great
21:30
grandfather um so that was a huge
21:32
symbolic moment
21:33
to visit yeah the man who effectively
21:35
kicked us out of
21:37
america and so that his revolting tea
21:39
all over that tombstone
21:40
um they also as well as that they um had
21:43
hot dogs for the first time the first
21:44
time a royal had had a hot dog
21:46
the headline in new york times said king
21:48
tries hot dog and ass for more
21:51
um they were the hot dogs were served on
21:52
a silver tray and
21:54
apparently the queen at the time which
21:57
was that was the queen mother yeah
21:59
um she asked roosevelt how to eat a hot
22:01
dog and roosevelt said very simple
22:03
push it into your mouth and keep pushing
22:05
until it is all gone
22:08
it's good advice in general a surefire
22:10
recipe for choking
22:12
well then she used the knife and park
22:14
after that did she yeah
22:15
no photographers are allowed to take
22:17
photos because of the royals eating hot
22:18
dogs yeah i mean that's the thing
22:20
i think you're not allowed to take a
22:21
photo of the queen eating now are you
22:23
you know
22:23
you don't want that phallic shot do you
22:25
you don't want the hot dog going into
22:27
the queen you don't have a whole sale
22:29
yeah you know what the president of the
22:30
united states shoving a sausage
22:32
in the queen's face do you it's vampire
22:36
um i was i looked up a little bit about
22:38
tea um
22:39
you know carl linnaeus yeah categorizing
22:43
uh life uh he was really desperate he
22:46
wanted to import a lot of plants and
22:48
because
22:48
he was a specimen collector and he was
22:50
desperate to bring back tea from the
22:51
east
22:52
and time and time again he failed to
22:54
bring back any tea from the east
22:55
so he tried 20 different times to get a
22:58
single tea plant
23:00
from china where it wasn't but what
23:01
happened did he keep getting halfway
23:03
through and then just thinking i could
23:04
do with a brew
23:06
well they died on route uh other times
23:08
they were eaten by rats or mice
23:10
there was once a time where he had a
23:12
student called pear osbeck who had
23:13
managed to source a tea plant
23:15
and he got it all the way to the cape of
23:16
good hope sailing all the way back from
23:18
china
23:19
and then it was there was a sudden
23:20
whirlwind and it was blown overboard
23:23
another one another one fell off ship
23:25
when the ship blasted a ceremonial gun
23:27
as it left the harbour
23:31
put it below deck what are they doing i
23:33
know but i know but why have they only
23:35
got one specimen each time
23:37
i reckon like the 13th time i'll be like
23:39
why don't we take two this time just in
23:41
case
23:42
so the the following assistant after the
23:44
gun debacle
23:45
uh he was called lagastram and he too he
23:47
brought a plant back to upseller he
23:49
managed it he made it brought a plant
23:50
back and then he nurtured it over two
23:52
years before finding out it was the
23:53
wrong one
23:55
was it because is this in china that he
23:56
was taking the the police
23:58
yeah so it was that china had a
24:00
stronghold over t and they didn't want
24:02
that could that was the biggest most
24:03
dangerous thing to their economy for you
24:05
to take that out
24:06
and there was as a result of as someone
24:08
actually managing to smuggle it out
24:10
and setting it up that's what gave birth
24:13
to so much
24:14
of how the west became powerful
24:16
basically through tea
24:18
it was if i made that i feel like you're
24:20
looking at me
24:23
some more clarity wouldn't go in this
24:26
[Laughter]
24:27
so i was looking at tea so teas are very
24:30
british
24:32
thing the brits have been very proud of
24:33
their team making their concert they're
24:34
addicted to tea basically have been for
24:36
a long time
24:36
and to the extent that in war it's been
24:39
really useful
24:40
and every single tank every single
24:42
armored tank to this day
24:44
uh has team making facilities in it and
24:47
this is because
24:48
uh it caused a serious problem in the
24:50
war so in the second world war just off
24:52
the normandy landings
24:53
there was a british battalion a british
24:54
tank battalion who had a couple of
24:56
minutes to spare so they did what all
24:58
british troops did with a couple of
25:00
minutes to spare
25:01
they popped out of their tanks tickled a
25:02
few spiders they tickled some spiders
25:05
and had a quick roller skate
25:08
and they made a tea and they made this
25:11
tea
25:12
and the enemy saw that they were doing
25:14
that and they
25:15
sort of destroyed them and their tanks
25:17
and so it became apparent that there
25:19
needed to be tea making facilities
25:20
within tanks
25:22
and you couldn't put petrol and light
25:23
fires in tanks to make tea and so
25:25
tanks were all equipped in their little
25:27
funnel in the sort of chimney
25:29
with proper team making facilities that
25:31
were designed for tanks that use the
25:32
electricity that the tank used
25:34
and it was inside the turret and they
25:35
are still used to this day
25:37
and it was because the brits needed to
25:39
drink tea at all times so
25:41
cool that's amazing even in tanks um
25:44
we're gonna have to move on shortly to
25:46
our final fact
25:47
can i just i've got some stuff about
25:49
milk and tea so the way
25:50
the brits drink tea is with milk and i
25:53
wanted to know when that actually
25:54
started and so the first person to
25:56
recommend drinking tea with milk was
25:58
a guy called thomas garway in 1670. so
26:01
no one drunk tea with milk then most
26:03
other countries they don't but he
26:05
wrote a pamphlet called an exact
26:07
description of the quality and virtues
26:09
of leaf tea
26:10
drawn up for the satisfaction of persons
26:12
of quality
26:13
and he gave a bunch of reasons why tea
26:16
is a great thing to drink so he said if
26:18
you add milk to it
26:19
it avoids looseness in the bowels which
26:22
is quite good to know
26:24
i think uh he also said the good thing
26:25
about tears it prevents fevers by
26:27
provoking a most gentle vomit
26:29
[Laughter]
26:32
he was really weird then he said it
26:34
makes the body active and lusty
26:36
and he said that this was something that
26:37
he'd learned from japanese law that have
26:39
been brought over
26:40
the best deal to be gathered by virgins
26:43
they're the only people who are
26:44
qualified to gather the best tea
26:45
yes you were saying about vomiting the
26:48
the reason that we have tea
26:49
in britain is due to vomiting and this
26:51
is because
26:52
um when charles ii married catherine of
26:54
braganza of portugal
26:56
and she brought the idea of tea over it
26:58
had been a few people had had it but it
27:00
wasn't really popular
27:01
and she came over to the uk on a boat
27:04
and it was an extremely stormy crossing
27:06
and when she arrived she was feeling
27:07
really really sick so she asked for a
27:09
cup of tea
27:09
and everyone went what the [ __ ] tea
27:11
and they didn't know what tea was
27:12
and so they gave her instead a glass of
27:14
veil um
27:16
which unsurprisingly did not make her
27:18
feel better at all and so she decided
27:20
that we're going to have to have a lot
27:21
more tea in the country and then
27:23
it became much more popular thanks for
27:24
that
27:27
god imagine if you went traveling and
27:29
you got to the other end and they said
27:30
what the [ __ ] tea
27:32
you'd go back have you ever heard of
27:35
america
27:40
um okay it's time for our final fact of
27:42
the show and that
27:43
is james okay my fact this week is that
27:46
many
27:47
millipede researchers are annoyed that
27:49
more than 70 years after world war ii
27:52
the animals are still associated with
27:53
the nazis
27:57
it's certainly the first symbol i have
27:59
in mind when i think
28:00
nazi so this is true
28:03
apparently um oh a very early qualifier
28:09
well i was told this by our good friend
28:10
erica mcallister who works in the
28:12
natural history museum
28:14
why are they nazi insects well i googled
28:16
it and it apparently comes from the dig
28:18
for victory campaign
28:20
so do you remember during world war ii
28:21
the people who were left home they
28:23
weren't tickling
28:24
spiders and they weren't playing with
28:25
the roller skates and stuff like that
28:27
they were making food at home so that we
28:29
wouldn't run out of food
28:30
and so they sent a load of pamphlets
28:32
around to everyone saying this is what
28:34
you have to do this is how to plant
28:35
sprouts and this is how to dig up
28:37
potatoes
28:37
but it also said this is what you have
28:39
to do with pests and they had
28:41
a picture of a centipede and a picture
28:43
of a millipede and they said the
28:44
centipede was a fast moving friend
28:46
and the millipede was a slow moving
28:48
enemy and they showed you how to tell
28:50
the difference between the two of them
28:51
and the millipede was holding a massive
28:53
swastika
28:56
right i'm sorry is that the main way you
28:58
tell the difference even today
29:01
but the reason was that centipedes um
29:03
eat insects
29:05
and millipedes eat plant matter and so
29:07
if you're
29:08
making vegetables what you don't want is
29:10
insects that are going to eat the roots
29:12
of your plants but you do want
29:13
centipedes that might eat the other
29:14
pests
29:15
but in actual fact millipedes mostly eat
29:18
decaying
29:18
organic matter um they have very weak
29:21
mouths so they can't really eat tubers
29:22
and stuff like that so this
29:23
it was completely ridiculous i can't eat
29:25
a tuber um
29:28
fair place here thank god we've
29:32
resuscitated the reputation of the
29:33
millipede
29:36
everyone thought was a fascist
29:37
millipedes don't have a thousand legs
29:40
sometimes researching this show is just
29:42
horrible
29:43
i i they have 750 is the most they've
29:46
ever had
29:47
yeah there is a theory that one day
29:50
there could be a millipede with a
29:51
thousand legs
29:52
why because i believe that some of the
29:54
some of them
29:55
develop extra legs the longer they live
29:57
really yeah
29:58
well they all do millipedes all add legs
30:01
to themselves as they're growing so when
30:02
they're born they're born with about
30:03
three pairs of legs yeah
30:05
and it's kind of like uh they're adding
30:07
to each other like their lego or
30:08
something like a conga line they're
30:09
constantly adding
30:10
a new segment they shed they molt and
30:13
then they add a new segment with legs
30:15
so if they live forever i guess they
30:17
would but if they live forever yes
30:19
or a thousand years um a thousand years
30:23
just like the third reich was predicted
30:25
too
30:29
and more and more evidence as we look
30:31
for it
30:33
well there's this is the really cool one
30:34
the it's called iliac meat plenipedes
30:36
uh which is the one with the most legs
30:37
ever it only lives in california under a
30:40
particular boulder
30:42
sorry it lives in a very small
30:45
four and a half square kilometers not a
30:47
boulder four and a half kilometers it
30:48
was found under a boulder it was missing
30:50
for 80 years
30:53
and then it was rediscovered they should
30:54
have just looked under the boulder
30:56
yeah should have looked in argentina um
31:02
that's too much it's too much um
31:06
but um this is oh this is a really weird
31:09
thing oh yeah the male of this
31:11
species iliac me plenipedes or plenipes
31:14
um it has converted two of its legs into
31:16
sex organs yeah which is a thing that
31:18
some animals can do
31:20
that's what millipedes tend to do their
31:21
legs turn into penises
31:24
during puberty imagine that 13 years old
31:27
and one of your legs turns into a penis
31:32
that's a rough day at school isn't it
31:36
you would hope your shoes had fit
31:40
and why aren't you doing pe today well
31:44
uh yeah it sounds pretty dramatic
31:45
actually their whole bodily makeup
31:47
changes this is a recent study that
31:49
looked into what happens when
31:50
they hit puberty and it's usually on
31:53
their fifth sixth or seventh segment
31:55
those legs turn into a gonopod or
31:58
gonopod
31:59
and that's basically sort of penises
32:00
that clasp the female while they put
32:02
sperm into her
32:03
and it involves the rearrangement of all
32:05
their internal organs basically
32:07
and it's an exhausting process in terms
32:09
of energy consumption to turn your legs
32:11
into a penis
32:12
and so some adolescent male millipedes
32:17
go through reverse adolescence because
32:19
they
32:20
they develop the penis legs and then
32:22
they're so exhausted they're basically
32:23
at starvation level because they've used
32:25
so much energy and so they go backwards
32:27
again they're like i'm knackered
32:29
i can't deal with this hole so they turn
32:31
their leg penises back into legs yeah
32:33
yeah they reverse adolescence wow
32:36
imagine if spider-man was bitten by a
32:40
melody
32:45
this one's definitely not a pg guys
32:47
[Laughter]
32:51
so okay well madagascar's giant pill
32:54
millipedes they have a music making
32:56
organ on their back side the males is
32:59
called a harp and the females is a
33:01
washboard
33:02
and basically it's like a load of ridges
33:04
but both sexes have a knob
33:06
on their back side of the last pair of
33:07
legs which they rub across their
33:09
backsides to make noises
33:11
wow so like the female sounds a bit like
33:14
um
33:15
like a washboard and a male sounds like
33:17
it's like it's like a skiffle group
33:21
whereas a lot of them are deaf as well
33:23
tragically so they make this music to
33:24
seduce each other
33:26
but they can't hear and so we don't
33:28
really know what the point is
33:30
wow could they have vibrations
33:33
in their hairs yeah yeah but they can't
33:35
hear the beautiful skiffle music that's
33:37
been created
33:38
very sad you know some of them have um
33:40
this is just quite a cool thing they
33:41
have spiral stomachs
33:43
to give themselves a larger surface area
33:45
to digest food
33:46
because obviously they're very very long
33:48
so if the food is going around a spiral
33:50
it gets maximum surface area
33:53
very clever very clever they give
33:57
each other back massages yeah
34:00
this is actually how they seduce their
34:02
mates is they give
34:03
the ladies a back massage so the
34:07
millipede's defense mechanism is to curl
34:08
up into a ball into a spiral
34:10
and sometimes if she hears a male coming
34:12
she thinks or she's male coming she
34:14
thinks oh that's a threat
34:15
and so she curls up tightly and to try
34:17
and seduce her he'll walk over her back
34:20
until she relax lower
34:23
lower still got a long way to go
34:26
but that's that's not to me
34:30
if you if you turn that into human terms
34:32
if you were seducing and you gave a back
34:34
massage you would go with hands
34:35
you wouldn't anyone who gets a massage
34:37
when you suddenly feel
34:38
someone standing on your back is that
34:41
the thing like there is something
34:42
like my wife had a massage the other day
34:46
um and she had people walking all over
34:48
her back
34:49
is she yeah it's a thing there you go
34:50
and imagine if those people had 750 legs
34:53
that would be a good massage
34:54
i'm going to get a call one of them's a
34:56
penis
34:58
you were never seeing them again
35:02
we're gonna have to wrap up shortly guys
35:03
oh yeah i've got one quick thing
35:05
um which is that lemurs self-medicate
35:07
using millipedes
35:09
this is really cool so they get these uh
35:11
infestations of thread worms which are
35:12
very nasty things
35:14
around their mouth and around their
35:15
anuses and um
35:17
they they sort of crawl out and then
35:18
they lay their eggs in your skin around
35:20
those two areas thread worms they're
35:21
very unpleasant to get
35:22
so lemurs uh have a particular kind of
35:25
millipede which has a chemical defense
35:27
mechanism inside it and it can blind and
35:30
poison predators and it's quite strong
35:31
so the lemurs
35:32
chew on the millipedes and then they rub
35:34
the remains around their mouths and
35:36
around their anuses and then they
35:38
swallow them
35:39
uh and that uh repels everyone
35:47
it's an awful moment for the millipede
35:49
when i think oh this is a real low point
35:51
in my life i'm being used as lip balm
35:54
little does it know the anus is coming
35:58
[Laughter]

[Applause]
00:11
hello
00:12
and welcome to another episode of no
00:14
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:17
this week coming to you live from boston
00:24
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
00:27
here with anna cizinski
00:29
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:31
and once again we have gathered round
00:33
the microphones with our four
00:34
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:36
and in no particular order
00:38
here we go starting with fact number one
00:41
and that's my fact this week
00:43
my fact is the 95 year old billionaire
00:46
who controls viacom and cbs now
00:49
communicates via an
00:50
ipad pre-loaded with audio clips
00:54
his choices include yes
00:57
no and you
01:02
so how does this work he's you're having
01:04
a conversation with him
01:05
and rather than respond with his mouth
01:07
then he responds by clicking a button
01:09
he's a very old man now he's 95 years
01:11
old and
01:12
um his speaking has gone quite bad so um
01:16
his communication is very bad so what
01:18
they've done is they've
01:19
they've helped him swear at people um
01:22
with as much force via a button um yeah
01:25
because he can't
01:26
swallow kind of he has a problem with
01:28
his throat um he is fed through a tube
01:30
and he really really likes steak and he
01:32
wants to eat steak but they won't never
01:34
let him because he has this tube
01:35
and they say the only way he can get rid
01:37
of his tube is if he conserves his
01:39
energy
01:40
by reducing his sexual activity to once
01:42
a week
01:45
and he refuses
01:48
is he called redstone he is he's called
01:50
sumner redstone
01:51
um he's a very big media mogul um he has
01:54
a lot of you know cbs and so on and
01:56
things that are underneath that are like
01:58
paramount pictures and so on his family
02:00
have a company which is the national
02:02
amusement theater chain and that's what
02:04
that all sits underneath
02:05
he has a majority vote so he's the big
02:07
dog really um so
02:09
he's a very important guy and he kind of
02:11
like he's done a few things that have
02:12
gone into
02:13
pop culture um content is king is a
02:16
thing he coined
02:17
um is that something that we're all
02:19
supposed to know about
02:23
i think he would be very hurt by that
02:24
comment i know what he'd say
02:28
[Laughter]
02:31
what is that what is what content is
02:34
king you know
02:36
it's been said it's not a very old
02:39
saying sorry you're saying he invented
02:41
the non-existent catchphrase content is
02:43
king is this kind of he's been
02:44
churning out he's a billionaire
02:46
yeah that's all you need to do
02:47
apparently just one catchphrase and you
02:49
become a billionaire no he's got a
02:51
giant empire behind a real catchphrase
02:53
that's not like nice to see you to see
02:55
you nice
02:56
brucy came out and shouted content is
02:58
king
03:00
he's not on tv yelling it's
03:04
where is he he's behind the scenes but
03:06
why when is he saying content is king in
03:08
a way that's become
03:09
so famous he's going to get meetings
03:11
when bruce foresight is going what do
03:12
you think i've got this great
03:13
catchphrase but i've got no show that's
03:14
03:15
content is king that's when he's saying
03:17
it
03:18
but the thing is is it's hard to know
03:19
whether the you that he says
03:21
um or the f you let's stop swearing the
03:23
f you uh
03:25
is said as a mean thing or nice thing
03:27
there was an interview with one of his
03:28
advisors a wealth advisor called rebecca
03:30
rothstein
03:31
and she said i've only been the
03:32
recipient of an fu once
03:34
i think he meant it in an endearing way
03:38
it's all to do with how he presses the
03:39
button i suppose
03:41
take your cue from things like that yeah
03:44
wow
03:44
was he known for being a particularly
03:46
bad boss
03:48
you know is this something he uses a lot
03:49
this button well he's a big he is a big
03:52
character there's a lot of controversy
03:53
in his personal life in his business
03:55
life um it's hard to say don't know the
03:56
guy but yeah um
03:58
we're talking about a billionaire i
03:59
don't want to say anything libelous
04:01
right now
04:02
it's an what are you going to do
04:03
[Laughter]
04:07
all my researcher is on
04:09
billionaires so
04:11
we're in trouble one guy who admits that
04:13
he used to be a bad boss is bill gates
04:16
um i think he's got a much more cuddly
04:19
image now but
04:20
when he was first working at microsoft
04:21
when he was first in charge of microsoft
04:23
bill gates knew everyone's car license
04:25
plates so he could look out into the car
04:27
park
04:28
and see when people were arriving and
04:30
leaving from their work and he only
04:31
stopped doing that when the company got
04:33
so big that he could not
04:34
physically remember everyone's life if
04:36
only you could come up with a system of
04:38
putting letters and numbers in a big
04:40
file
04:44
[Laughter]
04:49
he i was actually reading a thing in the
04:52
guardian
04:52
where they asked people to write in and
04:54
say examples of bad bosses and what they
04:56
made them do
04:57
and one of them may have been a bill
04:58
gates employee because one of these
05:00
people wrote in and said
05:01
my boss made us all park our cars facing
05:04
the same direction for neatness
05:06
in the car park yeah that same boss said
05:09
that all of your buttons have to be made
05:10
of pearls because plastic buttons
05:12
are ugly and then yeah this isn't i
05:15
don't think this is bill gates
05:17
no i don't think that is bill gates that
05:18
that would be like they do call him
05:20
pearly gates
05:21
so maybe that's why there you go yeah
05:23
that's why
05:24
[Laughter]
05:26
there was just in this list of this list
05:29
of things for the guardian these are
05:30
some other
05:31
other things people have had to deal
05:32
with with bad bosses someone wrote in
05:34
and said that they got a round robin
05:35
email from their boss saying please can
05:37
everyone do their
05:38
number twos before they come into the
05:40
office because i don't like going into
05:41
the bathrooms and having them smell bad
05:43
so that's some advice from a boss
05:45
another boss banned all paper clips
05:47
because once he'd accidentally
05:49
clipped some sensitive material to the
05:51
back of someone's appraisal
05:53
which they'd read and another boss said
05:56
that
05:57
all equipment in the entire office needs
05:59
to be clearly labeled by friday
06:01
otherwise disciplinary action will be
06:03
taken
06:03
and that included things like every
06:05
single thing by friday things like
06:07
chair light switch door floor and
06:10
ceiling
06:12
ceiling someone had to get a steplad
06:14
around
06:16
i found a thing about uh how to be
06:18
successful at work in relation to your
06:20
boss
06:20
okay so if you keep a religious symbol
06:24
at your desk
06:24
your boss is less likely to ask you to
06:26
act unethically
06:28
and it can be simple from any religion
06:29
so there was a study of this in india
06:31
and if they found that their bosses you
06:33
know put less pressure on them to bend
06:35
the rules or to
06:36
you know be rude to other people and it
06:38
also works if you put a virtuous
06:40
quotation at the end of your email
06:42
like better to fail with honor than
06:44
succeed with fraud
06:48
but when you say it's getting them you
06:49
you ask them to do less
06:51
fraudulent things that we said is it not
06:53
that you just spend less time talking to
06:54
them because you don't want to talk to
06:56
them so you ask them to do less things
06:57
and
06:58
maybe because they've got an enormous
07:01
crucifix a six foot tall cruise flicks
07:02
above their desk
07:04
larry's a bit full on isn't he i would
07:05
give that person a wide berth definitely
07:08
how's this for a bad boss um i'm not
07:10
sure if we mentioned before george
07:11
pullman
07:12
have we mentioned him he made then we'll
07:14
leave
07:15
no he just made train cars didn't they
07:17
yeah he made train cars but he was a
07:18
really he was a terrible boss he ran
07:20
um basically he built a town for all of
07:23
his employees to live in so he had
07:24
schools and churches
07:26
he changed the money from american
07:28
dollars to paying them in pullman money
07:30
so it was just his own currency like he
07:32
was the monopoly man
07:34
and uh yeah so he just took over their
07:36
whole life whoa
07:37
yeah yeah um and then the thing about
07:39
him is he was hated so much that his
07:41
family buried him under like three feet
07:43
of concrete because they thought someone
07:44
would
07:44
go after his cops this is a i've got
07:48
some advice
07:50
i'll just be offering some time spun
07:52
homely comments or proceedings
07:54
oh i'm not sure about that
07:57
oh dreadful um it's all right it was
08:00
dead
08:01
um wouldn't have cared uh but there is
08:05
there are some tips if you haven't
08:07
really about you to do the eulogy at my
08:08
funeral
08:09
[Laughter]
08:10
do what you like to this guy now he
08:12
doesn't give a
08:14
do you know one thing that does uh work
08:17
is sticking a pin
08:18
into a doll of your boss oh so this
08:21
genuinely reduces what do you mean work
08:22
um as if they don't feel the injury
08:25
wherever you put them
08:27
that would be a hell of a factor perry
08:28
wouldn't you voodoo works
08:30
[Laughter]
08:33
if so sorry it works to reduce your
08:35
anger at your boss so
08:37
participants in this experiment they
08:38
were asked to remember very specifically
08:40
and clearly a time that their boss had
08:42
humiliated or blamed them
08:43
when it wasn't their fault and then they
08:45
were asked to name a voodoo doll on the
08:47
screen
08:48
uh on the computer in front of them and
08:50
some had to name it nobody
08:52
and others people could name it after
08:53
their boss and if you
08:55
got the chance to do the damage to a
08:58
doll named after your boss
08:59
you felt a much lower sense of injustice
09:01
after it was all over
09:03
there's alternatives because people do i
09:04
think regrettably do stuff where they
09:07
if they don't like their boss they send
09:08
stuff i was reading in america there's a
09:10
human resources director
09:12
who's taking legal action to find out
09:14
who wants her to eat
09:15
a bag of dicks now this is a
09:19
this is a company in america that send
09:22
on request gummy shaped little
09:25
penis-shaped gummies sorry
09:30
not gummy-shaped penises something you
09:33
need to see a doctor about that
09:36
what a frightening company that would be
09:41
but yeah they're called dicks by mail
09:42
and what they do is you ask them to send
09:45
a package to a boss or someone a
09:46
relative that you don't like
09:48
right um and she's trying to sue that
09:50
company now to find out who had sent
09:52
that to her
09:53
yeah because she she was very upset um
09:55
the company's website if you go to it
09:56
it's
09:57
so dicks by mail and it markets itself
09:59
as great way to tell your friends
10:01
family loved ones or enemies to eat a
10:03
bag of dicks
10:07
i actually have a related fact it's
10:09
about eccentric millionaires
10:11
um do you know what john wayne bobbitt
10:13
is up to these days
10:15
oh so you remember him he was the one
10:17
whose wife yeah
10:18
dropped off his chops gummy yeah
10:24
and threw it out of the car well um he
10:26
is now a treasure hunter
10:28
okay he's been still looking for it
10:33
[Applause]
10:35
he is looking for a chest of treasure uh
10:38
and this is a chest of treasure that an
10:40
eccentric art dealer has hidden in the
10:42
rocky mountains somewhere
10:44
he's called forrest fenn uh 350 000
10:47
people have tried and failed to find
10:49
this treasure wow is it
10:50
worth did you say it was worth a great
10:52
deal uh i didn't but it is
10:53
okay it's probably worth about two
10:57
million dollars okay and it's like
10:59
jewels and stuff like that and he's
11:01
hidden it somewhere and four people have
11:02
died looking for it oh
11:04
yeah it's very dangerous um one bad boss
11:07
was um the guy who ran mars forest mars
11:09
senior
11:10
he invented the milky way and eminem so
11:12
he's quite a big deal but um
11:14
when new managers came he would make
11:16
them sign a resignation letter on their
11:18
first day
11:19
what oh and then just in case and just
11:22
in case so he had it
11:23
in case they didn't reach their targets
11:25
he'd be able to say well now you're
11:26
going to give me your resignation
11:28
that's pretty bad isn't it in a meeting
11:30
once he made his younger son pray for
11:32
the firm on his knees for an hour
11:36
i when you said he ran mars i i thought
11:38
you meant he ran i didn't i didn't think
11:40
anyone ran mars but no
11:42
you mean the planet yeah exactly oh yeah
11:45
but you mean the chocolate femme
11:47
he says chocolate is king it's a
11:49
catchphrase
11:51
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:54
that is
11:55
chozinski my fact this week is that
11:57
before scarecrows were straw dummies
11:59
they were living children
12:02
wow so you're not saying every single
12:04
scarecrow that you see used to be a
12:06
living child are you
12:07
and then a powerful witch uh came across
12:09
them
12:11
um that's how stuck in the mud came
12:13
about if you actually run under a
12:14
scarecrow's legs it turns back into a
12:16
child
12:16
that's true but don't do it because that
12:18
child is angry by this point
12:21
no that's that's not the fact that would
12:22
be amazing this is the fact that the way
12:25
that people
12:26
scared birds away from their farms in ye
12:28
olden days was just by employing kids to
12:30
do it
12:30
and the first use of the word scarecrow
12:33
to
12:33
refer to something that scares a bird
12:35
was in 1553 and that referred to
12:37
children
12:38
who had the job of doing it and then in
12:39
1592 came the idea of the stuffed dummy
12:42
but until the late 19th century and i
12:44
think into the early 20th century then
12:46
kids were just employed to do this and
12:48
it was quite a common job you know how
12:49
you got a job doing a milk ground or
12:51
something or working in a cafe as a kid
12:53
the equivalent of that in the victorian
12:55
era was standing in a field
12:57
and scaring away birds and the reason
12:59
that um they stopped having children
13:01
there is because the factories
13:02
started opening and they could pay the
13:04
children more mm-hmm
13:06
yeah and then the factories can pay the
13:07
children wrong yeah so the children
13:09
decided to work in the factories instead
13:10
well i'm not sure they had much say in
13:12
the matter i must say
13:13
but they worked in the factories instead
13:15
and also the reason that um
13:16
the scarecrows came in is because of the
13:18
plague the plague killed so many people
13:21
that there weren't enough children to go
13:22
around and so they had to make the
13:24
scarecrows instead
13:25
oh really it wasn't a terrible gig i
13:28
read that
13:28
in the 1800s if you were for instance a
13:31
child scarecrow in
13:32
winchcombe you will be paid a penny per
13:35
day
13:36
plus a swede by which you mean the
13:39
vegetable
13:40
no a swedish person we had a surplus
13:42
then
13:44
there's only one celebrity scarecrow
13:46
that i've found in history
13:48
who is uh you know the thomas hardy book
13:50
jude the obscure
13:51
yeah judy obscure used to be a scarecrow
13:53
as a child oh my god i'd totally
13:55
forgotten that really
13:56
i'd forgotten it too it's not a real
13:59
celebrity
14:00
it's not it's not gonna trouble heat
14:01
magazine anytime soon
14:03
i mean i would say a bigger celebrity
14:04
scarecrow is the scarecrow from the
14:06
wizard of oz
14:07
yes yes that's true yeah
14:10
so there are two well actually just so
14:12
just quickly on the scarecrow from this
14:14
from the wizard of oz i was reading
14:16
about him today and it turns out that in
14:18
the original books he doesn't actually
14:20
lack a brain
14:21
in reality when she meets him he's only
14:23
two days old and just really ignorant
14:26
yeah so he actually has a brain and then
14:28
in the movie itself um
14:30
if you all remember that great moment
14:32
where the wizard does give him a brain
14:33
he suddenly recites pythagorean theorem
14:36
and uh
14:37
he states that it applies to an
14:38
isosceles triangle
14:40
that's not correct no obviously it's a
14:42
right angle triangle what the is he
14:43
talking about
14:46
he's only had a brain for like 10
14:47
seconds i would have loved to have been
14:50
in the cinema with you as a kid
14:53
but actually the character of the
14:54
scarecrow so it was played by a guy
14:56
called ray bolger
14:57
in the original wizard of oz but it was
15:00
supposed to be played by a guy called
15:01
buddy ebsen
15:02
and if you look this man up buddy epson
15:04
was he was six foot three
15:05
he was incredibly skinny and he looks
15:07
exactly like a scarecrow his whole face
15:09
is scarecrow-like
15:10
and so the people making the film
15:11
thought this is our guy he's an actor
15:13
looks like a scarecrow and then they
15:15
decided to cast this guy called ray
15:17
bulger as the tin man
15:18
little did they know that ray bulger had
15:20
been inspired to act when he'd seen a
15:22
production of the wizard of oz
15:23
and he'd seen the scarecrow leap up
15:26
through a haystack off a trampoline
15:28
and seeing that scarecrow made him think
15:30
one day i must play the scarecrow in the
15:32
wizard of oz
15:34
and so he was cast as the tin man and he
15:36
was pissed off
15:38
he insisted and they said no no we're
15:40
not going to let you we've got this guy
15:41
who looks like a scarecrow
15:43
and the guy who looked like the
15:44
scarecrow you know was practicing the
15:45
lines and was being taught the dances
15:47
and eventually bulger just wore them
15:49
down
15:49
and said i will be the scarecrow it's my
15:52
life's mission
15:53
and he was a scarecrow so that's if you
15:55
could see inside the tin man
15:57
he looks like a scarecrow but do you
15:58
know that they swapped yeah
16:02
this is not amazing yeah no no what
16:03
happened was they swapped
16:05
so they were like okay we're still in
16:06
the movie this is fine then the guy who
16:08
was the original scarecrow
16:09
was now the tin man but he got allergic
16:11
to all of the paint that was put on him
16:13
couldn't do the job so he got fired he's
16:15
not in the wizard of oz
16:16
he's not there he lost his job they
16:18
should have given him lion
16:20
i don't think that's how it worked i
16:21
don't think there was just a he was also
16:23
allergic to cats
16:24
[Laughter]
16:26
um there are cool old uh old words for
16:28
scarecrows which i i never knew
16:30
uh in old english they were called a
16:32
frey boggard
16:34
nice which is a good oh yeah really we
16:37
still call it that round
16:38
yeah now they know what we're talking
16:41
about
16:43
what the hell is this character well
16:44
let's try a couple of others then um
16:47
potato bogel
16:48
[Music]
16:53
[Laughter]
16:58
potato bougail if you're from oxbridge
17:00
obviously but
17:01
tatty bogal for the rest of us i was
17:03
reading that in 1989
17:05
they were testing new scarecrow ideas
17:07
and there was one exciting one
17:09
which was a scarecrow that i think must
17:11
have been laying back
17:12
because every now and then a propane
17:14
cannon would lob it up
17:16
and yeah no these these are still sold
17:18
and it really works it really scares
17:20
away the birds because suddenly
17:22
yeah there it goes i read one more bit
17:25
of um
17:26
scarecrow technology in australia they
17:28
have ai scarecrows
17:30
although we've been in the west country
17:31
for two days now and i've realized
17:33
around here ai stands for artificial
17:35
insemination
17:37
we learned that last night did learn
17:39
that
17:40
[Music]
17:44
do we mean the hard way
17:50
um yeah they have this um it's kind of
17:52
like a box
17:53
but what the box can do is it can
17:55
recognize what animals are gonna
17:57
come towards it and it can make
17:58
species-dependent noises
18:00
that's cool yeah so they know what crows
18:02
don't like and they know what geese
18:04
don't like and all these different
18:05
things they can make different sounds
18:06
and the the main problem with scarecrows
18:08
is they get used to whatever's trying to
18:10
scare them the crows get used to it
18:12
and so this is they can change it all
18:13
the time we're gonna have to move on to
18:15
our next fact
18:16
um um should we move on well i found one
18:18
article in the metro
18:20
um it was entitled is this the world's
18:22
most useless scarecrow
18:24
and it was a picture of a scarecrow that
18:26
was completely covered in bird poo
18:28
and it had a nest of five chicks tucked
18:30
inside
18:32
[Laughter]
18:35
okay it is time for fact number three
18:38
and that
18:39
is andy my fact is that the first ever
18:42
leisure caravan had a man on a tricycle
18:45
going ahead of it to check that the
18:47
roads were good enough
18:49
so caravans you know um were traditional
18:53
mode of transport for a long time before
18:54
they were used for leisure
18:55
and then i found this on a blog by a guy
18:58
called eugene burn
18:59
which is a great blog i do recommend it
19:01
and it was all about the guy who
19:02
invented
19:03
recreational caravanning he was a guy
19:05
called william gordon stables
19:08
and he was alive in the second half of
19:09
the 19th century and
19:11
uh until 1910. um and he he was a
19:14
crazy guy he wrote for the boy's own
19:16
paper um
19:17
advice to boys and most of the things he
19:19
recommended were cold baths and hot
19:21
porridge and long walks and he said that
19:23
kind of sorts you out and so
19:24
he wanted to have an adventure so he
19:27
commissioned
19:28
a wagon company in bristol to build the
19:31
this beautiful thing that he called the
19:33
wanderer
19:34
and it's really ornate it's made of
19:37
mahogany um
19:38
it had a paraffin oven it had a bookcase
19:40
velvet lined furniture
19:41
lots of musical instruments and he kept
19:44
a pistol in it as well i do not know why
19:46
and he went on adventures but but yeah
19:49
he called it i think uh he called it
19:51
a land yacht and it was the land yacht
19:54
wanderer and
19:55
he was an interesting guy the other
19:56
thing he did he had a real passion for
19:58
dogs and cats
19:59
this guy william gordon stables and he
20:01
wrote a load of books in his life and he
20:03
either wrote books about
20:05
how boys could survive in the wild you
20:08
know like
20:08
camping like boy scout style books or he
20:10
wrote books about how to keep dogs and
20:12
cats he wrote a book called the domestic
20:13
cat
20:14
and the dog from puppyhood to age yeah
20:17
and then on top of that he wrote medical
20:19
life in the navy
20:20
wild adventures in wild places and his
20:23
last book was called the sauciest boy in
20:25
the service
20:27
wow it's not what you think
20:30
the word saucy just used to mean cheeky
20:32
didn't it oh okay
20:34
i think he was scottish as well because
20:36
he he loved
20:37
dogs and cats and he wrote a lot about
20:39
them and he would frequently turn up at
20:40
dog cat and agricultural shows usually
20:43
in full highland dress
20:44
yeah so he's got a character and his
20:47
thing was
20:48
um with the whole tricycle was that he
20:50
so the
20:51
the caravan was horse-drawn he had two
20:53
horses
20:54
uh that were that were taking them
20:56
forward uh they were called captain
20:57
cornflower
20:58
and polly p blossom and they would both
21:02
be going down um but the the manservant
21:04
that he had
21:05
on the tricycle who was called foley he
21:07
was both checking that the road surfaces
21:09
were okay for him to go on
21:11
but also in case anything was in the way
21:13
he would say get off the road
21:14
there's a caravan coming and what's a
21:17
caravan
21:18
[Laughter]
21:19
yeah it's true yeah i i guess it was a
21:21
new thing um but yeah
21:22
we should say it wasn't a new thing so
21:24
the caravan had existed
21:26
as a travel and for circuses and
21:29
travellers for a long time thousands of
21:31
years really but the idea of using
21:33
caravans for leisure
21:35
which some people would say is an idea
21:36
that should have been nixed at the first
21:39
second
21:40
but he was the first person to do that
21:42
and the early ones were really luxurious
21:44
it was a thing that the upper classes
21:45
did
21:45
and they would be one of the few
21:47
holidays you could take where you'd have
21:48
running water they had running water
21:50
in the like turn of the 20th century
21:52
they would have libraries
21:54
full libraries some of them had pianos
21:56
in them and the pioneers of caravanning
21:58
called themselves gentlemen gypsies
22:01
and they were always horse-drawn in fact
22:03
except
22:04
just coming up to world war one then the
22:06
motor car had been invented by this
22:08
point but it wasn't quite strong enough
22:10
to pull most caravans but a few
22:12
people experimented with motor cars
22:14
pulling caravans
22:15
and they were very much frowned upon as
22:17
like too fast-paced this is what
22:18
caravanning is about
22:20
you can still get some really posh
22:22
caravans really expensive ones with lots
22:24
of great stuff in
22:24
uh the element palazzo is the world's
22:26
most expensive caravan
22:28
uh it costs about two million pounds two
22:30
million pounds yup
22:31
go on it has a rooftop terrace
22:35
underfloor heating and a pop-up cocktail
22:37
bar pop-pop cocktail
22:40
yeah but really very pleasingly it's
22:42
known as the land yacht
22:44
which is the same as the first ever one
22:47
it's interesting isn't it marketing is
22:48
very clever because if you analyze those
22:49
three things a rooftop terrace is just a
22:52
it just means you can get onto the roof
22:53
um underfloor heating
22:56
not super impressive right you put a
22:57
radiator on the floor
22:59
and a pop-up cocktail bar that's just a
23:01
table
23:04
it's just a foldable table i'm gonna i
23:06
just need to go and get my two million
23:07
pounds back
23:08
there was a panic in 2014 about uh
23:11
caravan holidays
23:12
and people thought that there were
23:13
sleeping gas gangs who would go around
23:16
and they'd drop a sleeping gas canister
23:17
through the window of your caravan
23:19
so then you'd be unconscious they'd
23:21
knock you out and then they'd come in
23:22
and they they'd rob your caravan
23:24
of all its stuff well it's they'd take
23:26
the pop-up bar and they'd take someone
23:28
they'd rip the radiator from under the
23:29
floor
23:30
um but this was it seems to have been a
23:33
completely
23:34
fabricated thing so the royal college of
23:37
anaesthetists got involved and they said
23:41
the dozens of newspaper stories about
23:42
these sleeping gas gangs operating in
23:44
france and italy i think on
23:45
you know innocent british tourists who
23:47
were taking their caravan around
23:48
and they said it is the view of the
23:50
college that it would not be possible to
23:51
render someone unconscious by blowing
23:53
ether chloroform or any of the others
23:55
through the window of a motor home
23:56
without their knowledge ether is
23:57
extremely pungent
23:59
and it would cause coughing and
24:00
sometimes vomiting and it takes some
24:02
time to reach unconsciousness
24:03
even if given by direct application to
24:05
the face on a cloth
24:07
so they said it just doesn't happen if
24:09
you were
24:10
going to rob people uh and you would
24:12
think where where do people store their
24:14
most
24:15
valuable possessions should we rob a
24:17
mansion
24:18
should we rob a castle no i think if we
24:21
pop over to one of those haven caravan
24:23
sites
24:24
try and render those guys unconscious or
24:26
get a couple of bottles of cider
24:28
i mean it doesn't make any sense at all
24:31
i read uh just an article in
24:33
that was um sent to the royal society in
24:35
1957
24:36
uh and it was about the history of the
24:38
caravan and it was
24:39
uh done by the head of the caravan
24:41
society uh and he was talking about the
24:44
kind of
24:45
the fact that they had their caravans
24:46
but people were really against caravans
24:48
for a little while he said conservative
24:50
elements that feel their own interests
24:52
threatened
24:53
and fear it have accused followers of
24:55
caravans of
24:56
every sin from leaving litter and
24:59
stealing
24:59
chickens to sexual promiscuity and
25:02
spying
25:04
spying all right 07. this isn't going to
25:07
be the most glamorous gig yet
25:08
[Laughter]
25:10
okay it is time for our final fact of
25:12
the show and that is
25:14
james okay my fact this week is that the
25:16
gravity on mars's smallest moon
25:18
is so weak that if you built a ramp on
25:21
it you could ride your bike
25:22
into space so you escaped the the
25:26
escape yeah you're going to escape
25:27
velocity and you can fly into space
25:30
you wouldn't really want to ride a bike
25:32
there because you probably wouldn't be
25:34
able to ride because you need gravity to
25:36
ride bikes
25:37
so you can kind of if you they've done
25:39
experiments where they have bikes which
25:41
kind of
25:41
they're built to make it look like
25:43
there's no gravity to make you feel like
25:44
there's no gravity
25:45
and they found that people can balance
25:47
but they can't turn and they can't use
25:48
the brakes
25:50
on mars that's in any kind of
25:52
anti-gravity
25:53
kind of situation we haven't not on mars
25:56
we haven't got people to mars just for
25:58
the sake of doing this bike experiment
26:01
that would be and also this isn't mars
26:04
this is
26:04
the smallest um moon which is called
26:07
demos
26:08
daymost and it is 150 millionth
26:13
times as big as the moon so really
26:15
really small
26:16
its radius is about four miles so you
26:18
could run a marathon around its equator
26:20
and have the finishing line pretty much
26:21
where the starting line was
26:24
and because it's so small the gravity is
26:26
really weak so i would weigh about the
26:28
same as a teaspoon of salt
26:30
wow just on uh bikes not going into
26:33
space
26:34
actually there was a plan that we were
26:35
going to send bikes with one of the
26:37
apollo missions
26:38
because yeah the lunar buggy wasn't
26:40
going to be ready in time apollo
26:42
apollo 15 actually tested out bikes
26:45
that they could take to the moon this is
26:47
uh electro
26:48
electric bikes as opposed to pedaling
26:50
bikes although that was suggested as
26:52
well you couldn't pedal in a spacesuit
26:53
though presumably presumably yes
26:55
although someone did do a tandem
26:57
quadra bike that they wanted to send up
26:59
there as well and they actually got
27:00
close to the testing they actually
27:02
brought them up into a vomit rocket
27:03
so that they could experience what it
27:05
was like to peddle a bike
27:06
while plummeting back to the earth and
27:08
experiencing one what is it one
27:10
sixteenth or one
27:11
sorry one-sixth of the earth's gravity
27:13
yeah wait
27:14
it's so i think so they thought that
27:16
maybe they wouldn't have time to get the
27:17
vehicles ready and so they'd have to
27:18
send bikes instead because if you were
27:20
going into space and they said i'm sorry
27:21
we haven't had time to rig up the stuff
27:23
we meant to do you mind bringing your
27:24
bicycle
27:25
i would just say i don't think i'm gonna
27:27
do this mission
27:28
count me out that's true i don't think
27:30
you guys have thought enough about this
27:32
um well so imagine if like they got
27:35
there with neil armstrong and he just
27:36
hits a rock and lobs off into it
27:38
yeah we've lost neil he's uh you know
27:41
you could
27:42
run off the surface of this moon as well
27:44
if you wanted to
27:45
uh so you just have to reach a speed of
27:47
about 12.5 miles an hour
27:48
so if we were all stuck there that's
27:50
kind of the maximum that a kind of fit
27:52
person could sprint
27:54
so the fit ones could get off it and
27:56
then the really unfit ones would be
27:58
stuck on the moon
27:59
yeah but neither is ideal i mean both
28:02
we're gonna die of solar radiation and
28:03
exposure and
28:04
yeah it's not a dream world for anyone
28:06
no um gravity is
28:08
different uh different places on earth
28:11
which i
28:11
didn't know so this is about gravity
28:13
being different in different places so
28:15
um the there's a the place which has got
28:17
the lowest gravity is just south of sri
28:19
lanka
28:20
in the indian ocean but there there is a
28:22
fact that uh
28:23
peru's gravity is also extremely low
28:26
there's an error of peru and the
28:27
arctic's
28:27
gravity uh i think is quite high so
28:30
if you fell from exactly 100 meters all
28:34
over the earth they've done simulations
28:35
on this they have not tested it for real
28:37
um if you would drop from 100 meters
28:39
high all over the earth you would hit
28:40
the surface in peru
28:42
16 milliseconds later than in the arctic
28:45
because the gravity is different i mean
28:46
it's not much different
28:49
a bit more of your life would flash
28:50
before your eyes
28:52
because there's um there's a moon of
28:53
uranus called miranda
28:55
and it has an 11 mile high cliff on it
28:58
called verona rupays and the peak is so
29:01
high
29:02
and the gravity is so low that if you
29:03
fell off it you would fall for 12
29:06
minutes before hitting the ground
29:08
that's a lot of life flashing before
29:09
your eyes isn't it there is an app you
29:11
can get which is called high jump which
29:13
can tell you
29:14
how high you would be able to jump on
29:15
various different um
29:17
planets and moons of our solar system
29:19
what a vital app
29:20
yeah this is made by astronomers uh
29:23
stuart lowe and chris north
29:25
and so they tell you for example if you
29:27
jumped on the moon
29:28
you could jump three meters ten feet off
29:30
the ground you'd be in the air for about
29:31
four seconds
29:32
on mars it would be three feet for two
29:34
seconds um
29:35
but the sixth largest moon of saturn
29:39
you could jump if you did your average
29:41
jump you would go up 42.6 meters
29:44
and you would float back down and you
29:45
would land with the same force that you
29:47
did if you did the jump on earth so it
29:49
wouldn't crush you
29:50
um and it would take roughly a full
29:51
minute to go up and down
29:53
with that jump yeah well i think to be
29:56
honest i think
29:57
uh this moon daimos is pretty much the
30:00
exact perfect one
30:01
if you want to jump as high as you
30:02
possibly can because if the gravity was
30:04
any less there then you would just float
30:06
away
30:07
but you can just about not but do you
30:09
know do you know the story of how mars's
30:11
moons were discovered
30:12
because it's quite so they were
30:14
discovered by a guy called assaf hall
30:16
which is a very weird name but this was
30:18
in 1876
30:19
and he really thought that mars probably
30:22
had a couple of moons which
30:24
it does or some moons and so he had this
30:26
telescope and
30:27
he wanted he was looking through this
30:29
telescope looking closer and closer to
30:31
mars
30:32
and so the thing about the martian moons
30:34
is they're very close to the planet
30:36
itself and he got really close to this
30:38
telescope and the glare from mars was
30:39
getting too much
30:40
and he was like no there clearly aren't
30:42
any moons there and he went home
30:44
away from his observatory and he went
30:46
home to his wife who was a woman called
30:47
angeline stickney and he said no moon
30:50
can possibly exist here
30:52
the thing about angeline his wife is
30:54
that she had been his math teacher at
30:56
university
30:57
and she was very good at calculations
30:59
like this and while he'd been there
31:00
looking for the moon she'd done the
31:02
calculations
31:03
of how close a moon could be to mars and
31:05
said no
31:06
i've worked it out it's going to be
31:08
closer than anyone thinks is possible
31:09
go back and look again and there was a
31:11
thing then that women didn't really look
31:13
through telescopes like men were allowed
31:15
to operate telescopes
31:16
women could do the calculation stuff so
31:18
he went back you know because she said i
31:19
really think it's there
31:20
and then he found the two martian moons
31:23
so she used to do his calculation so she
31:25
calculated the orbits of the moons
31:26
around mars
31:27
and did lots of stuff for him and then
31:29
eventually said to him um
31:32
do you mind because i'm doing a lot of
31:33
this work if you pay me
31:35
the salary that i might get if i work
31:37
for you and he said no and so she
31:38
stopped doing it for him
31:40
wow amazing person fair enough
31:43
and but even before that uh kepler um
31:46
said that there were two moons of mars
31:48
he said earth had got one moon and
31:50
jupiter had four moons and so it just
31:52
makes logical sense that the planet in
31:54
between must have two
31:57
he was right well he was right apart
31:59
from the fact that
32:00
jupiter has a lot more than that and the
32:02
logic is completely spurious
32:06
mind you people were predicting it left
32:08
right and center so jonathan swift
32:10
in gulliver's travels in 1726. so 150
32:13
years before they were discovered
32:14
said like so in gulliver's travels if
32:16
you've read it the locutions
32:18
not to be confused with the lilliputians
32:19
the laputian said they discovered that
32:21
mars has two satellites
32:23
and then he described them and he said
32:24
the inner one orbits within 10 hours so
32:27
it's orbit last 10 hours the outer ones
32:29
orbit is 21 hours
32:30
and actually it's 8 hours and 30. so
32:32
pretty damn close
32:34
this is 150 years before they were
32:35
discovered he said i reckon it's got two
32:37
moons
32:37
that's pretty good yeah so we're talking
32:40
about mars
32:41
and there's a prospect of going to mars
32:44
you know
32:44
possibly soon a bit so i was looking at
32:46
some of the problems of it
32:47
and um the really interesting thing is
32:50
that uh it would be a much longer
32:51
mission than anyone's done in space
32:53
before you need to do about three years
32:55
in space to get to mars so already being
32:57
in space causes problems
32:59
um so your skeleton is constantly it's
33:02
adapted to gravity
33:04
uh and so without it calcium gets into
33:06
the bloodstream which gives you
33:07
uh kidney stones and it also causes
33:09
constipation and psychotic depression
33:12
so this medical students remember this
33:14
as bones stones abdominal groins and
33:16
psychic moans
33:17
[Music]
33:20
but there's a thing where there's
33:21
another problem which is being in
33:22
microgravity it moves where your brain
33:24
is in your head
33:26
so microgravity makes astronauts brains
33:28
squish upwards
33:29
and squash at the top of their skulls
33:31
and what that does is that puts pressure
33:33
on two particular lobes the frontal and
33:35
parietal lobes
33:36
which control movement and higher
33:38
executive function
33:39
which is essential for planning things
33:41
and remembering details
33:42
so you would end up not being able to do
33:45
anything or plan anything and also the
33:47
those regions of the brain are
33:48
associated with pro-social behavior
33:50
so they think that you'd end up making a
33:52
lot of hurtful and inappropriate
33:53
comments
33:55
to other astronauts but they all would
33:58
be yeah
33:58
yeah here's a weird thing i don't have
34:00
the science behind this but i read it
34:02
it's
34:02
they've worked out recently through
34:04
tests that they've done with astronauts
34:05
who've been up at the iss recently
34:07
when you go up let's say the three of
34:09
you who don't wear glasses
34:10
uh well andy you do but you two don't
34:13
your eyes
34:14
something happens to it where it means
34:16
you might suddenly need glasses for
34:17
close reading whereas my eyes and andy's
34:19
eyes he's wearing contacts
34:21
we suddenly will have better vision and
34:23
i'll be able to take my glasses off yeah
34:26
wow very weird it's a thing that happens
34:28
with the eyeball and the way something
34:29
at the back distorts
34:30
i said that would be another problem
34:32
space truly is the home of real nerds
34:34
[Laughter]
34:36
okay that is it that is all of our facts
34:38

hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:18
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:20
live
00:21
from red roof
00:28
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:31
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:33
murray and james harkin
00:35
and once again we have gathered round
00:37
the microphones with our four
00:38
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:41
and in no particular order
00:42
here we go starting with fact number one
00:46
and that's my fact this week my fact is
00:49
after the author george eliot died her
00:52
family spent
00:53
50 years publicly denying that she had a
00:56
massive
00:57
right hand
01:00
where to start with the questions did
01:03
she
01:04
well basically before she was famous
01:06
this was in the 1840s um
01:09
she was talking to a neighbor she was in
01:10
her mid-20s pre-fame
01:12
and she stretched out her right hand and
01:15
with some pride
01:16
demonstrated how massive it was it's
01:18
like look how big this is
01:20
and it was big she said because in her
01:22
teenage years she was making butter and
01:24
cheese on her family's farm so she
01:26
was doing all the churning that she
01:27
needed to do and as a result she built
01:29
up this
01:30
massive hand so it wasn't even by birth
01:33
like she
01:34
built it herself and she said that it
01:37
was so
01:38
big her hand comparative to the left
01:40
hand that she had
01:41
that it left her kind of lopsided
01:43
because the weight of it
01:46
she did to this in this anecdote so this
01:48
is the problem it was an anecdote that
01:50
was said
01:50
before she was famous and when she died
01:53
28 months
01:54
after she died a biography was released
01:56
where someone had gone to the local town
01:58
and so on and it interviewed neighbors
02:00
and the neighbors said yeah she was this
02:02
person with a massive hand that she told
02:04
me about sounds like something that was
02:06
made up by the neighbor doesn't it well
02:07
this is why the family was
02:09
very very furiously denying it um they
02:11
were saying it was not
02:13
she was never a dairy farmer that was
02:14
more the thing it wasn't so much the
02:16
hand they didn't want her
02:17
to be thought of because it kind of
02:18
showed that she had a really rural
02:20
upbringing
02:21
yeah exactly yeah well also there was a
02:24
kind of
02:24
uh potential rudeness in what she
02:27
because
02:28
no just because dairies were kind of
02:30
seen as hotbeds of vice
02:32
were they yeah because you know there
02:33
are cows and there are others and
02:35
there's milk and it's all very sexy
02:37
[Applause]
02:39
right no right i did try to find out a
02:41
bit bit more about this but it's quite
02:43
hard to google
02:44
naughty milkmaids and find anything sort
02:46
of germane
02:48
ivan i went into onto the national
02:51
portrait gallery website and they have a
02:52
lot of portraits of her
02:54
and i don't i didn't see a single one
02:56
where she had a massive right hand so
02:58
is she always disguising it by wearing
02:59
one of those big foam fingers
03:05
she would have asked him to cover it up
03:07
though i think that could be
03:08
like william gladstone i think he was
03:10
william gladstone he had a missing
03:11
finger didn't he and portrait art has
03:13
covered that up his whole life yes
03:15
and that was like agreed by the
03:16
newspapers wasn't it all the newspapers
03:18
agreed that they would never mention it
03:19
and the cartoonist agreed that they
03:21
would never draw about it
03:22
yeah but he had a dummy finger yeah he
03:24
wore a fake finger in place of his real
03:26
finger
03:27
maybe she wore a smaller hand
03:30
i think you would you would do it the
03:32
other way around you would wear a
03:33
massive hand on your other one so they
03:34
look
03:35
very clever and so i read a lot about
03:37
this i don't know if this
03:38
this is where you saw it um dan i saw a
03:40
review of a book called the
03:41
um tales of the flesh in the age of
03:43
decorum by catherine hughes
03:45
and she wrote about both gladstone and
03:47
about george eliot
03:49
and in this book she came across george
03:51
eliot's glove
03:52
at the end of one of the chapters and of
03:55
course that
03:56
might tell you what's happened so she
03:58
found this glove it was the right glove
04:00
and she looked at it and it was quite
04:02
big but of course the problem was she
04:04
didn't have the left glasses
04:08
and then people have suggested to the
04:10
author that maybe she threw away the
04:11
left club
04:12
because it was too small for her we
04:15
should just quickly say because
04:16
um uh george eliot to me was a name i
04:18
was kind of familiar with but not really
04:20
she um was an author george eliot was
04:22
the pseudonym that she had
04:24
marianne was her name um marianne
04:26
marianne evans
04:27
evans and um she wrote middlemarch and
04:30
a number of books which today are
04:32
considered by a lot of
04:34
modern day writers like martin amos and
04:36
so on to be amongst the greatest books
04:38
ever written in literature yeah she's
04:39
the i think she's probably like the
04:40
greatest novelist
04:42
ever she was a genius really um and
04:44
middlemarch is my favorite book
04:45
probably in the world but it is a shame
04:47
because she did have people during her
04:49
life
04:49
and after it commenting on her
04:51
appearance and i know i'm perpetuating
04:53
that by doing it now but
04:54
there were some choice phrases so she
04:56
lived this very
04:57
um kind of unusual life for the
05:00
victorian era
05:01
and she sort of lived in sin with a
05:04
married man
05:05
for about 30 years so you can always
05:07
tell an ex-milk made
05:11
but people used to be captivated by her
05:13
but also weirdly repulsed by her so
05:14
henry james was
05:15
a huge fan of hers and he called her
05:18
magnificently ugly
05:19
deliciously hideous but then said he
05:23
completely fell in love with her he said
05:24
within her vast ugliness resides the
05:26
most powerful beauty
05:28
and this seemed to be what she did to
05:29
people it's not the prime tinder chat
05:31
upline territory is it
05:33
well hang on you've not quite given the
05:35
full the full quote there from him he
05:38
said
05:38
uh he said all the nice things about how
05:40
you fall in love with her and he said
05:41
yes
05:41
behold me literally in love with the
05:43
great horse-faced
05:44
blue stocking so return to land
05:48
right in the final bit of this quote a
05:49
lot of people said that didn't they they
05:51
said that she was really ugly but as
05:52
soon as she spoke as soon as she engaged
05:54
you
05:54
she suddenly captivated you so lucy
05:57
clifford whose novelist said that she
05:58
did look like a horse
06:00
but it was a strange variety of horse
06:02
that was full of knowledge
06:09
yeah it's not she used to take the piss
06:10
out of herself yeah
06:12
and she sort of ended up with this guy
06:13
george lewis uh who
06:15
was also unattractive i believe and i
06:18
think that's why she called herself
06:19
george
06:20
elliot we assume is sort of an homage to
06:22
him
06:23
and also there's a weird theory that a
06:25
biographer came up with just after she
06:27
died that
06:28
her surname was also in made in homage
06:30
to him because
06:32
apparently her surname was so
06:35
l so his name is george lewis starts
06:37
with l
06:38
and it's to l i o it and this biographer
06:42
theorized that her surname is
06:45
comes from l i o it
06:49
[Applause]
06:54
um she was a great writer um i i looked
06:57
at some of the
06:58
words that she had coined so she was the
07:01
first person to use
07:02
the word pop as in pop music and that
07:04
was in 1862
07:06
she said there was too much pop for the
07:08
thor enjoyment of chamber music
07:10
she also coined the words according to
07:12
the oed this is
07:14
appealingness beseechingness close-ish
07:17
and embrowning wow which unless coinages
07:21
is just putting the word ness after
07:22
things isn't it
07:23
she was also the first person to write
07:25
the words lampshade and lunchtime
07:27
cool time yeah it is a biggie isn't it
07:31
that's a real one we should say when she
07:32
used the word pop it was in a letter and
07:34
she was referring to the fact that
07:35
beethoven's septet had been played
07:38
so i think pop was quite different then
07:39
wasn't it so the pseudonym that she used
07:42
it was because she wanted to go
07:43
get away from the fact that people would
07:46
maybe look down on the novel because it
07:48
was written by a woman she was trying to
07:50
even though there were a lot of women um
07:51
literature authors at the time it was it
07:54
was not as taboo as it was in the
07:55
earlier days but
07:56
she she wanted to get away from that and
07:58
um so she used
08:00
george eliot but when she released her
08:02
first stuff and when her first novel
08:04
this is 1859 adam bead was published
08:07
um she did it with the pseudonym and
08:09
obviously no one knew who it was so
08:10
there was a lot of questions about
08:12
who could this be and the people like
08:14
with jk rowling having done robert
08:15
galbraith they did a lot of searching
08:17
trying to work out who it was
08:19
and they found that the book had a lot
08:21
of references to a local place
08:23
um called noneaton which it was such
08:26
good local knowledge they thought it
08:27
must be for someone from there
08:29
and they pinned it down to a guy called
08:30
joseph liggins who lived there
08:32
and joseph liggins when he first got not
08:35
accused but pushed to say oh the
08:37
are you the author he was flattered and
08:38
went well i shouldn't really say
08:40
and then when it comes out then when it
08:42
got really big he then said yes it's me
08:45
so he said yes it i absolutely am so
08:47
then the publishers of the book
08:49
because this guy was living in poverty
08:50
at the time he'd had a very rough life
08:53
he started uh the publishers getting all
08:54
these messages going why is he so poor
08:56
this is a big book he should be making a
08:58
lot of money
08:59
so then they had to reveal their cards
09:00
that it was in fact uh merry christmas
09:03
it's me and for miles around and
09:07
everyone
09:07
said that's a man's hand if i ever saw
09:11
one
09:13
so it got revealed that um that he was
09:16
not
09:16
the author and that obviously ruined his
09:18
life because he was
09:20
a fantasist he was claiming something
09:22
that he wasn't and he ended up living
09:24
in a um a workhouse where he eventually
09:26
died and his life just went
09:28
downhill from there so he died in this
09:30
place in this workhouse and that work
09:32
house is no longer there
09:33
but it's been reused as a new building
09:36
and renamed
09:37
the george eliot hospital oh yes
09:40
even in death her childhood home is is
09:42
there it's now
09:44
the griff house beefeater and none eaten
09:46
premier travel inn
09:48
and i looked for ages on the trip
09:51
advisor reviews and none of them
09:52
mentioned george eliot it's quite
09:53
sad when she released adam bead
09:57
i think a lot of reviewers felt quite
09:58
stupid because a lot of reviewers
10:00
compared it favorably to women's fiction
10:02
the the economist which i know we've all
10:04
publicly stated we love and we do
10:06
but this is a long time ago the
10:08
economist compared it very favorably
10:10
with
10:10
fiction written by silly women um and
10:12
another another reviewer said it was the
10:14
work of a brave
10:15
manly soul so everyone thought this is
10:17
like really definitely written by a man
10:19
but actually interestingly charles
10:20
dickens was the first person to spot
10:22
that her
10:23
books seem like they were written by a
10:25
woman and this is when she released her
10:26
first book which was scenes from a
10:28
clerical life
10:29
and she wrote he dickens wrote to the
10:31
publishers saying how much he loved it
10:33
and how brilliant it was
10:34
and he said that definitely originates
10:36
with a woman you know this understanding
10:38
of human nature this woman's perspective
10:40
he said if they originated with no woman
10:42
i believe that no man ever before had
10:44
the art of making himself mentally
10:46
so like a woman since the world began
10:48
wow oh he called her out
10:50
give her a big hand
10:54
how long you've been saving that since i
10:56
sent the fact two weeks ago
10:59
um she did she hated lots of other women
11:01
novelists though
11:03
so this is so the reason maybe that she
11:05
one of the reasons that she might have
11:06
written under a man's name
11:08
um we mentioned this very briefly before
11:09
she she wrote an essay
11:11
uh i think before her first book which
11:13
was called silly novels by
11:15
lady novelists and she said that women
11:18
authors wrote stupid plots with
11:19
pointless characters and she was clearly
11:21
determined to
11:22
to do something about that right more
11:23
realistically although she didn't like
11:25
some female novelist she liked the
11:26
brontes she liked uh
11:29
other female novelists who were good
11:32
well i'm not sure you've proved your
11:34
credentials there
11:36
um we've got to move on shortly ish i'm
11:39
just using an ish love just coined there
11:42
um megan fox's thumbs are shaped like
11:44
toes
11:46
what just while we're on talented women
11:48
with weird hands
11:49
that's a great fact it's good fact that
11:51
isn't it i mean all thumbs are shaped a
11:52
bit like toes
11:53
yeah but hers are really stumpy and
11:54
small um she's got
11:56
brachydactyl type d and most surgeons
11:59
call it stub
12:00
thumb really yeah and if you ever look
12:02
at pictures of them and
12:03
she's not worried about it she shows
12:04
them off quite often they're just like
12:06
about half the size of a normal thumb
12:08
i share a birthday with megan fox oh
12:10
good fat
12:11
[Laughter]
12:14
so anyway so yeah she has this thing i'm
12:17
sorry
12:17
sorry can we even tell you wow well i'm
12:21
about do you see
12:22
each other my thumbs are normal so who's
12:25
winning there
12:27
are the people with weird hands oh yeah
12:31
so rachmaninoff had huge hands
12:34
famously if you ever read about
12:36
classical music it's like the first
12:38
thing that's ever mentioned about him
12:39
and any article about him is
12:40
massive handspan um and if he especially
12:42
his left hand was particularly huge
12:44
so if he had his little finger on a c
12:47
then his thumb on his left hand would be
12:50
able to reach the g
12:51
of the next octave oh it was so exciting
12:54
i think what we're all wondering is when
12:55
was his birthday
13:00
but actually um keyboards people have
13:03
found recently that they disadvantaged
13:05
female pianists
13:06
so um they according to a recent study
13:09
they disadvantaged
13:09
87 percent of female pianists and they
13:12
looked at the 12
13:14
best pianists in the world and they all
13:16
had spans of 8.8 inches or above
13:19
whereas the average female span is about
13:21
seven inches
13:23
wow um so it's really difficult for
13:25
women to play a lot of
13:26
a lot of the songs and so um they they
13:28
looked at those 12 people and there were
13:30
two women in that group and one had a
13:31
hand span of nine inches and the other
13:33
one had a hand span of 9.5 inches
13:35
which goes to show that it's really
13:37
difficult for women with normal sized
13:38
hands together
13:39
but it's good that george eliot's
13:41
descendants have found work
13:44
she could only play the melody
13:49
um just with the um with the family
13:51
those 50 years
13:52
so as i say before it's sort of like
13:54
were they angry about the idea that she
13:56
was
13:57
claimed they they said she had a massive
13:58
hand or was it about the fact that she
14:00
was a dairy farmer that's a bit blurry
14:02
um but um they made sure that if anyone
14:05
wanted to do a biography of her
14:07
the stipulation was you are not allowed
14:09
to mention the massive hand
14:11
or the dairy thing you just have to like
14:13
actually deny that that was a truth um
14:16
and so i i was thinking about that
14:18
happens a lot doesn't it whenever a
14:19
celebrity is interviewed where they
14:21
i told a pr person says don't ask the
14:24
celebrity
14:25
about this question yeah i found this
14:27
article by a guy called jesse mulligan
14:28
who's in new zealand and he collected
14:30
through other journalists things that
14:31
they've been told not to ask celebrities
14:33
so
14:34
for example when meatloaf went to
14:36
auckland um all
14:37
people were told not to ask him um what
14:39
he wouldn't do for love
14:41
is an obvious one right um when david
14:44
ike
14:45
the big conspiracy theorist uh went to
14:47
new zealand dom harvey uh interviewed
14:49
him
14:49
and he was told no questions about his
14:51
failed predictions
14:52
especially the one where he predicted
14:54
new zealand would completely disappear
14:56
in the late 90s
14:59
and then lastly the killers the band
15:02
were playing the big day out in
15:03
australia and
15:04
the interviewers were told not to ask
15:06
about bruce springsteen
15:08
religion or beards and that's because of
15:10
the lead singer is a mormon
15:12
uh he'd recently grown a bit of a beard
15:14
and their new album was being compared
15:15
to bruce springsteen
15:16
and at the press junket uh one of the uh
15:19
interviewers
15:19
asked who has the best beard jesus or
15:21
bruce springsteen
15:25
very good move okay it is time for fact
15:29
number two
15:30
and that is andy my fact is that some
15:32
grandfather clocks
15:34
used to use ox testicles for their
15:36
pulleys
15:38
were they still attached to me
15:42
that would be silly no um this is
15:43
actually this got sent to me by a
15:44
listener someone called jenny wild blood
15:47
and um it's from a book called food in
15:49
england by dorothy hartley and dorothy
15:51
hartley was an incredible woman she um
15:54
she she sort of documented all these
15:56
social customs dating back centuries
15:58
and she um she lived in the 20th century
16:01
and she died in it
16:02
and she recorded all these
16:05
she didn't make it out damn it um but
16:08
she
16:09
and so she she we don't have many places
16:11
that this fact is written down and it's
16:12
from her book food in england and she
16:14
says that the long testicle cord of a
16:16
bull
16:16
you know you used to use all of the
16:18
animal and that cord was used as pulleys
16:20
in some grandfather clocks because it
16:21
was strong
16:22
in texture and it was long so sorry can
16:24
i just ask is the
16:25
pulley the lump at the bottom of the
16:28
pendulum you've got the two things
16:29
hanging down
16:30
the pulley you know uh the thing that
16:32
you the long stringy bit that has the
16:34
blobby bit at the bottom thank you
16:37
okay cool and it was the blobby bit no
16:39
it's the string
16:40
the stringy bear it's the chord the
16:42
testicle chord it's not the testicles
16:44
yeah though in theory they should have
16:45
just used the testicle as the bobby bear
16:46
yeah that's true yeah use it all don't
16:49
waste not want not
16:51
um but there was one other thing it was
16:52
used for i went i tracked down the book
16:54
um and it was also the long testicle
16:57
chord of the ox
16:58
was valued by drovers as a lash so you
17:01
might
17:02
as a cattle be lashed by the testicles
17:05
of your ancestors
17:08
by the testicles of your ancestors
17:09
sounds like an amazing explanation
17:12
by the testicles of your ancestors
17:15
are you crazy
17:20
so
17:23
let's all start picturing testicles and
17:25
talk about grandfather clocks which
17:26
aren't as old as you might think or the
17:28
name isn't
17:29
so the name comes from 1876 and it's a
17:32
song
17:33
by a guy called henry clay work so
17:35
before grandfather clocks were called
17:36
that they were just called something out
17:38
they were called floor clocks or they
17:39
were called long clocks so i think they
17:40
had various names
17:41
but then he wrote this song where he
17:43
referred them as
17:44
a grandfather's clock and it's such a
17:46
nice song it's from the perspective of a
17:48
grandson
17:49
talking about how his grandfather's
17:50
clock has been born at the same time as
17:52
his grandfather and they've both lived
17:54
this life together
17:55
and they're really well bonded and then
17:56
when their grandfather dies the clock
17:58
stops working
17:59
and then that's and it was covered by
18:01
johnny cash some time later
18:03
and that's where we got the term i guess
18:06
you guys know that song do you
18:07
my grandfather's grandfather's yeah
18:10
yeah i've never heard it but it's based
18:13
on an actual clock
18:14
on a real-life clock in north yorkshire
18:15
it's still there um
18:17
it's in i forgot where i think it's near
18:19
darlington
18:20
uh and henry clay work was in this hotel
18:24
in this
18:24
restaurant um and he saw this clock and
18:26
they told him the story of how it had
18:28
stopped on the day that the guy died and
18:30
that's how he wrote the song he said by
18:32
the testicles of my ancestors what a
18:34
subject for a song
18:37
historians think that it was a marketing
18:38
gimmick used by the innkeepers to dress
18:40
up their inability to get the clock
18:42
repaired
18:45
i was i didn't know that as well as a
18:46
grandfather clock you could get a
18:48
grandmother clock
18:49
and a granddaughter clock how cool is
18:51
that
18:52
how does how is the gender
18:53
differentiated on clocks um no gender
18:55
difference
18:56
um but it's height height difference is
18:59
what it is they use the vagina of an ox
19:02
[Laughter]
19:08
so um a grand for the clock is generally
19:11
agreed to measure at least six foot
19:12
three in height
19:13
uh so that's a grandfather clock a grand
19:16
mother clock is six foot three
19:18
below six foot three i'm sorry you have
19:21
to dig a hole
19:21
six foot three down into the ground
19:25
so yeah you need to go that way yeah
19:28
it's just anything anything under six
19:29
foot three is a grandmother you know
19:30
what andy said is right yeah you ready
19:33
what's the granddaughter clock and
19:34
daughter clock is exactly six foot three
19:37
is that it yes no
19:38
it's um anything that measures in
19:40
between uh three and five feet uh so it
19:42
still needs to be a tall standing
19:44
clock otherwise then it's just a really
19:46
tall clock but it doesn't get
19:47
status as a ground yeah and you also get
19:50
the george elliot clock where one of the
19:51
hands is really big
19:52
[Laughter]
19:55
[Applause]
19:59
so clocks have an amazing history
20:01
actually so the first clocks or some of
20:03
the first clocks were water clocks
20:05
and the first water clock i could find
20:07
evidence of was from ancient greece
20:09
and its whole purpose was to stop people
20:12
going on too long
20:13
uh in in words
20:17
the way it worked in ancient greece was
20:19
actually quite different to what came
20:20
afterwards but basically what you had
20:22
was you had a
20:23
bull imagine a small bowl and you've got
20:25
a little hole in the bottom of that bowl
20:26
and then you put it in a bigger bowl of
20:28
water and then the
20:30
water gradually goes up through the hole
20:32
in the bowl and the time that bowl takes
20:34
to sink
20:35
uh is a you know a certain passage of
20:38
time
20:38
and they would use this to time people's
20:40
speeches in parliament so if a
20:41
politician was wang
20:42
on too long then you'd be like the
20:44
bowl's underwater now get off the stage
20:46
mate
20:46
and then that was that was their purpose
20:48
that's pretty cool that is cool
20:50
bring it back they should put the
20:52
politician in the bowl of water and just
20:54
slowly the speech
20:55
and i think that would be amazing
21:00
that's a game show i think yeah it's
21:02
time to play
21:03
hole in the ball
21:04
[Laughter]
21:07
do you know why we say o'clock when if
21:10
you say it's four o'clock
21:11
why we say that rather than just saying
21:13
it's four because
21:14
uh no i don't know why we say that well
21:16
it's so this goes back such a long way
21:19
this goes back to when the so sundials
21:22
were what we used before
21:23
mechanization came into clocks in in the
21:26
west
21:26
was about the 14th century when
21:28
mechanical clocks came in
21:30
and in sundials what you had was the day
21:32
was divided into 12 equal hours and the
21:35
night was divided into 12 equal hours
21:37
and so because the day is longer in
21:38
summer then the hours in summer would be
21:41
much longer than the hours in winter yes
21:43
but with mechanical clocks
21:45
all hours are the same length um and so
21:48
it when mechanical clocks
21:49
came in then people were sort of living
21:51
on a half sundial half mechanical clock
21:54
basis
21:55
and so if you said what's the time and
21:57
someone said it was it's 12
21:58
or 12 is a bad the worst possible
22:01
example that's the only one where it's
22:02
the same
22:05
12 is the same regardless if you said
22:08
it's eight
22:09
then they say well what do you mean do
22:10
you mean eight on the sundial or do you
22:11
mean eight on the mechanical clock and
22:13
that's why you say eight
22:14
o'clock as in eight on the mechanical
22:15
clock that's so i'm gonna start saying
22:17
it's eight o sundial
22:21
okay we need to move on it is time for
22:23
fact number three
22:24
and that is james okay my fact this week
22:28
is that the first motel was meant to be
22:31
called a motor hotel
22:32
but the sign was too small to fit all
22:34
the letters on
22:36
couldn't he have just written smaller he
22:39
could have done that i guess
22:40
but um he'd already bought this bought
22:42
the letters and it's
22:43
all that also below a certain font size
22:45
it's not a useful sign anymore
22:47
you're right that's all right just
22:49
becomes a
22:50
notice yep yeah so this is the milestone
22:54
motel inn which was open in 1925 it was
22:57
in
22:57
san luis obispo which is exactly in
23:00
between los angeles and san francisco
23:02
and people had started using their cars
23:04
to kind of drive around
23:06
and that was a very popular journey but
23:08
before that people had to just kind of
23:10
park into the lay by and kind of camp
23:12
but he started this new idea of having a
23:14
hotel where people could drive up and
23:16
they could stay there
23:17
and so he wanted to call it the
23:18
milestone motor hotel but he couldn't
23:20
fit it on his side
23:23
it sounded really cool i've seen photos
23:25
of it he was very inspired by
23:27
sort of spanish houses so it's this
23:29
beautiful i mean
23:30
if you picture what an american motel is
23:32
like now it's the exact opposite this
23:34
was luxury it looked stunning
23:37
it had uh enough rooms for 160 people to
23:40
stay there
23:41
i had showers central heating um it even
23:44
had rooms for people's chauffeurs
23:46
to sleep in like that's how much of an
23:49
upper-class idea
23:50
it was for him and um unfortunately i
23:52
think i'm ryan saying he was unable to
23:54
sort of trademark the idea right so as
23:56
soon as he did it everyone leaped in and
23:58
opened their own and and his idea of
24:00
franchising it was out the window that's
24:02
right he was called arthur heinemann
24:05
yeah nice is it um and we should say
24:07
because everyone's always wondered
24:09
what's the difference between a hotel in
24:10
a motel and i think
24:11
this is right a motel basically means
24:14
you can park up next to your room and go
24:16
into it right
24:17
yeah and it's all kind of the whole the
24:19
motel is in sort of a c-shape
24:21
usually and it's just all on one floor
24:24
and you just walk straight into it but
24:25
there's no rules
24:26
so you can have a motel that's a hotel
24:28
or a hotel that's a hotel
24:30
yeah but they had a bad reputation and
24:32
even before psycho
24:33
so imagine what that did for them but
24:35
the
24:36
in the so from then in 1940 jayaka
24:40
hoover who was director of the fbi
24:41
said that most motels were dens of vice
24:44
and hideouts for criminals
24:46
and they had this reputation for what
24:48
was called the hot pillow trade
24:50
which basically means the shadows of
24:52
guests stay there in the space of 24
24:54
hours
24:55
and not because they're really busy so
24:56
there was a study done which found that
24:58
about 16 guests per night were
25:00
staying at one motel because it was a
25:01
place that you would go
25:03
with your mistress or your master and
25:07
you have a quick shag you book it for an
25:09
hour and then you go again and then you
25:10
leave
25:11
and a 1935 study which was done by a
25:14
texas university
25:15
found that 75 of motel visits were one
25:18
man and one woman
25:19
remaining for a very short stay and they
25:22
also found that they in one motel 102
25:26
out of 109 guests signed in under fake
25:29
names
25:32
they were dodgy joints and there's one
25:33
really dodgy one which is in
25:35
nevada um it's called the clown motel
25:38
and wherever you look there are clowns
25:40
looking at you
25:42
basically every wall there's a clown
25:44
looking at you but it's all right you
25:46
can kind of just
25:46
nip out of the back if you want but
25:48
unfortunately if you do that you go to
25:50
the historic miners cemetery
25:52
um where they have hundreds of corpses
25:54
from people who died in the plague
25:56
yeah oh god below ground
26:00
that's the weird thing i read up on that
26:02
as well they describe it as an abandoned
26:03
cemetery
26:04
and i don't know how you abandon a
26:06
cemetery
26:08
right we're going everyone is your last
26:12
chance for the bus
26:14
all right um i'd rather like this in
26:17
2017 there was a man in india who was
26:18
arrested for stealing more than 120
26:21
televisions from budget hotels across
26:23
the country in an incredible four-month
26:25
crime spree that was one a day
26:26
and his modus operandi was brilliant he
26:29
would check in carrying as the report
26:30
said a fairly large suitcase
26:33
and if the tv in his room was really big
26:35
he would
26:36
go off to the shops for a bit and come
26:37
back with a really big suitcase
26:39
and they would just leave with that he
26:41
was caught
26:42
he was caught yeah amazing took that
26:45
long i know
26:46
um i found the worst hotel in the world
26:48
oh great well there are theories
26:49
obviously because there's not there's
26:50
not an official title but
26:52
um one that gets quoted as the worst
26:54
hotel in the world is the grand hotel
26:56
in pristina which is the capital in
26:58
kosovo and it has truly atrocious
26:59
reviews it's very very very bad
27:01
and when he was asked about it last year
27:03
the actual president of kosovo said
27:05
i don't think it is the worst hotel in
27:07
the world but that is because the world
27:09
is very big
27:10
[Laughter]
27:17
there's one more called hans brinker
27:18
which is in amsterdam but they
27:20
make a virtue of how bad it is they kind
27:23
of advertise it
27:24
they say unfortunately most of the
27:26
reviews are really true
27:27
um the hotel website actual website for
27:30
the hotel says it's comparable to a
27:31
minimum security prison
27:34
and they also advertise themselves as
27:35
being environmentally friendly because
27:37
the curtains double up as towels
27:39
[Laughter]
27:43
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:45
the show and that
27:47
is chozinski my fact is that
27:50
a man found guilty of deer poaching has
27:52
been sentenced to a year in prison
27:54
and been ordered to watch bambi once a
27:57
month during that year
27:58
[Laughter]
28:01
this is uh this is great so this was
28:04
actually at the end of last year and it
28:06
was in missouri
28:07
and a judge sentenced a man called david
28:09
berry jr
28:10
and he had been done for poaching he
28:13
approaching was it was like a
28:14
family thing like his dad was doing his
28:16
brother was doing it i think
28:17
and the judge said look you've killed
28:19
hundreds of deer
28:20
uh so i want you to watch bambi and see
28:23
what that deer might have felt like
28:24
and apparently the prosecution said that
28:28
the judge is hoping there will be some
28:29
kind of emotional reaction
28:32
and weirdly the guy who worked for the
28:33
prosecution was called don
28:35
trossa so it felt like he was in the
28:38
dear faction i think if he's killed
28:40
hundreds of deer as you as
28:41
he has i think he might be able to cope
28:44
with bambi
28:45
without cracking i'm not sure who meant
28:47
his ways because of the bambi i think
28:48
it's a good idea but
28:49
no well there might be there might be
28:50
something to the idea um
28:52
so the person who played young bambi
28:56
in bambi he was the voice of bambi um
28:59
he became a u.s marine so he had to take
29:01
lives unfortunately as part of his
29:03
career
29:04
but he said that experience of seeing
29:06
what had happened uh
29:07
in bambi's story meant that he never
29:09
could bring himself to kill an animal so
29:11
maybe it does affect yeah just kill
29:13
loads of humans yeah
29:15
yeah but the one problem is that a
29:18
current according to sheriff brad delay
29:20
who um is in charge of the lawrence
29:22
county jail where they sent this guy
29:24
they only have one cinema so whenever
29:26
they put it on they have to get everyone
29:28
else
29:28
out of the room and no one else is
29:29
allowed to watch anything and this guy
29:31
just has to watch bambi that's amazing
29:33
do they just run free or what no it's
29:36
like it's like the recreation room
29:37
they just go to another part of the
29:38
prison okay okay
29:41
they don't go well the cinemas have used
29:43
why don't you just have a run around
29:45
the town that's all right just come back
29:48
in an hour an hour or two it'll be all
29:49
right
29:50
um he is amazing this actor who played
29:53
bambi donny dunigan
29:55
he was five years old when he got the
29:56
role which you know um
29:58
because that's what the role called for
30:00
um but he had been in a few movies
30:02
already
30:03
but his agent at the time hated the
30:06
sound of the film
30:07
and he said i've got a much bigger role
30:08
for you in a western so
30:10
i think you should take that and not
30:11
become bambi and donny dunigan
30:14
um heard this agent talking to his mum
30:16
on the phone
30:17
and he was quite rude to his mum on the
30:18
phone and so he fired his agent
30:21
at the age of five and variety ran a
30:23
story saying five-year-old actor fires
30:25
his manager
30:27
which is pretty cool you can't see bambi
30:28
doing that but he did say he had this
30:31
amazing moment and this kind of depends
30:33
on you having seen bambi which i learned
30:35
to my horror that james and dan
30:37
haven't uh presumably you have okay
30:40
good he fought in vietnam donnie
30:42
dunnigan much later on obviously
30:44
and do you remember the scene in bambi
30:46
where it's quite near the end and bambi
30:48
gets shot and he collapses and you think
30:51
bambi's in real trouble here
30:52
and then his father the big scary dear
30:54
sorry this is a huge spoiler by the way
30:55
guys but the big scary deer
30:56
comes up over him and suddenly says uh
31:00
you have to get up looks down at him and
31:01
says you know bambi come on you have to
31:03
get up by the testicles of your
31:05
ancestors
31:07
you must get up
31:10
[Laughter]
31:12
it's a very haunting and moving scene
31:17
but we all remember it yes
31:20
he says that verbatim and anyway tommy
31:24
dunnigan
31:25
born in vietnam and a grenade went off
31:28
and bizarrely he was knocked to the
31:29
ground and he got a bullet to the leg
31:31
exactly like bambi did in the film got a
31:34
bullet to the leg
31:34
collapsed and his sergeant he woke up to
31:37
find his sergeant standing over him
31:38
saying sir you must get up you have to
31:40
get up and they got up isn't that
31:42
amazing
31:43
that's crazy he was shot in a lot of
31:45
places he was asked to enumerate it and
31:47
he said he was shot
31:48
uh in the back of the head the stomach
31:50
the left leg the left lung
31:51
the scrotum he was he was yeah but he
31:54
didn't tell anyone else in the u.s
31:55
marines that he was the voice of bambi
31:58
because he knew he would have been
31:58
bullied i didn't tell anyone he was shot
32:01
i'm fine it's all good but your
32:03
testicles appear to be bleeding
32:07
i just deleted them to a clock
32:10
so bambi is based on a book not many
32:12
people know it's called bambia life in
32:14
the woods and it's by felix sultan
32:16
and um it's very different to the movie
32:19
so
32:19
in chapter 12 uh bambi has sex with his
32:22
cousin
32:25
what that's only in the director's cut
32:27
of the movie isn't it
32:29
uh he in chapter 12 he has a restless
32:32
desire he no longer recognizes his
32:34
cousin
32:34
feylin she's now a sex object and um
32:38
he has his merry way with feline all
32:41
night and he's so turned on
32:42
he forgets to eat and then a little bit
32:45
later
32:45
uh bambi's father gives him some drugs
32:51
and he says it tasted terribly bitter
32:53
and smelled sickeningly
32:54
and after many days in an opium like
32:56
days he heals
32:58
no no i'm afraid so what he does
33:01
we should say inbound but he does get
33:02
with his cousin i don't know i haven't
33:04
seen
33:05
feylin in the film is his cousin and he
33:07
gets you don't see a graphic
33:08
sex scene in right the edited version
33:11
i'd love to see felix being sat down by
33:13
walt disney going we love it we love it
33:15
we're so excited to have bought it
33:17
um we've got a few changes we'd like to
33:19
make
33:20
you know the drug i scene think that's
33:23
going to go down well with the
33:24
six-year-olds um
33:26
in the um same year as he wrote bambi uh
33:28
felix sultan felix sultan he wrote a
33:30
book called the hound of florence
33:32
which is about a man who turns into a
33:34
dog every other day
33:39
that sounds quite good yeah yeah well he
33:41
was he he wrote
33:42
um also another very famous book didn't
33:44
he which was actually a
33:46
an adult erotica book really did he
33:49
yeah it was uh it was called josephine
33:51
mutzenbacher the story of a viennese
33:53
33:54
as told by herself and um
33:58
and it appeared 20 years before his
33:59
bambi book um
34:01
but you obviously can see related themes
34:03
according to how the original novel
34:06
went but yeah it's still today it sold
34:07
three million copies it was a very big
34:09
book yeah
34:09
huge i'm just picturing some sort of
34:11
catastrophic mix-up with the two scripts
34:14
for the films
34:16
actually weirdly just uh quickly the
34:18
actor donnie dunnigan who
34:20
played bambi met thumper for the first
34:22
time when he was in his 80s
34:24
so they never met the kids just went in
34:26
to film the scenes and then obviously
34:27
the thumb kid went in afterwards
34:29
and then they met a few years ago when
34:31
they were both really old men they
34:32
guessed it on a tv show and bambi got to
34:34
be like hey thumper
34:35
that's very really sweet there's a
34:38
character in it
34:38
um that bambi refers to as man was that
34:41
right yes
34:42
it's man yeah so um that was a code that
34:45
got used in the disney offices
34:47
anytime walt disney arrived all the
34:49
animators and everyone would go
34:50
man is in the forest that was the code
34:53
to let everyone know
34:54
look like you're busy really and mann
34:57
got voted the
34:58
number 20 villain in the american film
35:01
institute's top
35:02
100 villains of all time did he just man
35:05
and also bambi was voted the 20th most
35:07
scary horror film of all time
35:12
that was according to time magazine wow
35:15
they did study a dead deer when they
35:16
were um making the film
35:19
yeah the animators wanted to see exactly
35:21
how a deer
35:22
would move and how it fit together so
35:24
they observed a deer corpse in various
35:26
stages of decomposition for
35:28
over several evenings to see the muscles
35:30
and tendons and how they all fit
35:31
together
35:31
i know they said there was a rich aroma
35:33
in the air
35:35
yeah actually according to scientists um
35:38
if
35:39
bambi's mother had died then really they
35:41
should have just shot bambi as well
35:44
because actually young deer when they're
35:46
often they tend to have very bad lives
35:48
because their
35:49
antlers don't work properly and they're
35:50
very likely to be killed so
35:52
um the humane thing if uh if a deer gets
35:55
opened is i've lost to the audience i
35:57
must say
35:59
wait the antlers don't work properly
36:01
yeah it's weird they don't grow properly
36:04
they grow much slower which means then
36:06
they're
36:06
they're less able to defend themselves
36:09
wow
36:10
we should do a series of no such thing
36:11
as a fish factually accurate movies
36:15
tonight bambi four minutes long
36:18
well here's another thing then in 2017
36:21
um scientists
36:21
discovered the first instance of a deer
36:24
eating human remains
36:26
we put that in there oh yeah yeah they
36:28
um found this um deer
36:30
um in the middle of um the forest and
36:33
it was holding a human bone in its mouth
36:35
like a cigar
36:38
where did i get the bone um if there
36:41
were been someone who had died
36:42
unfortunately it hadn't killed someone
36:44
no no because they do eat meat i
36:46
couldn't believe this i was reading a
36:48
blog
36:48
by uh someone in america who has been
36:50
hunting whitetail deer in the u.s
36:52
and says that they can eat me and they
36:56
fish so first of all they eat birds
36:58
sometimes they'll catch a bird in their
36:59
mouth
37:00
and eat it and then they go fishing
37:03
she said they don't go fishing they go
37:06
fishing
37:11
no this is what she said they use their
37:12
hooves to disable
37:14
fish such as trout they will then grab
37:16
the fish with their mouths chew it up
37:18
and swallow it
37:19
wow i think if you as a trout if you can
37:22
be caught by a deer
37:24
you've you deserve it yeah
37:28
you've failed as a trout you got cocky
37:31
you got too cocky
37:33
um we're gonna have to wrap up very
37:34
shortly okay it is quite common in
37:36
america are relatively common where they
37:38
give these kind of weird punishments
37:39
don't they there's a particular judge
37:41
called michael
37:42
ciccioni who is from paynesville ohio
37:45
paynesville which is a great name but
37:48
over the time he
37:49
um there was a guy who was caught with a
37:51
loaded gun and he was ordered to the
37:52
local mog to look at um
37:54
corpses there was a guy who had referred
37:56
to a police officer as a pig
37:57
and he was ordered to stand beside a
37:59
live pig with a sign
38:01
that read this is not a police officer
38:05
that's clever imagine if that police
38:07
officer got involved in like a major
38:09
crisis where he got involved like there
38:11
was
38:11
a car chase and this guy with this
38:13
massive sign is next to him
38:21
so imagine the pig suddenly gets
38:23
involved in like this
38:24
insane that's a disney movie i want to
38:27
see
38:28
oh my god i still think it's a good idea
38:32
it doesn't always work that thing
38:34
because in 2008 i think it was the same
38:35
judge
38:36
he uh 24 year old had been blasting
38:38
really loud music in his car
38:40
and he was said you can either play this
38:41
huge fine or you can have a very tiny
38:44
find but you have to listen to 20 hours
38:46
of classical music
38:47
to sort of show you that listening to
38:49
music you don't like is not fun and you
38:50
shouldn't play it for other people
38:52
and the guy said okay i'll take the 20
38:54
hours of classical music and he lasted
38:55
15 minutes
38:56
and then said i'm just going to pay the
38:57
fine actually
39:02
wow okay that is it that is all of our
39:06

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:16
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
this week coming to you live from
00:21
cardiff
00:29
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:31
sitting here with anna schizinski andrew
00:33
hunter murray and james harkin and once
00:36
again we have gathered around the
00:37
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:39
from the last seven days and in no
00:41
particular order here we go starting
00:44
with you james okay my fact this week is
00:46
that the oldest football cup competition
00:49
in spain is the copper del rey
00:52
each year the winner gets the name
00:53
engraved in the trophy in comic sans
00:58
the greatest font of them all
01:01
so i don't know if you know who invented
01:03
comic sans
01:04
anyone vincent conair and he did an
01:08
interview recently and they asked him
01:10
his favorite times that comic sans has
01:12
been used so he said that it was in the
01:14
copa del rey it was in a photo album
01:16
made by the vatican
01:19
and in the presentation by cern to
01:21
announce the discovery of the higgs
01:22
boson yes
01:25
but it wasn't it wasn't a vatican they
01:27
didn't announce the new pope in comic
01:29
sans or anything no they still did that
01:31
with the smoked smoke yeah yeah if you
01:33
could do the smoke in comic sans
01:37
it was a lovely photo album that they
01:38
gave to the pope so it was the vatican's
01:40
present to him and it was all the
01:42
captions were in it's the best way to
01:44
caption a book comic sans there's no
01:46
question you know he's only ever used it
01:48
once he says vincent conair he said he's
01:50
used comic sounds once in his life it
01:52
was when i was having trouble changing
01:54
my broadband to sky so i wrote them a
01:56
letter in comic sounds complaining
01:57
saying how disappointed i was he got 10
01:59
pound refund
02:02
he's he's very um
02:04
he's very bullish about it like he's
02:06
done he's done uh talks like a ted talk
02:08
or something saying
02:10
my name is vince connor and i've
02:11
invented the best font in the world um
02:13
and he's quite you know if people don't
02:15
like it he pushes back so he said if you
02:18
love comic sans then you don't know
02:20
anything about typography but if you
02:22
hate comic sense then you don't know
02:24
anything about typography either
02:27
okay and where should you stand
02:29
ambivalent i think so yeah
02:31
and he also he has a thing where he
02:34
loves the hatred for comic sans as well
02:36
he really thrives off it and he collects
02:38
examples of people's fury so he was
02:41
doing an interview again and he said
02:43
interesting fact the main designer at
02:44
twitter tweeted that the most service
02:46
space is used by complaints first about
02:49
airlines second comic sans third justin
02:53
bieber and then he says
02:55
so not even the bieber can beat comic
02:56
sans
02:58
but he's said it he said it's like
02:59
bieber yeah he has said it's the justin
03:01
bieber of fonts because lots of people
03:04
love him but a lot of people wouldn't
03:05
say it's the best music yeah that's fair
03:08
enough that's an i controversial opinion
03:09
here in cardiff anyway
03:12
yeah he said that he once went to the
03:14
design museum in london and had to have
03:15
a bodyguard
03:18
diddy hell well he said that i know he
03:20
maybe he was joking but um
03:22
just an interesting fact um his boss at
03:24
microsoft when he did that was rob
03:26
norton who was the son of mary norton
03:28
who wrote the borrowers
03:30
just a fact and also after he did the
03:33
comic sans he designed the ministry of
03:35
sound logo yeah just a few bits of
03:37
trivia there's this thing about comic
03:39
sans that gets claimed which is that the
03:40
reason it's used in schools and teachers
03:42
like it is because it makes children
03:43
read better and it's very good for
03:45
dyslexic children because partly because
03:47
the writing is very slightly unclear so
03:50
it takes you longer to read it and the
03:52
theory is that that makes you remember
03:53
it better but that's been shown to be
03:56
bollocks
03:57
so
03:59
teachers don't write in there is a font
04:02
called sans for gettica and that was
04:04
developed last year which tries to
04:06
achieve what people claim comic sans
04:08
does and so that's the typeface you
04:09
should look it up it's quite cool that's
04:11
quite difficult to read because it's got
04:12
lots of gaps in the letters and it just
04:14
means you it takes a bit more
04:16
concentration to read it but it is true
04:18
that your retention of whatever's
04:19
written there if it's in sounds for
04:21
gesica is much better so is it that if
04:23
you have something important
04:26
you should write it in sound forgetting
04:27
yes because it feels like quite a risky
04:29
if you're writing something important
04:30
it's something that people have to read
04:32
like an emergency sign or an exit sign
04:34
and you're saying you should write it
04:35
with bits missing so people really focus
04:37
on it
04:38
if it's something you have to remember
04:39
in future if it's something you need to
04:40
know now then maybe just write it in
04:42
times new romance
04:45
there's this thing just on that about
04:46
how you read um so when you read i
04:49
didn't know this you're jumping all the
04:51
time between uh the words and you're
04:54
yeah otherwise when you read a story you
04:57
just go once once once once
05:00
make the leap james make it once upon
05:04
once upon that once upon
05:06
okay okay
05:08
no i walked into that and that's there
05:10
so
05:11
you're doing these things called i think
05:12
it's saccades or cards and fixations
05:15
which is jumps and pauses and
05:17
if you're reading fluently what it turns
05:20
out you don't really look at the whole
05:21
word when you read it you look slightly
05:23
to the left of the middle of the word
05:24
you're reading
05:26
and you and you then sort of you see the
05:28
immediate letters around it and then you
05:29
kind of guess the other letters yeah as
05:31
you jump from one thing to another
05:32
that's so true that is happening right
05:34
now
05:35
this is live reading welcome
05:38
wow yeah um so in the um in 2008 um john
05:44
mccain when he was running for president
05:46
he chose optima as his font for his
05:48
signs
05:49
because it was the same typeface used on
05:51
the vietnam veterans memorial oh that
05:53
was his idea obama used gotham um which
05:56
has been described as friendly without
05:58
being folksy confident without being
06:00
aloof
06:02
wow that's quite similar to him which is
06:04
crazy because it's like a gotham villain
06:06
came into power right after him well
06:08
yeah
06:09
actually trump's campaign font was
06:11
called accidents grotesque
06:17
honestly true
06:20
that's a that's a designer having a
06:22
laugh or something isn't it that's
06:23
amazing
06:24
um you know there are font detectives
06:27
no yeah there are font detectives
06:29
why well
06:32
i'm looking at us like we could possibly
06:34
work out what that is
06:35
so
06:36
the font goes missing
06:38
yeah that would be good if sans forget
06:41
again just completely disappeared
06:43
um
06:44
no it's it's not quite that it's um it's
06:46
people who uh determine whether
06:47
documents are authentic by analyzing the
06:49
fonts in them so
06:51
if the dead sea scrolls are in comic
06:52
stands they're probably not exactly
06:55
so this guy thomas finney uh he writes
06:57
all these stories about his cases and he
06:59
writes them up like their sherlock
07:00
holmes stories is pretty cool um so in
07:03
like for example in 1999 this lawyer got
07:05
in touch with him because he was looking
07:07
at a will and he was trying to work out
07:09
is this wheel real or has it been
07:10
altered and finney discovered that the
07:13
will was dated 1983 but it was printed
07:16
by a high-res inkjet printer which
07:18
wasn't on the market until 1988. right
07:21
so
07:22
so that's good that's very good
07:25
but that's that's more like a printer
07:27
detective isn't it yeah
07:29
yeah it was an extremely poor example
07:31
from a wide portfolio of his career
07:34
on dead people in france one of the
07:36
things that the campaign against comic
07:38
sans hates the most so this is a
07:40
campaign that's set up by holly and
07:42
david combs or combs so i think we've
07:43
mentioned before but they say it just
07:46
doesn't look great in a lot of places
07:47
for instance says david combs a place
07:49
where it doesn't look great in my
07:51
opinion is on a tombstone and i have
07:53
seen a number of those
07:55
so there are tombstones out there with
07:56
comic sans yeah there's actually a
07:58
website you can go to called comic sans
08:00
criminal where it sort of lists all of
08:02
the most heinous crimes of comic sans
08:04
and it asks you the reader are you a
08:07
criminal and it shows you examples do
08:09
you agree with this kind of thing and
08:11
there was a the opening hours for a sex
08:13
offenders register office
08:19
sorry where sex offenders register yeah
08:22
really yeah okay and then um yeah there
08:24
was a defibrillator as well which just
08:26
looked really fun
08:28
there is a theory that this sort of this
08:31
the whole reason that comic sans became
08:32
huge is that it was a font that was
08:34
launched um it was designed for this
08:36
product called microsoft bob which
08:37
actually it ended up not being included
08:39
with it but it did get included as a
08:40
package in uh windows 95 i think
08:44
and this was the first time that all of
08:47
us could do typesetting you know before
08:49
that you needed to go to a designer and
08:51
then this and people have described this
08:53
as a massive shift in power you know
08:55
democratization of typesetting it's
08:56
basically like um what's his name
08:59
gutenberg
09:00
is like the second print revolution what
09:02
you're saying is basically when you give
09:04
people democratic choice they end up
09:06
doing something stupid
09:09
[Laughter]
09:16
you wouldn't have said that on our
09:17
sunderland gig would you
09:23
uh we're gonna have to move on to our
09:24
next fact soon um
09:26
but a couple of things about just other
09:28
weird trophy decisions um
09:31
there's a nascar sprint cup race that's
09:34
in martinsville and their trophy that
09:36
they give out
09:38
is a grandfather clock
09:40
it's just a giant grandfather clock
09:42
that's what you win um and that started
09:44
in 1964. it was it was given as a prize
09:47
everyone loved it so much and it's a big
09:49
thing it's a big thing to get a
09:50
grandfather clock until you get too many
09:52
there's a guy called dale ehrenhardt jr
09:54
who took home six and didn't really
09:58
just kept winning and it got to the
09:59
point was like did you do do i just
10:00
throw this one
10:02
how are you lifting that up well you
10:03
can't at the podium yeah it's a bit it's
10:05
a bit full-on wow i like um you know the
10:08
there's a trophy that's given out uh
10:10
ascot ladies day to the owner of the
10:13
winning racehorse which is it's like the
10:15
main event really alaska isn't it um and
10:17
the trophy is presented by the queen
10:20
but uh that causes a problem when she
10:23
wins it so she has won it before and and
10:26
prince andrew did step in to play the
10:28
role of the queen presenting it to the
10:30
queen for that but did he pl which queen
10:32
did he play did he play the presenting
10:34
queen
10:36
he played the one giving the trophy and
10:37
then she played the one well she was the
10:39
one receiving the trophy
10:43
just on uh fonts just it's always a good
10:46
idea to choose the right fonts because
10:48
there's a company called bell chic
10:50
and they had a bag that said my favorite
10:52
color is glitter
10:53
but they chose the wrong font and it
10:55
looked like my favorite color is hitler
10:58
oh
10:59
as a couple of years ago and then last
11:01
christmas um iceland chose the wrong
11:03
font and appeared to be selling minge
11:05
pies
11:06
[Laughter]
11:10
[Applause]
11:12
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:14
that is andy my fact is the american
11:17
product chock full o nuts contains no
11:21
nuts
11:23
it's a coffee product
11:26
that used the firm used to sell nuts and
11:28
then they they sold nuts and coffee and
11:30
then they stopped selling the nuts but
11:31
they thought well the name is so good
11:33
that we just have to keep the chock full
11:34
o nuts name
11:36
um yeah on the actually on the cans
11:38
sometimes some of the cans it says 1920s
11:40
we sold nuts 1930s we sold nuts and
11:44
coffee now we don't sell nuts we just
11:46
sell coffee but we like our name
11:50
and it has a massive disclaimer saying
11:52
contains no nuts and yet every time the
11:55
firm does any market research on why
11:56
people might not buy it people always
11:58
say that's probably nuts in it aren't
11:59
there it's probably not
12:01
chock full of nuts but it's a new it's a
12:03
new york product isn't it and it's if
12:05
you said if there was a new yorker near
12:07
you and you said chock full or nuts they
12:09
would say yeah i know it has no nuts and
12:11
it's a it's a big thing it was as soon
12:12
as they started going out into other
12:14
cities and countries that that became a
12:16
problem for them so they actually
12:18
existed fine without putting it on yeah
12:20
they have a picture of the new york
12:21
skyline as well on their packets but
12:24
they don't name it as the new york
12:26
skyline and their head of marketing said
12:28
that it's nice it worked perfectly for
12:30
us because people in new york see the
12:31
new york skyline and think this is for
12:32
me and then outside in york they have no
12:34
idea what the new york skyline looks
12:35
like so they just think yeah fine and
12:37
he's run focus groups all around america
12:39
saying you know would you object to
12:40
something that said new york on it and
12:42
they all say yes and then he says why
12:44
and they say oh i think it beats our
12:46
sports teams and that's it that's the
12:48
reason they won't eat nuts
12:50
there aren't any nuts in it
12:53
you've fallen right into the chain
12:55
have we said what it is it's it's a
12:56
cough cup
12:58
so it started by a guy called william
13:00
black
13:00
he rented a little space under a
13:02
staircase in new york and but it was
13:05
underneath the drugstore and he wasn't
13:06
allowed to sell anything that was sold
13:08
in the drugstore so he didn't know what
13:10
to sell but there was a theater opposite
13:11
so he decided to sell nuts but then when
13:14
the great depression struck according to
13:15
the website nuts seemed too much of a
13:17
luxury wow and so he had to find
13:19
something else but he had a roasting
13:21
machine for the nuts and so he decided
13:23
to go down to the to the docks buy green
13:25
coffee beans roast them themselves and
13:27
make coffee
13:29
and sandwiches right and sandwiches yeah
13:31
and we actually we spoke a few weeks ago
13:32
about how sandwiches that no human hand
13:35
had touched were a selling point in
13:37
those days because it meant that it
13:38
hadn't got any germs on it and he used
13:40
to sell his sandwiches advertisers
13:42
untouched by human hands and even when
13:44
they were making the sandwiches they had
13:46
to do it with tongs so you had to spread
13:48
the mayonnaise with one tongue and then
13:49
put the ham on with another and actually
13:51
they probably do that in cafes still i
13:52
don't know anything about hygiene
13:56
as i said i thought that doesn't sound
13:58
that bad
14:00
so just sort of product names basically
14:02
um this is a big thing especially in
14:04
america so there's a there's a cereal
14:06
called fruit loops but fruit is spelt
14:08
f-r-o-o-t and there's also captain
14:11
crunch with crunch berries and these
14:13
have been the subjects of repeated
14:14
lawsuits uh from people who claimed i've
14:17
been deceived i thought this was full of
14:18
fruit and really good for me um
14:21
and there are whole statements by judges
14:23
saying things like um here's one from
14:25
2009. this court is not aware of nor has
14:27
plaintiff alleged the existence of any
14:29
actual fruit referred to as a
14:31
crunchberry
14:31
[Laughter]
14:33
furthermore the crunchberries depicted
14:35
on the box of round crunchy brightly
14:37
colored cereal balls so far as this
14:39
court has been made aware there is no
14:40
such fruit growing in the wild or
14:42
occurring naturally in any part of the
14:43
world
14:45
you've got to be so careful though
14:46
because like red bull got sued in 2014
14:49
um for the fact that they don't actually
14:51
give you wings there was a problem oh
14:53
yeah yeah yeah it was it was a mixture
14:55
of that was one guy who's part of the
14:56
court case who said i didn't actually
14:58
grow any wings the rest said it claims
15:00
that it gives you this great energy and
15:01
it gives you these boosts and so they
15:03
actually had to pay out a huge amount of
15:05
money um including ten dollars to every
15:08
u.s consumer who'd bought the drink
15:10
since 2002 if they wrote in no really
15:13
yeah i remember there was once some
15:15
sausages sold in wales called dragon
15:17
sausages that had to be taken off
15:19
because they didn't contain any dragons
15:22
is that true that's true yeah very
15:24
disappointing for the cardiff audience
15:26
i thought you've been eating dragons all
15:28
these years
15:29
um there's a hair product in i think in
15:31
the u.s called rogaine and it was
15:34
originally called regain and then the
15:36
fda the food and drugs administrator
15:39
nixed that because they said you can't
15:40
call it regain because obviously it
15:41
doesn't work because hair regrowth
15:43
products don't work wow so you have to
15:44
change the vowels
15:46
there was a tattoo artist in london
15:49
whose salon was called prick
15:52
he was called henry hate
15:55
and he tried to stop a nearby cactus
15:57
shop from using the same name
16:00
and this guy henry hates is kind of
16:02
semi-famous because he did a lot of amy
16:04
winehouse's tattoos okay um and he
16:06
thought that this person with the cactus
16:08
shop was kind of passing off with his
16:10
edgy rock and roll name but then he went
16:12
to court and court judge melissa clarke
16:15
said it is difficult to imagine two
16:17
businesses with two less closely related
16:21
i activities is fair i can imagine two
16:24
things less similar than tattoos and
16:25
cactuses like um like a waffle maker and
16:29
then a sort of
16:30
like a rolls-royce engine firm
16:33
yeah
16:34
and if i had a bit longer i could have
16:36
come up with something really really
16:37
different
16:38
i guess they're both round don't they so
16:40
it doesn't really work yeah
16:42
well
16:43
[Laughter]
16:44
just on that um very similar note in
16:46
2018 a rapper dr dre lost a trademark
16:50
case to another man called dr dre who
16:52
has written books including 20 things
16:54
you might not know about the vagina
16:57
and the judge in that case said that
17:00
confusion was unlikely as dr dre is not
17:02
a medical doctor nor is he qualified to
17:04
provide any type of medical service
17:08
but they should get together because i
17:09
would listen to a dr dre rap about 20
17:12
things you might not know about the
17:13
vagina
17:14
to be honest i think there's quite a lot
17:16
of that in his wraps
17:19
it's not just on the famous names thing
17:21
um they're in australia at the moment
17:23
there's a pop-up burger place which a
17:26
lot of people trying to not shut down
17:28
but get them to change their name and
17:29
they're called pablo escoburgers and
17:33
and when you buy a burger from pablo
17:35
escoburgers you get um a fake line of
17:38
white powder it's like it's like
17:40
it's like a garlic flower that's on top
17:42
of the bun and then there's a rolled up
17:44
hundred dollar note next to it um
17:47
presumably a fake hundred dollar note
17:49
real it's real um yeah yeah fake
17:51
definitely fake the passing off thing is
17:54
quite it's like it's really well
17:55
established so for example we we've
17:56
mentioned on the podcast before the
17:58
first ever
17:59
self-service supermarket are you one
18:00
where you get a basket and you go around
18:01
or a trolley and you go around putting
18:03
things in rather than going to a counter
18:05
and handing over a list the first ever
18:07
of those in america was called piggly
18:09
wiggly and that was a fun novelty name
18:11
but it was immediately followed by
18:13
another firm setting up called hoggily
18:14
woggily
18:16
and then helpy selfie and then savey
18:19
wavy and these are all completely
18:20
different firms
18:21
um do you know that the food and drugs
18:23
administration in america when it's when
18:26
people are coming up with names for new
18:28
drugs they run it through a whole bunch
18:30
of handwriting tests so they get loads
18:31
of people in to write the drugs in
18:33
certain types of handwriting to make
18:35
sure that they can never be mistaken in
18:37
certain handwriting for other drugs oh
18:38
really that's really clever clever very
18:40
clever the letter z appears in 18 it
18:43
appears 18 times as often in drug names
18:46
as it does in other english words
18:48
yeah okay because it seems speedy and
18:52
powerful and memorable because it's
18:53
weird
18:54
so what's the drug that's got zed in it
18:58
wow
18:59
oh yeah well that's not really how i
19:01
feel when i take it
19:01
[Laughter]
19:04
um have you guys heard of breakfast
19:05
mates
19:06
no no this was a product this is
19:08
actually just more a disastrous product
19:09
than a bad name so it was launched in
19:11
1998 it was kellogg's breakfast mates
19:14
and it was an all-in-one package with
19:16
one serving of cereal one tiny tiny
19:18
carton of milk and one plastic spoon and
19:21
it was designed for people who find
19:23
normal cereal just too inconvenient and
19:25
too much of a hassle in the morning that
19:27
does sound quite a good idea yeah so you
19:29
get on the train with your breakfast
19:31
mates and you just pour out your cereal
19:32
into the bowl and then anyway basically
19:35
they had neglected to realize that
19:36
cereal is one of the most easy things to
19:38
prepare
19:39
and
19:40
there was there was testing which went
19:42
on and it showed that preparing cereal
19:44
the traditional way took one second
19:46
longer than breakfast mates
19:50
it adds up
19:51
okay it is time for fact number three
19:54
and that is chozinski my fact this week
19:57
is that the scientist robert hook
19:59
recorded in his diary every time he had
20:02
an orgasm
20:04
so this is
20:07
you might remember robert hook from
20:08
school you learn about hooke's law i
20:10
didn't learn about this
20:13
well you actually do learn about hook's
20:15
law of elasticity which is a veiled
20:17
reference
20:20
he was a polymath he was an unbelievably
20:22
high achieving scientist around at the
20:24
same time as newton and he wrote
20:27
extensive diaries where he recorded
20:28
every detail of his life including his
20:31
orgasms and he had a sign for when he
20:33
had an orgasm which was the sign of
20:35
pisces which is kind of sort of like a
20:37
backwards c and then a c back to back
20:40
and we're we actually are not 100 sure
20:42
that it was all of them but we kind of
20:45
assume people have used this as a basis
20:47
of what his sex drive was yeah yeah so
20:50
for instance um in one of his diaries it
20:52
says played with nell pisces sign hurt
20:56
small of back
20:59
that could have been twister he was
21:02
another one went late to bed pisces sign
21:05
in sleep sweat much and disturbed
21:08
[Music]
21:09
and then another one that made wormwood
21:11
wine pisces sign pisces sign
21:22
oh my goodness
21:23
um but yeah he was into it he had a
21:25
weird sex life actually hook so he
21:27
didn't really have relationships it was
21:29
kind of sad he never had sex with
21:32
someone who wasn't sort of financially
21:34
dependent on him or dependent for a home
21:35
so he used to have a lot of liaisons
21:37
with servants and shagged them a lot
21:38
like nell and then he had this weird
21:42
relationship with grace his niece who
21:44
was sent to live with him by his brother
21:46
who was sent to live with him when she
21:48
was 10 and then but she pretty much
21:49
turned 16 and he was like all right you
21:51
want to get off do you want a pisces
21:53
song you want a bunch of signs
21:56
he he was incredible i mean he he sort
22:00
of
22:00
someone described him um
22:02
as leonardo da vinci but without the
22:04
paintings
22:05
yeah so
22:07
which sounds pretty crap doesn't it but
22:09
it was
22:10
it sort of he worked on all these
22:12
different fields like he invented a
22:14
microscope and he used that to to draw
22:16
incredibly tiny things no one had seen
22:18
before or he designed thermometers or he
22:21
came up with telescopes so he invented
22:23
the word cell to mean a tiny cell in a
22:26
body it's pretty cool he saw them didn't
22:28
he looked in his microscope at some cork
22:30
and he saw these little he named them
22:31
after the cells that monks lived in
22:34
but he didn't know that what they did he
22:35
thought they was to send liquid around
22:37
the body or something like that so he
22:39
didn't really know what they were but he
22:40
did give the name which is quite good he
22:42
invented some flying machines in his
22:44
diaries he drew them he he invented the
22:46
first pressure cooker cool that's very
22:48
good he sort of claimed to have flown he
22:52
he experimented with lots of fly
22:53
machines on the grounds of wadham
22:54
college where he went to uni with his
22:56
friends he built all these machines and
22:58
then he did write in his diary in 1674
23:01
uh told sir robert suthell his friend
23:03
told him i could fly but i didn't tell
23:05
him
23:06
how just
23:08
10 cans of red bull
23:10
[Laughter]
23:12
he was a proper scientist and he did a
23:14
lot of measurements and stuff like that
23:15
and in those days it was long thought
23:17
that masturbation was extremely bad for
23:19
you and so one reason that he always
23:22
mentioned it in his diaries is because
23:24
it was like an ongoing appraisal of his
23:25
health so he would be able to see how
23:27
often it had happened and then he'd be
23:29
able to see how he's feeling because he
23:31
was a hypochondriac as well no no i'm
23:33
just conducting an ongoing appraisal of
23:34
my health sure
23:39
it's an experiment
23:40
[Laughter]
23:44
he when you say he's like leonardo
23:46
without the paintings interestingly we
23:49
don't know what he looks like we have no
23:51
idea there were no surviving paintings
23:53
of robert hook and that is very
23:54
surprising because he was such a
23:57
prominent person the royal society
23:59
particularly loved him every all the
24:01
scientists they didn't like him as a
24:02
person but they respected the hell out
24:04
of what he did his books were admired
24:06
from by peeps through to all the top
24:08
scientists and there is a rumor and it's
24:11
definitely a rumor um that the rivalry
24:13
that happened between him and isaac
24:15
newton was so great that when isaac
24:16
newton became the um president of the
24:19
royal society and at this point hooker
24:22
died that he slashed all of the
24:24
paintings of robert hook to say this was
24:26
not someone we need to i don't think
24:28
it's a ruler i think that's widely
24:30
accepted to have happened i think that
24:31
he probably did it i yeah we don't have
24:33
evidence i think there was one painting
24:35
and he and newton hated each other they
24:37
had a massive rivalry and newton did
24:39
erase him from scientific history for a
24:42
long time we all think newton's a good
24:44
guy but and then he became president of
24:46
the royal society who happened to have
24:47
this painting which has disappeared ever
24:48
since you raised him but all that
24:50
survived were the orgasms
24:52
[Laughter]
24:53
poor guy
24:55
if you get a uv light in the royal
24:57
society you can see the evidence
25:05
that's all that's left of him it's so
25:06
sad
25:08
but yeah he yeah he he sort of
25:11
preceded newton in his theory of inner
25:13
theory of gravity which is a bit vague
25:14
of the newtons but he said that planets
25:16
were attracted to each other the sun and
25:17
the planets were attracted to each other
25:19
he said gravity was a universal force
25:21
and newton claimed credit uh his diaries
25:23
also chronicled his flatulence uh and it
25:26
was always in conjunction with the
25:27
barometric pressure of the area
25:30
because he thought that the two might be
25:32
connected in some way so you thought if
25:34
there's
25:34
if it was low pressure you know it's
25:36
like today there's a storm coming in
25:38
everyone would be farting a lot
25:41
that more so much sense it does make
25:43
sense nice does it is it true yeah it
25:45
does because if it's low pressure you
25:46
would have thought that you know your
25:48
gas goes from an area of high pressure
25:49
to an area of low pressure out through
25:51
your erection
25:52
i reckon it's true
25:54
i don't think i'm on the news going well
25:55
we've been getting a lot of reports of
25:57
flatulence from the area of cardiff um
26:00
now it's over to anna with the weather
26:04
one long fart take your umbrella around
26:06
today
26:12
i mean he also wrote a lot about um he
26:14
was a hypochondriac he said that he
26:17
suffered from giddiness indigestion
26:18
flatulence blockages of the sinuses
26:22
sore eyes noises in the head insomnia
26:24
and he took all these different
26:25
medicines uh which he wrote all about as
26:27
well so he took steel iron oxide opium
26:30
amber purgatives and whatever his
26:33
medicine gave him constipation he said
26:34
he was cheated of a [ __ ]
26:38
that's a great phrase
26:40
he was basically a drug addict though
26:42
yeah he was so ill he took all the drugs
26:45
and in those days medical drugs were
26:47
basically all the illegal drugs now like
26:49
opium and cannabis and lordnam and stuff
26:51
like that there's one other thing he
26:52
took because science was in its infancy
26:54
he believes a lot of uh rather dubious
26:56
stuff so he noted down that a thing
26:58
called circus humanum was really good
27:00
for removing uh films or mists from the
27:02
eyes and circus humanum is dried and
27:05
powdered human poo
27:08
apparently you were meant to blow it
27:09
into your eyes and this would heal your
27:12
eyes
27:14
does it work it doesn't work okay
27:17
actually i haven't even checked that but
27:18
i just think it's important to say
27:21
i think this is the moment that don't
27:23
try this at home was inventive
27:26
on putting stuff in your eye samuel
27:28
peeps the probably the world's most
27:30
famous diarist who was around at the
27:32
same time and who in fact met hook he
27:35
only wrote his diary for nine years i
27:37
had no idea it's so weird because he's
27:40
basically the main source for everything
27:41
i've ever read about um the 1600s and he
27:44
wrote his story from 1660 to 1669 when
27:47
he panicked that he was going blind
27:49
because he'd been writing it too much
27:51
and he quit and he never wrote another
27:52
word because he said i'm going blind uh
27:55
this the good god prepare me for this
27:57
awful affliction i'm on my way out and
27:59
then he lived for a further 34 years
28:01
without going blind without going back
28:04
wow that's amazing he did write amazing
28:06
he was famous i guess for the sex stuff
28:08
like if you there's any time you think
28:10
of peeps it was he wrote very much about
28:12
his sex life in it but here's an entry
28:14
that i read so i to bed and in the night
28:17
was mightily troubled with a looseness
28:20
and feeling for a chamber pot there was
28:22
none i having called the maid up out of
28:25
her bed she had forgot i suppose to put
28:27
one there so i was forced in this
28:30
strange house to rise and [ __ ] in the
28:32
chimney twice
28:37
and so to bed and was very well again
28:42
how i wish i had been cheated over [ __ ]
28:45
wow
28:46
you know you prefaced that by saying he
28:48
was into the sex stuff yeah
28:50
okay um
28:55
a bit too much from my diary there
28:58
okay we need to move to our final fact
29:00
of the show and that is my fact my fact
29:03
this week is that warty comb jellies
29:07
grow a brand new anus every time they
29:10
need to defecate
29:12
how cool is that so a wart comb jelly is
29:14
like a jellyfish but not it's a
29:16
different species
29:17
but they look very similar if you saw it
29:19
in the ocean and uh for very for a very
29:22
long time we assumed they had an anus
29:24
and it's only just recent this is almost
29:26
breaking news in science and very
29:28
exciting news because what they learn is
29:31
that when it goes to the toilet this was
29:33
a guy called sydney tam who was studying
29:35
them very closely with microscopes
29:37
every time they needed the toilet
29:39
basically the the
29:41
waste bit pushed towards the edge of
29:42
their body on the inside and this anus
29:45
grew
29:46
out of nowhere
29:48
and then soon as it was out it closed up
29:50
again and then they are anus-less once
29:52
again
29:53
and because they poo once virtually
29:56
every hour they grow 24 anuses every day
30:01
it sounds like you're pitching to be the
30:02
new david attenborough
30:07
but this is very exciting in science
30:09
because it's a transient anus it's a
30:11
it's a it's
30:13
it's never before been seen in any of
30:16
the living species that we have well
30:18
there are there are a few transcendences
30:20
only one of a handful of
30:22
[Laughter]
30:24
this is the first scientific observation
30:26
of one though
30:27
yeah yeah we've um we know of a few
30:28
because we have mentioned one on the
30:29
podcast actually there's a jaw worm uh
30:31
who has a transient anus called
30:33
haplognathia
30:35
and there's also a microscopic creature
30:37
called limnogdaffia which lives in the
30:40
hot springs on disco island in greenland
30:45
transient anus on disco island
30:48
nice
30:49
i mean the researcher who found this is
30:50
really cool um he works at a lab called
30:52
woods whole which is interesting and he
30:56
he watched individual watery comb
30:58
jellies for hours and he marked the
31:00
times of their defecations and then when
31:02
the time was exactly right for the next
31:04
one he zoomed in with a microscope and
31:06
he found that he saw the the wormhole
31:09
opening basically
31:11
well it is kind of like a wormhole it's
31:12
like a stargate
31:14
they call it the ring of fusion
31:16
don't they
31:18
that's the process behind it when the
31:20
canal and basically the way they think
31:22
it happens is that basically it's all
31:24
fused up and then your anal canal swirls
31:27
and swells and swells and presses
31:28
against your skin tissue and eventually
31:30
it creates little orifice that that
31:32
dilates and then it sucks itself back in
31:35
again incredible dan said that it's a
31:37
bit like a jellyfish it certainly looks
31:38
like a jellyfish but it's not related to
31:40
a jellyfish in any way really it is less
31:44
related to a jellyfish than we are to a
31:46
worm
31:48
okay and that's because about 550
31:49
million years ago the types of animals
31:52
in the world were worms sponges
31:54
jellyfish and comb jellies which is this
31:56
type of jelly
31:57
and worms kind of turned into all the
32:00
different animals and mammals and birds
32:01
and lizards and everything and the
32:03
jellyfish and the comb jellies had
32:05
already split off way before that it's
32:07
as different from a jelly as a tattoo
32:09
parlor is from a cactus emporium
32:14
they are amazing comb jellies and you
32:16
like you should look them up because
32:17
they're also kind of beautiful but the
32:19
way they move is they have cilia so you
32:22
may remember cilia from school as well
32:24
those tiny hairs we have in our nose and
32:25
our lungs and they use cilia these
32:28
little hairs as ores to propel them
32:30
along and they're the biggest things
32:31
that use them for movement they run in
32:34
in combs in eight rows on their body and
32:38
uh yeah they're the largest animals to
32:40
do it and the main uh
32:42
main jelly is almost six feet wide so
32:45
they're quite some of them can get quite
32:46
big wow yeah but mostly they're like
32:49
under 16 inches quite small the eating
32:51
method is very cool i think it's not
32:53
exactly those ones but there are things
32:55
called beroid comb jellies because their
32:56
whole family they're different members
32:58
of the family and um steroid comb
33:00
jellies they eat their food before they
33:02
kill it
33:03
so they're just basically a bag floating
33:05
in the ocean and if they spot some prey
33:08
which is normally another jelly um they
33:10
just swallow it hot they just open the
33:12
back the mouth of the bag swallow their
33:14
prey and then they just keep their mouth
33:16
shut for as long as they can um while
33:18
they're pulling their prey apart on the
33:19
inside they actually have mouths that
33:21
reseal that basically disappear like
33:24
like zippers they're described as or
33:26
it's like a zip yeah so they
33:28
open their mouths which their mouths are
33:30
about half of their body so it's like a
33:32
plastic bag opening and they engulf this
33:35
other jelly often bigger than they are
33:37
and then they zip it shut and they
33:39
properly fuse their mouths back together
33:41
again until they're ready to eat wow
33:43
this is amazing but these particular
33:45
jellies that we are talking about the
33:47
ones with the trans containers
33:49
they're called
33:50
nemiopsis lady
33:52
and they are also known as sea walnuts
33:55
and a few other things now these guys
33:57
they eat by again opening their mouth
33:59
but then when they open it it creates
34:01
almost like a current you know those
34:03
rides when you're on like a donut and
34:05
you're going really slowly down there
34:06
down there so they start that kind of
34:08
current but it's so so slow the things
34:11
that get caught in this current don't
34:12
even realize there's a current
34:14
and they just suddenly slowly slowly
34:17
float into this place and before they
34:18
know it they're eating almost like a
34:20
conveyor belt that the food just comes
34:22
in them and it comes in them and they
34:23
can eat an unbelievable amount of stuff
34:26
they can eat 10 times their body weight
34:27
in a day
34:28
and so they end up basically taking over
34:31
lakes so there was some taken to the
34:32
black sea by accident in some bilgewater
34:35
and in less than a decade the population
34:37
in the black sea had gone got a biomass
34:40
of 1 billion tons
34:42
which was 10 times the weight of all the
34:44
fish that were caught in the world that
34:45
year
34:47
it's incredible it's unbelievable and
34:50
weirdly we don't know a huge amount
34:52
about them and uh really we thought they
34:54
were far fewer species than there are
34:56
until recently and that's partly because
34:58
they're really hard to study because the
34:59
moment you attempt to pick them up they
35:01
fall apart so there's um and genuinely
35:05
they sort of melt in your hands so i
35:07
think there was a spotted comb jelly
35:10
displayed in california's monterey bay
35:12
aquarium and it was like literally water
35:15
currents in the aquarium would just tear
35:17
it into so it's very difficult to
35:19
collect and this actually i was reading
35:22
a piece about this monterey bay aquarium
35:23
and the jellies that they collected and
35:26
they uh the main marine biologist there
35:28
was talking about them and he was also
35:30
saying that they shimmer so when they
35:33
have a light shone on them then they
35:35
their little cilia break up the
35:37
wavelengths of light and they reflect
35:38
them so they're sort of all rainbow
35:40
colors and that actually wouldn't happen
35:42
in the wild but it does want to shine a
35:43
light on them but the marine biologist
35:45
at the aquarium who talked about that is
35:46
called steve haddock
35:48
ah
35:49
nice
35:50
so lots of primitive life forms have
35:54
only one uh hole in their bodies and
35:56
they have to eat through that and
35:57
excrete through that and the reason that
35:59
we are better than them and i'm just
36:01
going to say it i think we are better
36:02
than them
36:03
i'm sorry i'm an egalitarian but i do
36:05
think we are we've got them beat all
36:07
right
36:08
so the reason that you need it is
36:10
because if you have a through gut which
36:12
is what we've got um if you don't have
36:14
that then you can't eat anything until
36:17
you've excreted your previous meal so
36:19
it's a very inefficient system so
36:21
basically you can't have your lunch
36:22
until you've pooed out your breakfast
36:24
exactly oh exactly yes i told you we
36:27
were better than them
36:28
[Laughter]
36:30
just on um sort of being able to regrow
36:33
body parts you know that we can regrow
36:35
stuff humans we can we grow fingertips
36:38
and especially children can regrow
36:41
huge chunks of their fingers so children
36:43
up to the age of 10 can there's not an
36:45
amber for cutting off
36:47
yeah the fingertips again
36:49
it's that don't try this at home thing
36:50
isn't it
36:51
well you know if they've broken the tv
36:53
curfew what else can you do
36:57
i suppose if you cut their fingertips
36:59
off they won't be able to use the remote
37:00
control
37:01
can't use the remote exactly and um if
37:04
you cut off the fingertips or if the
37:06
fingertips of children under 10 fall off
37:08
then
37:11
as as is very likely to happen which
37:14
they do it's a defensing court um and
37:16
you don't sew them up so what doctors
37:18
tend to do is seal them up with flaps of
37:20
skin so you've just got a shorter finger
37:21
at that point but if you don't do that
37:23
then they'll tend to grow back and
37:24
interestingly they grow back but they
37:26
don't have a fingerprint oddly and also
37:29
the way they grow back if there was any
37:30
nail left at all tiny bit of nail it
37:32
will grow back but it will grow back
37:34
square rather than oval which is how our
37:36
how our nails grow so it grows back
37:38
fully square
37:39
i have that
37:41
i have a slightly square fingertip and
37:42
that's because my finger got shut in the
37:43
door
37:45
oh you didn't break the tv
37:46
tv curfew
37:49
i made sure to bring in all the telly's
37:51
from the garden
37:53
right on time
37:55
we're gonna have to wrap up very soon oh
37:56
just one more thing i'm afraid this is
37:58
about um the word uh it's about the word
38:01
in the fact um so there are old
38:04
there are old books there are book
38:06
scanners which are designed to digitize
38:08
uh very elderly books books from the
38:09
19th 18th century that kind of thing
38:11
which no one's read and convert them
38:13
into ebooks so they can be read
38:14
unfortunately there are some book
38:16
scanners which cannot tell the
38:17
difference between the word arms and the
38:18
word anus
38:20
um and it literally can't tell its arse
38:22
from its elbow isn't that pleasing
38:24
so
38:25
this does make a number of old books
38:27
quite exciting so for example
38:31
bertie dear bertie will you not say good
38:33
night to me pleaded the sweet voice of
38:34
minnie hamilton as she wound her anus
38:36
affectionately around her brother's neck
38:41
[Laughter]
38:45
when she spotted me she flung her anus
38:47
high in the air
38:49
oh boy she said she grabbed my anus and
38:51
positioned my body in the direction of
38:53
the east gallery and we started
38:59
i walking reading the book of farewell
39:01
to anus online actually and i really
39:03
enjoyed it
39:04
written by a comb jelly
39:07
okay that is it that is all of our facts
39:10
thank you so much for listening if you
39:12

00:04
[Music]
00:15
hello
00:16
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish
00:20
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:22
live from newcastle
00:31
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:33
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
00:35
hunter murray and james harkin
00:37
and once again we have gathered around
00:39
the microphones with our four favorite
00:41
facts from the last seven days
00:42
and in no particular order here we go
00:46
starting with fact number one and that's
00:48
my fact this week
00:49
my fact is some of the plants at the
00:52
poison gardens
00:53
at anik castle are so deadly they are
00:56
kept in cages
00:58
yeah they don't surely they don't think
01:00
they're going to escape do they
01:03
this is this is does anyone if we're up
01:05
near the area of anik castle does anyone
01:07
know it
01:08
yeah yeah so this is they have this
01:11
poison garden
01:12
and everything in it basically is aiming
01:14
to kill you
01:15
as a species of plant so you're not
01:17
allowed to
01:18
touch anything you're not allowed to
01:20
taste anything it'd be weird if you did
01:21
that anyway
01:22
um you're not really well i'm not sure
01:24
because some of the things
01:26
there are opium poppies cannabis and
01:28
magic mushrooms
01:30
so now i think i know why the um cages
01:32
are there especially after that cheer
01:35
if i was a gardener there what i would
01:37
do i would make some
01:38
some fake cages but i'd leave them you
01:40
know busted open
01:41
with the with the door hanging off his
01:43
hinges and something in there
01:45
yeah exactly and then just
01:49
with your group you're bringing in just
01:50
dash out don't say anything i'd run
01:52
around looking worried
01:54
no this is so they do have a number of
01:56
cages um a couple of them it is because
01:59
they are drugs like cannabis and opium
02:01
but they also have things like giant
02:02
hogweed
02:03
um and i listened to an interview by
02:05
their head gardener who's called trevor
02:06
jones and
02:08
he was saying that that's one of the
02:09
things that they need to keep in there
02:10
because they have a lot of children
02:11
coming to the gardens
02:13
and giant hogweed are very tall they're
02:15
about eight foot tall and and kids love
02:17
to run around
02:17
underneath it um but it does things like
02:20
blis if you touch it it blisters
02:22
your skin and it can go to almost third
02:23
degree burns and
02:25
uh gardeners that they know who work
02:26
there who've had contact with it have
02:28
all been hospitalized within hours
02:30
this is a very dangerous deadly drug
02:32
yeah so um
02:33
i think also it is a bit of show that
02:35
they want to sort of yeah well they do
02:36
say don't they say
02:37
though that also as well as not tasting
02:39
or touching you shouldn't sniff
02:41
the flat the plants in there and you say
02:43
it's show but
02:44
one summer apparently quite recently i
02:46
think seven people
02:47
fainted from just inhaling the toxic
02:49
fumes they're emanating from the plants
02:51
i don't know why anyone visits this
02:52
place
02:54
has anyone here ever fainted at the
02:56
poisonous gardens
02:58
no no no it's not proven yet but it will
03:00
be but what you say about it being like
03:02
for sure
03:03
i mean on the gates they do have like
03:04
skull and crossbones and a big sign
03:06
saying these plants can kill
03:08
excellent so it is you know so it was
03:10
set up by um
03:12
the local duchess is it the duchess of
03:13
northumberland she kind of
03:15
owns the place and she's um she's pretty
03:18
goth
03:18
like she's um she's got she's a big fan
03:22
of taxidermy so she has 20
03:24
stuffed dogs which is a lot even if
03:27
you've got a big house that is a lot of
03:28
stuffed dogs to own
03:29
she so she has this whole um there's one
03:32
plant there
03:32
uh which is called brugmansia or angel's
03:35
trumpet
03:36
and the duchess says it is an amazing
03:39
aphrodisiac
03:39
before it kills you wow but you die
03:44
happy well
03:46
supposedly um victorian ladies would um
03:48
would add tiny amounts of the pollen to
03:50
their tea because it gives you a bit of
03:51
a
03:51
bit of a buzz a bit of a little trip and
03:54
also i found this claimed i don't think
03:56
this is true
03:56
that prostitutes in paris used to put
03:58
the pollen in their clients drinks
04:00
because it makes you sleepy but it also
04:03
has the reputation of making you dream
04:05
about wild sexual adventures and you'd
04:08
wake up
04:08
and you'd think you'd done all this
04:10
crazy stuff and actually you hadn't
04:12
slept with anybody at all you just had a
04:14
cup of tea
04:16
actually angel's trumpet is a
04:18
particularly frightening one
04:20
people still take it it was quite
04:20
popular in the early 2000s at festivals
04:22
when people got into herbal highs it's a
04:24
really bad idea to take it it's very
04:26
dangerous
04:26
a man in germany a few years ago took
04:29
some and then used a pair of garden
04:30
shears to cut off his own tongue and
04:32
penis
04:34
wow in that order
04:39
i'm just thinking you won't be able to
04:41
scream if you cut your tongue off
04:43
oh yeah it is it's just sensible isn't
04:45
it whichever order you've done it's
04:47
weird that he did one and thought oh
04:48
that was a good idea
04:51
oh my god
04:56
i've never found a fact before that i'm
04:57
just going to choose not to believe it's
04:58
true
05:01
they say if you take angel's trumpet it
05:03
makes you feel hot as a hair
05:05
blind as a bat dry as a bone red as a
05:07
beet and mad as a hatter
05:10
[Laughter]
05:14
there's a word which is for a sort of
05:16
blanket word for any antidote to
05:18
a poison which is mithra darty it's a
05:20
bit of an old word
05:21
but it comes from mithridates whose
05:24
mythologies are sick there was an
05:25
anatolian king in the second century bc
05:27
and i really like him he had this
05:29
terrible phobia of being poisoned which
05:31
is fair enough his dad was killed by
05:32
poisoning and you know it was the olden
05:34
days people were always trying to poison
05:35
each other
05:35
and so he decided to combat this really
05:38
clever
05:39
you know over 2000 years ago he would
05:41
ingest lots of poisons every day
05:43
his whole life to try and build up an
05:44
immunity and
05:46
uh this kind of worked and it was
05:48
actually kind of cool he also was the
05:50
first person to use a chemical weapon in
05:52
that he used
05:52
mad honey so this is honey that uh makes
05:55
you get really really sick
05:57
it's honey that's uh made by bees of
05:59
eating poisonous rhododendron
06:00
so he's known for that um but so he was
06:02
very successful in war he was always
06:04
eating this poison and he built up this
06:05
immunity
06:06
and then at the end of his life he was
06:07
about to lose in battle
06:09
and the thing to do then was to commit
06:10
suicide and he tried multiple times and
06:13
couldn't do it because he was immune to
06:14
all the poisons
06:16
but he hadn't like stabbed himself in
06:18
the heart lots of times growing up honey
06:20
he could have done something that wasn't
06:21
a poison well eventually he did have to
06:23
get his mates to stab him
06:24
all right it wasn't how he wanted to go
06:26
well there are some other people who did
06:28
that so
06:29
um the fisher kanye are known as poison
06:32
damsels and they're in
06:33
ancient indian tradition um so they
06:36
probably didn't exist but it's the story
06:39
and they were raised on poisons from
06:40
birth and what it meant was that they
06:43
possessed lethally poisonous bodily
06:45
fluids
06:46
so they got loads and loads of poisons
06:47
as they grow up and then all of their
06:49
bodily fluids to anyone else was really
06:51
poisonous according to legend
06:52
and so anyone who had sex with them
06:54
would die
06:55
right wow that's amazing again it's not
06:59
true
07:00
were they doing it deliberately is it
07:02
yeah so again it's this mythicism
07:04
where they deliberately did that and
07:06
they were used as assassins
07:08
you but you could just gobbing someone's
07:09
drink if you're one of these magic
07:11
poisonous people
07:12
yeah that's not as cool a way of cutting
07:13
someone off i just have one thing that i
07:15
want to add
07:16
um and this is generally to people
07:18
listening to the podcast um you should
07:20
check out this poison garden it is
07:21
absolutely amazing the amount of stuff
07:23
they have there every plant genuinely
07:25
could probably kill you if you got too
07:26
close there are certain
07:28
plants that have berries on them that if
07:30
kids ate
07:31
three of them would kill them in a
07:33
matter of hours two's okay
07:35
two is fine twos recommended they'll get
07:38
all trippy and it'll be awesome
07:39
um and and you should check out trevor
07:42
jones who is the gardener there he is
07:43
such
07:44
a fantastic personality and he's always
07:46
there so people should meet him but my
07:47
favorite person is the duchess of
07:49
northumberland and she was
07:51
asked because she has such incredible
07:52
knowledge about poisons
07:54
um she said that she uh her husband
07:57
sometimes is worried about her
07:58
knowledge of poisons and she said but i
08:00
tell him she he shouldn't be concerned
08:02
because these days every single plant
08:04
poison is detectable in the blood
08:07
so like i wouldn't get away with it
08:10
and then she said so i can't possibly
08:12
put in print how i would kill someone
08:14
because she does know
08:15
based on the poisons but my husband
08:16
tells me that he'd hit me over the head
08:18
with a salmon from the freezer
08:20
and then eat the salmon so she okay it
08:23
is time for fact number two and that is
08:25
andy
08:26
my fact is that the man who got
08:27
nominated for an oscar for editing
08:30
no country for old men doesn't exist
08:36
it's not even panto season um so
08:40
yes it's no it's not
08:44
[Applause]
08:46
it's always a good show when the biggest
08:47
laugh is for the audience
08:51
so how is this possible well he's called
08:54
roderick james um he's an elderly
08:56
english gentleman
08:57
and he's edited all the movies of the
08:59
coen brothers and he
09:01
doesn't exist um he's been edited he's
09:03
been nominated for an oscar twice for
09:05
editing fargo and no country for old men
09:08
um but the reason he has never been to
09:10
attend the oscars ceremony is because
09:12
he is made up by the coen brothers yeah
09:15
you keep saying this but why
09:17
well they edit all their own films and
09:20
they just they you know they write and
09:22
direct and produce and all of it
09:23
so um they have just made up this
09:26
fictional man who
09:27
just for fun they think it looks braggy
09:29
to have their name on too many of them i
09:30
read
09:31
i read that it was to get around some
09:32
union issues
09:34
i don't know if that's true but yeah but
09:36
whatever the reason they are really into
09:38
it so
09:39
they were asked is he coming to the
09:40
oscars this year he's been nominated and
09:42
they said oh no he's very old very old
09:44
late 80s early 90s i don't know how he'd
09:46
make the trip and then he didn't win in
09:47
the end he got nominated but did not win
09:49
and
09:50
um ethan cohen was asked how james had
09:53
taken the news and
09:54
he said well we know he's elderly and
09:56
unhappy so probably not well didn't take
09:58
it well
09:58
very sad they're very
10:02
they've like um they've made a
10:04
biographical note for him
10:06
so there's this whole paragraph where
10:07
they say roderick james began his career
10:09
minding the tea cart at shepparton
10:11
studios in the 1930s
10:13
he remains widely admired in the film
10:14
industry for his impeccable grooming
10:16
and is the world's foremost collector of
10:18
margaret thatcher nudes
10:22
many of them drawn from life
10:26
i feel like the coen brothers last film
10:28
is going to be a biopic
10:30
of this guy yes
10:33
i was just looking at sort of people who
10:35
have been nominated for oscars but
10:36
weren't
10:37
there or things like that and um banksy
10:39
was up for one recently a documentary
10:41
one for exit through the gift shop
10:42
filming it a few years ago um and he
10:45
actually asked if he could attend the
10:47
oscars and he asked if he could attend
10:48
the oscars in disguise
10:49
and they said no and so the the
10:52
executive director of the academy
10:54
said um sadly we had to turn him down
10:56
because the fun but disquieting scenario
10:58
is that if the film wins
11:00
and five guys in monkey masks come to
11:02
the stage all saying i'm banksy
11:04
who the hell do we give it to and it's a
11:06
fair point
11:08
um so he was fine with it but banksy
11:09
said i don't agree with the concept of
11:11
award ceremonies at all but i am so
11:13
happy to make an exception if i'm
11:14
nominated for an award
11:17
my favorite um nominee for adapted
11:20
screenplay was a
11:21
person called p h vasic um and ph vasik
11:25
was nominated for
11:26
grace stoke the legend of tarzan lord of
11:29
the apes
11:29
um but this person was in fact not a
11:32
person it was a hungarian sheepdog
11:34
belonging to who it was uh who was meant
11:37
to be nominated robert
11:39
robert towne who was the writer but he
11:42
hated all the changes that happened to
11:43
the script
11:44
so he put his hungarian sheet dog as the
11:46
actual scriptwriter
11:48
and that script writer got nominated so
11:50
a hungarian sheepdog has been nominated
11:53
for another turn up
11:54
uh no and it didn't win so probably um
11:56
also
11:57
he had a sleep a sheet dog called p h
12:00
vazqack
12:01
that's an unusual name for a dog isn't
12:03
it giving it two initials well he's he
12:05
hey if he can write screenplays he's
12:07
probably gonna
12:08
have a very strong literature-based name
12:10
as well i think you've misunderstood
12:12
your own story
12:14
have you heard of the actor uggy no no
12:17
so there was a big campaign a few years
12:18
ago to get ugly
12:19
nominated for um a bafta before his
12:23
performance in the artist and if you
12:25
remember the film the artist it was that
12:26
silent movie and uggy was the
12:28
terrier i do remember the dog was a big
12:31
you know hit in the film and lots of uh
12:34
you know
12:35
if you're a member of bafta you have to
12:37
you know pick who you nominate
12:38
and a lot of the members of bafta wrote
12:40
to the committee to check am i allowed
12:41
to nominate this dog for a bafta
12:43
and bafta made it had to make a public
12:45
statement about it and they had to say
12:46
regretfully we must not we must advise
12:49
that as he is not a human being
12:51
and as his unique motivation as an actor
12:53
was sausages
12:57
is not qualified to compete for the
12:59
batter in this category
13:02
it doesn't matter what their motivation
13:04
is most actors are motivated by money
13:06
which they may well be using to buy
13:07
solely sausages
13:08
so we don't know um
13:11
someone who's got nominated a bunch of
13:13
times but has never
13:15
uh accepted an oscar is a guy called
13:17
george scott he's a he was an
13:19
ex brilliant actor uh in the in the 60s
13:21
in the 70s
13:22
he's an ex brilliant he used to be
13:24
brilliant yeah so he's still going but
13:26
yeah but he's all for now
13:27
yeah really embarrassing um so george c
13:30
scott always said he'd never accept an
13:32
oscar he's very clear about this he
13:34
called the oscars a two-hour meet parade
13:36
a public display with
13:37
he's motivated by sausages obviously
13:41
he basically was like the suspense is
13:43
contrived for economic gain i don't want
13:45
to be pitted against my
13:47
fellow actors uh he kept on getting
13:48
nominated in 1960 and 1962 he got a best
13:51
supporting actor nomination he turned it
13:52
down he was like i don't want to be
13:54
nominated
13:54
they wouldn't give up in 1971 he got a
13:57
best actor nomination i think that was
13:58
for the film patton
14:00
um and he refused the nomination but
14:01
they ignored his refusal and he won the
14:03
oscar
14:04
i think you have to say i really don't
14:06
want this please take it away
14:08
but yeah they gave it to him anyway i
14:10
think goldie horn was giving out the
14:12
oscar and she opened the envelope and
14:14
she just went oh my god
14:17
um i've pretty much only researched dogs
14:19
and oscars
14:20
um there is why dogs
14:25
i like stuff i like dogs so there is a
14:28
thing about um
14:30
the first ever oscars because just i was
14:32
you know off the back of uggy in the
14:34
artist
14:34
um there's there was a very famous dog
14:37
called rin tintin
14:39
yeah yeah so it was like a like this is
14:41
way back this is you know 1920s era
14:43
hollywood
14:44
um and renting tim was i think a german
14:47
shepherd maybe
14:48
very like a proto-lassie basically and
14:51
was hugely popular
14:52
and when the first ever academy awards
14:54
happened uh rented tin received the most
14:57
votes for best
14:57
actor and that's true there's um
15:01
susan orlin is a writer from america
15:03
who's
15:04
done a lot of research into this and
15:05
it's her belief that this this happened
15:08
but um he won the first round and they
15:10
thought we
15:11
we have just set up the biggest film
15:12
awards in the world we cannot give it to
15:15
a dog the first time round
15:16
we would be a laughingstock so they then
15:18
said well
15:19
we're going to have a second round and
15:21
the criterium for entry in the second
15:22
round is
15:23
number of legs
15:26
pretty much you have to be a person yeah
15:28
really really
15:30
it sounds like they weren't taking it
15:31
seriously the voters and i haven't seen
15:33
rin tintin's performance but
15:35
they can't have been taking it very
15:36
seriously if they really thought he was
15:38
a super popular dog right i mean he was
15:40
more famous than a lot of the actors he
15:41
appeared on screen with
15:43
was this do you say this is the first
15:44
oscars yeah because the first oscars was
15:46
quite odd anyway wasn't it
15:47
it was the 1929 one and it was a this
15:49
big there was this big long dinner with
15:51
lots of speeches about
15:52
films and other stuff and then the
15:54
awards ceremony
15:56
lasted five minutes within which 15
15:58
awards were handed out
16:03
one award every 20 seconds just
16:06
sprinting up onto stage and sprinting
16:08
away again
16:09
that's amazing so bizarre there was um
16:11
for best actress there were five people
16:13
nominated except three of them were the
16:15
same person
16:18
janet gainer she was just nominated for
16:20
three separate films she'd been in
16:22
and she did win it yes do you want do
16:25
you know the most i think this is the
16:26
most embarrassing moment in oscar's
16:28
history
16:29
not the la la land thing moonlight thing
16:32
i think
16:32
um although that was very embarrassing
16:34
obviously so this was in 1933
16:36
um this was the best director award
16:39
and uh frank capra who was a really
16:43
famous director a lot of classic golden
16:45
age hollywood
16:46
films he directed uh he was up for it
16:48
and so was another director called frank
16:50
lloyd
16:51
and frank capra heard the presenter say
16:55
come on up and get it frank but he
16:58
hadn't been listening properly
17:00
and he had said it to frank lloyd oh god
17:02
and frank capra was already
17:04
moving up the room to collect it i think
17:07
he got to the stage
17:08
and he then realized his mistake and he
17:11
had to walk
17:11
all the way back in front of everyone he
17:13
later said
17:14
the walk was the longest saddest most
17:17
shattering walk
17:18
of my life i wish i could have crawled
17:22
under the rug
17:23
like a miserable worm
17:29
um okay we need to move on to fact
17:31
number three
17:32
and that is chozinski my fact is that
17:35
houses in ancient turkey had
17:37
no doors or windows you got in by
17:40
climbing a ladder up to the roof and
17:41
dropping through a trapdoor
17:44
i just think this is so cool um this is
17:47
so this is discovered and this amazing
17:49
settlement that
17:50
archaeologists have uncovered in the
17:52
last few years it's a settlement
17:54
called uh chateau hayuk and it was
17:56
settled over 9 000 years ago it's on the
17:58
kanye plain in turkey
18:00
and it's yeah it's amazing and they all
18:02
built their houses back-to-back
18:04
uh sort of clustered like um you know
18:06
terrorist houses which is very weak they
18:08
had lots of room
18:09
and yeah no doors or windows and like
18:11
little ladders that you could drop down
18:13
to climb up to get in
18:14
and then you put the ladder down and you
18:15
drop onto the hearth in the middle
18:17
it's a bit weird because the uh entrance
18:20
which you dropped through was the same
18:22
as the exit for the fire
18:23
so you wanted to make sure they didn't
18:25
have a fire lit when you are coming back
18:27
home
18:28
i read a description of it it's a bit
18:30
like a honeycomb so you have all these
18:32
like little cells that are next to each
18:33
other so there's no paths in between
18:35
them
18:35
yeah they're all you've got like six
18:37
neighbors one on each wall
18:39
and the only way to get out is to go
18:40
through the roof and the streets were
18:41
sort of
18:42
the roots weren't they if you were going
18:43
to someone's house you would just walk
18:45
along the top and you would go down so
18:46
it was a sort of
18:47
as if it were an underground bunker but
18:49
they just built it upwards and that
18:51
became their new street level in fact
18:52
they did everything on the roofs
18:54
so anything you would do as a group so
18:56
any kind of let's say you were doing
18:57
some religious stuff it would all have
18:59
to happen on the roofs because that's
19:00
all the space you had
19:01
apparently there was one little area
19:03
wasn't there where they defecated
19:05
really yeah like uh they had like a
19:07
courtyard where they would
19:09
put all of their feces and their rubbish
19:11
and all that kind of stuff in
19:12
in a big midden that's nice yeah we have
19:14
one of those in the center of newcastle
19:15
don't we somewhere
19:18
but they lasted so they lasted a
19:20
thousand seven hundred years
19:22
yeah a lot when you really think about
19:25
that
19:25
just have a real think about that
19:27
quickly a long time well it's yeah it
19:29
wasn't the same people
19:31
no and then they disappeared
19:34
yeah they probably disappeared we don't
19:37
know why
19:38
in about 5000 bc i think it was yeah the
19:40
civilization just
19:42
don't know what happened to it but they
19:44
do have they've got amazing paintings
19:45
that they've found on the inside of
19:46
their walls and they're always painting
19:48
sort of like leopards and boars and
19:49
bears and also they always do those hand
19:51
paintings
19:52
which i like because you always do them
19:53
at primary school and it's nice that
19:55
sort of cave people did that too and
19:57
they have paintings they have this
19:58
really cool painting of
20:00
people but without heads and then a huge
20:02
what looks like a vulture
20:04
and they think that's because they did
20:06
that thing where when people died they
20:07
would put them out on the roofs
20:09
and no other animals could get to them
20:10
but the vultures would come and be able
20:12
to eat out their organs
20:13
yeah which is oh so then they would take
20:16
the bodies which
20:17
had no longer any meat on them so it's
20:18
just a skeleton and they would bury them
20:20
in their houses
20:21
under their beds yeah so you keep your
20:24
grandma under your bed
20:27
wow i gotta say i think i think
20:30
we're getting it right and they didn't
20:34
in some ways look here's here's one
20:37
thing that they did get right and
20:38
one reason that people think they lasted
20:40
so long is because
20:41
when we look at these cells now where
20:43
they all lived they're all
20:45
almost exactly the same and it's not
20:46
like some of them have got more hand
20:48
paints on or some of them have got more
20:50
decorations and stuff like that and it
20:52
seems that that is because they all
20:53
basically didn't have a way of
20:55
accumulating goods
20:57
everyone was exactly equal and one
20:59
theory as to why the
21:00
um why it died out in the end is because
21:03
when they started farming people could
21:04
start hoarding food and then some people
21:06
got richer than others and then
21:07
eventually
21:08
that's because of the inequality that's
21:10
why the civilization died
21:12
but they were one of the first they're
21:14
almost the most important
21:16
agricultural community early
21:17
agricultural community aren't they when
21:19
people went from being nomadic to being
21:20
agricultural but weirdly
21:22
their houses are nowhere near their
21:24
fields which is quite confusing because
21:25
you would have thought if that's all
21:26
you're doing
21:27
you want your field to be next to your
21:28
house but i think that's because
21:31
the clay to build their houses they
21:33
wouldn't have been able to carry that
21:34
from wherever that was
21:36
uh to next to the fields to build their
21:38
houses so instead they had to carry
21:39
their corn
21:40
back to their houses so the houses are
21:41
built where the building materials are
21:43
it's annoying to have to make that kind
21:44
of
21:45
trade-off it's but it's much lighter to
21:47
carry corn than it is to carry a house
21:50
but but you've only got to carry the
21:51
house once so exactly
21:53
yeah oh it's tricky isn't it and you put
21:55
it on the back of one of those trailers
21:58
[Laughter]
22:03
um have you heard about the people who
22:04
lived in the old dubai gorge in tanzania
22:07
no no yeah fair enough
22:11
um this is supposedly where the oldest
22:14
houses in the world are
22:16
and they're 1.8 million years old
22:20
so that's 1.5 million it's 1.5 million
22:22
years older than humans
22:23
are they're circles of stone which are
22:26
they're not
22:27
lovely houses okay because obviously
22:28
they're 1.8 million years old
22:30
there are circles of stones and they're
22:31
surrounding slight depressions in the
22:34
earth uh in the middle and that's about
22:35
they're about 13 feet across these
22:37
circles
22:38
and some cynics have said these are not
22:41
houses
22:42
um because they're just circles of rocks
22:45
but you think how did the rocks get into
22:46
circles we don't know
22:48
and there's a theory that maybe a
22:50
growing tree pushed the rocks outwards
22:52
into a circle
22:52
then the tree died and it leaves a
22:54
circle of rocks behind that seems
22:56
unlikely
22:57
that's silly yeah but the house thing is
22:59
but we don't know but we don't know but
23:00
it's a theory and
23:01
they had presumably roofs they weren't
23:03
just circles of stone at the time we
23:04
think or were they because if i just put
23:07
strewed a few pebbles around me and then
23:08
said look i've built a house
23:11
i don't think i'm being employed by any
23:13
architectural firms it's tricky because
23:15
there's no definition really of what a
23:17
house is
23:17
right yeah um i've got a fact about uh
23:19
trapdoors
23:21
yes because this was about getting into
23:23
your home trapdoor um
23:25
so uh russo the french writer had a
23:27
trapdoor in his office
23:29
for whenever he had unexpected guests
23:32
was it to drop them through
23:38
[Music]
23:45
i read recently that mark zuckerberg has
23:47
that as well really really yeah yeah
23:48
yeah generally wow i think so
23:51
why didn't russo just lock his door
23:56
it's not as cool it's not as cool as the
23:59
trap door
24:00
um they found a few years back what they
24:02
think is the oldest door
24:05
in europe and they think it's 5 000
24:07
years old and it was found
24:10
when archaeologists in zurich were
24:11
digging i think it was for a car park
24:13
and they suddenly found this door
24:15
um and do you know how they dated it
24:18
um someone had put a letter in there and
24:21
they looked at the puzzle
24:22
oh yeah no they counted the rings it was
24:24
a long shot
24:25
yeah how is that really what's a wooden
24:28
door yeah
24:29
it's pretty cool yeah so they were able
24:30
to count very good
24:32
i thought you sensed what am i doing
24:33
because you'd only know from when it was
24:35
born the tree right
24:36
oh this is 12 years old yeah they could
24:39
have carbon dated it i guess right yes
24:41
it's obviously the answer
24:45
wait they must they did they
24:50
did they count the rings they counted
24:52
the rigs but the rings obviously yeah
24:54
but the cheap
24:54
the tree was chopped so i don't know who
24:57
wrote this [ __ ]
25:00
i tell you what when we do it in the
25:02
office it's embarrassing enough in front
25:04
of a thousand people
25:06
i really have to question what's going
25:08
on in this header mode
25:10
should we uh another door another door
25:12
thing yeah quickly move on
25:14
um some native american tribes
25:18
and uh actually i think some east
25:20
african tribes used to have keyhole
25:22
shaped doors
25:23
and this why do you think that is uh
25:26
massive keys
25:29
they had really huge keys really big
25:32
kind of dresses and so it was the shape
25:35
of them
25:37
oh like a like a ladies loose sign which
25:39
goes out like that like a keyhole uh
25:42
they didn't have houses they just had a
25:43
load of ladies lavatories right
25:45
okay no you're all incorrect okay um
25:47
they counted the rings
25:51
it's the opposite of wearing dresses
25:53
it's it's either
25:54
it's like if they were wearing dresses
25:56
but upside down as in that's keyhole
25:58
shape because
25:58
the top is much wider and it's because
26:01
people usually women will carry big
26:02
bundles on their heads
26:04
and then when they're entering their
26:05
homes the top is wider so they can fit
26:08
those bundles through but you don't want
26:09
to let all the heat out of your house
26:11
and so the bottom is much narrower so
26:13
you can conserve heat very cool
26:15
um we need to move on to our final fact
26:17
um okay it is time for our final fact of
26:19
the show and that
26:20
is james okay my fact this week is
26:24
that the red triangle slug can escape
26:27
from frogs
26:28
by super gluing them to trees ah
26:32
so cool it is really cool so i read the
26:35
story in new sciences quite recently
26:37
there was a guy called john gould from
26:39
the university of newcastle
26:42
in australia
26:48
and he made the discovery when he
26:50
spotted a frog struck to a tree
26:54
and there was a slug next to it
26:55
presumably kind of rubbing his hands
26:57
with glee or something
26:59
and he cut a bit off the tree and he
27:01
looked how old it was
27:03
and then he took it
27:07
unbelievable and then he took the frog
27:11
back to his lap
27:12
and he left it there for a while to see
27:14
if it would get free and it really
27:15
didn't eventually they prised it free
27:18
and they put it in a like a little uh
27:20
container and then it kept getting stuck
27:22
to the sides of the container
27:24
and it turns out that this um slug can
27:27
get this kind of mucus and it normally
27:28
has the nice
27:29
like slippery mucus that it can travel
27:31
on but it can also make this really
27:33
really sticky
27:34
mucus wait so why did they get the frog
27:36
did they then interview the frog or they
27:38
like
27:39
tell us how this happened i was just
27:43
trying to catch a slug
27:45
it got all over my feet but it is it's
27:47
so weird because it's so weird that the
27:49
slug
27:49
because this is an amazing defense
27:50
mechanism once it's super glue the frog
27:52
to the tree as you said it just kind of
27:54
hangs out
27:54
next to it's the thing that it's locked
27:57
up yeah
27:58
that is awesome and it lasts days
28:00
doesn't it yeah
28:02
so they do get off but it is a couple of
28:04
days of what must be horribly
28:06
embarrassing
28:09
yeah well the other frogs must be like
28:11
we're gonna go catch that cool frog
28:12
movie do you want to come
28:13
i'll be there in a minute you didn't get
28:16
stuck did you
28:18
i don't know it feels like that would be
28:19
a thing yeah probably so um this
28:21
um this mucus is really good because
28:24
it's
28:24
a very unusual thing in that it's very
28:28
gluey and very sticky but as it gets
28:30
wetter it gets stickier
28:32
and this is something that doesn't
28:33
really happen usually when things dry
28:34
out they get
28:35
or they adhere more like if you think
28:37
about super glue when it dries out it's
28:39
much more sticky
28:40
so this works better in wet conditions
28:42
and they think we might be able to use
28:43
it
28:44
humans might be able to use it for like
28:46
fixing wounds
28:47
or there's similar ones that they use to
28:50
kind of
28:50
um put in people's hearts if you have a
28:52
lesion in your heart you can hold that
28:54
together because obviously a lot of
28:55
blood around there and it works there so
28:56
this might be really useful for us
28:58
plasters that don't fall off in the sea
29:01
yes that's amazing i'm down with i'll
29:05
fund that research
29:08
that is weird that's why when you get
29:10
slug slime on your hands don't put water
29:11
on it to wash it off because it just
29:13
makes it worse really is that right
29:14
yeah yeah yeah oh yeah because slug
29:16
slime it can
29:18
it can kind of suck up water yeah so it
29:21
just gets bigger
29:22
and more money wait so it drinks it
29:24
drinks the water yeah
29:26
it can do like so if you think like if
29:28
you think about a slug like they like to
29:30
be wet don't they they like to be moist
29:32
but then they're always giving out this
29:34
slug slime all the time so you think
29:36
they would just dry out but what
29:37
actually happens is some of that slug
29:38
slime can
29:40
take in the water because it just gets
29:41
loads and loads of water in it and it
29:43
can actually almost drink through this
29:44
slime
29:45
yeah that's crazy i was reading about
29:47
banana slugs
29:48
um they have a thing where sometimes
29:50
when they have sex
29:51
the slime itself is so sticky that
29:54
the male slugs penis will get stuck in
29:57
there
29:58
and because it's just too sticky so
30:00
their only option is they bite it off
30:03
and just leave it this is where anna's
30:06
german guy at the festival got his ideas
30:08
from
30:10
it's too sticky it's gotta go
30:13
yeah really
30:18
but they do sometimes bite each other's
30:19
penises off anyway i think they're not
30:21
really
30:22
supposed to but um
30:25
it's it's considered rude yeah
30:28
sorry about it i wasn't meant to do that
30:30
but if they so they're all
30:31
hermaphrodites aren't they slugs so
30:33
which is good that means when they have
30:34
sex then both can go away pregnant which
30:36
is nice
30:37
but they will at the end you have to
30:39
scarpa really fast otherwise your
30:41
partner
30:41
might bite off your penis which is a bit
30:43
scary but the best slug mating actually
30:46
is the leopard slug mating
30:47
isn't it because the leopard slug has
30:50
sex
30:51
while upside down hanging from a branch
30:53
and the reason it does this is because
30:55
its penis is so
30:56
big that it needs to use gravity to
30:59
unroll it
31:02
we've all
31:07
my tinder profile was me hanging upside
31:09
down from a tree
31:11
just i think you know what this means
31:15
this is amazing though they they'll
31:17
climb up a tree
31:18
two slugs and they decided they're
31:19
mating and then they produce slime that
31:21
it can solidify really fast so
31:23
it acts like a bungee cord so they drop
31:25
down off a branch
31:27
hanging from their slime and then they
31:29
unfurl these penises which are almost as
31:32
big as
31:32
they are they're really really long and
31:34
they intertwine their own slug bodies
31:36
which looks quite nice like a flat and
31:37
then they intertwine their own slug
31:39
penises
31:40
which is sort of basically like extra
31:41
slugs in the end if you look at it
31:43
it looks quite nice and then they have
31:45
sex
31:47
you've got such a low bar for what
31:49
counts as nice and i like that
31:52
it's very pretty and then when they're
31:53
done they eat their way back up the rope
31:56
wow oh that's the bit you're disgusted
31:58
by
32:00
you've got some weird standards in
32:02
newcastle what i'm thinking of is that
32:04
seeing a mission impossible now where
32:06
he's doing he slowly lowers himself down
32:08
the road
32:09
if he'd got his knob out at the bottom
32:11
of that right
32:16
what are you doing ethan sorry
32:19
i'll eat the rope and come back up
32:26
there's a thing that i like as well just
32:27
on the biting off um
32:29
of penis spirits
32:32
well it's it's about losing body parts
32:35
and there's a thing that um
32:36
some slugs can do there's sea slugs that
32:38
do this certainly slugs and there's tail
32:40
dropper slugs
32:41
and what they do is um if there's
32:43
predator coming towards them
32:44
they basically just rip off a bit of
32:47
their body in the tail dropper it's the
32:49
tail
32:49
and they use it as a decoy bit of bait
32:52
so they'll be like
32:53
go have that and so the predator will
32:55
eat that because it's not moving and
32:57
while they're munching on the bit of
32:58
that body
32:59
the rest of them can get away it's not
33:01
extraordinary
33:02
yeah we i think we mentioned there's a
33:04
scorpion that does that
33:06
oh yeah there is it breaks off its tail
33:09
well the problem
33:10
is it breaks off its anus yes and then
33:12
it can't poo anything and it kind of
33:13
appears
33:14
ever again yeah and the poodle sort of
33:16
builds up in its body because it's
33:17
thrown away its tail
33:19
so it doesn't get eaten but then three
33:20
days later it dies of constipation
33:22
yeah does it really yeah they explode
33:25
yeah they do die i wonder if they regret
33:27
it i guess you've you've then
33:29
it's then like another mission
33:30
impossible film you've got three days
33:32
left to pass on your genes
33:35
it's quite hard to attract female
33:37
scorpions
33:38
because you're getting bigger and bigger
33:40
full of poo yeah
33:41
yeah so that's an exciting pitch i think
33:44
for a film
33:46
ethan hunt has thrown away his own ass
33:52
um so i i've actually been looking at
33:55
glue and gluing things
33:57
um do you because it was about because
33:59
it was about glue
34:00
um so do you remember the guy who um
34:04
who glued himself to gordon brown's
34:05
sleeve
34:08
politics was a lot more fun in those
34:10
days it really was
34:11
there was a guy called dan glass and he
34:14
was uh
34:15
an environmental campaigner he was from
34:17
a campaign group called plain stupid
34:19
and uh he got invited to a reception at
34:21
downing street in 2009 and he thought
34:23
now's my chance
34:24
and he he uh so he thought i'm gonna do
34:27
it i'm gonna glue myself to the prime
34:28
minister
34:29
to make a point about climate change
34:31
fair play um
34:33
and he's he said i was saying to gordon
34:35
brown you can run away from climate
34:37
change but you can't run away from my
34:39
arm
34:39
and and he glued up his hand and he did
34:43
it he managed to grab gordon brown's
34:45
sleeve and super glued himself to the
34:47
prime minister inside downing street
34:49
however the pm managed to outfox him by
34:51
the relatively simple method of taking
34:53
off his jacket
34:58

01:38
how
01:42
[Applause]
01:52
hello
01:54
[Applause]
02:02
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:06
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
02:09
coming to you live this time from dublin
02:22
my name is dan schreiber and i am
02:25
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
02:27
hunter murray and
02:28
james harkin and once again we have
02:30
gathered around the microphones with our
02:32
four favorite facts from the last seven
02:34
days
02:34
and in no particular order here we go
02:37
okay that's
02:37
it that's all about facts
02:40
you've been a great crowd we'll see you
02:42
again next year
02:43
[Applause]
02:49
okay it is time for fact number one
02:52
and that is chozinski
02:55
[Music]
02:58
this week how were they tonight bit cold
03:02
actually
03:04
okay thanks very much pipe down okay
03:08
my fact this week is that if you are
03:09
flying from england
03:11
to dublin the air traffic control
03:13
waypoint that you pass that tells you
03:15
you're going the right way
03:16
is called guinness
03:20
yeah so
03:23
these these things are very cool i
03:24
didn't really know about these but air
03:25
control waypoints are basically like
03:27
landmarks in the sky because when you're
03:29
flying a plane it's not like going for a
03:31
walk where i guess
03:32
you can say like go past the third tree
03:34
and then turn left at the style
03:35
there's just nothing there and so they
03:37
have these things on aeronautical maps
03:39
which
03:40
are five letter codes basically and they
03:43
have to be
03:43
codes that anyone who speaks any
03:45
language can pronounce they're mostly
03:46
nonsense
03:47
but they are created by the local air
03:50
traffic
03:51
workers the local air traffic providers
03:52
and so sometimes they have a little joke
03:54
and so the one on the way to dublin is
03:59
so g-i-n-i-s how you spell it but and
04:02
there's over
04:02
there's a big database of them there's
04:04
over 37 000 of them and there's a lot of
04:06
serious normal ones but there are as you
04:08
say plenty of very jokey ones so
04:10
um in portsmouth new hampshire in
04:12
america when you're uh heading in there
04:15
they have a sort of warner brothers
04:17
tribute to the cartoons so
04:19
your wayfinding points uh are gonna be
04:21
called
04:22
i taught yeah
04:25
and then and you can fill the rest in
04:27
here no
04:29
what yeah i taught and then i tore and
04:32
then what did you do
04:33
is it a puddy
04:37
tat and then lastly i did
04:44
but they're all really badly spelled
04:45
presumably so tat must be with three t's
04:48
on the end or something
04:49
you've got two t's a and then two t's
04:51
you're saying these are meant to be
04:52
pronounceable
04:53
i would look at that and be like where
04:54
are we
04:57
yeah they are very good yeah you're from
04:59
south london aren't you done
05:00
uh and i looked at the one that was
05:02
closest to where you live and it's
05:08
d-o-r-k-i-dorky
05:10
[Laughter]
05:15
and sometimes they have local tributes
05:17
to people who just live nearby
05:19
so uh nissan lewis there's annie and
05:21
then lennox
05:23
and then in boston there's nimoy because
05:25
leonard nimoy was born there
05:26
nice and it's a really nice one where um
05:28
in california there's a place near where
05:30
charles schultz the cartoonist was from
05:31
and that's
05:32
snoopy that's very very good
05:35
with a uh sometimes they change them
05:39
though so in 2010
05:41
um when the apprentice was massive in
05:42
america you had
05:44
donald trump and you're fired
05:47
um you're kidding yeah no you you're fad
05:51
you're fast you're fast so that's
05:52
menacing when you say it like that isn't
05:54
it
05:55
it's how it's about ufi id you're fad
05:57
you fade
05:58
but they also had ivanka as well and it
06:00
got to the point where people started
06:02
pilots were complaining going i don't
06:04
want to fly
06:04
you know past a bunker and so they
06:07
actually changed it they removed it so
06:09
it no longer
06:10
exists those waypoints yeah that's cool
06:12
wow
06:13
well you applaud but now there are a
06:15
hundred pilots lost somewhere over
06:17
america
06:19
uh they do like a bit of wordplay pilots
06:21
so if you are a helicopter pilot before
06:23
you set off you need to check your shits
06:26
and tits
06:28
uh the tits for instance is your
06:29
checklist for your navigation radio
06:31
which is twist identity test and select
06:34
and that's how they teach you how to
06:36
apply a helicopter because my wife's a
06:38
pilot so she did that
06:39
and every time you um get on an airplane
06:42
before it sets off they always do their
06:44
bum fish
06:46
which is brakes undercarriage fuel or
06:49
flaps
06:50
instruments switches and harnesses and
06:53
they know it as bum fishing
06:55
really wow that's very cool
06:58
yeah see they've got a sense of humor
07:00
these guys you don't want them too funny
07:02
though
07:04
i found out a guy who we think is the
07:06
man behind the airline pilot voice
07:08
what well good evening ladies and
07:09
gentlemen we're just experiencing a
07:11
little uh turbulence as we head over the
07:13
north atlantic but don't worry that's
07:15
kind of the same voice each time it's
07:16
not pre-recorded
07:17
it's not pretty i'm not saying it's
07:18
pre-recorded i'm saying there's a kind
07:21
of
07:21
way that pilots speak oh which is
07:24
you don't get well we've got some
07:28
turbulence
07:32
we're going to be through in about five
07:33
minutes
07:35
but surely they're just being calm
07:39
i've read a theory which is that they're
07:41
all being calm because of chuck yeager
07:43
uh who i think we might have mentioned
07:44
before so he was a he was a fighter
07:46
pilot and then a test pilot and then he
07:47
broke the sound barrier
07:49
he had a very calm and gravelly voice
07:51
and everyone thought oh wow chuck jaeger
07:52
is so cool and in control and so people
07:54
started imitating him and so there's a
07:55
theory that
07:56
pilot voices are now like that partly
07:58
because of him obviously it just makes
07:59
sense also to
08:00
sound calm and authoritative yeah i was
08:02
looking into air traffic control
08:03
generally
08:04
and um the guys who do it at heathrow
08:07
particularly the ones who are in the
08:08
tower they
08:09
do 90-minute dedicated towering they
08:12
sort of stare at the screen and they
08:14
they
08:14
make sure all the planes come in and
08:16
then in their break after 90 minutes
08:18
there's a special room that they go to
08:20
where they're told not to read emails
08:22
they're told not to do anything whether
08:23
where their eyes are staring at anything
08:25
because of the intensity of it
08:27
so there's just movies and books for
08:28
them to read it's like a recreation room
08:30
for them to go into
08:31
nice they have their break and then they
08:32
come back for the intensity of flight
08:34
yeah you know you can eavesdrop on them
08:36
now if you want really you can eavesdrop
08:37
on any air traffic control you like
08:39
there is an
08:40
app i think it's called live atc
08:43
and you can basically get that and tap
08:45
into the conversations that air traffic
08:46
control are having and it's if
08:48
your plane isn't taking off yet or it's
08:50
delayed or you know it's not landing yet
08:52
and you can find out what on earth is
08:54
going on
08:55
and i think i don't know if it's
08:56
technically legal um in some
08:59
some countries so you might want to read
09:01
your constitution
09:02
first but um yeah it sounds really cool
09:06
and you can understand all of it because
09:08
i didn't know that air traffic control
09:09
is all done in one language the language
09:12
of english
09:14
except for one country which i don't
09:16
know if people can guess
09:17
what that is north korea no
09:20
fine with english north korea is france
09:22
yeah
09:26
i was reading that um one of the
09:27
problems that air traffic control people
09:29
have is that obviously they're
09:30
monitoring planes that are going by but
09:32
other things register
09:33
on the screen and i was reading a report
09:35
that in ireland
09:36
uh they often have to report ufos
09:39
because they're appearing quite a lot
09:41
these unexplained so
09:42
they don't necessarily think that they
09:44
are alien spacecraft
09:46
um the problem is is that at night
09:49
sometimes the instruments are so
09:51
sensitive to picking up lights and so on
09:53
that they think what they often mistaken
09:55
as a possible
09:56
ufo are um a flock of birds
09:59
uh clouds
10:03
and then even possibly a large truck on
10:06
the ground
10:10
um we're gonna have to move on very
10:12
shortly
10:13
about guinness yeah oh yeah um
10:18
no your audience handy so guinness uh
10:21
was invented
10:22
in wales
10:23
[Music]
10:25
[Applause]
10:27
at what point exactly do you think you
10:29
lost the mandy well
10:33
there's there's a pub uh in the place
10:35
called
10:36
bloody hell flanferfeken i think is what
10:41
it's called it's near bangor and they
10:42
claim that arthur guinness
10:44
uh took the recipe from there on his way
10:46
to
10:47
dublin in the 1750s and they said it
10:49
should be called ginwis
10:52
it sometimes is called that after about
10:54
10 30 11 p.m
10:56
various other names but it obviously has
10:59
a really
11:00
huge worldwide spread guinness which is
11:02
you know people think it's a very irish
11:04
thing but
11:05
it's three biggest markets well its
11:07
biggest market is the uk
11:08
isn't it and then its second biggest
11:10
market is nigeria which
11:12
overtook ireland about 10 years ago now
11:14
i think
11:15
very popular there and also they're
11:16
drinking the strongest stuff in nigeria
11:18
so that's more than 10 years ago but
11:20
they're drinking the
11:22
more original guinness so it was
11:24
originally the welsh stuff yeah
11:30
after you won them back when did you
11:31
think you lost them again
11:35
so when it first came about in the very
11:37
start of the 19th century wasn't it
11:39
afghanistan it was
11:40
stronger so it's 70 it was it's not 17
11:43
it's 7.5 in nigeria and that's because
11:46
it has to be much hoppier to be able to
11:48
be exported abroad and more alcohol to
11:50
preserve it more
11:51
and so that's what they're drinking and
11:52
apparently there was someone who worked
11:54
in the guinness factory one of the
11:55
guinness factories in nigeria
11:56
who was saying you tell nigerians that
11:58
they drink guinness in ireland and
11:59
they're like why do they drink guinness
12:00
there
12:00
it's audrey you guys have some beef with
12:03
a few countries after this
12:06
in 1991 um you know the little widget
12:08
inside a guinness can which
12:10
helps it to fizz up in 1991 that was
12:12
voted by britons as the best invention
12:14
of the previous 40 years
12:20
very good in second place the internet
12:27
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:30
that is
12:31
james okay my fact this week is that
12:34
the first ever bone transplant used a
12:37
dog's bone
12:38
to repair a man's head the patient was
12:41
immediately excommunicated by the church
12:43
for no longer being fully human
12:45
[Music]
12:48
that is incredible someone shouted out
12:50
damn right
12:57
so when was this it was in 1668 and the
13:01
surgeon was called
13:02
yob van meerken and the patient was a
13:04
russian nobleman called
13:06
butterline uh and is that funny
13:10
that's all fine um butter line had been
13:12
hit in the head with a sword
13:14
and he put some dog bone in there and
13:16
then he survived but he was immediately
13:17
excommunicated and then butterline
13:19
demanded that the surgeon took the dog
13:21
bone back
13:22
out but by then his own bone had regrown
13:24
around it so he couldn't get it out
13:26
so he was stuck and he's yeah yeah
13:30
he's still there in purgatory somewhere
13:33
that's a thing that happens doesn't it
13:35
we are i believe when we're born we have
13:37
over or around 300 bones but then as we
13:40
grow up
13:41
it slowly shrinks down to about 206
13:44
and that's because there's a lot in the
13:45
head which fuses over so
13:47
if you're going to put a bone in that
13:49
you want to take back out don't go for
13:50
the skull
13:51
it's just it's it's all about the fusion
13:52
up there
13:54
yeah i'm not sure that's exactly i mean
13:56
i mean that's with babies isn't it with
13:58
cartilage turning into bone
14:00
oh but old butter lynn's head infused
14:02
well they do well because bones
14:04
regenerate
14:04
very very well so if you've ever broken
14:06
a bone very most people have i broke a
14:07
bone last year and they just say
14:09
keep it still for a month and it's fine
14:11
and that's why things like this can work
14:13
and
14:13
it's why in the 18th and 19th centuries
14:16
in fact so
14:17
from when cook got to tahiti uh
14:20
he met tahiti islanders and he realized
14:22
that they fixed skull fractures with
14:24
coconut
14:25
so if you had a skull fracture they'd
14:27
cut out the damaged bit of your skull
14:29
and they just slot a bit of coconut
14:30
shell in there and then your new bone
14:32
grew around that
14:33
yeah it's because it's just the right
14:34
shape yeah they're so good at doing it
14:36
if you were running could you do that
14:38
monty python thing of them
14:39
yes so just another kind of transplant
14:43
you can have i think we've mentioned
14:44
this before a big thing
14:46
is uh fecal transplants where your
14:48
stomach bacteria don't work
14:49
and you have someone else's feces
14:50
implanted into you so we've mentioned
14:52
that before the podcast
14:54
you know it's a big thing these days but
14:56
i read this i did not know this okay a
14:57
few people have had it great good on you
15:00
a few a big problem these days is people
15:02
doing diy
15:03
fecal transplants based on
15:07
youtube tutorials and i looked them up
15:10
and now my youtube is just going to be
15:12
recommending these things to me for
15:13
weeks
15:13
and it's true and because the problem is
15:15
you can you know the microbiome all the
15:17
bacteria in your
15:18
intestines are very very powerful so
15:21
transferring cells can have an
15:22
unintended consequence so normally
15:24
you're screened for any
15:25
autoimmune diseases things like this and
15:27
if you have any you can't be a poo donor
15:29
but if you just do a diy one at home
15:32
you can transfer over you can transfer
15:34
obesity
15:35
but just what you're controlling because
15:37
because your microbial
15:40
[Laughter]
15:51
they'll tell you except no don't and but
15:53
you can you can even hand over um
15:55
like poor sleep but how do you get it in
15:59
does it which
16:00
how do you instead i think it goes up
16:02
not down i think it's a pill
16:04
if you do it properly it's a pill i
16:05
don't know what youtube tells you
16:07
youtube probably just now
16:09
if you go to bumfishing.com you will
16:11
find
16:13
yeah but you know cats can repair their
16:15
own bones
16:16
okay and you know how they do it sorry
16:19
what do you mean so not naturally
16:21
like if you break it uh well that yeah
16:23
basically so if
16:25
cat breaks its bone uh the way it
16:26
repairs it is just it purrs
16:28
and that's what cat purring is they
16:30
think now they're
16:32
healing their fractures so well they
16:34
power a frequency
16:36
which is between 25 and 150 hertz and
16:39
sound if you fire a certain sound
16:43
frequency
16:43
at damaged bones or damaged muscles then
16:45
it repairs them
16:46
and it's exactly the right sound
16:48
frequency and it's sort so the reason
16:49
they're just sitting there purring
16:50
contentedly it's just they're just
16:51
healing and developing their bones and
16:53
muscles
16:54
i think you've got my notes
16:59
that's what they're doing they're very
17:01
clever
17:02
um so there was another dog human
17:05
transplant this was in 1891 it was a
17:07
doctor called phelps
17:09
um there was a young boy who had injured
17:12
his leg
17:12
and a bit of his boner come off and
17:14
they'd had to remove him so they had to
17:15
put a dog bone in there
17:17
but the way that they did it in those
17:18
days is both the donor and the host were
17:20
attached to each other for two weeks
17:23
so that the blood circulation could
17:25
carry on going round so this young boy
17:27
had
17:27
he was playing like a wait a minute one
17:29
two three four a five-legged race with a
17:32
dog
17:34
because he has to have one of his legs
17:35
attached to the dog's leg that's cool
17:37
isn't it did he get to keep the dog
17:38
afterwards
17:39
um because you'd be so bonded by then
17:43
well they've said that they both
17:44
recovered after a brief convalescence
17:47
so they both got better yeah they did a
17:49
lot of experimenting on dogs with
17:50
surgery
17:51
because another kind of surgery that has
17:54
a similar mechanism is skin grafting
17:56
really so if you put a skin graft on
17:57
then it can cause new skin to regenerate
18:00
and the first person to experiment with
18:02
skin grafts uh
18:03
properly was a guy called walter
18:04
charlton who did it actually with robert
18:06
hook who we talked about a few weeks ago
18:08
this is in 1663 and he basically did it
18:11
by he got a dog
18:12
and he sliced the skin off one side of
18:14
the dog and then plugs it onto the other
18:16
side
18:16
to see if it would be able to like still
18:18
stay alive there and grow but the dog
18:20
understandably just chewed the whole
18:22
thing off quite quickly
18:24
so they got it back in the lab and they
18:26
tried to do it again and the dog escaped
18:28
and was never seen again
18:30
wow so that's why they put doors on
18:32
hospitals now
18:36
are we ready to go on to excommunication
18:38
sure okay so
18:39
um there's a big long list online of
18:41
things you can get as communicated for
18:43
uh posing as a nun stealing from a
18:46
christian who's been shipwrecked
18:49
oh no oh
18:52
no taking place in any jousting
18:56
tournament between 12 45 and 12 48. oh
18:59
no
19:00
i did one this afternoon at 12 47. oh
19:04
well the good news is that there is an
19:06
ecclesiastical law which is canon 1324
19:09
which makes a number of exceptions for
19:11
excommunicable offenses
19:13
and if you're under 16 you can't be
19:15
excommunicated and also
19:16
if you lack the use of reason because of
19:22
drunkenness
19:24
old loophole if you're pissed you could
19:27
do what the you want
19:29
that's why ireland has remained such a
19:31
religious country
19:33
the rest of us have drifted
19:39
so there are some offenses where oh you
19:42
you might be excommunicated and there
19:43
are some which bring immediate automatic
19:45
excommunication
19:46
so grassing people up after confession
19:49
just automatic
19:50
um desecrating holy communion fair
19:53
enough for the eucharist um
19:54
this is all over the internet physically
19:56
attacking the pope which
19:58
i would have thought yeah i think fair
20:00
play actually that's probably
20:01
yeah but there is always a way there's a
20:03
way back i
20:04
because i thought it was that you were
20:06
if you were excommunicated you were out
20:07
and that's it you're not you're not even
20:09
a catholic anymore yeah and that's not
20:11
the case no you stay catholic and
20:13
actually
20:13
they do if you go i mean you probably
20:15
know this a lot of you but if you go to
20:17
catholic resources online they say the
20:18
whole point of excommunication
20:20
is to try and encourage you to repent
20:21
and come back to the church
20:23
and so you can be our next communicated
20:26
it's the naughty step
20:27
basically it's the naughty step yeah but
20:29
there is i like the eucharist one where
20:31
the you're not allowed to throw away the
20:32
eucharist because what that basically
20:34
means is that if you're a priest and
20:36
you're going giving the eucharist
20:37
you will be excommunicated if there's
20:39
wine left at the end and you toss it
20:41
away which is why at the end you have to
20:43
drink
20:43
all of the wine left over as the priest
20:46
andy all of the bread and that's why the
20:48
bread they they work really really hard
20:50
to engineer crumb-free
20:51
eucharist bread because if you drop a
20:53
crumb then that's it you're out
20:55
you're automatically gone i love that
20:58
bread so much
20:59
do you yeah i'm annoyed you can't get in
21:01
shops i would totally
21:03
when are you when are you eating this
21:04
stuff at church oh
21:07
every sunday where the are you guys
21:11
wow you are definitely excommunicated
21:15
you just keep going up in a different
21:17
mustache
21:18
[Laughter]
21:22
meanwhile anna's necking another bottle
21:24
of wine
21:26
it's really hard though to get
21:28
excommunicated these days as you were
21:30
saying it's um there was a site that was
21:31
online called
21:32
count me out dot ie and yeah
21:36
and it was a website that was providing
21:38
information to how you can be
21:40
excommunicated if you wanted to go out
21:41
so it sort of gave you the
21:43
the form that you could send in and um
21:45
you would
21:46
so because the idea is that you need it
21:48
on your baptism certificate to say that
21:50
you're officially excommunicated
21:51
but then this was launched in 2009 this
21:54
website
21:54
and in that same year the pope set up
21:56
new canon laws
21:58
about what is uh the way to get uh
22:00
excommunicated
22:02
which they couldn't get past they
22:03
couldn't get their head around it so the
22:05
site had to close
22:06
because they were like we've got no idea
22:08
how to get excommunicated anymore
22:10
it's too complicated so it's not
22:11
difficult i don't think to get
22:12
automatically ex-communicated like you
22:14
said there's two types
22:15
there's the automatic super easy flush
22:17
communion wind down the toilet
22:18
you're out i mean i've said before on
22:20
the podcast that i have been
22:21
excommunicated because i'm a catholic
22:23
and i mentioned jesus is false i've done
22:24
it again yeah you've done it again
22:26
yeah yeah jesus if you mention jesus's
22:28
farskin you get automatically
22:29
excommunicated
22:31
you do but to get specifically
22:32
excommunicated is quite special
22:34
and to get excommunicated by the pope is
22:36
very exciting so
22:38
he does this very rarely and the last
22:40
one was the start of last year and it
22:42
was someone who spilled secrets from
22:44
the confessional yeah that was the first
22:47
for about two or three years i think
22:49
yeah in 2014 uh the mafia in italy got
22:52
excommunicated
22:54
and high time i think 2014.
22:58
so in the but the really cool thing was
23:00
in the 15th century used to be able to
23:02
excommunicate all kinds of stuff
23:03
so um in the 1480s the bishop of alta
23:06
ota in france
23:07
he ruled against some slugs which were
23:10
in his garden
23:11
and he ordered them to leave or be
23:13
cursed and basically slugs were quite
23:15
frequently excommunicated
23:17
in the 15th century because
23:20
it made it easier to uh uh destroy them
23:24
so what what what and then you felt less
23:26
guilty
23:27
like the people who were looking after
23:30
gardens didn't want to
23:31
destroy god's creatures but if they'd
23:33
been excommunicated that must have been
23:36
a hassle for the pope though
23:37
just every slug he needing to approve
23:40
the
23:41
ex-communication i think he could send
23:43
an envoy
23:44
i found a guy who was excommunicated
23:45
called pedro the cruel
23:47
um and he was excommunicated by a guy
23:50
called
23:50
blessed urban the fifth and yeah so he
23:54
was uh excommunicated
23:55
uh for cruelty um
23:58
so i don't know which came first the
24:00
name it's like a chicken egg thing with
24:01
that one
24:03
speaking of urban popes um i don't know
24:05
if this is true
24:06
but it's certainly stated online that
24:08
it's true
24:09
and and that is that pope urban viii
24:13
um ordered that anyone that found guilty
24:15
of taking snuff
24:16
in church should be excommunicated and
24:18
that's because
24:19
it led to sneezing which he thought too
24:22
closely resembled sexual ecstasy
24:26
ah i get that i understand that
24:30
um guys we're gonna have to move on a
24:31
second and we're gonna have to move on
24:33
without ever finding out why james has
24:34
been talking about jesus foreskin but um
24:37
can i just give you one fact about
24:38
catholic confessions
24:40
yeah um so this is the news
24:43
that paddy power is getting really
24:45
wrapped up with the catholic church and
24:47
it's a good thing
24:48
so first of all in fact last year the
24:50
pope came here and apparently paddy
24:52
power erected a massive confessional did
24:54
any of you guys see it
24:55
though it was just opposite of phoenix
24:57
park it was obviously a publicity start
24:58
but they said they'd put these adverts
25:00
out saying we invite everyone to come
25:01
and have their sins absolutely sorry do
25:03
you mean a single enormous booth
25:04
yes yes a drive-through are you joking
25:08
you drive through
25:08
you you do it's outside of public right
25:12
if it was a drive-through is is the
25:14
priest in another car
25:15
next to you i don't know they didn't
25:18
seem to advertise the presence of
25:19
appreciate
25:20
how drive-throughs work
25:24
if you go to mcdonald's you've not got
25:26
ronald mcdonald in a mazda going past
25:28
you throwing burgers at you
25:34
but no this isn't the first time they've
25:35
bonded so in 2010 there's a church in
25:37
suffolk right in a new market which is
25:39
trying to raise 65 000 pounds for
25:41
refurbishment
25:42
they phoned lots of places they phoned
25:44
up paddy power
25:45
one source said because they thought
25:47
ireland is a catholic place
25:48
it's a catholic looking name why don't
25:50
we just phone them up and see if they
25:51
want to donate and paddy power said
25:52
yeah we'd love to donate to your new
25:55
confessional
25:56
and so they did they put 10 000 pounds i
25:59
believe towards a
26:00
new confession box and it's got their
26:02
own little logo
26:04
their little paddy power marker it says
26:06
it's got a plaque on it that says paddy
26:08
power sin sinbin
26:12
in a church like do they offer odds on
26:14
the things that are going to be
26:15
confessed inside
26:16
we've got adultery at eight to one today
26:19
if you fancy a flutter
26:21
amazing we need to move on to our next
26:23
fact okay it is time for fact number
26:25
three
26:26
and that is andy my fact is there is a
26:28
world record
26:29
for pulling a train with model trains
26:33
this is so cool uh
26:36
is it cool it's cool
26:40
we're going to get a real insight into
26:42
andy's childhood in the next time
26:43
i believe it um so this was uh i saw
26:46
this
26:46
guy called tim dunn who tweets a lot
26:48
about trains he is really cool
26:50
he put this up recently and this record
26:52
was broken a few years ago in germany at
26:54
a place called miniature
26:56
wonderland and it's and the video is
26:59
online it's incredible so it's
27:01
they they get 198 mini trains
27:04
and they've all got little engines in
27:06
them and they attach them to one single
27:08
rope which is attached to the front of a
27:09
massive
27:10
well not a massive trailer not a train
27:12
um
27:14
and it just looks massive because of the
27:16
little ones next to it
27:18
yeah it does yeah um and so and it works
27:21
and they they put they managed to pull
27:23
whole thing along and the really cool
27:24
thing is that the model trains
27:25
are exactly the same as the same model
27:28
of train as
27:29
the train nice but they're pulling when
27:31
do they can they get on the rail gauge
27:33
can they get fit on the rail
27:35
uh it was done under controlled
27:36
circumstances some of it was not a
27:38
normal railway yeah
27:39
i think they built them a little
27:40
platform oh did they okay so it's not a
27:43
platform
27:44
oh dear here we go
27:45
[Music]
27:47
but they're not saying it's a viable way
27:48
for trains to get about in future no
27:50
they're not no no
27:51
they were very clear on that
27:53
[Music]
27:55
this miniature wonderland is amazing
27:57
isn't it i think it's the biggest
27:59
uh model railway in the world is it or
28:01
something yeah yeah um it has
28:02
an airport with planes taking off and
28:05
landing it has
28:06
a football stadium where they have
28:08
commentary of a famous football match
28:09
that happened
28:10
um it has because it's germany it has
28:12
mini naturists
28:16
and people doing things in bushes oh
28:19
wow yeah it's a thousand one hundred
28:22
square meters and they started by
28:23
building germany as a replica of germany
28:26
and they've moved on to other countries
28:27
like venice and and they they
28:29
[Laughter]
28:33
[Applause]
28:36
still living in the 14th century aren't
28:38
you though you meant city states
28:41
didn't they are you
28:44
they are moving on to other countries
28:45
though right they've got a whole spread
28:46
of countries like sydney
28:49
so as i think you were trying to say
28:51
they do have a bunch of countries
28:52
already
28:53
there so they expanded into austria and
28:56
america it's kind of it's a weird sort
28:59
of territory
28:59
america is actually a continent not a
29:01
country sorry
29:03
[Applause]
29:07
you're absolutely right i meant the
29:09
united states of america
29:11
um at switzerland scandinavia which
29:14
again not a country but they did love
29:16
them all in together
29:17
but they've planned up to 2028 what
29:19
they're going to do and
29:20
so england's getting on there england
29:22
and scotland are getting on there by
29:23
2021
29:24
ireland and wales have to wait till 2025
29:27
i'm afraid oh
29:28
yeah um one thing it does have is it has
29:31
a mini replica model of the miniature
29:34
wonderland
29:35
with tiny miniature trains going around
29:37
yeah
29:38
wow really they also have because they
29:40
got a guinness world record they also
29:42
have the adjudicator who came to give
29:43
them the world record
29:45
they made a mini version of her to stand
29:47
in front of their buildings
29:49
yeah so the guy who came up with the
29:51
idea was called frederick brown
29:53
and in 2000 he'd been running a
29:55
nightclub for eight years
29:56
and he decided he didn't want to do it
29:58
anymore he said this is not my life
29:59
people are always getting drunk
30:01
they hug you but they do not know you
30:03
and so on
30:06
so he realized he wanted to do something
30:08
else and he didn't know what to do
30:10
and he said at that time it was possible
30:11
to send emails to thousands of aol users
30:14
without it being spam
30:18
around 3 000 people answered my question
30:21
for what kind of attraction they would
30:22
like to see in hamburg
30:24
for men a model railroad was number
30:26
three for women it was the last out of a
30:29
list of 40.
30:33
but i'm a man so we went with the model
30:34
thing um the model
30:37
railway thing model trains someone who
30:39
loves model trains is rod stewart
30:41
oh yes so he he has one he has a model
30:44
railway the size of a tennis court in
30:46
his home
30:47
he has admitted as well that he likes
30:49
model trains so much that when he goes
30:51
on tour
30:52
he books a second hotel room just for
30:54
his model trains
30:56
and they go on the road with him yeah he
30:59
loves it he's
31:00
featured on a model railroad magazine a
31:03
bunch of times he's been a cover
31:05
star and he wrote to them
31:08
saying can i be included in your
31:09
magazine they didn't write to him yeah
31:11
and he's more proud of that than being
31:13
on the front of rolling stone on enemy
31:15
he's he's not the only rock star um neil
31:18
young
31:18
as well massively into model um railways
31:22
and
31:22
he um actually has bought into a big
31:24
brand called lionel trains uh he did
31:26
that in the 90s
31:27
and he's worked on sound technology for
31:29
them yeah so for when they're moving
31:31
this is how intuit he is when he's
31:33
playing with his model
31:35
railways he uses a pseudonym created
31:38
to be the model railway enthusiast he
31:40
calls himself clyde coyle
31:42
and clyde coyle is his alter ego who
31:45
runs coil picks
31:46
uh which is a short film set inside his
31:48
model railway
31:49
system i'm totally into it oh it's so
31:52
exciting
31:55
i don't know if that's the best way to
31:56
recruit new users and that is a problem
31:58
for railway and
31:59
model railway enthusiasts right so the
32:01
average age of your model railway
32:03
enthusiast is going up and up
32:05
and they're worried that the younger
32:06
generation is not as into it
32:08
so there was for instance there was an
32:10
interview the guy called ron may who
32:12
lives in phoenix and
32:13
he said that he's been into railway
32:15
since the 50s uh right and he's like
32:17
really obsessive about it and they
32:19
interviewed his son
32:20
who was 26 years old a guy called tony
32:22
who said i'm so impressed by my dad's
32:24
level of detail the layout
32:26
he recreates train scenes from the 1950s
32:29
right down to what pigeons would have
32:30
been at what train station at what time
32:32
that's no way
32:36
he's done the research he's a keen
32:37
reader of what pigeon magazine
32:39
and um and the rust streaks on the box
32:43
cars
32:43
and so he was saying i really respect my
32:45
dad for this so the journalist said
32:47
and are you the younger mr may attempt
32:48
to take up the hobby and he said to be
32:50
honest not really
32:51
no yeah in the um the national model
32:54
railroad association has
32:56
19 000 members and their average age is
32:59
64.
33:01
and their average sex is male 1
33:03
[Laughter]
33:09
very cruel of you to associate them with
33:10
average sex
33:13
average sex a lot of them may be very
33:15
fiery lovers
33:16
[Laughter]
33:22
look if you scale this up a hundred
33:23
times bigger
33:26
[Laughter]
33:28
um there was a great story in the
33:30
newspaper in february and this is the
33:31
headline
33:32
octogenarian sat on burglar who tried to
33:34
steal his model railway collect
33:36
collection
33:37
this is true he's a guy called john
33:38
heddington he was in his mid 80s he used
33:40
to be
33:40
work on the railways and um there was a
33:42
man who broke into his home and was
33:44
trying to steal his very valuable trains
33:46
and he and his wife sat on the burglar
33:48
together
33:49
until the police arrived really sweet
33:52
i reckon if wow two 80 year old people
33:55
sat on me i would still be able to get
33:57
up
33:57
yeah well you weren't the this burglar
34:01
mr barnes who yeah it was actually just
34:04
a five-year-old child who's been invited
34:05
around to play
34:08
picked up one of the trains sat on him
34:13
we're gonna have to move on very shortly
34:15
just the model trains have been around
34:16
for a while so
34:17
the early 1800s really almost since
34:20
trains but the first model trains were
34:22
carpet the first were carpet railways
34:26
and they were trains that you'd have in
34:27
your house and they were invented in the
34:29
1840s and they were called the
34:30
birmingham dribblers
34:32
which having just gigged in birmingham
34:33
means a different thing today but
34:36
they they were called that because they
34:37
were basically a steam-powered boiler so
34:40
they'd have an alcohol-fueled flame
34:42
and then it was powering it was steam
34:44
power so it had a big tray of water
34:45
above it
34:46
and then it would dribble because
34:48
because it was made of tin so it had
34:49
lots of gaps it just dribbled all over
34:51
your carpet as you ran it
34:52
but it was also a massive fire risk
34:54
because there's an alcohol-fueled
34:56
flame on a very unstable wooden floor
34:59
and all the floors were wooden in those
35:00
days
35:01
so it would frequently just bump into
35:02
the furniture and fall over and set fire
35:03
yeah
35:05
wow we've come a long way um should we
35:07
move on to our final facts
35:08
uh we can do yeah i have another world
35:10
record about trains
35:12
okay quickly just um in 2012 romanian
35:15
wedding salon that got the world's
35:17
longest
35:18
train of a wedding dress okay
35:21
it was uh 1.85 miles long
35:25
what and it stretched across the entire
35:28
city center of bucharest
35:30
and it was modeled by a lady called ima
35:32
dumatrescu
35:33
who went up in a hot air balloon while
35:36
the train
35:37
went down throughout the whole town and
35:39
according to the telegraph
35:41
this was mostly ignored by unimpressed
35:43
bystanders
35:44
[Laughter]
35:47
[Applause]
35:51
okay it is time for a final fact of the
35:54
show and that is my fact
35:55
my fact this week is that in the 19th
35:58
century
35:59
if the owner of an estate died it was
36:02
traditional for the estate's
36:03
beekeeper to inform all of the bees
36:07
of the death and then
36:10
allow them to mourn by covering the
36:12
hives in black
36:13
veils but you wouldn't have to inform
36:16
them one by one would you
36:18
i think you only tell one of them and he
36:20
lets the others know yeah
36:21
yeah this was this was the thing that
36:23
did often happen it was um
36:25
it was called telling the bees and this
36:26
was not just and how did it get that
36:28
name
36:29
um and it wasn't you weren't just
36:32
telling them about death you were
36:34
telling them
36:34
everything if there was you know juicy
36:36
gossip the bee
36:38
the beekeeper would go to the hive and
36:39
be like guess what guess who's
36:41
guess who's dating who and by keeping
36:43
them informed you pleased the bees
36:45
because they wanted to feel part of the
36:46
family and
36:48
so that was that was the purpose of them
36:50
and when when people died
36:51
if they weren't told people would worry
36:53
that they would get sick and die
36:55
so that was a very important thing to do
36:58
to make sure the bees knew
36:59
otherwise and yeah it wasn't just death
37:02
it was
37:03
because they get offended if they're not
37:04
kept up to speed with the idea wasn't it
37:06
so
37:07
if you had a new birth in the family or
37:10
if you got
37:11
married or anything like that then you
37:13
had to inform them straight away
37:14
if a couple got married and they went
37:16
back to their parents house they had to
37:17
introduce themselves formally to the
37:19
bees
37:21
because and sometimes actually if you
37:22
had a wedding and you got married then
37:23
you'd leave them a piece of wedding cake
37:25
as well to make sure that they
37:26
knew that they were welcome and they
37:28
were invited to funerals as well
37:30
i read they were invited to weddings too
37:31
sometimes really yeah yeah
37:34
you don't want to be sat next to one of
37:35
them in a wedding dinner
37:37
the baby on my left and then the swarm
37:39
of bees on my ride
37:41
sometimes they protected them when the
37:42
body was leaving the house as well they
37:44
would turn the hive around
37:46
so they wouldn't see and get out yeah
37:48
people did mad stuff before telly didn't
37:50
they
37:50
that's really what we've learned you had
37:54
to sing to them sometimes there were
37:55
traditional bee songs
37:57
along the same lines you know so bees
37:59
bees awake
38:00
your master is dead another you must
38:02
take
38:04
what a song i don't know it does sound
38:07
like a b-side
38:12
there was i was reading a story actually
38:15
which one of our colleagues matt posted
38:17
a few years ago
38:18
on our forums but it's related to the
38:20
fact that
38:21
at every funeral another thing that you
38:22
did out of respect was you
38:24
turned round the beehives that belong to
38:26
the dead person
38:27
out of respect and then sometimes people
38:30
didn't know how to do that so this is in
38:31
1790 a report where
38:33
a servant didn't really know about the
38:35
fact that you had to turn the beehives
38:36
around when
38:37
their owner died and so instead he
38:39
lifted the beehives up which of course
38:40
released them all
38:42
and they intact the entire funeral
38:43
procession
38:45
the horses and their riders a general
38:47
confusion took place attended with lots
38:49
of hats
38:49
wigs etc many stings and a corpse left
38:52
unattended
38:55
and so the oldest laws ever in ireland
38:59
are the 7th century rehn laws
39:05
and we have a we have a group of 7th
39:07
century irish lawyers in tonight i
39:09
believe
39:11
they were written by a welshman called
39:13
no
39:19
so they have some um b laws in these
39:22
laws um
39:23
so if your bees were found to be
39:25
collecting nectar from flowers on the
39:27
neighbor's land
39:28
they could be accused of trespassing
39:32
and to get around the laws the rule said
39:34
you had three years of freedom with your
39:36
bees so they were allowed to do what
39:37
they wanted for three years
39:39
but on the fourth year if they went to a
39:41
neighbor's area
39:42
and they at his flowers next her then um
39:45
he had to give the bees to the neighbor
39:47
as payment
39:49
yes
39:53
so there was another one if a person was
39:55
stung by a bee
39:56
uh they were entitled to a meal of honey
39:59
from the bee's owner
40:00
uh a meal of honey oh great
40:03
just like a bowl of honey yeah well some
40:06
food some honey yeah
40:07
unless he or she had retaliated by
40:09
killing the bee
40:11
[Laughter]
40:12
they used to think that honey was ready
40:14
made though didn't they until in fact
40:16
1800 people like around round about
40:18
there and the prevailing belief was that
40:20
honey just existed in the atmosphere
40:22
and all the bees were doing was they
40:24
were picking it up and putting it in
40:25
their houses
40:28
like stealing it and so
40:31
it wasn't until then that they sort of
40:33
people realized that it was a chemical
40:34
reaction and the bees actually added
40:36
some stuff to it and then it so they
40:38
just thought these were collecting it
40:39
from flowers and it was naturally
40:40
produced
40:40
and in fact people thought that bees
40:43
were naturally produced
40:44
as well so for a long time people like
40:46
aristotle
40:47
and virgil wrote that bees didn't give
40:50
birth to their young
40:51
they went to nearby flowers and they
40:54
found
40:54
baby bees in them what and they gathered
40:58
them up in their mouths and took them
40:59
back to a hive
41:01
and that's how bees come about there's
41:04
the other belief about how
41:05
you got bees which was called bugonia i
41:08
think
41:08
and that's the it was spontaneous
41:10
generation from
41:11
dead animals so we may have mentioned
41:13
that in the past it was
41:14
the bees came out of the body of a dead
41:16
ox if you had a dead ox
41:17
you left it for a long time you would
41:19
get bees um and that different things
41:21
came out of different animals so drones
41:23
came from horses
41:24
hornets came from mules and wasps came
41:26
out of asses
41:28
um it does sound uncomfortable
41:32
but there were even like virgil gave
41:33
instructions on how to get bees
41:35
so he said you have to take a bullock
41:37
whose second year's horns are just
41:38
curling over its brow
41:40
stop up its nostrils and mouth and beat
41:42
it to death and then
41:45
it's not one of virgil's best lines and
41:47
then you have to shut up and
41:48
shut it up in a room uh with some herbs
41:51
and then after nine days
41:52
uh the bees will appear wow from the
41:54
body yeah because they in
41:55
egypt in about 250 bc they thought the
41:58
same thing
41:59
and when you when a cow died or an ox
42:01
died you buried it but it had its horns
42:03
sticking up above the ground and they
42:05
thought the body would basically turn
42:06
into bees and then they'd come up
42:08
through the horns
42:08
so you must have just been walking
42:10
through egypt and you've got these
42:12
horns poking up through the ground
42:13
everywhere turning into
42:16
treading on lego
42:17
[Laughter]
42:19
do you know that there is undertaker
42:21
bees so roughly
42:22
uh daily about 15 bees will die
42:25
in the area of the hive and uh what
42:28
happens then is they wait
42:30
for a few days when it loses moisture
42:32
and some bees will go out
42:33
and they'll pick up the bee and they'll
42:34
drop them off about 150 meters away
42:37
and it's it's known as the undertaker
42:39
bee they're bringing them okay so it's
42:41
the idea to get it away from the hive so
42:42
that anything coming to eat it doesn't
42:44
find the other
42:45
living bees is that yeah 150 feet i
42:47
should say meters is a pretty long
42:49
journey
42:50
yeah they could still do that they're
42:52
not as advanced as undertaking humans i
42:53
think you'd be annoyed if you called an
42:54
undertaker to take away your granny and
42:56
they just
42:57
picked her up dumped her by the roadside
43:00
150 feet away
43:02
i think the undertaker bees also grab
43:04
the deceased in their jaws
43:06
and drag them that way so
43:09
there's a belief that's really ancient
43:11
about bees that is still practiced
43:13
according to a lot of beekeepers that i
43:15
know and also on the internet so i don't
43:16
know if there are any beekeepers here
43:18
but
43:18
they enter a thing called tanging so
43:20
there's been this belief that's been
43:21
around for over 2000 years that they
43:23
really bees really love the sound of
43:25
metal clashing together with other metal
43:28
and that is how you can calm them down
43:30
so if they're freaking out and swarming
43:31
you can settle them into your hive
43:33
and so you know you've got pictures of
43:34
women in the 16th century who would go
43:36
out and
43:36
bash metal onto a saucepan to try and
43:38
get the bees to settle and if you go
43:40
into beekeeper forums they still say do
43:42
you do tanging do you guys do tanging
43:43
do we know what they think the bees
43:45
think um i think they think that it's
43:47
like
43:48
thunder and so when they hear thunder
43:49
then they look for shelter and so
43:51
they'll immediately go back into the
43:52
hive
43:53
okay flower what really works we're
43:56
gonna have to wrap up
43:57
in a second guys
43:59
[Music]
44:01
do you know bees communicate by
44:02
headbutting each other
44:04
just like people of dublin
44:08
and it is to communicate with their
44:10
rivals um but
44:11
i really like the way this was found out
44:13
so one of the world's leading b
44:15
experts or two of them actually called
44:16
thomas celia and kirk visha
44:18
and they were on an island off the coast
44:20
of
44:21
canada i believe and basically what they
44:23
do is
44:24
one of them goes out and places lots of
44:26
beehives of different
44:27
levels of goodness and then he waits
44:29
outside them and then they release some
44:31
bees and wait for them to find the hives
44:33
and then kirk sits outside one of the
44:35
hives
44:36
with paint on a brush and as soon as he
44:38
sees a bee go in he gets poised
44:40
and when the bee emerges he flicks the
44:42
paint brush at them to put a little
44:44
colored dot on a bee and that marks it
44:46
as a bee that's been
44:47
into this hive and then the bees go back
44:50
to let's call it
44:51
base uh where they started out and so
44:54
the ones with the pink dot you know have
44:55
been to one hive and then the ones with
44:57
a yellow dot i think he puts on others
44:59
have been to another hive
45:00
and then we learn that because bees are
45:02
always trying to advertise to each other
45:04
where they should move what house they
45:05
should move to next they love moving
45:07
house
45:08
and so they come back and they're always
45:10
saying hey you should come and move to
45:12
the house that i've just found for us
45:14
so when the ones with the pink dot come
45:15
back they want everyone to move to
45:17
the pink dot house whereas the ones
45:19
where the yellow dot want them to move
45:20
to the other house
45:21
and they head butted out until they've
45:23
decided and they just
45:24
bash into each other until eventually
45:26
they've been silenced so
45:28
you know you you basically can cuss a
45:29
bee to the extent it says
45:32
final move to your place it was fine
45:35
that's crazy that's it just on color
45:38
um with the hives um i was reading a
45:41
thing it was just reminded me that
45:42
um there was in north france somewhere
45:45
there was a hive that was producing
45:47
blue honey and then green honey and they
45:49
had no idea what was going on
45:51
and um it was just doing it for ages and
45:53
they had to investigate it going have we
45:55
have they evolved in some way what's
45:57
going on why what's producing this um
46:00
and they think they've worked out the
46:01
answer and that is uh 2.5 miles away is
46:04
an m
46:04
m factory
46:06

00:13
hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
this week coming to you live
00:21
from the lowry in salford
00:30
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:33
here with anna chazinski
00:35
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:38
and once again we have gathered round
00:39
the microphones with our four favorite
00:41
facts from the last seven days
00:43
and in no particular order here we go
00:46
starting with fact number one and that's
00:48
my fact this week
00:50
my fact is that in 17th century europe
00:53
people used to sing each other the news
00:58
how they got the news it would it would
00:59
be sung at their face
01:02
[Music]
01:04
that kind of thing yeah so this is the
01:06
thing in the 17th century um illiteracy
01:08
rates were so high
01:10
that if they did publish newspapers no
01:12
one was really buying them because they
01:13
couldn't read them
01:14
so what they ended up doing was they
01:16
were taking classic
01:18
classic ballads of the time but then
01:20
applying just the news of the day to
01:21
them
01:22
and so people would go on the streets
01:24
and they would start singing the news
01:25
and people would memorize the songs that
01:27
they were singing and
01:28
they would pass it on and pass it on and
01:30
that's how the news got around
01:31
and so it was for everything from
01:32
political news to um
01:34
you know sentimental stories religious
01:36
news royal rumors
01:38
medical advice they do like an and
01:40
finally at the end with a dog on a
01:42
surfboard or something
01:45
they did have a uh a pay wall so people
01:48
people plugged uh the balance so there
01:50
were guys
01:50
going around selling the ballads and
01:51
they would uh they would sing them to
01:53
the audience on the street corner to
01:55
drum up interest
01:56
but they would not sing the last verse
01:58
so you didn't know how it ended
01:59
so there was that thing where it goes
02:01
gray on the website but it's an
02:02
execution ballad how often was it
02:04
and he pulled his head out just in time
02:08
well it is it is a bit like the internet
02:10
today isn't it because
02:11
so they had these um these sheets that
02:13
you could buy the sheet music if you
02:14
wanted to
02:16
and then you could share it on the
02:17
streets by singing it
02:19
and then it gave you ideas of morality
02:21
and stuff like that so it's a little bit
02:23
like reading the news on the internet
02:24
and then sharing it and then commenting
02:26
on it yeah yeah
02:27
except it was just a lot more gruesome i
02:29
mean they were kind of disgusting in
02:31
their taste i don't know if you've heard
02:32
any of the news over the last few years
02:35
the fact that i'm not on social media
02:36
makes that an unreliable comment
02:38
um but there was one so there was a
02:40
french song in fact which was set to a
02:43
really fun tune apparently so they were
02:44
like quite upbeat
02:46
and it was about a huguenot whose
02:47
execution got interrupted because the
02:49
people thought that they weren't being
02:50
harsh enough by just chopping his head
02:51
off
02:52
or hanging him sorry they were hanging
02:53
him and so the people dragged him to a
02:56
dung heap and mutilated him
02:58
and this ballad went uh the little
03:00
children all got together yelling and
03:02
singing joyously having a great
03:04
time pulling out his innards to throw
03:06
them in the fire removing his guts and
03:08
organs
03:08
and then a dog swallowed his heart there
03:10
you go there you go
03:14
doesn't even rhyme
03:17
i think it rhymed in french they used to
03:20
as well
03:20
um not just report the news but in the
03:23
execution ballads this moral thing that
03:24
james is talking about they used to then
03:26
do verses
03:27
from the perspective of the person who
03:29
was killed guillotined or hanged
03:31
and that's where the moral would come in
03:33
they would suddenly it was as if the
03:35
news was reading a quote from someone
03:36
but that quote never existed
03:38
so they would be saying oh i lament what
03:41
i did and i wish i had not done it
03:43
and oh what a silly sausage i was and
03:46
and and that was the way of saying that
03:48
everyone
03:49
was upset about the crime they committed
03:52
mortal life i will depart and then a dog
03:54
will swallow my heart
03:56
and then you end yes yeah
04:01
[Applause]
04:05
the nice thing was it was tunes that
04:06
everyone knew so they used green sleeves
04:08
for a load of
04:09
ballads because you know you couldn't
04:11
say you couldn't get people to sing and
04:12
use if you they didn't know the tune
04:14
that's so appropriate because then henry
04:15
viii write that song no no that is a
04:17
myth
04:18
so it's completely just a
04:21
no no there is a there is a rumor that
04:23
he did yeah it was written around the
04:24
same time as him so he wrote it know
04:28
the thing is if we think we have fake
04:30
news now i mean this was out of control
04:32
so
04:32
it was mostly kind of overheard gossip
04:34
and rumors because so people having to
04:36
sort of
04:37
eavesdrop on diplomats and things like
04:39
that and talk to people who talk to
04:40
people who've been at court and
04:42
um so there was even a proclamation in
04:44
1672
04:45
charles ii in fact issued a proclamation
04:48
to restrain the spreading of false news
04:51
which is just very prescient but um
04:53
there was even ballads
04:55
about how they shouldn't write ballads
04:57
that were so full of fake news
04:59
there was a whole ballot that was taking
05:02
the pier saying
05:03
all the ballards we hear these days are
05:04
full of stories stories lies and stories
05:07
a pox on your newsletters they lie both
05:10
and flatters they are but attract to
05:12
weedle men in
05:13
wow there are some there are some
05:15
manchester ones so i've
05:17
read quite a few of them um and they
05:19
include things like
05:20
these are all ballads that were real the
05:22
spinners lamentation
05:24
uh victoria bridge on a saturday night
05:28
and johnny green's trip from oldham to
05:30
see the manchester railway
05:32
[Laughter]
05:34
i found a 17th century song not telling
05:37
the news but just a ballad that survived
05:39
the times
05:40
and the title of it is kentish dick
05:44
or the lusty coachman of westminster
05:49
and it was a story about a guy who moved
05:51
to london and
05:52
he would go around wooing women and he
05:54
would trick them into believing that he
05:56
was going to be there
05:57
for all of their life and he would sleep
05:59
with them and they might get pregnant
06:00
and they thought they had a whole life
06:02
with him and then he would just
06:02
disappear and
06:04
that the whole song was teaching immoral
06:06
and they has a line in it where the town
06:08
seeks to sever from him
06:10
that unruly limb yeah
06:13
and then he was just called kentish
06:14
after that
06:15
[Laughter]
06:19
do you know that under the town police
06:21
clauses act of 1847 it's still an
06:24
offense to publicly sing
06:25
any profane or obscene song or ballad in
06:28
the street
06:29
isn't it yeah so you're not allowed to
06:30
do it oh so andy
06:32
sorry oh no we could have performed
06:34
citizen's arrest on all the people of
06:36
newcastle last night
06:39
and when i was looking that up i found
06:41
this this isn't on topic at all but i
06:42
found out that there is a pub in
06:44
whitehall in london called the silver
06:45
cross pub
06:47
which is technically the nation's only
06:48
legal brothel
06:50
really because it was given the license
06:52
by charles the first which has never
06:54
been revoked
06:55
what doesn't they and they have an
06:57
upstairs room that you can hire
06:59
yeah just another fact
07:04
that's actually the sponsor for this
07:06
week's podcast
07:08
um i was looking at some other ballads
07:10
and what they were written for so
07:11
a lot of them maybe the you know the
07:14
most popular type of drinking songs
07:16
and they used to be plastered up in pubs
07:19
so and this is particularly in britain
07:21
and england especially so in england
07:23
balors were written on single sides
07:25
because they had to be used as wallpaper
07:26
in various pubs whereas on the continent
07:28
they were double-sided because they were
07:29
pamphlets
07:30
but they had these drinking ballads and
07:32
i read one of them
07:33
which was at the end of every verse it
07:35
would say
07:36
ah we've had this one drink now bring us
07:38
another so every verse was you had to
07:40
down your drink and get another one and
07:42
it had 13 verses
07:44
so one song you had to drink
07:47
13 pints whoa yeah there were quite a
07:50
lot of um
07:51
sort of heartbreak ballads as well that
07:53
was another big genre
07:54
so um i am a bachelor isn't it sad was
07:58
the title of one of them
07:59
or each has a lover but me um daddy come
08:03
home i don't think that is actually a
08:05
single one um jack and his nuts
08:08
possibly a relation of kentish dick and
08:12
my
08:12
my favorite is nancy i have lost my wig
08:15
what a great song that's awesome um you
08:18
were saying anna about how they got
08:19
these ballads and they put them on the
08:20
wall
08:21
in the pub they'd often put it on the
08:23
doorpost of the inn
08:24
and they used to call that posting and
08:26
that's how we eventually get the phrase
08:28
posting a message on the internet
08:29
is from the same kid wow
08:33
so you basically you had posting things
08:35
on the posts outside the pub and then
08:37
you went to
08:37
like newspapers were called the post and
08:40
then you would have postal services and
08:41
then you have posting
08:42
internet things wow it's awesome the
08:45
phrase
08:45
dick pic comes from kendish dick it used
08:49
to be
08:49
he would do a wood cut of his
08:55
don't say cut don't say wood
08:58
i mean it's not very wrong
09:01
[Laughter]
09:03
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:06
that is
09:06
andy my fact is that pound for pound a
09:09
33 gram
09:10
finch can bite you 320 times harder than
09:14
a t-rex
09:14
could
09:15
[Laughter]
09:18
yeah but pound for pound actually
09:19
[Laughter]
09:21
so there's not many pounds in a finch is
09:23
there no
09:24
there's a lot in a t-rex that's true so
09:27
this is
09:27
like there's it's
09:31
it's good news in various ways because
09:33
it turns out the finches are small and
09:34
t-rex's are all dead so
09:37
in a way we're fine let's win win yeah
09:39
win-win
09:41
but this is a study that has just been
09:42
done into bite force
09:44
um and it's that is you know we know
09:46
roughly what the t-rex
09:48
uh could chomp so uh if it bit you it
09:51
was the equivalent of 13 grand pianos
09:53
landing on you
09:55
yeah that's a brilliant cartoon yeah
10:01
so they could bite really really hard
10:02
there's no no i'm just disputing that
10:04
but
10:04
there's there's this study has measured
10:06
hundreds of different animals bite
10:08
strength
10:09
and um this tiny finch the galapagos
10:12
finch has a very powerful bite relative
10:14
to its body size
10:15
so um yeah yeah i read that it's um
10:19
the if a finch was scaled up to a
10:21
t-rex's size
10:22
its bike would be 320 times stronger
10:25
than that of a t-rex
10:26
and t-rex had a bite force of 12 800
10:30
pounds
10:31
so the finch would have a bite force of
10:33
four million pounds
10:35
whoa and a rocket has five million
10:37
pounds of thrust
10:39
wow so i don't think this is realistic
10:42
yeah i'm just so concerned now that
10:45
someone involved with jurassic park 29
10:47
or wherever we are is listening and it's
10:48
like i've got the climactic moment to
10:50
the next film
10:52
a giant finch thunders on
10:55
just swallows the t-rex that's what the
10:57
author said that this is reading
10:59
university and they said the king of the
11:00
dinosaurs would be no match for a finch
11:02
in a fight
11:03
if they were the same size
11:06
oh my god the idea of finch size t-rex
11:08
is very cute isn't it yeah
11:10
well you do they do know what baby
11:11
t-rexes look like now
11:13
do they just like small t-rex's yeah
11:15
pretty much right
11:16
no they've they've done um a picture of
11:18
what it might look like and they're
11:19
really cute and fluffy and they had
11:21
normal length arms compared to the
11:23
t-rex's have small arms but they have
11:25
normal and so
11:26
at some stage in their puberty their
11:28
arms just became
11:29
small wow they keep growing but their
11:32
arms have stopped
11:32
yeah yeah yeah
11:36
all their arms become small it's like
11:38
it's it's all relative it's one of them
11:42
so if the finch if it bit me on my
11:44
finger yeah what would that
11:46
feel like your hand would explode
11:49
it would hardly hurt at all not at all
11:51
really and the thing is basically it's
11:53
it's the thing with like um
11:55
ants being able to carry massive things
11:56
isn't it if things are small it's much
11:58
easier for them to do things in
11:59
impressive ways
12:00
[Laughter]
12:07
that's my tinder profile
12:11
you don't understand pound for pound
12:13
this is like having sex
12:14
with a t-rex
12:15
[Laughter]
12:23
good file that under things that aren't
12:25
gonna work
12:28
um but they have they have just looked
12:29
into t-rex adolescence and discovered
12:31
some quite interesting stuff about it
12:33
so they have adolescents kind of like
12:35
humans they
12:36
have found out how old t-rexes would
12:38
grow to is about 28 and adolescents
12:40
happen between 14 and 18
12:42
and that's where they just had their
12:43
massive growth spurt and the way they
12:46
can tell this is because they look at
12:47
the growth rings on them
12:48
so they study growth rings on ribs
12:52
and they have mineral deposits that are
12:53
laid down every year as they grow
12:55
and so then you can count you know at
12:57
what point they grew a lot suddenly
12:59
so like they're like trees that's the
13:02
analogy i was going for yeah
13:05
i i was um looking and there's a um
13:07
there's a museum um
13:08
which is uh the museum of astrius and
13:11
it's in uh spain
13:13
and they have a um a model of a t-rex
13:16
and it's the weirdest thing and this is
13:18
a museum that they invite children to
13:20
and adults and it's a family day out and
13:23
the structure of it is they're showing
13:26
two t-rex's
13:27
uh mid-copulation they're having sex so
13:30
the female t-rex is it's it's a doggy
13:32
style basically position
13:34
of these two giant skeletons and the
13:37
weird thing is
13:37
there's no reason for it because we
13:39
don't even know how they have sex
13:40
there's just no point
13:42
they're just speculating that that's
13:44
what it is but when you go in there
13:45
there's a t-rex taking another t-rex
13:48
from behind it's crazy
13:50
they have started putting feathers on
13:51
them in museums which i appreciate i
13:53
went to a
13:54
natural history museum in tasmania
13:56
recently because you know they
13:56
discovered that
13:57
most dinosaurs had feathers and so
13:59
they've had to go back through all the
14:00
old bloody
14:01
museums and pin feathers to all their
14:03
exhibits
14:04
and they're doing it do you know that um
14:07
t-rex's got mouth ulcers
14:09
no really yeah they did so they looked
14:11
at microbes in coprolites in t-rex poo
14:14
and they found that they had the same
14:15
kind of microbes as birds get
14:18
and it gives them mouth ulcers so we
14:20
think that probably t-rexes have mouths
14:22
amazing so uh finches yeah yeah
14:25
so this is a thing also about uh
14:27
adolescence actually adolescent finches
14:28
so teenage finches they learn how to
14:30
sing uh zebra finches
14:32
they learn how to sing from their
14:33
fathers and they get taught this
14:34
incredibly complicated set of tunes
14:37
but we have recently discovered so most
14:40
animals learn kind of by rote they just
14:41
listen and repeat listen and repeat
14:43
what's really rare in the animal kingdom
14:44
is learning uh via social cues
14:47
so if i was singing my song and and my
14:50
father
14:51
sort of gave a sign of approval or
14:52
disapproval and you know
14:54
that's how they do it but they don't
14:55
learn from their fathers uh they learn
14:57
from their mothers
14:58
and the the way they learn is their
15:01
mothers
15:02
kind of give the signs of finding them
15:04
attractive
15:06
so they they do what's called fluffing
15:08
up
15:09
which is a signal that a female likes a
15:12
male song
15:12
and basically the the young finches sing
15:14
and if they get the song close to their
15:16
father's song
15:17
the mum fluff is fluffs up and it's
15:19
basically she's saying that's just how
15:21
your father wooed me
15:22
that's kind of nice that's like a mum
15:25
sending their son off to the proms
15:26
sorting out his hair before he leaves or
15:28
something but making it look exactly
15:30
like his father's hair
15:32
and saying yeah i find this attractive
15:34
and i want you to look like it it's a
15:35
combination of sweet and creepy
15:36
yeah yeah it's back to the future isn't
15:39
it
15:42
they also when they're tiny the finches
15:44
um they have a very amazing ability for
15:47
feeding at night these are the baby
15:48
finches and they lose this as they get
15:50
older
15:50
they have these little nodules that glow
15:52
in the dark they're these
15:54
blue nodules that suddenly glow so that
15:56
when the mother is looking to feed them
15:58
she can specify which ones are where and
16:00
not lose any food in the process
16:01
how cool is that very small it's amazing
16:03
they're glow in the dark
16:04
and on their singing they have another
16:08
very clever thing they do when they sing
16:10
which is started to happen since global
16:12
warming became a thing
16:14
and this is that zebra finches sing to
16:16
the embryos
16:17
in their eggs so the mothers will sing
16:20
into their eggs
16:21
and their singing will be a warning
16:23
about the temperature outside
16:25
and this tells the embryo inside the egg
16:28
how much or how little to grow
16:30
so if it's getting hot outside which it
16:32
often is now
16:33
then the zebra finch sings a song to us
16:35
embryo's going is pretty warm out here
16:40
there's been an armed robbery in
16:41
tribstone
16:43
i was just gonna say we've had them sing
16:45
in the news and now we're having them
16:46
sing in the weather we just need someone
16:48
singing the spot
16:54
the vampire finch do you know guys these
16:56
guys they
16:57
have very sharp beaks and they peck at
16:59
the skin of boobies
17:00
and they drink
17:04
and they drink the blood out of these
17:06
boobie birds uh
17:07
and it break even breaks into the booby
17:09
eggs and drinks the contents and
17:10
sometimes it does it with humans
17:11
sometimes it will try and
17:13
peck on a human and try and get at the
17:14
blood as well but not the human eggs
17:16
no no that's a very difficult thing to
17:19
do isn't it
17:20
i don't know how it's got there you've
17:23
got bigger things to worry about slow
17:25
process of trust gaining over many
17:26
months
17:27
you start with the boobies
17:33
um this fact is also about biting um
17:36
i've found a couple of things about
17:37
biting this is just a bit of a useful
17:40
thing to know
17:40
um it's and it's something that science
17:43
are looking into at the moment because i
17:44
think it can be applied um
17:46
in the long term to mosquito sprays but
17:49
mosquitoes
17:50
if you if a mosquito is biting you if
17:53
you slap
17:54
your arm or wherever it's biting if you
17:56
slap there
17:57
it sends vibrations up through to the
17:59
mosquito
18:00
and when they leap off they associate
18:02
the smell that you have
18:04
with what just happened there the fear
18:06
that they might be killed
18:07
and the reason that mosquitoes land on
18:08
us is they're attracted to a smell and
18:10
they remember the smell
18:11
so it turns out that if you do that
18:13
you're going to put the mosquito off for
18:15
24 hours
18:16
that same mosquito won't come back and
18:17
land on you it might be a different one
18:19
but
18:19
it will think i might get killed if i go
18:21
back to that
18:22
remembers the smell of your body exactly
18:24
so they think that's a threat i can't go
18:26
back there that might kill me
18:27
so all mosquito products at the moment
18:29
are trying to work out how they can
18:30
get what we managed to do with our
18:32
pheromones and our and our
18:34
body smell into that in order to stop
18:36
but next time you've got mosquitoes
18:37
around just slap yourself a lot and
18:39
you'll be
18:39
all over your body just slap yourself
18:42
silly and yeah
18:43
that kind of implies that the next
18:45
mosquito repellents are just going to be
18:46
lots of little snappers that we have to
18:48
pin
18:49
to our bodies like little mouse traps
18:51
all over us constantly smacking us i'd
18:53
rather be bitten
18:54
oh okay not just personally for everyone
18:57
else it lasts for 24 hours
18:59
that's really good yeah um do you know
19:01
what makes uh
19:02
so humans we have a certain bike
19:04
quotient we have quite a strong bite
19:06
but do you know we probably could bite
19:09
much harder than
19:10
we do but what would you think holds us
19:11
back what do you think determines how
19:12
hard we bite
19:13
how good our muscles are in our jaws so
19:16
i say willpower
19:17
so i think um james is wrong andy's more
19:21
wrong
19:21
uh this is trying to go for this
19:25
i think socially it looks awkward if
19:27
you're biting harder than
19:30
uh we have a winner there we go no this
19:33
is an experiment that was done by a guy
19:34
called dr g e
19:35
black this was actually in 1933 so it
19:38
was a long time ago
19:39
but he invented what he called a natho
19:41
dynamometer
19:43
and this was basically he put some
19:44
rubber pads on this steel instrument he
19:46
designed and he got a thousand people to
19:47
bite down on it
19:49
and he worked out the restrictive factor
19:51
on how hard you can bite
19:52
it's not your jaw strength it's your
19:53
teeth so the people stopped biting when
19:55
they said my teeth really hurt
19:57
and actually if you think about it when
19:59
like your jaw more power
20:00
than your teeth are able to withstand so
20:03
if you just man up
20:04
and deal with the tooth pain willpower
20:06
that's what i said
20:08
yep you're right i meant my response
20:10
you're correct
20:12
okay it is time for fact number three
20:15
and that
20:15
is james okay my fact this week is that
20:18
the most polluted city
20:20
in the world is kanpur it is nicknamed
20:23
the manchester of the east
20:26
[Laughter]
20:28
i've lost them guys unbelievably risky
20:34
um so i mean this is true it's the
20:36
particles in the air
20:37
it's especially particles with a
20:38
diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers
20:41
which basically means soot and it's
20:44
because of the tanning industry and
20:46
there's a local wind called the liu of
20:48
kampur
20:49
which gives them really bad dust storms
20:51
and it's yeah it's really really
20:52
bad but um the reason that they call it
20:54
the manchester of the east is because
20:56
obviously manchester used to have
20:57
extremely bad
20:58
pollution and also it's um it's kind of
21:01
an industrial town
21:02
and manchester is one of the most famous
21:03
industrial towns because it's such a
21:04
great city
21:05
[Laughter]
21:07
[Applause]
21:11
great backtracking you say manchester
21:15
used to have
21:16
quite bad pollution let's face it it
21:18
still does uh so i
21:19
actually thought this would be a thing
21:20
where we went oh and it's such a
21:22
misnomer because
21:23
manchester's fine now and i was on if
21:26
you look at air pollution
21:28
rates i always thought london was the
21:29
worst but actually topping the list
21:32
from last year is port talbot in wales
21:35
because they've got big steel works
21:36
and then second is not in fact
21:39
manchester
21:40
is where we are right now which is
21:42
salford
21:45
joint second and you know what's third
21:47
this is really weird the third most
21:48
polluted place
21:50
in britain nope gibraltar
21:53
what well i'm sure it won't be for long
22:01
that is because half of the world sea
22:03
trade goes through the gibraltar strait
22:05
and so all of those polluting particles
22:08
coming from the sea
22:09
and they have no countryside around
22:10
there it's just that literally that
22:11
little rock
22:12
yeah exactly those poor monkeys
22:16
[Laughter]
22:17
so the term acid rain was coined in
22:19
manchester
22:20
in 1872 and friedrich engels who
22:23
lived here for a little while um he
22:25
described it as
22:27
a place of filth ruin an
22:29
uninhabitableness
22:30
and he described it as hell on earth
22:34
but in fairness at the time it was when
22:35
manchester was really growing and people
22:37
had come over from ireland and the
22:39
the cotton mills had just started and it
22:41
was it was not a great place to live
22:43
unlike now and so in
22:46
although having said that there was a
22:48
pub for every 139 residents of
22:50
manchester
22:52
nice and one in 40 of the city's
22:55
population was arrested for drunkenness
22:57
within a single year
22:59
wow
23:03
that's very good i found a different
23:05
thing that engels
23:06
observed when he was in town uh 1845 he
23:09
was around he was amazed to discover
23:11
that there were flourishing
23:12
piggeries in every back street in the
23:14
city yeah still you haven't been around
23:16
today
23:17
um yeah but it was it was very useful
23:20
and in fact
23:20
that was the case all over the country
23:22
it wasn't just manchester united it's a
23:23
piggery just
23:24
where you're farming pigs it's a pig
23:27
it's whatever tiny space you keep a pig
23:29
in as a piggery
23:30
it depends it's dependent on the
23:31
presence or absence of a pig
23:34
if it's if it hasn't got a pig in it
23:36
it's just a small yard
23:38
are you claiming that if you've got one
23:39
pig you've got a piggery yes
23:41
really it's not a thriving piggery is it
23:45
i would say it's on its last leg
23:49
yeah but it's a very good waste disposal
23:50
unit all rubbish goes
23:52
into the pig and the pig eats everything
23:54
and uh then you eat the pig
23:56
yeah perfect it's it's a slightly slower
23:58
way of eating lots of rubbish
24:04
just on uh city nicknames um this
24:08
uh so this um is about a city nickname
24:11
and manchester used to be called
24:12
cottonopolis and you say it wasn't a
24:14
good place to be but it's always very
24:15
much swings and roundabouts in the 19th
24:17
century it was also extremely wealthy
24:19
and kind of an awesome place to be
24:20
because you could make money but um i
24:22
was reading
24:24
an account of someone who was traveling
24:25
around manchester for the first time in
24:27
the mid-19th century
24:29
and loving it and you know saying you
24:30
know it's so brilliant and people are
24:32
all about the cotton mills and he kept
24:34
on asking to be seen to be shown around
24:36
a cotton mill like given a tourist
24:38
visitor tour and they would never let
24:40
him because they were so paranoid about
24:42
everyone else stealing their technology
24:43
because they had the best cotton
24:44
technology so they weren't allowed in
24:47
in 1871 32 of all the cotton in the
24:50
world
24:51
was made in manchester
24:54
the whole planet i just think that's
24:56
incredible so there were there were
24:57
gangs as well
24:59
because obviously lots of people moving
25:01
from the country to the city
25:02
lots of people in a cramped space you
25:04
get gangs and
25:05
uh are people familiar with the
25:07
scuttlers is that a thing still
25:09
not still okay they are not thriving uh
25:13
this is like the
25:14
piggery um they were they were a gang
25:17
who really plagued the city in the late
25:19
19th century
25:20
and they had a very distinctive look
25:22
they had a fringe which was called a
25:23
donkey fringe
25:24
and they had neca chiefs which told you
25:27
which gang they were in which is quite
25:28
smart so
25:29
you could see the stripes or the spots
25:30
and say oh you're with that gang but
25:32
the way they started the scuttlers it
25:35
started with a historical reenactment
25:36
society that got out of hand
25:38
no this is
25:42
says a historian called andrew davis has
25:44
written a book about this this is what
25:46
it says about the book davis has
25:48
identified the trigger point for
25:49
scuttling as arising from the reception
25:51
of the franco-prussian war by the school
25:53
boys of ancoats
25:54
young boys recreated the battles on the
25:57
streets of anchors using the categories
25:58
of catholic french and protestant
26:00
russian to reflect their own allegiances
26:02
the game very quickly evolved into a
26:05
widespread vote for street battles
26:07
and it just turned into gang warfare wow
26:11
the worst place to go was on dean's gate
26:12
wasn't it that was where they all hung
26:14
out
26:14
okay and the absolute worst place was a
26:16
hovel on the corner of hartman street
26:18
and dean's gate
26:19
which today is a wagga mama's wow
26:25
it's only gone downhill i have a sort of
26:28
a sort of modern manchester fact i
26:31
imagine everyone here will know this so
26:33
apologies to the crowd here but
26:34
people at home and overseas won't know
26:36
this but we all know manchester united
26:38
and man city um as the football teams um
26:40
and in 2011 they were awarded the third
26:43
ever
26:43
annual jelly donut award um for
26:46
it's it's done by the accredited
26:48
language services they award
26:50
the best translation errors um each year
26:53
and when the man city uh stadium was
26:57
the etihad stadium etihad in arabic
27:00
uh means united and no
27:05
[Laughter]
27:06
oh my goodness yeah so man city suddenly
27:09
we're playing
27:10
in the etihad that's such a good fact i
27:14
love it
27:14
you know xi jinping came to manchester
27:16
in 2015 and visited man city
27:18
and he visited the stadium and he was
27:21
given a copy of the rules of football as
27:23
a gift because football big something
27:24
that was invented
27:25
in england and so he was given a copy of
27:28
the rules that were drawn up in 1863
27:30
and in exchange xi jinping gave us a
27:33
copper representation of a figure
27:34
playing kuju
27:36
the football esport invented in china 2
27:38
000 years ago
27:40
wow feels like a bit of islam
27:43
just on on world leaders do you know
27:45
that manchester united was literally
27:47
hours away from being owned by colonel
27:49
gaddafi
27:51
really yeah so not not the whole thing
27:53
but a huge percentage
27:54
29.9 it was um the guy who did
27:58
who brokered the deal to the glazer
27:59
family um who did take over
28:02
he said it was hours away from not going
28:04
to them and going to gaddafi instead
28:06
uh bad luck guys what might have been
28:10
okay it is time for our final fact of
28:13
the show
28:13
and that is chozinski my fact is that
28:16
dogs over 35 centimeters tall
28:18
are banned from beijing there's a high
28:20
restriction
28:22
they all get measured if they're too
28:23
tall they've got to go so
28:25
china has this bizarre history with dog
28:28
laws
28:29
and this one was passed in 2003
28:32
and it was about what breeds of dogs and
28:34
what kind of dogs are allowed in beijing
28:36
in in the center of beijing really and
28:37
then in bits of the rural districts
28:39
if you're taller than 35 centimeters and
28:41
a dog not allowed
28:45
if you are on a list of 41 breeds that
28:48
they listed you're not allowed so
28:49
like setters greyhounds mastiffs holding
28:52
the sheepdogs those
28:53
really cute shaggy things banned collies
29:04
is a chinese dog so that's weird i
29:07
thought chow chows were quite small
29:09
no chow chow they're like the chewbacca
29:11
looking guys
29:14
they used to be warrior dogs um for the
29:16
chinese armies and so they're very
29:17
revered there so that's bizarre that
29:19
they're on that list
29:20
but could you get your dog to for
29:21
example sit so it's shorter than 35
29:23
centimeters tall
29:24
oh yeah you don't change your height
29:26
when you sit down like
29:29
but they could do that wiping bomb
29:30
shuffle that they do and just walk like
29:32
that
29:32
what about you could give it a haircut
29:34
so you could i bet if you shaved a
29:36
sheepdog
29:37
there's tiny under all that the whole
29:40
point is that these breeds
29:41
are banned no matter how tall they are
29:43
no but i reckon you wouldn't recognize a
29:44
sheepdog if it was completely shameful
29:46
[Laughter]
29:48
and there are some breeds that would be
29:49
allowed if they're under 35 but not if
29:51
they're over 35. so you could shave them
29:53
but if you're right on that cusp i don't
29:54
know if they'll give you the benefit of
29:55
the doubt
29:56
there was a crackdown they cracked down
29:57
properly on this in 2014 and there were
29:59
all these owners of
30:00
pets that were suddenly told they were
30:02
outlawed who were
30:03
having a bit of a disaster the
30:04
government said why don't you just give
30:05
your pets away to shelters
30:07
and obviously people didn't do that
30:08
because it's a weird thing to do to your
30:09
dog of 10 years
30:11
but there is a lot of luxury stuff for
30:13
pets so this is weird division between
30:15
the chinese government which is cracking
30:16
down on animals
30:17
and then um there are lots of tiny dogs
30:20
and those are treated very luxuriously
30:22
it's a really popular thing in china
30:24
yeah um so there are play centers just
30:26
for dogs which have got indoor swimming
30:28
pools and ball pits and
30:29
obstacle courses there's pet acupuncture
30:32
that's quite a big thing
30:34
and there's there are dog hotels which
30:35
have dog cinemas in
30:37
yeah and the film the film is especially
30:39
designed for dog's eyesight
30:41
i don't know what that means
30:44
so i think they see stuff more frames
30:46
per second than us about twice as many
30:48
so maybe they have many more frames per
30:50
second in the film so this is why dogs
30:52
don't get very captivated by television
30:56
another reason is that they're very very
30:58
stupid animals
31:00
but it looks to them like a series of
31:01
photographs one after the other so i
31:03
guess this is
31:04
yeah so if you suddenly fast forward a
31:05
movie on your tv are they like
31:07
whoa what is this uh in dorset there is
31:10
a spa hotel for guinea pigs
31:15
what does that entail well for 16 pounds
31:18
you can get a pedicure 16 16.
31:21
that's pretty good well you need to pay
31:23
for the hotel but this is just an extra
31:25
on the side thing oh sorry i thought
31:26
this was a nice b b for a guinea pig
31:29
well they don't eat much bee and they
31:31
don't need a very big b
31:36
so um so for your 16 pounds anyway you
31:38
get a pedicure you get two washes with
31:40
lice
31:41
shampoo anti-life shampoo you get a
31:43
haircut
31:44
a towel dry a massage while watching a
31:47
movie
31:48
and a snooze wow you have to pay for a
31:51
snooze
31:54
that is a ripoff but yeah in china
31:56
people are very
31:57
into their dogs but they've worked out
31:59
recently
32:00
that um the city-dwelling millennials
32:03
are responsible for seventy percent of
32:05
pet spending in china which is actually
32:07
quite weird because millennials uh is
32:08
basically born in the 80s and 90s which
32:10
is pretty young to be spending a lot on
32:12
pets
32:12
but they think it's because they've been
32:14
this is what the economist said
32:16
they've been lured away from their
32:17
families and friends by jobs in the big
32:18
cities meaning they're incredibly lonely
32:20
at this point
32:22
a lot of people single the air is very
32:24
bad outside
32:25
as previously discussed and it's
32:27
extremely easy to stay inside and just
32:29
watch stuff on the internet it's nice to
32:31
have someone with you when you do that
32:32
and by the way there are 200 million
32:35
unmarried people in their 20s and 30s in
32:37
china
32:37
which is if you think about that as a
32:38
proportion of world population it's a
32:40
lot of single people
32:41
200 million in 20s and 30s yeah wow
32:44
single
32:44
yeah it's a lot they're all sitting
32:46
there with their dogs inside this woman
32:48
said
32:48
i live alone and it's nice to have
32:50
little louie waiting all happy to see me
32:52
when i get home and she said this as she
32:54
flicked through photos of cats on her
32:55
iphone
32:57
i just feel like there's a social
32:58
problem that we need to address yeah wow
33:00
just some dog sizes um in japan
33:03
i i was being told earlier by uh ash
33:06
gardner who
33:07
wrote our theme tune um he when he was
33:09
in japan
33:10
there were parks there and i started
33:11
googling this after he said it yo yogi
33:13
park
33:14
um it's in japan and what they have is
33:17
they want to make sure that
33:18
dogs that go to the park have a great
33:19
experience so there is a
33:21
weight and size category for dogs of
33:24
which bit of the park they go to
33:26
so they separate the big dogs from the
33:27
little dogs and the little dogs and the
33:29
medium dogs hang out together and they
33:31
all play and the big dogs have to go to
33:33
another section
33:34
so yeah they're separated so no fights
33:36
break out amongst the dogs
33:38
hmm i think that sounds a bit sort of
33:40
like sizeist
33:41
i think that sounds good segregation you
33:44
pro-segregation no
33:49
just like very big dogs look never mind
33:54
never has anyone back down from an
33:56
argument so quickly
33:58
dogs are much less clever than humans
34:01
like to think
34:03
so there are lots of people who think
34:04
that dogs are very very clever
34:06
and the science doesn't really bear it
34:08
out unfortunately and i can feel the
34:09
room slipping away as i say this
34:12
but so dogs for example can't recognize
34:15
themselves in mirrors
34:16
which some animals can do and on lots of
34:18
measures they're about the same as
34:19
pigeons
34:20
um and they can't fly either
34:24
and they can't even fly useless um but
34:27
the doctor who carried out this work
34:28
britta osthaus she did work about 10
34:30
years ago which showed that dogs were
34:31
cleverer than cats
34:32
and she got a big backlash then from all
34:34
the cast owners saying my cat's as
34:36
clever as any dog and now she's done
34:37
this research
34:38
she's got a backlash of dog owners um
34:41
and
34:41
when she published this study and it was
34:43
printed in the times
34:44
there was lots of backlash in the
34:46
comments section one times reader wrote
34:48
we once had a beagle who could open the
34:49
refrigerator with his paws
34:53
case closed
34:53
[Laughter]
34:56
just on the idea of having small dogs
34:58
there is there is concern to be had when
35:01
you do
35:01
hang out with just small dogs in america
35:03
recently
35:04
there was a warning when there was a big
35:06
storm that hit cleveland with 50 mile an
35:09
hour winds there
35:10
the weather bureau released a statement
35:13
saying can everyone
35:14
please be careful these winds are huge
35:17
and um
35:18
things that can happen are trash cans
35:19
will go missing um
35:21
trees will fall and dogs will go flying
35:24
and yeah they did a small dog warning
35:27
and it's the idea that when the winds
35:29
pick up so high
35:30
they get lobbed off into the air and if
35:32
you're not holding on to them by leash
35:34
they will disappear um and if you are
35:37
holding on to them by at least you've
35:38
got an amazing kite yes
35:46
now they did do this slightly
35:47
tongue-in-cheek but it is based on
35:49
real incidences that have happened in
35:51
america stories that you can read up on
35:53
um for example a 72 year old couple or
35:56
72 year old lady called
35:58
dorothy otley she lost her chihuahuas
36:03
and she lost her chihuahua toto in a
36:08
[Music]
36:10
tornado
36:14
wow yeah i didn't notice that no it was
36:16
a it was a six pound chihuahua called
36:18
tinker bell
36:18
and they started mixing their movies in
36:22
yeah this is cross genre baby they were
36:24
um yeah they were
36:26
uh they were walking around and a 70
36:28
mile an hour wind came and it picked
36:30
tinkerbell up
36:31
and it took her off in the wind and they
36:33
couldn't find her and what they actually
36:34
ended up doing
36:35
is that they hired a pet psychic called
36:37
laurie okay
36:39
right well they had my sympathy for a
36:41
good long time there
36:43
laurie laurie said you um you have to
36:45
stop looking in lowlands
36:47
was laurier pet who was also a psychic
36:49
was
36:50
no no no she was a psychic of pets and
36:52
she was also a third generation
36:54
psychic so she was yeah she was the
36:56
granddaughter of original psychic
36:58
yeah there's a lot of nepotism in
37:00
psychic
37:01
there my father was a fraud my
37:03
grandfather was a girl
37:06
and so she said to them you need to look
37:07
up and so the volunteers started looking
37:10
outside of the swamp and up the hill and
37:11
they found tinkerbell
37:12
and so my point is that you will lose a
37:15
dog in the wind
37:16
right
37:20
okay that is it that is all of our facts
37:23

[Music]
00:14
uh
00:23
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:27
no such thing as a fish
00:29
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:31
live from norwich
00:39
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:42
here with anna chazinski
00:44
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:46
and once again we have gathered around
00:47
the microphones with our four favorite
00:49
facts from the last seven days
00:51
and in no particular order here we go
00:54
starting this week with my fact fact
00:56
number one
00:57
and that is for the last four years
00:59
there has been an annual
01:01
academic conference dedicated to the
01:04
archers
01:06
yep where speakers present lectures on
01:09
big unanswered questions
01:10
such as how is it possible the
01:12
characters can eat so many cakes and
01:14
pies
01:15
but never suffer from diabetes
01:19
do we know the answer to that well i the
01:21
lecturer i haven't actually heard the
01:23
lecture i actually do know the answer to
01:24
that so i looked into this is called the
01:26
ambridge paradox
01:30
and the scientists who presented the
01:32
paper made some guesses as to why this
01:34
might be
01:34
so firstly fitness levels are very high
01:37
because as she says
01:38
birthday cards are always delivered by
01:40
hand
01:43
messages that could be texted or emails
01:45
are always related face-to-face
01:47
and residents quite often walk long
01:49
distances just to ask when a relative
01:51
will be home for tea or if they would
01:52
like a coffee
01:55
did they not also say it's all made up
01:58
that wasn't a feature of this lecture i
02:00
think they said as well
02:01
lemon drizzle is a cake that they eat a
02:03
lot and there's something about what's
02:05
in
02:05
lemon drizzle that means that it knocks
02:07
out the
02:08
i know i know but it's worth saying that
02:12
these are not just
02:13
fans who or comedians or whatever trying
02:15
to make a point about
02:17
you know a comedic lecture these are
02:18
real lecturers this is a genuine thing
02:20
this was set up by three people
02:22
um who love the archers one is from the
02:25
tate modern called cara courage
02:27
um and then there's an oxford university
02:29
person there's a sterling university
02:31
person
02:31
there's an oxford oh the oxford
02:34
university person
02:35
yeah nicola hedlum talking about the
02:37
archers
02:40
has university education gone downhill
02:42
it's just it's
02:43
it's it's brainy people who happen to
02:45
listen to the archers and be academics
02:47
yeah yeah but they have they have
02:49
genuine academics who will present
02:50
an idea or a lecture and this is the
02:52
fourth year that it's going to happen
02:53
it's happening april 5th so this podcast
02:55
will have gone out by then most likely
02:56
and um
02:58
yeah so um i saw some other of the um
03:00
lectures that they had there
03:02
big telephoto lens small tick list bird
03:05
watching
03:05
class and masculinity in ambridge
03:09
i was one of them and my parsnips are
03:12
bigger than your parsnips
03:15
the negative aspects of competing at
03:17
flower and produce shows
03:20
that's really good and they go through
03:21
because it's obviously such a you know
03:23
it's been going
03:24
60 plus years the archers and so there's
03:26
so much to pick on
03:28
should you say what the arches is for
03:29
americans who are listening
03:31
i think we just plow on and don't
03:32
explain it
03:35
see if you can possibly piece it
03:37
together by the way so yeah it's
03:39
an extremely long-running series on
03:41
radio 4. it goes out twice a day should
03:42
we say what radio 4 is
03:46
which is which is a great radio station
03:48
which does radio
03:50
i don't know how to make it it's a long
03:52
running drama
03:53
and it's been going for 60 plus years
03:55
and yeah so they they do pick up on
03:57
so the talks do also include um the
04:00
absence of primary education
04:02
in the archers like why is there no
04:04
primary there's stuff about the um
04:06
the flower rotor at the local church and
04:08
who's doing all the flowers
04:09
who could possibly do this why do so
04:11
many of them not die
04:12
is another one oh yeah it's like the
04:15
antidote to
04:16
all other soaps so yeah it was started
04:18
in 1951 so that's so long ago
04:20
no one has ever been murdered now as
04:23
someone who
04:24
watched eastenders as a kid i find this
04:26
extraordinary
04:27
yeah yeah because it's based on a
04:29
village isn't it in
04:30
um in worcestershire called ink barrow
04:33
yeah okay which is a tiny little village
04:34
where nothing ever happens
04:36
but actually the crime rate in this
04:37
village is much much lower than in
04:40
the arches so for every hundred people
04:43
the amount of crime in the village of
04:45
ink bearer which is real
04:46
is 1.8 crimes right and in ambridge it's
04:49
0.9 crimes
04:51
so it's you're half as likely to have
04:53
crime against you in ambridge as you are
04:55
the fictional place
04:56
yeah that's great whereas eastenders
04:58
[Laughter]
05:00
if you live in walford you're three
05:02
times more likely to be murdered
05:05
there have been sort of uh killing offs
05:08
so
05:09
there was a big controversy uh this is
05:11
way back when on the very night the itv
05:13
launched uh which was the 50s i think
05:16
55 55. grace archer one of the main
05:18
characters is one of the members of the
05:19
archer family
05:20
uh were her character was bumped off and
05:23
it was to
05:24
draw attention away from itv so that
05:26
people wouldn't watch it
05:27
and obviously that worked really well um
05:30
you know it actually wasn't because of
05:32
that because well
05:34
they always denied it and this thing
05:36
came out
05:37
recently so the woman who played grace
05:39
archer is a woman called issan
05:41
churchman and she kept on being asked
05:44
after 1955 why has your character been
05:46
killed off
05:47
and she always said dead girls tell no
05:49
tales
05:50
and then age 90 in 2015 she spilled the
05:54
beans
05:54
and first of all she said ready for had
05:56
no idea was going to be such a big thing
05:58
so everyone thought it was to overshadow
06:00
itv
06:00
and maybe it was maybe they're still
06:02
lying but they said they had no idea
06:03
it's gonna be such a big deal
06:04
the reason they killed her was because
06:06
she'd been asking for equal pay
06:08
and they tried to exile her already
06:11
she'd been exiled to ireland the year
06:13
before
06:15
within the show within the show sorry
06:24
yes for the americans the producers of
06:26
the archers also make the laws
06:28
of england well also what do you mean
06:30
they tried to exile her did she was she
06:32
just
06:32
the actor walking back into the studio
06:35
improvising lives i'm back
06:37
they sent her to ireland in the show and
06:39
the public outcry was so much because
06:40
she was such a popular character that
06:42
they were like we'd better write her
06:43
back in but we've gotta off this one
06:45
um so this used to happen quite a bit so
06:46
there's a guy who uh
06:48
he plays a doctor or until recently i
06:49
think he played a doctor on the archers
06:51
and he was originally rejected he
06:52
applied he auditioned for the role of a
06:54
doctor and he was rejected because they
06:55
said he didn't sound enough like a
06:56
doctor
06:57
to play a doctor i said he said fine so
07:00
he was given a different role on the
07:01
show but he could only do thursday
07:03
afternoons and weekends because he
07:04
worked as a doctor
07:05
so so so anyway
07:08
so there were times when they he needed
07:10
kind of to be in a scene
07:12
but he wasn't available because he was
07:13
busy in a gp surgery
07:15
so the way they got around it was they
07:16
just had his wife ask questions and he
07:18
was supposedly in another room and
07:19
didn't hear them
07:20
and didn't answer that
07:23
wow but they do have characters who
07:25
never speak don't they
07:27
i mean i've never listened to it but
07:28
apparently there were more than 500
07:30
characters who are known to the audience
07:31
who have never spoken a single word in
07:33
the show
07:34
wow so there's a guy called um shane
07:37
who has never said anything but is known
07:39
to the audience as somebody who did the
07:40
cooking at nelson's wine bar in the 80s
07:42
and was famed for his legendary quiche
07:47
there was a person called mandy beesboro
07:50
she had a daughter called india whom
07:52
oliver
07:53
and caroline's foster child carly
07:55
described as having
07:56
an arse the size of a continent and she
08:00
never spoke
08:00
and there's a guy called derrick
08:02
fletcher who's an incomer so he came in
08:04
from somewhere else
08:05
and he never ever speaks but as a joke
08:08
they always describe him as
08:09
excessively talkative
08:13
very good very funny there was a guy
08:15
who's actually got a guinness world
08:16
record for playing a character
08:18
so long so consistently on the archers
08:20
his name was norman painting and he
08:22
played a character called phil archer
08:24
and he'd been doing it the world rec the
08:26
guinness record was
08:27
um for doing the same role without a
08:29
break for more than 50 years
08:30
so he passed away in 2009 um but he
08:34
um clearly really wanted a break um
08:37
because he started penning archer's
08:39
episodes himself
08:40
under a pseudonym which was bruno milner
08:42
and in them he kept writing his own
08:44
character out
08:46
did he keep trying to send himself to
08:48
ireland
08:49
exactly not kill himself just like oh
08:51
he's going off to ireland this week or
08:52
whatever
08:53
wow just to give himself a break from
08:54
the show because it's such a stressful
08:56
job
08:57
well yeah maybe it probably is yeah we
09:00
know someone
09:00
in the arches uh i support we do yes i
09:03
contacted him today so one of the qi
09:05
elves her husband uh played a character
09:08
in the archers i think he's called paul
09:10
and so the character is called paul just
09:13
called paul
09:14
yes um who got was getting off with
09:16
lillian if you guys
09:17
again the character is getting off with
09:18
lillian the character lillian
09:20
yes um and lillian and what he said
09:23
about this was uh
09:24
when we had to do sex scenes um it was
09:27
lillian's this perennial sex bomb he
09:28
says in the archers
09:30
didn't realize they had those um whereas
09:32
the actress is in fact gay and happily
09:34
married where she plays
09:35
this heterosexual sex bomb so uh mike
09:38
our friend said when we had to do sex
09:40
scenes
09:40
we both preferred to actually kiss
09:42
rather than kiss with our hands and try
09:44
to come off and make kissing sounds at
09:46
the same time
09:46
it's much easier if you just kiss so so
09:49
they did the actual
09:50
instead of sound effects they did the
09:52
actual snogging did they actually have
09:53
sex no they didn't do that
09:54
actual sex penetrative sex they're in
09:57
the studio
10:04
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:07
that
10:07
is james okay my fact this week is that
10:10
a company in new york
10:12
has invented coffee cups that grow on
10:16
trees
10:18
um so yes these this is amazing so these
10:20
are reusable cups that are made from
10:22
goods
10:23
which are a plant which is like pumpkins
10:25
or marrows or something like that
10:27
and they're grown inside 3d printed
10:29
molds and so they grow
10:31
on a tree and you can literally pluck
10:33
the cup off the tree and use it as a
10:35
coffee cup immediately
10:36
wow it's absolutely amazing and of
10:38
course the problem is that coffee cups
10:40
are really
10:40
bad to recycle hardly anyone recycles
10:43
them so this could be the future of
10:44
recyclable coffee cups i read that they
10:47
got the idea from this
10:48
from how the japanese have been breeding
10:51
watermelons
10:52
um because it's very hard to pack a
10:54
watermelon in the shape that they are so
10:55
they've been breeding them to be
10:57
rectangular shaped or box shaped so you
10:59
can actually stack them now inside
11:02
cargo ships and so on to get them out
11:03
there so they've managed to do it on
11:05
actual trees outside but the problem is
11:07
obviously you're going to have pests and
11:08
the weather you never know what's going
11:10
to happen so they've done it in a
11:11
laboratory now
11:12
but they think that this genuinely could
11:14
be a future thing and obviously
11:15
they are 100 biodegradable oh great so
11:18
that's the main thing about them
11:19
because the coffee cups that we get
11:21
they're made of paper but they have like
11:22
polyethylene i think on the inside
11:24
which means that basically you can't
11:26
recycle them at all
11:28
yeah well you can but it's almost
11:30
impossible it's crazy here's a bit of a
11:32
bummer of the fact
11:33
um 2.5 billion coffee cups
11:36
are are thrown away each year and 99.75
11:40
of those are not recycled so that's just
11:43
in the uk
11:44
[ __ ] and actually those are 2011 figures
11:49
and it may be more like five billion a
11:50
year
11:51
by now and also most of these cups are
11:54
made from virgin paper pulp which means
11:56
they've never been used for anything
11:57
else they haven't been recycled from
11:58
something else
11:59
so a tree gets cut down you turn it into
12:02
a cup
12:02
you drink half the coffee and throw the
12:04
rest away because it's cold and that's
12:05
the last time it ever gets used
12:07
they last for 30 years i mean dan was
12:09
already bummed out by his fact you've
12:11
now been at 70 times worse
12:14
poor guy but the future is maybe
12:16
biodegradable yeah
12:17
some trees um another thing that's
12:20
obviously quite bad for the environment
12:21
is bottles and
12:22
we chuck a lot of bottles away as well
12:24
and other countries have this great
12:25
system of bottle recycling where
12:27
you get kind of bottle anti-vending
12:29
machines where you put your plastic
12:31
bottles in
12:32
and you get money out and so germany has
12:35
this for instance and it's very clever
12:37
so you take an empty bottle to one of
12:38
these machines
12:39
put it in you get 25 cents and
12:42
so people have started gaming this
12:44
system as you would
12:45
and a man in germany last year was
12:47
sentenced to 10 months in prison
12:49
after he installed a magnetic sensor
12:51
within one of these machines and then
12:53
this kind of wooden tunnel
12:54
that like redirected the bottle so
12:56
usually the bottles are shredded when
12:57
they go in
12:58
so that you can't get hold of them again
13:00
he created a little wooden tunnel that
13:02
redirected the bottle
13:03
so it came straight back out again and
13:06
he got 44
13:08
362 euros by inserting one bottle
13:11
177 451 times
13:16
imagine being right behind him in the
13:18
queue
13:22
he did say the judge actually his court
13:24
case said this was a logistical master
13:26
stroke
13:27
and said you must have done nothing else
13:29
every day other than attend to the
13:30
machine
13:31
and he did reply i had a radio next to
13:34
it because otherwise it was really
13:35
boring
13:40
i've been looking into coffee cups so
13:43
there's one there is
13:44
has been invented a self-stirring mug
13:47
that's cool so it's got a propeller in
13:48
the bottom that goes at 3
13:49
000 revolutions per minute which reveals
13:53
i don't know no no no no no that's what
13:56
it says
13:56
it's a small propeller but nevertheless
13:58
it just it just stirs it
13:59
so you know say goodbye to that sludgy
14:01
hot chocolate
14:02
like 50 a second or something yeah it's
14:05
fast it's fast i'm not saying it's not
14:06
fast say hello it's a coffee spilled
14:09
everywhere
14:10
yeah how can you i don't know i don't
14:12
know how it stays in
14:13
um and there's another one which uh is
14:16
sort of heats up and it's connected to
14:18
an app so it keeps your coffee at the
14:20
same temperature all the time
14:22
but it's quite expensive and it only
14:23
lasts for you have to recharge the
14:25
battery every hour
14:26
right and you need to use an app on your
14:28
phone to set the temperature you want
14:29
your drink to be at
14:30
so there are some teething problems yeah
14:33
you could just use a microwave couldn't
14:34
you i agree
14:35
[Laughter]
14:37
um can we uh talk about gourds
14:41
yes please gourds i'd not heard of
14:44
really
14:44
i've seen i know you know what a pumpkin
14:46
is i know what a pumpkin is
14:47
never heard of the word gourd up until
14:49
researching this and it's one of the
14:50
most fascinating
14:52
things i've ever read about i have to
14:53
say did you want to say anything
14:56
specific
14:56
or just no i just want to marvel in the
14:59
beauty of it no they're incredible
15:01
gourds have been used
15:02
for virtually everything throughout
15:04
history they're one of the first
15:06
domesticated things that we've
15:07
before we domesticated investigated it's
15:10
true it's true we had
15:11
we had pet pumpkins before we had pet
15:14
dogs
15:15
yeah you don't want to come up against a
15:17
wild gord though
15:19
very dangerous you might get god
15:28
very forgiving audience
15:31
that's how old they are that's the very
15:33
first pun ever made
15:35
what's your favorite use i really like
15:38
when you see old victorian
15:39
um people's smoking pipes that's a gourd
15:43
that's the top of a gourd that's been
15:44
attached to the rest of the bit that
15:46
sucks in but
15:47
the bit that big sherlock holmes looking
15:49
bit that is a cool
15:50
sherlock hole this is the sequel to
15:52
sherlock holmes
15:54
and young sherlock holmes
16:00
elementary my dear watson
16:05
home smash
16:09
he's not he's not clever but he is
16:11
strong
16:11
[Laughter]
16:13
you don't want to make him deduce
16:17
yeah so goals are they have uses yeah
16:20
they've got great uses
16:22
oh yeah that's my favorite one in china
16:24
they use them as uh cricket boxes
16:27
sorry do you mean boxes to keep insects
16:30
yeah i don't mean
16:31
cricket boxes that you put over you no
16:34
they use them to keep crickets and it's
16:36
quite a statement if you turn up with a
16:37
massive gourd over your box when you're
16:39
playing cricket isn't it
16:40
it implies a certain swag although that
16:42
is a thing isn't it penis gods
16:43
yeah quite in different places around
16:45
the world all over the world they um
16:47
they use it
16:48
for a lot of like hunter-gatherers who
16:50
don't wear clothes they would always
16:52
cover their genitals with a god
16:54
yeah i think somewhere where they were
16:56
are still worn actually is in papua new
16:58
guinea in new guinea and they're called
17:00
koteka and they're
17:01
made of the calabash which is a type of
17:03
gourd and you can identify different
17:05
tribes by the way they wear their gourd
17:07
so
17:07
sometimes they'll be pointed straight
17:09
outwards sometimes they'll be straight
17:11
up sometimes they'll be at a specific
17:13
angle and the direction of the penis
17:14
like a sundial well it's like a sundial
17:17
yeah
17:18
what what you wouldn't tell what what
17:20
time is it oh let's just see barry's
17:22
penis chord
17:23
oh yeah it's not like the hand of a
17:26
clock
17:27
it just stays in the one place so can
17:30
you
17:30
deduce things about the wearer from the
17:32
way they're wearing it right sherlock
17:34
holmes
17:37
you can introduce whether they're
17:38
working or playing if they're working
17:39
they'll wear smaller ones and then
17:41
really come on i mean going to a party
17:45
or a ceremony or something
17:48
what they do not use is um bigger ones
17:50
to show status or anything like that
17:52
you'll wear
17:52
one similar to your friends so if you're
17:55
part of a group you'll all wear a
17:56
certain type
17:57
so we would all have the same type oh no
18:00
yeah well we're like from the north so i
18:03
would have a slightly different penis
18:04
score to you guys from yourself you also
18:06
would have a whippet attached to them
18:10
and apparently some of the gods are so
18:12
um capacious that travellers
18:14
on long journeys would keep cigarettes
18:16
or money in them
18:17
in their penis well you don't have
18:19
pockets to you if you're naked apart
18:20
from the penis guard
18:22
it's a good place to keep it which we
18:24
didn't say but they would usually be
18:25
naked apart from penis
18:27
uh it is quite hot there it's fine um
18:29
but this was thought to be a problematic
18:31
thing in the 70s
18:32
to the indonesian government who thought
18:34
in 1971 to 72 the indonesian government
18:36
launched operation penis gold
18:38
which was they tried to encourage the
18:41
locals
18:42
in papua new guinea to wear shorts and
18:44
shirts but
18:45
they didn't succeed because people
18:47
didn't know how to wash their clothes
18:48
and they didn't really know how to wear
18:49
them
18:50
so there were people who went
18:51
missionaries who went and reported
18:52
people men wearing shorts as hats and
18:54
women using the dresses as shoulder bags
18:58
so it is bad and like also if you can't
19:01
find a god
19:02
then you kind of improvise um so people
19:05
in the past
19:05
would use coconuts or shells or leather
19:08
or grass or something like that but in
19:10
modern
19:10
years they've been using toothpaste
19:12
containers kodak film cans and even
19:15
sardine tins wow
19:19
well yeah it's not the only
19:25
everyone else was holding that laughing
19:28
those kodak film tins are not very big
19:31
are they
19:33
i don't know what your status is
19:38
well let's see what develops
19:40
[Laughter]
19:43
[Applause]
19:48
in modern times gourds are used on on
19:51
the other head the actual head
19:53
um that's what you call yours isn't it
19:55
the other hand the other hand
19:58
yeah um in nigeria there was a law that
20:00
was passed where all
20:01
motorcyclists had to wear a helmet and
20:04
unfortunately helmets are very expensive
20:06
for a lot of people there so what they
20:08
did was they
20:08
cut a gourd out and you would wear the
20:10
gourd as your helmet
20:12
it was not it was not seen as a legal
20:14
thing but it was
20:15
very effective because they're amazingly
20:17
sturdy they're very wooden
20:19
the gourd
20:22
you're making your own jokes now guys
20:25
well the main reason that they're so
20:26
amazing is because they were used for
20:28
carrying water
20:29
and food and stuff like that and that's
20:30
why we domesticated them
20:32
tens of thousands of years ago like that
20:34
is
20:36
cultivated we didn't domesticate them we
20:39
cultivated you domesticate crops
20:41
wild animals in hawaii they had a game
20:45
called
20:46
killu and what you did is you would cut
20:48
the top off of god and then you would
20:49
spin it
20:50
and you would try and hit your
20:51
opponent's killer a bit like conquers
20:53
almost
20:53
uh but it was taken really seriously
20:57
uh if anyone disturbed the silence that
20:59
was supposed to prevail during the
21:00
course of a game his clothing was set on
21:02
fire
21:04
sorry when do you say his clothing do
21:05
you mean he's a single penis guard
21:06
because that's all he's wearing this is
21:07
in hawaii where they were
21:09
oh i'm sorry okay okay god that is harsh
21:12
yeah
21:13
but it does apply here today audience so
21:15
take note
21:17
um should we move on to our next fact
21:18
okay it is time for fact number three
21:21
and that is andy my fact is that the
21:23
mona lisa effect is where a painting is
21:25
looking directly at you
21:27
however it has just been discovered that
21:29
the mona lisa effect does not apply
21:31
to the mona lisa she's not looking at
21:34
you
21:34
she's looking through you she's saying
21:37
isn't she looking just over your
21:39
shoulder at someone more interested
21:40
[Laughter]
21:42
and that's why she's so enigmatic and
21:43
brilliant yeah uh
21:45
so this is the the effect that's been
21:47
known as that for years and then
21:48
researchers at a german university
21:50
bielefeld
21:51
they actually were studying directional
21:53
gaze and they thought let's do an
21:54
experiment on the mona lisa
21:56
and it they gave people uh images of the
21:58
mona lisa on the screen and rulers
22:00
and they said can you just map where
22:01
she's looking with the ruler and uh
22:03
she's not none of them thought that she
22:05
was looking at that yeah and then if you
22:06
look at it actually she is obviously
22:08
just looking
22:09
giving looking at scants isn't she she's
22:11
giving side eye
22:14
yeah yeah amazing some so the laughing
22:16
cavalier is one of these things
22:18
and actually it's quite easy to to do
22:20
this kind of thing if you do
22:21
any painting where someone's looking out
22:23
directly in front of them
22:24
then that will have the effect of the
22:26
eyes following you around the room
22:27
yeah yeah yeah it is undeniable that the
22:30
mona lisa has
22:31
a smile a flickering enigmatic smile
22:34
though isn't it even though a lot's been
22:36
made of it
22:37
because you know you look at the picture
22:38
again when you're reaching this you're
22:39
like oh yeah that is an elusive smile
22:41
but there has been a study done recently
22:44
which has given quite a convincing
22:45
explanation for how
22:47
that enigmatic smile is achieved and
22:49
it's really interesting
22:50
so it's not about her eyes it's about
22:52
our eyes
22:53
and what it is is that um around her
22:56
mouth it's quite blurry so da vinci
22:58
painted it quite blurry and quite
22:59
shadowy
23:00
and if you look at her eyes then your
23:03
peripheral vision is controlled by the
23:05
rods
23:05
in the edge of your eyes so you've got
23:07
rods and cones the rods are in the edge
23:09
and they're much better at making out
23:10
shadows and therefore
23:12
night vision so when you're looking in
23:13
the mona lisa's eyes the mouth
23:15
looks like it's smiling because you see
23:17
more of a blurry shadow there but as
23:18
soon as you look down to the mouth
23:20
the smile vanishes and you can try it
23:22
you look at the eyes and smiles there
23:23
you stare at the mouth it's gone
23:25
it's very annoying you feel like she's
23:26
flirting with you and then she doesn't
23:27
give a [ __ ]
23:28
but we all know that feeling
23:31
um there are so many theories about what
23:33
causes the mona lisa's looks they're
23:35
crazy
23:36
and they're they're not very flattering
23:38
to her either so there are all these
23:39
interesting features so one theory is
23:41
she's got yellow slightly yellowed skin
23:43
and rather than just that being the age
23:44
of the painting some doctors said oh
23:46
she's got a thyroid problem
23:48
and she's got psychomotor retardation
23:50
and muscle weakness leading to a less
23:52
than fully blossomed smile
23:54
another theory is she had a goiter in
23:55
her neck a sort of swelling
23:57
uh due to a lack of iodine she's got
23:59
heart disease said someone else
24:00
another person said she's smiling
24:02
because she's got enormously high
24:03
cholesterol
24:06
does that make people smile i don't
24:09
think
24:09
so the cholesterol thing i think she has
24:11
slightly fatty
24:12
eyes and they think that maybe that's
24:14
it's not to build up a fatty acid she's
24:16
smiling with her eyes because of high
24:18
cholesterol
24:19
there is a theory that she's got
24:21
syphilis so this is really interesting
24:23
because we know about the woman who was
24:25
in the who was the subject who was the
24:28
model for it uh she was called lisa del
24:30
giacondo
24:31
and um we know a little bit about her
24:33
spending records
24:34
her the actual woman so for example we
24:36
know that
24:37
she bought in august 1514 seven lira of
24:40
medicinal snail water
24:41
from the nuns at saint ursula and so
24:45
snail water was a treatment for sexually
24:47
transmitted diseases
24:49
however also she did buy it ten years
24:51
after
24:52
uh the painting was actually painted so
24:54
it would have had to be an especially um
24:56
yeah but we've all
24:57
had the thing where we feel a bit sick
24:58
we put off going to the doctor so
25:00
because she put it off for 10 15 years
25:03
then she finally went and got her snail
25:04
water
25:05
i didn't realize that she's painted on a
25:08
wooden board
25:09
not on canvas i had no idea oh she did
25:12
not know that
25:13
did you not yeah it's not a canvas that
25:14
is a plank of wood that she was painted
25:17
on yeah
25:17
wow cool yeah i am just on
25:20
the weird stuff that's attributed to her
25:23
there was
25:23
a headline in discover magazine which
25:25
was really the epitome of
25:27
i think there's a word for headlines
25:28
that ask questions and the answer is
25:30
always no
25:31
the better it's laura better better ages
25:33
law yes
25:34
so the discover magazine headline was
25:36
was mona lisa's smile caused by
25:38
belle's palsy or a punch in the face
25:43
the answer is neither but yeah there is
25:47
a theory it might have been bell's palsy
25:48
where the facial nerve has
25:49
undergone a bit of degeneration so it
25:51
looks a bit limp
25:53
um or someone thinks that this is a
25:55
academic study that was done
25:57
that says that a close-up shows a scar
25:59
suggesting the application of blunt
26:00
force
26:01
um and also there are changes in the
26:03
periaral area
26:04
that occur when the anterior teeth are
26:06
lost and a scar on her lower lip that
26:08
suggests that teeth have pierced her
26:09
face
26:10
so what you're looking at is someone
26:11
who's been in a huge fight
26:14
send for big sherlock holmes
26:19
i think we might have said before that
26:21
the mona lisa wasn't all that popular
26:23
uh until it got stolen right and then it
26:25
got stolen and it was a big cause
26:27
celebrity and they it became like really
26:29
famous after that
26:30
when it was stolen from the louvre in
26:32
1911 the number of visitors to the
26:34
gallery actually rose
26:35
and people just went to look at the
26:37
blank space in the wall where it had
26:39
been
26:40
and it was the first time anyone had
26:41
ever had to queue to get into the louvre
26:43
and that year 1911 was a record year for
26:45
the gallery and all because people just
26:47
wanted to see
26:48
where it used to be wow that's not
26:50
amazing so
26:51
steal it again from themselves well they
26:54
it kind of was stolen from by themselves
26:56
from themselves because it was a guy
26:58
who was working for the louvre who stole
27:01
it
27:01
so there had been a threatening letter
27:03
the year before i
27:04
don't know what i said i'm going to
27:05
steal your paintings or something but
27:08
um louvre officials had then hired a
27:10
glazier's firm to put dozens of the
27:12
paintings under glass
27:13
and one of the people working for the
27:15
glazier's firm
27:17
vincent vincenzo perugia an italian man
27:20
he
27:20
was annoyed because the french the
27:22
french always insulted him
27:24
they called him things like macaroni
27:25
eater and
27:27
i know other slamming insults and
27:29
[Laughter]
27:31
and he stole it he walked out with his
27:33
under his coat but he thought that the
27:35
painting had been stolen from italy
27:36
didn't he yes
27:37
um so that's why he thought he wanted to
27:38
bring it back to his own his own
27:40
land right and there is a theory that
27:43
during the two years that he had it
27:44
he made a copy of it and then he gave
27:47
back the copy to the louvre and then
27:48
he's still got the original or someone
27:50
has still has the original yeah aged 180
27:54
there was another theory that and i
27:56
think this has been discounted at this
27:57
point but
27:58
um he was he was asked to steal it by
28:01
someone else who planned to make a lot
28:02
of money off it and they made
28:03
six copies which they shipped around the
28:05
world so
28:06
shipped it at a time when it would have
28:08
been would not have been suspicious
28:10
and he never wanted the actual mona lisa
28:12
what he wanted
28:13
was for it to go missing so that he
28:15
could then sell to private buyers
28:17
these six who would never admit to
28:19
owning it and
28:20
and that's the plot of what the most
28:22
highly rated doctor who episode of all
28:24
time city of death
28:25
there you go so that's facts there right
28:27
there yeah people have been obsessed
28:30
for a long time even though it generated
28:31
a lot of publicity the 1911 thing
28:33
napoleon for instance was enough with
28:35
the painting and
28:36
almost from the moment it was painted
28:38
leonardo da vinci knew it was a big deal
28:40
he spent something ridiculous like 15
28:42
years working on it
28:43
and after his death was massively
28:45
critiqued and then in 1800 napoleon took
28:47
it and hung it on his bedroom wall
28:49
for a few years which i find very weird
28:51
the idea that he was there looking at it
28:53
for a few years i believe that he dated
28:55
a woman an italian woman called theresa
28:58
guadagni who was a descendant of the
29:00
real life mona lisa
29:01
no way imagine someone taking you back
29:05
to their place
29:07
they take you up to their room and your
29:08
great great great great great
29:10
grandmother's one
29:13
he had a type
29:17
we're gonna have to move on very shortly
29:19
just uh some things about um
29:21
other effects that paintings have on
29:23
people oh yeah
29:24
the weird effects paintings have so um
29:28
there was in in 2007 there was a 32 year
29:31
old woman
29:31
called rindy sam who was wearing
29:34
lipstick when she kissed a painting by
29:36
the
29:36
american artist sai twombly um and she
29:39
left this big red smudge and so he's
29:41
very
29:41
famous modern artist she kisses painting
29:44
left this red smudge
29:45
and she went to court and she explained
29:47
when i kissed it i thought the artist
29:48
would have understood i was overcome
29:50
with passion
29:51
and the court disagreed and she was
29:52
sentenced to attend a course on good
29:54
citizenship
29:55
oh wow well also um in america marth
29:58
rothko
29:59
um his paintings are said to be such a
30:02
confrontation of emotion
30:04
and um this is particularly he's the one
30:07
who does the big blocks of
30:08
color yeah the ones you can buy in ikea
30:10
yeah oh yeah
30:11
i can't go in ikea anymore i get too
30:14
overcome by emotion whenever i go in
30:16
he has there's in texas the rothko
30:19
chapel which has a lot of his paintings
30:21
and outside of the security guards that
30:23
they have there they also have on
30:24
standby
30:25
counselors who can comfort you if the
30:27
emotions become way too much
30:29
and you need to talk about it wow that
30:31
is an easy job
30:34
so this is the guy who just paints big
30:36
rectangles yeah
30:37
and andy will be appearing on bbc four
30:39
in his new series
30:41
modern art with andrew hunter murray
30:44
just a [ __ ] block
30:51
[Applause]
30:55
all right we need to move on to our
30:56
final fact of the show and that is
30:58
chozinski
30:59
yes my fight this week is that in
31:02
ancient rome there was a job which was
31:04
to deal with infected earlobes
31:07
and this was uh specifically because
31:10
people were really into earrings in
31:12
ancient rome
31:12
and they had big heavy earrings that
31:15
sort of
31:16
you know well actually any of us who
31:17
follow is pissed they get infected at
31:18
some point
31:19
um and so there was a job it was always
31:21
a woman who did it
31:22
they were called the auricular ornatrix
31:26
and she would deal with the infected
31:28
lobes
31:29
or she would also so either she would
31:31
work in a
31:32
salon so there are a few sources which
31:34
describe them working in the
31:35
hairdressers and the man would do the
31:37
barbering the manly barbering
31:39
and the auricular natrix would do the
31:41
earlobing or they would be employed as
31:43
slaves in a household where their
31:45
specific and
31:45
only job was to look after their
31:47
mistresses ears and
31:49
it you know take care of their earrings
31:51
put earrings into their ears when they
31:52
needed to be put in
31:53
take them out when they needed now
31:54
that's an easy job isn't it
31:56
that's pretty easy very much the mark
31:58
rothko texas chapel psychiatrist
32:01
attendant of its day yeah barbers were
32:03
weird as well actually barbers in
32:05
ancient rome
32:06
had various other jobs so first of all
32:08
being a barber was quite different to
32:10
today
32:10
so treatments for hair involved applying
32:13
things like decomposed leeches
32:15
not just leeches rotting leeches uh
32:17
urine and pigeon droppings to your head
32:18
so if you want to get a haircut that's
32:20
what you got
32:21
and they also perform teeth extraction
32:24
yeah ah it's not like there's the old
32:27
thing about i don't know if this is true
32:28
but the old thing about the
32:29
pole for a barbers being white and red
32:32
is because they did a lot of surgery as
32:33
well
32:35
but that was the actually the new and
32:37
improved sign for barbers because before
32:39
that the sign was a bowl of blood
32:41
and at some point i think authorities
32:44
got involved and they said
32:45
maybe the bowls of blood are going a bit
32:46
off could you replace the bowls of blood
32:49
and actually about the um the decomposed
32:51
leeches
32:52
according to pliny the best way to get
32:54
um black hair coloring
32:56
is to apply leeches that have been
32:58
rotten in red wine for 40 days
33:01
and with the juice of that apply it to
33:03
the hair so you have to put it in the
33:05
red wine for 30 days presumably drink
33:07
the wine afterwards because waste not
33:08
wobble
33:09
and then you put the little bit on your
33:11
head any product today
33:12
sir um just another
33:16
quite weird job that they used to be in
33:18
ancient rome um there was the urine
33:20
tax collector wow okay collected tax in
33:24
urine or taxi every time you weed yeah
33:26
both are equally ridiculous exactly
33:28
no it was um this was for the the
33:30
bathing houses if the toilets were there
33:32
they would overflow with um urine they
33:34
would have to be taken away but the
33:35
urine
33:36
was very necessary for a lot of chemical
33:38
products at the time
33:40
as you were mentioning with the leeches
33:41
might be used there so many things
33:43
mouthwash in ancient europe ancient
33:45
urine
33:48
that was another time ancient urine in
33:51
ancient rome
33:52
mouthwash was was urine um you would
33:54
you'd go
33:55
with some urine and that would in theory
33:57
clean your teeth would you
33:59
well i wouldn't but in if i was in an
34:02
ancient rome yeah
34:04
where's the whites that they from the
34:06
people who were purchasing the urine
34:07
that was taken from this collective
34:09
urine for your for your mouthwash i can
34:12
make mouthwash
34:15
i imagine i have read that about
34:17
mouthwash but i reckon
34:18
mostly for dying bleaching things yes so
34:21
bleaching hair you could bleach that
34:23
with urine
34:24
um you could tan leather with urine lots
34:26
of things she was used to wash clothes
34:28
maybe
34:28
yes they did the job of being a fuller
34:30
where you had to stand in a big tub full
34:31
of dirty clothes and urine and stamp
34:34
and just stamp on them fun yeah that
34:36
makes more sense because i do think that
34:38
if you are using mouthwash
34:40
more than you're urinating then you've
34:42
got a problem at one end or the other
34:48
um okay some more jobs should we do some
34:51
more jobs
34:51
yeah sure yeah um there was a job in the
34:54
ancient rome called the fistulator
34:59
i can't do it now darling i'm sorry but
35:01
i will do it later
35:04
it's like an iou a fistulator was
35:08
someone who played a flute and
35:11
there was a very particular guy called
35:13
gaius gracchus
35:15
or grachus and he was an orator but he
35:18
always wanted his aeration his speeches
35:21
to be at a certain pitch
35:22
and according to cicero um he had this
35:24
guy who was a flotist who was a
35:26
who's playing the flute and he would
35:28
play the pitch so that whenever he
35:30
he spoke he was always he was never too
35:32
high and never too low
35:33
wow yeah i read that that guy um
35:37
specifically that guy would uh would
35:38
blow a note if he was over exerting
35:40
himself too much
35:42
or calling you know you speaking with
35:43
real strained efforts who might damage
35:45
his voice so yeah just to kind of
35:47
turn it down yeah
35:51
i mean i say it's a job cicero said it
35:53
happened to one guy
35:56
sounds legit a lot of the information we
35:57
have on the weird jobs in ancient rome
36:00
seem to come from this guy
36:01
called jan gruta who doesn't seem to be
36:04
referenced
36:04
at all anymore but um he was this late
36:07
16th century flemish scholar he was a
36:09
son of a guy called
36:10
wuter gruta
36:14
he published he published
36:17
all these volumes of inscriptions which
36:20
i just think is
36:21
good to note there were guys who went
36:22
around looking at all the bits of
36:24
latin on bits of stone all over the
36:26
empire and piecing them together and
36:28
working out what jobs existed
36:29
but for instance i think it was him who
36:32
wrote about
36:33
in the columbarium of freedmen of libya
36:35
so this is a place where all the slaves
36:38
of libya
36:39
were buried so olivia was the evil woman
36:41
from i claudius if you've read that
36:43
um and there were there were 600 slaves
36:46
that she had
36:46
all buried there and she had slaves for
36:49
instance that were labeled as keeper of
36:50
the armchair
36:52
um specifically keeper of the family
36:54
portraits was one whole job
36:56
and the cura catelli which is caretaker
36:58
of the lap dog
37:01
full job yeah there was also um
37:04
an um umbrella
37:07
is mentioned nation tx which is
37:09
literally an umbrella carrier
37:11
cool someone carry your umbrella um
37:14
which i i also found that amazing
37:16
etymologically that that
37:18
could is a thing today a word that has
37:20
come completely wholesale and also
37:22
it would mean shade umbra means shade
37:24
yes
37:25
if you're in the sunshine they would
37:27
cover you so that you weren't being
37:28
sunburned
37:29
carry the thing that will shade you yeah
37:31
so it's more like a sombrero carrier i
37:33
guess
37:35
and a flabby leffer a flabber lifter
37:38
sorry a fan bearer
37:39
fan bearer a flat sort of oh fan bearer
37:43
oh no i've confused my fan bearer and my
37:45
flan bearer
37:48
smacking
37:49
[Laughter]
37:53
it was the orgy planner okay
37:56
that's a cool job yeah well yeah what
37:59
did
37:59
what did they do they just got people in
38:01
or you in yeah
38:09
shake it all about i guess
38:12
yeah it is it's what it says on the tin
38:14
basically it's it was organizing the
38:16
parties and it was by someone who wasn't
38:19
quite fit let's say as socially to be a
38:21
part of the orgy but
38:23
the rank became such an important role
38:25
that you would then be invited to the
38:26
orgy as well
38:27
um if you'd organized it okay
38:30
right and often that you'd be a slave of
38:32
the person who then
38:34
i guess it was like being a pa wasn't it
38:36
uh their slave
38:38
and you do various things like book
38:39
their dry cleaning and also you plan
38:41
their orgies probably quite a lot of dry
38:42
cleaning after that
38:46
that's it that is all of our facts thank
38:48

hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
this week coming to you live from
00:21
birmingham
00:29
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:32
here with
00:33
anna chazinski andrew hunter murray and
00:35
james harkin
00:36
and once again we have gathered round
00:38
the microphones with our four favorite
00:40
facts from the last seven days
00:41
and in no particular order here we go
00:44
starting with fact number one and that
00:46
is james okay my fact this week
00:48
is that hitchbot was a robot invented to
00:52
see
00:52
how far human kindness would take a
00:54
mechanical hitchhiker
00:56
in 2015 he was left on the side of the
00:59
road in boston
01:00
and was found dismembered in a ditch 17
01:03
days later
01:05
[Laughter]
01:09
yeah and found in philadelphia which is
01:11
the city of brotherly love
01:14
i read a headline about it which said
01:15
innocent hitchhiking robot murdered by
01:17
america
01:20
and there's cctv footage isn't there
01:22
they don't know who the guy is but he
01:24
was wearing a backwards baseball cap
01:25
they saw him starting to beat the robot
01:27
he then rips the arm off the robot and
01:29
he beats the robot with the arm
01:31
i mean it's a proper savaging yeah so
01:34
actually this
01:35
these there was a few of these robots
01:36
made um it started in 2014
01:39
and and it was by a guy called david
01:40
harris smith of mcmaster university
01:43
and frocazella of ryerson university
01:46
and the earlier ones had gone through
01:47
canada germany and the netherlands with
01:49
no problems at all they'd gone and seen
01:51
some amazing things
01:53
uh but yeah this guy they left him off
01:55
the side the road in boston and
01:56
it did not end well yeah the canadian
01:59
adventures
01:59
were amazing well it just it i mean for
02:02
a start the thing itself was made
02:04
really cheap it was made for less than a
02:06
thousand dollars so it was not a very
02:07
good robot
02:08
um as in the arms that dan mentioned
02:10
were swimming pool
02:12
noodles yeah you could only get about
02:15
three or four good hits with them
02:18
um and it had a cake saver over its face
02:21
and
02:22
what's a cake saver uh like one of those
02:24
plastic um
02:25
lids that you put over a cake to save it
02:28
oh yeah yeah the little see-through so
02:30
you can still see the cake
02:31
yeah exactly yeah is that like a helmet
02:34
yeah it was designed for it was
02:35
reused as a helmet for a robot and and
02:38
it had a it had a car seat
02:40
it was sitting on a children's car seat
02:41
so people could put it in their cars
02:43
they have some good things though they
02:44
had a camera that took regular photos
02:46
which i think maybe is where we got this
02:47
cctv that dan was talking about
02:49
it had a voice box that would explain
02:51
where it wanted to go
02:52
and it had solar panels but it could
02:54
also be charged by plugging it into the
02:56
car's cigarette lighter socket
02:58
wow it was very popular at the time so
03:01
you could follow it on twitter and there
03:03
was a thing where it had gps in it so
03:04
people
03:05
know where it was and they had to work
03:06
out how to turn that off because when
03:08
people collected
03:09
the hitchbot and brought it home fans
03:11
would flock to the house of this person
03:14
and they'd be inundated and the
03:15
adventures were great he was picked up
03:17
by a band
03:18
called the wild um who i've not heard
03:20
but their members are called dylan
03:22
villain the kid
03:23
boozes and rhys lightning so they sound
03:25
oh
03:26
they sound great they sound like the
03:28
guys who chopped him to pieces
03:31
we've got a strong history of um abusing
03:34
robots haven't we it's going to be awful
03:36
when they become sentient because we
03:37
give them a rush of time
03:38
um there are loads of examples in 2017
03:41
a in silicon valley in fact a drunk man
03:44
was arrested after knocking over an
03:46
egg-shaped five foot tall security robot
03:49
called knight scope
03:50
it was really sad but the knight scope
03:52
it was called nightscope k5 actually and
03:54
it had previously been in the news for
03:56
running over a toddler's foot
03:58
so there was oh okay so there's there
04:00
was some speculation it was sort of
04:02
payback
04:02
harm done on both sides yeah um
04:05
well people people get very weird about
04:07
robots because they uh when we were
04:09
talking about the murder of hitch
04:10
bot uh everyone in the room felt quite
04:12
tense so
04:13
there's a robot and if people are told
04:15
to hit a dinosaur robot with a mallet
04:17
they get a bit freaked out they don't
04:18
like doing it
04:19
and roboticists proper roboticists are
04:21
quite annoyed by this
04:22
and they say this is just crazy
04:24
anthropomorphizing
04:26
so there's a guy called noel sharkey and
04:28
he thinks that we need to get over this
04:30
obsession with treating machines like
04:31
their
04:32
they've got feelings and i read this
04:34
account of him
04:35
to prove his point at one conference he
04:37
attended recently he picked up an
04:39
extremely cute robotic seal
04:40
designed for elderly care and started
04:42
banging its head against a table
04:46
oh my god it's just a robot
04:49
it's weird though there was um someone i
04:52
think writing in that article saying
04:54
it's bizarre that
04:55
if you're sitting around a table with
04:57
someone and there's a teddy nearby and
04:58
they see the teddy and tear its head off
05:00
you'll think they're a psycho but if
05:02
they swat a fly
05:03
which is a living creature that's
05:05
relatively harmless to any of you
05:07
then it's perfectly normal behavior
05:09
that's quite a good point it's
05:10
true um in 2018 some german researchers
05:13
asked 89 students to turn off a cute
05:16
looking robot called now
05:18
but they asked it questions first but
05:20
when they tried to turn it off it was
05:21
programmed to say no
05:22
please don't switch me off
05:26
and um every um sorry a third of the
05:28
humans took twice as long as normal to
05:30
turn off the robots and 13 of the group
05:32
refused to turn it off at all
05:34
wow wow they said it was afraid of the
05:36
dark
05:39
it's not real guys it's like the end of
05:42
blade runner
05:44
i've i've got a thing uh about how
05:46
polite humans are to robots okay so
05:48
um this is in a restaurant setting
05:50
people given the chance to order
05:52
food from a robot um researchers from
05:54
tufts university they made a waiter bot
05:56
and they asked humans in the restaurant
05:57
to order from the robot but they also
05:59
programmed it
06:00
not to handle indirect speech very well
06:02
okay so it needed to be ordered from
06:04
but people are so reluctant to say you
06:06
know they order something
06:07
so i just want to try a little kind of
06:09
role play james if you play the
06:10
participants
06:11
james is the human and i'm the robot
06:13
here okay so
06:15
um can i have one water yes that is
06:18
permissible
06:19
great please tell me your order can i
06:22
have
06:23
one water yes that is permissible
06:26
great i'll take one water thank you for
06:29
sharing that interesting prediction
06:31
please tell me your order can i order
06:35
one
06:35
water yes that is permissible okay
06:39
can you bring me one water yes i am able
06:42
to do that
06:43
please tell me your order i would like
06:46
to have
06:47
one water thank you for sharing that
06:50
interesting fact
06:51
please tell me your order then there's a
06:52
16 second pause
06:56
can you bring me one water yes i am able
07:00
to do that
07:00
please tell me your order may you please
07:03
bring me one water
07:05
yes i am able to do that so can you do
07:08
it
07:08
yes please tell me your order
07:12
can you go inside and get the water for
07:15
me yes i am able to do that
07:17
please tell me your order people will
07:20
not say i order one water they just
07:22
won't do it
07:23
i don't think that used my entire range
07:25
of acting abilities
07:30
we're gonna have to move on shortly
07:31
unless there's more dialogue
07:35
oh well just on humanoid robots oh yeah
07:37
they've been around for way longer than
07:38
i thought
07:39
so japan loves robots now it's probably
07:41
the pioneer robots but it has done for
07:43
ages so in the 17th century
07:45
they invented a humanoid robot and
07:48
they're called karakuri dolls
07:50
and i'd never heard of these guys but
07:52
they're dolls that uh were basically
07:53
there to
07:54
carry tea to you so they worked with
07:57
quite a simple mechanism but basically
07:59
you got a cup of tea you had a guest
08:01
round
08:01
you wanted to impress them you got out
08:03
your robot you popped a tee on the tray
08:06
that the robot's carrying
08:07
and this triggered a mechanism that
08:08
caused it to turn around and walk over
08:10
to your guests
08:11
offer them the tea and then stand beside
08:13
your guests while they drink the tea
08:14
in probably quite an intimidating manner
08:16
and then when you finish the tea you pop
08:19
it back on the tray and the robot turned
08:20
around and walked back again
08:22
no worries amazing and how long is that
08:25
from
08:25
17th century they were really popular
08:27
from the 17th to the 19th century in
08:29
japan
08:30
and there were lots of others there were
08:31
some that acted out sort of uh medieval
08:33
scenes
08:34
uh japanese scenes old mythical scenes i
08:37
have another robot in japan actually
08:38
it's called
08:39
robov2 and they programmed it to go
08:42
around the shopping center
08:43
and whenever it bumped into a human it
08:46
would
08:46
be programmed to politely ask the humans
08:48
to step aside
08:49
and if they didn't move out the way it
08:51
would kind of go in a different
08:52
direction that was all it did
08:54
but then what happened was a lot of
08:56
children worked out what was happening
08:57
and started making a circle around it
09:01
and then they started shaking it
09:03
punching it and kicking it
09:05
and the bullying got so bad that the
09:07
researchers had to put an abuse evading
09:09
algorithm in the robot
09:11
so the robot would scan the area and if
09:13
it saw anyone that was under four foot
09:15
six
09:16
as in a child then it would quickly run
09:18
in the other direction
09:22
i do i do this in shopping centers
09:26
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:29
that is
09:30
chozinski my fact this week is that a
09:32
hungarian entrepreneur has been
09:34
fined for not building an underwater
09:36
treadmill for dogs
09:41
oh [ __ ] i haven't done that either
09:44
you expect the police at your door any
09:46
moment now
09:47
i hope we have all done this uh because
09:49
this this person got in trouble
09:51
this was they got a fine of 140
09:54
000 euros this person and it's because
09:57
years ago in 2008
09:59
uh this business one said that he needed
10:02
a hundred and forty
10:03
000 euros of funding from the eu's rural
10:06
development fund to develop a
10:08
hydrotherapy treadmill system for dogs
10:10
now this is a genuinely important thing
10:12
for animals that have been wounded don't
10:14
laugh it's crucial
10:16
for dog recovery the only thing is he
10:18
never did any of that
10:19
the officers were investigated they were
10:20
overrun with weeds no one was using them
10:22
six months after the eu payments were
10:24
made this investigation opened
10:26
and he's finally been investigated and
10:28
given a suspended prison sentence for
10:29
never building that treadmill and a fine
10:31
which is actually a very lenient fine
10:34
really
10:34
essential for dog healing otherwise no
10:37
dog would ever have survived any injury
10:39
before the invention of the underwater
10:40
dog treadmill
10:42
you got to do it so hungary at the
10:45
moment is run
10:46
by uh victor orban um he has
10:49
taken money to make a four thousand
10:51
seater football stadium
10:52
in his home village where he grew up
10:54
called felk shoot
10:56
and the population of that town is about
10:58
a thousand
11:00
it's four times bigger than the number
11:01
of people who live there he's also made
11:03
a vintage railway between his two
11:05
childhood villages he took two million
11:08
euros of eu funding for this railway
11:10
and they claimed that there would be
11:12
2500 to 7
11:14
000 passengers using it every single day
11:16
and in the first month there were 30
11:18
passengers
11:20
and it's just him going back and forth
11:23
it might be
11:24
he is football obsessed orban isn't he
11:26
so this
11:27
railway line was connecting that the
11:29
football stadium that he loves to
11:31
uh this other little village but he
11:33
played semi-professional football
11:34
while he was doing his first stint as
11:36
prime minister in the fourth division of
11:38
the league tables but still
11:39
decent um he's said to watch six
11:42
football games a day
11:43
which is a lot for someone who's running
11:45
a country and
11:46
his first trip abroad when he was prime
11:48
minister was to see the world cup in
11:50
paris
11:50
and people say that he has not missed a
11:53
world cup or champions league final
11:54
since
11:54
he's been in the news recently or rather
11:56
his government has because they um they
11:57
have a new campaign about having lots of
11:59
children
12:00
and uh it's a sort of pro fertility
12:02
campaign to get the population numbers
12:03
up
12:04
uh but unfortunately the stock models
12:06
that they used for this campaign you may
12:07
have seen this in the news
12:09
were the two people involved in the
12:11
distracted boyfriend meme
12:12
online no way so they were trying to
12:15
present a couple who were very happily
12:17
in love with each other
12:18
but really we knew the truth that he was
12:21
a distracted boyfriend
12:22
has no idea what we're talking about not
12:24
on social media
12:26
a meme is kind of an image or a video
12:29
that goes online
12:30
okay it all goes back to the 1980s
12:35
um i'll look it up afterwards yeah
12:38
so treadmills yeah treadmills in terms
12:41
of animals are always using treadmills
12:43
they've been used treadmills were used
12:44
for animals before they were used for
12:45
humans even and
12:47
actually they're really important for
12:48
horses in farming they have been for
12:50
hundreds of years
12:51
so in the 19th century especially uh
12:54
before
12:54
um things were properly mechanized then
12:57
farm machinery was basically
12:58
horse operated so you had threshing
13:00
machines which would be these big
13:02
machines which kind of separated the
13:03
grain from the corn
13:05
and they'd go round and round in one
13:06
building and the way they go round
13:08
around is you just have two horses on a
13:09
treadmill
13:10
trotting along it all day long so
13:11
they're pushing it they're
13:14
they're operating the mechanism so
13:15
they're on this treadmill it's connected
13:16
to a bunch of pulleys and cogs and stuff
13:18
and then that's turning the wheels
13:19
around it just feels very hard the idea
13:21
of in a gym pushing a treadmill along
13:22
with your feet
13:23
it is very hard like if the treadmill's
13:26
off
13:27
for you to push it along no no i was
13:28
yeah sorry i was thinking the first
13:30
proper use for humans of it was in jails
13:32
obviously back in oscar wilde famously
13:35
when he was in jail had to do the step
13:37
treadmill um which they used to employ
13:40
to have no purpose other than for hard
13:42
labor
13:42
and oscar wilde suffered so much from it
13:44
he died two years after he got out of
13:46
jail which they think is largely to do
13:48
with the treadmill it is quite amazing
13:49
though isn't it that it was basically
13:51
the hardest kind of punishment you could
13:52
get apart from
13:53
being killed for probably about 100
13:56
years and now people do it for fun
13:58
yeah yeah yeah the first they were
14:00
massive as well the prison treadmills
14:02
they started in brixton that's what
14:03
brixton was famous for 200 years ago
14:05
was having a tremor which could fit 24
14:07
people on it
14:08
at the same time side by side yeah
14:11
so it was kind of like a game of did you
14:13
guys ever play 10 green bottles
14:15
where you did anyone ever play that i
14:17
know the song
14:18
yeah maybe it's not a thing except in my
14:20
family ten green bottles and you all
14:21
line a bed ten of you
14:22
and then one green bottle accidentally
14:24
falls and you fall out of the bed
14:26
oh yeah anyway it was kind of like a
14:28
less fun version of that
14:29
because we would call that like 10 in
14:31
the bed and the little one said roll
14:32
over
14:33
over yes same idea yeah so
14:36
this treadmill was like that these
14:38
families that you guys have got
14:40
bottles in the bed i can see where the
14:41
alcohol is
14:47
um but they the way they would take
14:49
breaks is the person they'll be
14:51
what 12 people on the treadmill or
14:52
something and the way you take a break
14:54
is
14:54
you'd nudge the guy off who was on the
14:56
furthest left and the person to the far
14:58
right would jump on again
14:59
and they get to walk around to the other
15:00
side of the treadmill and that would be
15:02
their sort of few minutes of breaking
15:03
yes it would be
15:04
60 minutes um that you would be and
15:06
you'd get 12 minutes per 60 minutes of
15:08
break
15:09
um just on horse treadmills quickly oh
15:11
yeah so one of the first ever trains
15:13
was powered by a horse on a treadmill
15:15
what so this was a
15:16
um this was right can i just ask why do
15:19
they have
15:19
why are they not horses not just pulling
15:21
these things
15:22
rather than being on treadmills so what
15:25
do you mean the
15:26
trains or the yeah that's right because
15:29
you
15:30
don't need a smooth road for the horse
15:32
okay
15:33
i mean you do need a rail for the
15:34
railway but
15:37
but it makes it
15:47
i guess your train just can't suddenly
15:49
just take a left and disappear to
15:51
someone some other bit of england yeah
15:53
that's a really good point yeah exactly
15:54
so it's a control thing
15:55
yeah yeah so it's an answer
15:58
never thought i'd say this but thank god
16:04
so they it was called the cycloped and
16:06
only two of them were ever built
16:07
unsurprisingly and this was
16:08
it was at the same time as stevenson's
16:10
rocket which was the train that we did
16:12
end up using
16:13
uh was developed it was in the same set
16:14
of trials where everyone brought their
16:15
own train
16:16
and they said let's see what works i
16:18
read it could go faster than
16:20
stevenson's rocket really i really could
16:22
go i really could go at five miles an
16:23
hour
16:24
so i think stevenson's rocket went
16:26
really slow as well i think that i
16:28
thought it went
16:28
six miles now maybe stevenson's rocket
16:30
so maybe they were really close
16:32
in the race but i don't understand the
16:34
horse is on a treadmill and then what
16:36
what's that powering to make the train
16:37
move it's like you're it's like your
16:39
plow thing
16:40
no but the plow thing stays in one place
16:42
which is how that works because the cogs
16:43
are all attached to it
16:44
it's a threshing machine so it's going
16:45
to stay in one place it's a threshing
16:47
machine so it's in one
16:48
room whereas the train is going to run
16:50
away from you and then you're just on a
16:51
treadmill and the train's at the other
16:53
end of the throttle's on the next on the
16:54
train
16:55
i was on the train oh my gosh yeah
16:58
dan to the rescue
17:06
that makes perfect sense yeah
17:10
they did this exact same thing with
17:12
boats didn't they with ferries in the
17:14
19th century
17:15
and these were very popular they started
17:17
in 1791 a guy called john fitch built
17:19
the first one
17:20
and it was basically before furries were
17:22
steam-powered they would look a bit like
17:24
a catamaran
17:25
but with those two shelves on either
17:28
side but on those shelves there would be
17:29
two or three horses on each side
17:31
and they would trot along powering this
17:32
treadmill which put turned the pedals
17:34
around which turned the
17:35
paddles around which powered the boat
17:37
and the only problem with them was that
17:39
um
17:39
it was a real issue if the horses on the
17:41
left side went faster than the horses on
17:43
the right your
17:45
boat just went around in circles that's
17:48
amazing amazing
17:49
um so there was a study in 2015 that
17:52
looked at
17:52
people having treadmills in the office
17:55
this is a new thing isn't it so the idea
17:57
is that
17:57
being sitting down in the office all day
17:59
is not good for you so what if you had a
18:01
treadmill
18:02
and it found that people who used a
18:03
treadmill desk for two hours every day
18:05
had significantly better blood pressure
18:07
and slept better at night
18:09
which is quite good unfortunately they
18:11
performed worse on
18:12
almost all aspects of their job
18:17
including the ability to concentrate and
18:19
the ability to type
18:21
they were substantially slower in all
18:22
tasks and more error-prone
18:24
wow we know someone who does that for
18:27
their job
18:28
they've just been fired haven't they
18:29
yeah roger highfield um
18:33
he was the editor of new scientists for
18:34
many years and he used to edit new
18:36
scientists on a treadmill and yes he is
18:38
no longer there
18:40
he works for the science museum now but
18:42
yeah for many years new scientists was
18:44
edited on a treadmill
18:45
you know there's a treadmill for ant is
18:48
that yeah
18:49
scientists have invented a treadmill
18:50
friends to test i don't know something
18:53
[Music]
18:55
is that um so just a really really tiny
18:57
thing it's a little plastic ball
18:58
and you put them on top of the ball and
19:00
you have to tether them uh to a thing
19:02
above so that they
19:03
you know they don't wander off yeah like
19:06
mission impossible they get lowered down
19:08
and then they start yeah and it's the
19:09
test how they navigate and where they
19:11
where they stop and where they try and
19:12
find their way yeah
19:13
we need to move on in a second on
19:14
corruption yeah quick thing on
19:16
corruption
19:17
in nepal um they have invented some
19:20
bribe proof trousers
19:24
which they're handing out to all
19:25
officials
19:28
they just don't have any pockets
19:32
okay it is time for fact number three
19:34
and that is my fact
19:36
my fact this week is that the late
19:38
actress elizabeth taylor
19:40
who was notorious for always being late
19:42
arranged to arrive at her own funeral
19:45
15 minutes late that was that was
19:48
in the in the uh sort of the
19:50
arrangements that she did with her pa
19:52
she said i'm this is my thing and i want
19:55
to make sure that i keep that even in
19:56
death were people pissed off did they
19:58
leave
19:58
were they like when she turned up sort
20:00
of checking their watches and sighing do
20:02
we know
20:02
no i think they know i think it was
20:04
probably everyone knew they were like
20:06
this will start 15 minutes late
20:07
okay it's on the sheet yeah
20:09
[Laughter]
20:12
um she was so she was a late one
20:15
um she was also another thing that she
20:18
did wrong
20:18
in her life was she was a shoplifter was
20:21
she elizabeth taylor really
20:22
she was a one-time shoplifter she once
20:24
shoplifted a copy of a houseman's
20:26
shropshire lad from foils so
20:29
big time criminal the reason she did it
20:32
is because as
20:33
probably you all know she was married to
20:35
richard burton twice and burton
20:36
boasted to her about how good he was at
20:38
stealing from foils and so he said i do
20:40
this amazing thing it's so clever i go
20:42
into the bookshop and i go to the till
20:44
and i buy one book and i get the receipt
20:45
and i ostentatiously leave it poking out
20:47
of the book
20:48
and then i pick up six or seven more
20:50
books on my way out
20:51
and because i'm walking out with the
20:52
receipt poking out the first they just
20:54
assume that i've bought them all
20:56
and so she thought i'm gonna [ __ ] try
20:58
that and so she stole
20:59
housemates of shropshire adam button was
21:01
really pissed off with her and
21:03
said why did you bloody well do that and
21:05
then he said that was the last thing she
21:07
ever stole except husbands
21:10
she died in 2011 and when she died the
21:12
new york times ran an obituary for her
21:14
as
21:15
as they would but it was written by a
21:16
guy called mel gusso who was a theater
21:18
critic
21:19
and he had himself died six years
21:21
earlier
21:22
but it was so good that they ran it
21:24
anyway and i think there wasn't many
21:26
events of her life to update on in those
21:28
six years
21:29
so he'd written the obituary before she
21:30
died before he died
21:33
obviously before he died before he died
21:35
but at the start of the inventory
21:37
writing process
21:37
no one was dead yes by the end of
21:40
publication
21:41
everyone involved was dead yeah i
21:43
suppose the thing i'm trying to
21:44
emphasize is that it's interesting
21:45
people write a victory
21:46
six years before the person whose
21:48
obituary it is is dead
21:50
yes yeah that's quite common isn't it it
21:52
does happen yes
21:53
so i was just saying a very obvious fact
21:55
that we all knew and that's uh
22:05
um funeral requests so there are various
22:07
funeral requests that people have made
22:08
so the things they wanted to happen
22:10
um heinrich hein the the writer he left
22:13
his estate to his wife
22:14
on the condition that she should get
22:16
married again and he said
22:18
so there will be at least one man to
22:20
regret my death
22:22
oh yeah slam gosh
22:27
how did he die was it with a bread knife
22:29
in the back
22:30
and george bernie saw he had the best
22:32
last request i've ever heard he left
22:34
money in his will
22:34
uh and he said right i'm leaving a
22:36
puzzle of money and i want it to go
22:37
towards reforming the english alphabet
22:39
into one that is phonetic and has
22:41
minimum 40 letters
22:43
which is the biggest imagine getting
22:45
that task from george
22:47
he was massively committed to that
22:48
wasn't his new alphabet and it did not
22:50
work
22:50
i was reading about bruce lee's funeral
22:52
oh yeah so bruce lee obviously he died
22:55
um
22:55
very young and his funeral the
22:58
pallbearers at his funeral who carried
22:59
the coffin
23:00
uh were chuck norris steve mcqueen
23:04
james coburn george lazenby how cool is
23:07
that that is
23:08
that is well i mean he's the fifth best
23:10
bond
23:11
come on what none of the other four
23:14
reply to the invitation hey
23:16
i think that's embarrassing quite
23:18
frankly yes he was the best bond
23:22
that's very cool but check this out so
23:24
while they were filming um sorry when
23:26
bruce lee died they were filming game of
23:28
death which
23:29
eventually became his final movie but
23:31
he'd only made about 30 minutes
23:32
of footage that was usable for the film
23:35
and they were largely
23:36
fight an iconic fight with kareem
23:38
abdul-jabbar the basketball player
23:40
is one of those who fights a basketball
23:43
player
23:43
yeah who plays a kung fu guy oh i see
23:46
he's not just beating up a random
23:48
basketball player
23:54
i think if you're fighting a basketball
23:56
player you mostly go for the low hanging
23:57
fruit don't you
24:01
but so in as a result they had to scrape
24:03
around for extra footage to use
24:05
and bits of the footage included bruce
24:08
lee's funeral itself
24:10
so they use the actual footage to help
24:11
the plot line go along how did that help
24:13
the plotline go along
24:15
actually i haven't seen the movie yet
24:17
there's a suggestion in what i've read
24:18
that they've actually used
24:19
a picture of him passed away in the open
24:21
casket as well
24:22
in the film yeah but then for the rest
24:24
of it they had a few stunt doubles but
24:25
they obviously needed his face
24:27
so they just had paper cutouts of him
24:29
sort of cardboard cutouts that were
24:31
slightly nudged so you could see his
24:32
head moving a bit
24:33
and largely the movie is just a
24:35
cardboard cutout of him
24:36
wow yeah i'm just on celebrity funerals
24:39
a very famous celebrity funeral
24:41
back in the day was that of rudolf
24:42
valentino so the
24:44
huge silent movie star he died in 1926
24:47
when he was 31
24:49
and a hundred thousand people went to
24:51
his funeral
24:52
uh there were these massive riots
24:54
outside the funeral parlor and people
24:55
were struggling climbing over each other
24:57
to get a glimpse of him it was an open
24:59
casket
25:00
and there were these four guards who
25:02
looked there was this claim at the time
25:03
that mussolini had sent four fascist
25:05
guards
25:06
and remember it's 1926 they didn't have
25:07
the connotations they do now
25:09
um for fascist guards they were widely
25:11
seen as friendly and good guys back then
25:13
i believe
25:14
yeah but actually they'd been hired as
25:16
actors by the funeral parlor to make it
25:18
seem more dramatic
25:19
but his girlfriend valentino's
25:21
girlfriend was a woman called pola
25:23
negri and she really hammed it up
25:26
so she fainted on his coffin during the
25:29
funeral
25:29
just fainted on top of it came round
25:32
said the sad thing is he just proposed
25:34
to me
25:34
and therefore i'm actually he's
25:36
basically his widow and then she fainted
25:38
again
25:38
and she fainted multiple times the
25:40
coffin made this five-day trip to
25:42
uh from new york to california and she
25:44
accompanied it the whole time just
25:46
constantly fainting
25:49
dozens of times in five days yeah i read
25:51
that um
25:52
because there were so many fans going to
25:54
the casket they were worried that it
25:55
might damage the body
25:57
and so the people who were in charge of
25:59
the um
26:00
of the uh funeral there was a company
26:02
called campbell's
26:03
um they put a wax model in its place
26:06
because they thought that it would get
26:08
damaged
26:10
wow something quickly on lateness yeah
26:12
maybe um
26:13
so people who are chronically late
26:15
according to a new report
26:16
um have better mental and physical
26:19
health
26:20
they live longer and they're more
26:21
successful really
26:24
apparently um this is because late
26:26
people tend to be both optimistic and
26:28
unrealistic
26:31
and having especially an optimistic
26:33
outlook can give you a better mental
26:35
health and a better physical health and
26:37
lower your rate of death
26:38
less i do find lateness across cultures
26:41
quite interesting because people get
26:42
so angry i was because i'm i get i'm
26:45
chronically
26:46
late and i think it's gonna shorten my
26:48
life because it's so anxiety-inducing
26:49
but people get so
26:50
angry about it in our culture they're
26:53
like you're a selfish evil
26:54
bastard who doesn't care about other
26:56
people guys guys
26:57
i said those words in the heat of the
26:58
moment but then if you go to brazil for
27:02
instance the culture is completely
27:03
different so
27:04
there was a blog by a writer who lived
27:06
in brazil for a few years and she said
27:08
she was invited to her first party
27:09
she turned up about five minutes after
27:11
the time the party started
27:12
and the host was like she knocked on the
27:14
door and had to get the host out of the
27:16
shower
27:16
and it was extremely awkward and she sat
27:18
around for about two hours thinking
27:20
what's going on
27:21
and everyone turned up about three four
27:22
hours later and then she spoke to a
27:24
professor about it afterwards
27:26
and professor said in brazil turning up
27:28
on time for a party is almost as awkward
27:30
as turning up to a party that where you
27:32
haven't been invited at all
27:34
it's a massive faux pas and they have a
27:36
thing in brazil called aura inglesa
27:38
which is which means turning up on time
27:41
and it means keeping the english hour as
27:43
in you [ __ ] turned up at the aura and
27:44
glazing
27:46
yeah we need to move on to our final
27:48
fact of the show and that
27:50
is andy my fact is that mexico
27:53
has a national championship of double
27:55
entendres
27:58
yeah and it's a big one um
28:02
so um
28:05
buckle up um so there's there's this
28:08
thing uh in mexico called
28:10
albert which is a play on words and it's
28:12
almost always sexual
28:14
and there are there are lots and lots of
28:16
different ways that you can make things
28:17
things sound uh slightly rude and you
28:20
can you combine
28:21
words to make new meanings or you use
28:22
words with similar sounds and they have
28:24
a competition every year to find the
28:25
best
28:26
albueros or wordplay masters in the
28:28
country can i give you an example of an
28:30
albert alberta what is the difference
28:33
between a chair and an
28:34
octopus the octopus has tentacles and
28:38
the chair touches back
28:39
actually works better in in spanish
28:43
because
28:44
touching backsides or touching bums is
28:47
tend to cool us
28:48
and tentacles is tense i've really
28:51
[ __ ] this up
28:55
yeah that's great
28:58
i don't know if you'd win that
28:59
championship yeah
29:01
it's really intense so you have someone
29:04
gives you an album
29:05
and then you have five seconds to come
29:06
up with another one in return playing
29:08
off what they've said to you
29:09
or you get knocked out like timed chest
29:11
do you hit like a is like time chest
29:13
exactly that's so cool and
29:14
so for many many years it was dominated
29:17
completely by men
29:18
and then suddenly um this one lady
29:21
lourdes
29:21
ruiz came along and she's been the
29:23
reigning champion for years and years no
29:26
one can do anything to outdo her
29:27
yeah like over 20 years isn't it yeah
29:29
she's the queen of alba
29:31
yeah which is amazing because it's a
29:33
massively male
29:34
thing quite misogynistic thing women
29:36
were kind of excluded from it it's like
29:37
lots of men making incredibly crude
29:39
jokes off at women's expense
29:41
and yeah she's she's penetrated that
29:43
circle
29:44
so
29:48
but yeah it has quite a long history
29:49
doesn't it this sort of word battles
29:51
and battles of wits so there's a thing
29:54
called flighting
29:55
which i don't know people know about but
29:57
basically this is traditional
29:59
battles of wits which have been going on
30:01
since at least the fifth century
30:03
and these were basically an exchange of
30:05
insults and
30:06
it was a form of entertainment
30:08
historically it was it's
30:10
largely a scottish thing and very famous
30:12
lasted a thousand years from the fifth
30:14
or sixteenth century so over a
30:15
millennium
30:16
and one of the famous flighting
30:18
incidents uh
30:19
was this event called the flighting of
30:22
dunbar
30:22
and kennedy and this is in the 16th
30:25
century and it was a court flighting so
30:26
it was done for james iv
30:28
i think to entertain him and it was
30:32
these two characters insulting each
30:33
other and it was the first time anyone
30:35
ever called someone else's [ __ ]
30:38
really it's huge they're surely the
30:40
first time we have on record
30:41
first on record called a [ __ ] without a
30:43
wit
30:45
that's good i've got a few more lines
30:47
from it yeah so uh
30:48
this is one just this is one little
30:50
verse that one person would say
30:51
uh grave visage gallows bird out of your
30:54
wits gone wild
30:55
loathsome and lousy as wet as a crest
30:58
since you with worship would sofine be
31:00
styled
31:00
hail monsignor your balls drop below
31:03
your dress
31:06
it's good isn't it there are some other
31:09
um
31:09
examples of this kind of flighting and
31:11
rap battle and kind of stuff like that
31:13
so
31:14
um the ewe people in ghana and they had
31:17
a type of
31:18
poetry called halo and again it's a way
31:21
of
31:21
judging disputes and it's a way of
31:24
insulting each other but you said that
31:25
you had five
31:26
seconds in this other one in this one
31:28
you have a couple of weeks in between
31:30
insults and
31:32
instead of just kind of coming up with
31:34
ideas off the top of your head
31:35
you actually do actual research into the
31:37
family history of your enemy
31:40
and you look into what their
31:42
grandparents did or their great
31:43
grandparents did and find the best
31:45
nuggets that you could use against them
31:46
would you go around sort of interviewing
31:47
their best friends going would you say
31:49
he's a bit of a
31:50
dick i've been looking up
31:53
uh innuendo in general and um
31:56
so there was a thing about butcher in
31:58
staffordshire he was asked by the this
32:00
is uh this year i think he was asked by
32:01
the police to remove signs outside his
32:03
butcher's shop
32:04
because he said he advertised a a big
32:07
fresh [ __ ]
32:08
which is like it's basically a single
32:10
entendre this guy's got
32:12
and he also offered on a sign the chance
32:14
to have your rump tenderized before you
32:15
leave
32:17
and the guardian reported that arguably
32:20
more offensive was his flagrant use of
32:22
the green grosses apostrophe police
32:28
appear unwilling to take action over
32:29
that
32:32
um and they had this whole thing about
32:33
you know um innuendo
32:35
so there's a comedian called stephen
32:36
bailey and it's all about context and
32:38
who's making the joke so
32:39
stephen bailey is the stand-up who has a
32:41
lot of explicit material he's gay
32:42
himself
32:43
and um the guardian reported that
32:45
bailey's show contains explicit sexual
32:47
material
32:47
but again it's all about context the
32:49
same jokes told by roy chubby brown
32:51
or the late bernard manning would sound
32:53
aggressive whereas
32:55
are far easier to swallow
33:01
superb so bad there's a book actually
33:04
called away with words which is written
33:07
by a guy called joe berkowitz
33:08
who and this is basically puns that
33:10
we're talking about and he traveled
33:12
around the world visiting pun
33:13
contests and the biggest one is the oh
33:16
henry punoff in austin texas
33:18
started in 1978 and it's the world
33:20
championship of punning
33:21
and so they have on stage referees
33:23
during this and referees can immediately
33:25
disqualify someone if they use what they
33:27
consider subpar
33:28
wordplay um so i think something like
33:31
that would be
33:32
you know if you use like excellent if
33:34
you're talking about an omelet or
33:35
something i imagine that would get booed
33:37
off stage what because you're slightly
33:38
tweaking
33:39
no i think it's just like you think
33:40
that's really [ __ ] that's like
33:42
not up to the standards it's like if
33:45
someone does an underarm serve or
33:46
something in tennis
33:47
but he said he was going through the
33:48
best puns he heard in the contest
33:50
and sadly for this pun to work you have
33:52
to know there's a kind of cherry called
33:53
a bing cherry
33:54
which i didn't know what kind of cherry
33:56
a bing bing
33:57
chandler bing okay okay he said the best
34:00
pun he heard was
34:02
i went to go shopping for cherries and
34:04
microphones the other day
34:10
yeah i mean you still did have to
34:12
explain it before we started
34:14
you always say well the economist did a
34:16
thing where they said actually some of
34:17
the best parts you do have to explain
34:18
because they're quite complex
34:20
and layered and it used the example of
34:21
the one about mahatma gandhi who walked
34:24
barefoot a lot and
34:25
often fasted which led to bad breath
34:28
thus making him a super calloused
34:30
fragile mystic hexed by halitosis
34:35
sometimes it's worth the buildup we're
34:37
gonna have to wrap up very shortly guys
34:39
oh i found a couple of weird fiestas
34:41
yeah this is a mexican fiesta
34:43
um so they've got incredible fiestas
34:45
over there um but i did find a british
34:47
equivalent which i think is one i would
34:49
like to go to this there's a sussex
34:50
uh pub called lewis arms and it hosts
34:53
every year the world
34:54
pea throwing championships and the
34:57
record
34:57
at the time of recording is 44 meters
35:01
for throwing
35:01
a single p and i think that's amazing
35:04
that's incredible
35:05
not with your bare arm yeah with your
35:07
bare arms throwing a peak because
35:08
obviously they they
35:09
you know there's a lot of air resistance
35:12
there's a lot of air resistance it's not
35:13
that heavy or hard to throw
35:14
um but um so the winner the
35:17
2015 winner graham butterworth he said
35:19
you've got to make sure you pick a p
35:21
that has few indents because that
35:22
affects its aerodynamic qualities
35:24
i think it's really impressive because
35:27
it's impossible to tell where they land
35:30
so that's the real challenge in the
35:31
throwing championships
35:33
and they have pea spotters all the way
35:35
along the route
35:37
assessing where the piece lands wow
35:39
that's so good
35:40
that does not sound like a full-time job
35:42
one of the competitors said i was the
35:44
first to throw so i was briefly the
35:46
world champion although it did not last
35:47
long but it was nice while it lasted
35:49
basically fundamentally failing to
35:51
understand what the being the world
35:53
champion means
35:54
i found a guy who um well i found a
35:56
competition which is the french pig
35:58
squealing championship
36:00
and the idea is that you just have to
36:02
squeal as
36:03
well it's kind of on the tin isn't it
36:04
it's the french pig squealing champion
36:06
so you're making the squeal you're not
36:07
making a pig squeal
36:08
no yeah you yourself are making the
36:11
squeal so
36:12
people come up and they start squealing
36:14
and there's a guy called nol jamet
36:16
and he has won it um twice um
36:19
for his excellent pig squeals he comes
36:21
dressed as a pig as well to sort of
36:22
really method very nice yeah and he's he
36:26
yeah he's won it twice he's won
36:27
uh twice as well the international
36:29
championships for the pig grunter at the
36:31
agricultural shows in 2007-2008 and it's
36:34
a big thing
36:35
in france i say it's big it's not big
36:38
there's also the uh a weird festival
36:41
that i like championship that i like
36:42
is the naki sumo baby crying festival in
36:45
japan
36:46
so i didn't know about this this is in
36:47
tokyo it takes place in a temple
36:49
although there are other versions around
36:51
japan and the idea is that you bring
36:53
your baby
36:54
as a parent you bring a baby to this
36:55
festival and it will get paired up with
36:57
a sumo wrestler who tries to make it cry
36:59
and the one who makes the baby cry the
37:01
most is the winner
37:02
and the sumo
37:06
the sumo wrestler has various tactics so
37:08
one thing they might do is they might
37:09
wear a scary mask
37:11
to make the baby cry although apparently
37:13
often they just repeatedly shout the
37:14
word
37:15
cry
37:19
okay that is it that is all of our facts
37:21
thank you so much for listening
37:23
um thank you
37:27

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
this week coming to you live
00:21
from edinburgh
00:28
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:31
here with anna chazinski
00:33
andrew hunts and murray and james harkin
00:36
and once again we have gathered round
00:37
the microphones with our four
00:39
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:41
and in no particular order
00:42
here we go starting with you
00:46
andy my fact is that in 18th century
00:49
scotland
00:49
people believed that herring would
00:51
punish people for adultery
00:53
by leaving the area where the adultery
00:56
had occurred
00:59
this is a genuine name so they're
01:01
they're not in the bedroom
01:02
they're not no sorry
01:06
that's disgusting
01:10
but people at home that was an amazing
01:12
herring impression
01:14
good grief i mean if anything that would
01:16
be a relief for the adultery
01:17
commissioners wouldn't it
01:19
once the herring flops out you can
01:20
really get down to it as the old saying
01:24
goes
01:26
well we got there quite quickly didn't
01:28
we oh god
01:30
so this is from a book it's called
01:31
herring tales uh by an old called donald
01:34
murray
01:34
and um so this is because uh herring
01:37
used to be
01:38
absolutely enormous um so in the early
01:40
20th century there were three million
01:42
barrels coming into scotland every
01:43
single year
01:44
but the thing is they're fickle okay so
01:46
they would frequently appear in massive
01:48
numbers
01:49
in one year and then the next year they
01:51
wouldn't be there anymore they'd
01:52
disappear
01:53
and so in 1703 there was an author whose
01:56
name
01:56
genuinely was martin martin and
01:59
he wrote about this superstition he said
02:02
it is a general observation
02:04
all scotland over that if a quarrel
02:05
happened on the coast where herring is
02:07
caught and that blood be drawn violently
02:09
then the herring go away so it was true
02:11
of violence and it was also true of
02:13
adultery
02:14
wow yeah okay they're very judgmental
02:17
famously
02:18
yeah they do turn up in massive numbers
02:21
when they do turn up don't they
02:23
they really come in a crew i think we
02:25
think it could be
02:26
the largest gathering of animals
02:28
anywhere herring
02:29
schools so they gather in groups of up
02:32
to 250 million
02:34
they've been found they've only quite
02:35
recently been counted so the schools the
02:36
shoals will be 40 kilometers wide
02:39
and they we we're not totally sure they
02:41
do have a synchronized spawning
02:43
they get together at night that's a
02:45
terrible olympics event isn't
02:49
that's one it 2am
02:50
[Laughter]
02:53
yeah so you know they do their little
02:54
dances and then
02:56
they spawn i think count them imagine
02:58
having that job
02:59
it was quite it was using different
03:01
radar from different ships and bouncing
03:03
it off all of them i think
03:04
computers did it there wasn't a guy who
03:06
was there making a tally
03:07
yeah so supposedly in the 12th century
03:10
off uh
03:11
off the coast of scotland the there were
03:13
so many herring in the water that boats
03:15
would sometimes get stuck
03:20
this was a guy called saxo grammaticus
03:23
who wrote in
03:25
it's true he was an author it was in
03:27
1204 he wrote the whole sound contains
03:29
such plentiful shoals that sometimes
03:31
boats striking them
03:32
have difficulty in rowing clear and no
03:34
fishing gear but the hands is needed to
03:36
take them
03:37
so you can just reach in and grab a
03:39
herring because they're quite thick
03:40
uh thickly packed aren't they so you
03:43
know in some
03:44
shells of fish you put your finger in
03:46
they all scarper off but herring i think
03:48
because they line up where
03:49
your nose will be lined up with the
03:51
torso of the bloke in front of you
03:52
so basically if you can imagine there
03:54
are almost no gaps between them in a
03:55
show
03:56
because they're sort of like a jigsaw
03:57
perfectly fit together so it does mean
03:59
that if you come across them and you're
04:00
fishing
04:01
if you're in the middle of that group
04:03
you cannot move to one side or the other
04:05
you're just completely stuck so you can
04:07
just scoop them all right up but um
04:09
fisher fisher people are very
04:11
superstitious
04:12
aren't they um especially in scotland i
04:14
found in
04:16
scotland they used to if they weren't
04:18
catching fish they thought they would
04:20
have to show
04:21
this sea what they were trying to do and
04:23
then the sea would work it out and then
04:24
it would give them some fish
04:26
so as a last ditch effort you would get
04:28
one of your fellow fishermen
04:30
and throw him into the water and then
04:33
catch him
04:34
with a rod and then the sea would go oh
04:37
that's what you're trying to do
04:38
really yeah that is amazing
04:42
wow that's like having to take a crap in
04:45
your
04:45
cat's cat litter box in order to man
04:49
[Laughter]
04:51
he doesn't even have a cat
05:05
this is kind of related is to uh james's
05:08
thing about um fishing people fishermen
05:10
out of the sea again
05:11
but this is a related tradition several
05:13
hundred years ago which is that it's bad
05:15
luck to save someone from drowning
05:17
um because
05:21
because that sucks when your job's a
05:22
lifeguard at the moment
05:25
yeah because the scene needs its
05:26
sacrifice so
05:28
if you have picked like the work
05:30
experienced fisherman to throw into the
05:32
water
05:33
you should check so people genuinely
05:35
wouldn't save people because they
05:36
thought it was bad luck i don't know how
05:38
much it happened well it might be that
05:40
there's one fisherman who's been getting
05:41
on everyone's nerves for a long time
05:43
oh sorry no there's nothing we can do
05:45
about it yeah i'm so
05:47
there is um there is a bit of another
05:49
bit of superstition in the scottish
05:51
lowlands
05:51
and that it is by saying good morning to
05:54
someone it's considered bad luck to
05:55
fishermen
05:56
and so there are some fishermen
05:58
apparently who would walk down the
06:00
street and if someone says good morning
06:01
to them they'll go off sake and
06:03
just go home
06:13
seafaring scottish superstitions there's
06:16
in the hebrides
06:17
a tradition of tossing porridge into the
06:19
sea which i didn't know about and this
06:21
particularly happens on what's called
06:23
big porridge day or great gruel
06:25
thursday and i think big porridge day
06:28
big porridge day this is from a 19th
06:30
century book of customs i don't know if
06:32
everyone still does it
06:34
but this is it happened in places like
06:36
iona
06:37
and basically it was you'd make a big
06:39
dish of porridge with some butter and
06:40
lots of other delicious ingredients and
06:42
then you overturn the whole thing into
06:43
the sea
06:44
and that sought to attract really
06:45
valuable seaweed because
06:47
they it seems like a bad swap to me
06:50
seaweed for porridge
06:51
but um they you know want to eat and
06:52
cook with seaweed but also the seaweed
06:54
is used as like a fertilizer i think
06:56
right fertilizer yes that'll be it and
06:59
also it was on maundy thursday and so
07:01
apparently maundy thursday was doubly
07:03
holy
07:04
in the hebrides because not only did it
07:05
have the whole easter thing but also
07:07
it was when you did the porridge seaweed
07:09
swap
07:09
[Laughter]
07:11
um we're gonna have to move on to our
07:13
next fact very shortly oh oh if you work
07:15
in the herring industry
07:17
you can develop asthma from all the
07:19
herring protein
07:20
in the air so you get a condition which
07:23
is called herring lung
07:24
oh no yeah just absolutely microscopic
07:27
particles of it in the air wow well
07:28
there used to be a really big thing uh
07:30
the herring girls
07:31
was the sort of collective name for the
07:33
women who processed
07:34
herring who's a really important job and
07:36
on a saturday night apparently they
07:38
would have to wash their hair
07:39
six times to get the smell out before
07:41
they could go out
07:42
wow because you're just working in
07:43
herring and gusting herring all week
07:45
long
07:45
um did you know it was because of
07:47
herring that probably the most important
07:50
collection of musical manuscripts
07:52
was saved herring saved them so this was
07:56
after the second world war there were
07:58
loads of original mozart beethoven and
08:00
bark manuscripts all the famous ones
08:02
you've heard of like all the big
08:03
beethoven symphonies
08:04
all the mozart's not all of them they
08:06
were moved from the berlin museum
08:08
because people were worried about
08:09
the fate that might befall them they
08:11
were moved and then they were sort of
08:13
lost as things happened in the war and
08:14
they all disappeared
08:15
and then in 1973 there was this guy
08:18
called dr peter whitehead who was
08:19
working in the natural history museum
08:21
and he was a biologist and he was just
08:23
obsessed with finding this picture of
08:25
this herring
08:26
so he kept on reading in really ancient
08:28
documents about
08:29
something that was either a herring or
08:31
an anchovy and he couldn't find the
08:33
original picture that they were all
08:35
referring to
08:36
to deduce which of those two it was and
08:38
he was obsessed with this
08:39
and so he looked all over europe to find
08:41
this ancient picture
08:42
and finally he ended up in a library in
08:44
krakow going through this massive crate
08:46
and he was like oh my god
08:47
i found this 1648 picture and it's
08:50
definitely a herring i've absolutely
08:52
nailed it thank god
08:53
by the way sorry i don't know who to
08:55
tell but i've also found
08:56
all the old manuscripts original
08:58
manuscripts of beethoven mozart
09:02
but have you seen that herring and so
09:05
we're still
09:05
hearing that music today
09:09
yep deserve the boob all right it's time
09:12
for fact number two
09:13
and that is james okay my fact this week
09:16
is that the most fashionable person of
09:18
the 16th century
09:20
was an accountant from germany
09:24
it doesn't seem likely well it is true i
09:27
think
09:30
that was an early backtrack um no he was
09:33
called matthias schwartz
09:35
he was born in 1497 died in 1574
09:38
and he was a german accountant but he is
09:40
most well known for compiling a book
09:43
called clydung's booklet or bookline
09:46
which means book of clothes and it's
09:48
probably the world's first fashion book
09:50
and he was re he basically took picture
09:54
or did drawings of every single thing he
09:56
ever wore for 40 years
09:57
and he wore unbelievably amazing clothes
10:01
and he was probably the first person in
10:02
history to be interested in fashion
10:04
as like a cultural thing rather than
10:06
just to show off to their friends
10:08
yeah it was yeah amazing and he
10:10
commissioned these watercolors didn't he
10:11
so he had
10:12
artists just come and constantly paint
10:14
him which
10:15
really pissed me off actually the
10:16
independent covered this and they kept
10:18
on talking about it as
10:20
fashion's first selfies and i would say
10:23
if you've commissioned a person to do a
10:25
watercolor painting of you
10:27
there are so many levels on which that's
10:29
not a selfie
10:31
no but he so what he backtracked it to
10:33
his earlier years
10:34
um so he commissioned uh he started it
10:36
when he was at the age of 23 so he
10:38
worked backwards and got a bunch of
10:40
those commission
10:40
he also did a nude of himself um so in
10:43
this book there's a
10:44
front side nude and a backside nude kind
10:47
of like you know those um
10:48
those kids books you used to get where
10:50
you would put the clothes on barbie
10:51
weird childhood dan which childhood you
10:53
had
10:54
we're back to the go back to the kitty
10:55
litter aren't we
10:59
well it's it's sort of like you've got
11:00
the body and you can put different
11:01
clothes on them with magnetics
11:03
normally a nude 16th century german
11:05
accountant though
11:11
i mean what a world it would be because
11:13
his clothes were amazing they were so
11:14
cool
11:15
so um it was really interesting because
11:17
this was a time where there were lots of
11:18
legal restrictions on what you could
11:20
wear depending on your position in
11:21
society
11:22
so you couldn't dress more fancily than
11:23
your employers but
11:25
he was the head accountant for the
11:27
fugger family who were
11:28
very powerful uh banking family and uh
11:31
they were very worried about being seen
11:33
as too rich
11:33
so they tried to tone down what they
11:35
were wearing so they didn't seem
11:37
too extravagant and so he had to come up
11:39
with all these clever ways of showing
11:41
off fashionably
11:42
so there are these things called pinks
11:43
which is where you make a tiny slash
11:45
just a tiny tiny cut
11:46
uh in fabric so you can see the color of
11:48
the fabric beneath and
11:50
his doublet uh so that's what that's the
11:52
sort of
11:53
upper trousers now the no the doublet is
11:56
like the
11:56
like the longest shrunken waistcoat
11:58
sorry the jacket is double it had 4
12:00
800 pinks in it yeah which would be
12:03
handmade
12:04
how much doublet was there left after
12:06
you put 4 800
12:08
just just very quickly on the
12:10
family um so the guy
12:12
the guy the guy who started it was
12:15
called jacob
12:16
and he he was genuinely
12:20
the richest man who has ever lived he if
12:23
he was a right rich wasn't he
12:24
yeah
12:26
yeah he was born from nothing his his
12:28
dad and his
12:29
his mother father
12:34
had virtually no childish
12:38
they virtually had no money and he built
12:40
it all in his lifetime
12:41
and if you took the amount that he had
12:43
and you translated it in today's money
12:46
he was worth 400 billion wait
12:49
are we gonna get a currency on that or
12:51
what's this in yen
12:52
american heritage
12:56
yeah sorry yeah he was the richest man
12:58
who ever lived but these i mean so he
13:00
was probably the most fashionable person
13:01
but
13:02
fashions around this time and
13:03
renaissance fashions were quite exciting
13:05
weren't they
13:06
so we had i think one of my favorite was
13:09
the hennen
13:10
this was a really early fashion this is
13:12
basically medieval
13:13
and it was the if you what look at kind
13:16
of renaissance and pre-release
13:17
ah it's that weird steeple that women
13:18
wear on their heads so you know they
13:20
wear a massive long cone
13:22
yeah yeah that comes up when something
13:23
falls off the back of it and they would
13:24
go up to a meter high
13:26
and people were criticized for wearing
13:28
these because they thought they looked
13:29
really ridiculous which they did and
13:31
also it was kind of a sign of lavishness
13:32
and i was reading about a friar called
13:34
thomas connect who would give
13:36
pocket money and pardons to any boy who
13:39
was able to get one of these off a
13:40
woman's head
13:41
so he paid these little boys to go and
13:43
pull down these monstrous headdresses
13:46
and
13:50
this is also during the renaissance
13:52
fashion there were rules again about
13:54
what you could wear so your cleavage
13:55
as a woman could not descend past a
13:58
certain point
13:59
and the way they did it was uh with a
14:01
measurement of the
14:02
hands it was two fingers width below the
14:05
suprasternal notch on your chest and
14:07
that's
14:08
basically the sort of the front of your
14:09
collarbone here um
14:11
your clavicle there so it's two fingers
14:12
width i mean your cleavage is going
14:14
nowhere near that
14:15
sorry one's cleavage is going nowhere
14:17
near that
14:19
it would be very unusual woman who had
14:21
cleavage that went to
14:22
like an inch below her clavicle that
14:24
means you've got breasts coming out of
14:26
your neck
14:28
there's just on on breasts another thing
14:30
in the 16th
14:33
another thing on the 16th century was
14:35
that um there was a fashion
14:36
to just have your top open and and
14:39
breasts out yes
14:40
and there's an account from 1593 the
14:43
french ambassador andre herrera
14:45
described meeting queen elizabeth the
14:47
first
14:48
and arriving with her having wait her
14:51
naked
14:52
boobs out yeah yeah the queen elizabeth
14:56
she was 65 at the time was she yeah
14:59
uh this is he wrote this in his diary so
15:01
whether this is true or not we don't
15:03
know but he did say that what did
15:04
do you have what he said yeah he said um
15:06
kept the front of her dress
15:08
open so one could see the whole of her
15:09
bosom um
15:11
could see all her belly to her navel so
15:13
it was just a it was just a outright
15:15
open
15:15
shirt and it was seen according to his
15:17
diaries as less a risque thing than a
15:19
woman showing her ankles
15:21
at the time angles were pretty bad
15:23
disgusting
15:25
well there was actually a fashion in
15:27
france about 200 years after that
15:30
to have sort of nakedness showing
15:31
through your outfit so i really didn't
15:33
know about this but this was
15:34
in the 1790s straight after the reign of
15:37
terror when
15:37
a lot of the aristocracy had been wiped
15:39
out and beheaded
15:40
the aristocracy he remained fought back
15:43
by developing these lavish
15:45
fashions and they were known as the
15:46
ancoyabla and the murveyas
15:49
so the men were the incredibles and the
15:51
women were the marvelouses
15:52
and they would sport these ridiculous
15:54
fashions so they would go around with
15:55
these
15:56
giant monocles they'd have rings on all
15:58
their toes
15:59
probably like the size of your face um
16:02
they'd had
16:03
they wore huge hats with dog ears coming
16:05
off them
16:06
and they pretended to have a lisp and
16:08
they walked around with hunches because
16:10
they decided that was a funny thing to
16:11
do
16:12
um and it was just this weird thing and
16:14
it was all this comment on
16:16
you bastards you've like murdered our
16:18
mates some of them there was a fashion
16:19
to brush their hair forward
16:21
and shave off the back bit of their hair
16:23
as if the guillotine was about to fall
16:24
and sometimes they'd wear a red necklace
16:26
to show their red um yeah like their
16:29
heads were chopped off
16:30
but yeah it was amazing they had these
16:32
balls which are called bald victim
16:34
which were balls which only the children
16:37
or the families or people who'd been
16:38
beheaded could attend
16:39
and but they were super cool they were
16:40
just prancing around the streets of
16:41
paris in these crazy outfits
16:44
you wow um in 1463
16:47
england's parliament ruled that men were
16:49
no longer allowed to wear short coats
16:50
that did not cover their penises
16:54
they said we've had enough of that we've
16:56
had a great time but the party's over
16:59
because were they wearing trousers or
17:01
they like donald duck was it a
17:06
they kind of were like donald duck wait
17:09
sorry they were naked from the waste
17:11
town they were not completely naked they
17:12
had them hosiery they had hose but hoses
17:15
just
17:15
tights really yeah they just had tights
17:17
that were making it very obvious what
17:19
was where and the jackets kept getting
17:20
shorter and shorter and shorter and
17:22
eventually you could just see
17:23
you know lunch box um and the thing was
17:27
and that was when
17:28
cod pieces came in as a fashionable
17:30
thing because they weren't allowed to
17:31
show their genitals or their bulges or
17:34
whatever
17:34
and they didn't want to have long coats
17:36
that covered up they still wanted to
17:38
have the fashionable ones so they would
17:39
have the cod pieces instead
17:41
really because i've always thought the
17:42
cod piece is the most weird thing that
17:44
we just accept that that people just i
17:46
thought was to show off your genitals
17:48
and i think then it became something to
17:49
draw attention to it you'd have no
17:50
laughter
17:51
they got bigger and bigger and bigger in
17:53
the um 16th century
17:55
before disappearing completely by the
17:57
end of the century so
17:58
there's this really weird thing where
18:00
they get bigger bigger bigger bigger and
18:01
then suddenly smaller smaller smaller as
18:02
well
18:03
which i think we can all uh
18:07
well the reason that they the reason
18:08
they think they went out is because
18:10
there was a new thing that came in at
18:11
the end of the 16th century called a
18:13
peace cod belly
18:14
and what that was it was like you kind
18:16
of stuff stuff inside your
18:18
shirt like imagine you have a shirt here
18:20
you stuff it down and then it kind of
18:21
makes an
18:22
it's it makes you a little bit fatter
18:24
but then it goes down to a peak where
18:26
your genitals are
18:27
and so they're fighting over the same
18:28
real estate yes
18:30
and so they had this kind of thing but
18:32
it meant there was no space for the cod
18:33
piece anymore
18:34
and they were called women wore them as
18:36
well they were called stomachers
18:38
and sometimes there'd be a fashion to
18:39
wear a bigger stomach
18:41
and that would make you look a little
18:42
bit pregnant and then sometimes not
18:45
and the reason they were called peas
18:47
card is because they looked a little bit
18:48
like a pea pod
18:49
because they kind of tapered at the
18:50
bottom and
18:52
they were a very potent sexual symbol
18:55
and this is one of the reasons that the
18:57
phrase shelling peas became a euphemism
18:59
for sex
19:00
really yeah it did well
19:04
i mean it was in the 16th century
19:08
and some of us haven't moved on uh but
19:11
also because
19:12
um at p fields people used to have sex
19:14
in p fields as well so
19:15
[Laughter]
19:17
p's were just very sexy p's were just
19:20
very sexy in the 16th century
19:22
beds were hard to come by you know that
19:24
outfit that um you see a lot of
19:26
um in medieval uh depictions of gestures
19:30
and so on it's the two color outfit that
19:32
is
19:32
horizontal yes exactly so yellow on this
19:35
side red on this side completely down
19:37
the middle
19:38
that is called my party outfit
19:41
what do you mean we do know yeah we've
19:44
been to a party with you
19:45
i know that that's what you wear it's
19:46
great so it's it's mi so
19:49
i guess me technically and p-a-r-t-i
19:52
um me party outfits oh and is it like
19:56
it separates me it parts me no it's
19:58
probably
19:59
that's probably italian or something but
20:00
um but
20:02
probably in italian means this part's me
20:05
no i think i've no i think it's jordy
20:08
actually
20:09
[Laughter]
20:14
where's my party it feels like
20:18
it feels like if we talk about fashion
20:20
we have to talk about bo brummel who was
20:22
the creator of fashion even today so
20:26
beau brummel was the most fashionable
20:27
man at the turn
20:28
of the 19th century basically wasn't he
20:30
uh very early 19th century and
20:32
he used to take five hours to get
20:33
dressed each day
20:35
he polished his boots and i know how
20:37
does he get anything else done
20:38
polish his boots in champagne he had
20:40
three separate hairdressers
20:41
one for his temples one for his forehead
20:45
and one for the back of his head that's
20:47
incredible they must have
20:48
all d were they doing it at the same
20:50
time it's not gonna be like a game of
20:52
consequences where you do one of them
20:54
and then you have to work out what they
20:55
want after that
20:57
desperately hope they matter as well
21:00
between the temples and the top and then
21:02
the top and the back
21:03
yeah yeah yeah be very tense back there
21:05
yeah
21:06
um he also had separate um glove makers
21:09
so he had a glove maker for the palm
21:12
glove maker for the fingers and a glove
21:13
maker for the third
21:14
no you've got to have to because it's
21:16
different skills making the thumbs and
21:17
making the fingers is it very different
21:19
very different yes it doesn't feel like
21:21
it wow you don't know fashion
21:24
that's true we're gonna have to pat oh
21:25
we're gonna have to move okay basically
21:27
i should just say
21:27
rumble is the reason that you're dressed
21:29
like your dress today all of you
21:30
and uh because everyone looked absurd
21:32
until he came along they all wore these
21:34
like
21:34
powdered wigs and these big roughs and
21:37
frills and colors
21:38
and he basically said take all the
21:40
colors away all the textures what you
21:41
want is neutrally colored clothes that
21:43
are cut with precision
21:44
he banned perfume and jewelry for men
21:46
and men basically dressed like that
21:48
today that's why you're all stuck in
21:50
these yeah but then it still took us
21:52
five hours to get ready he got rid of
21:54
all that stuff and he's like but it's
21:55
still gonna take me five hours to put on
21:57
a pair of trousers
21:58
and a shirt yeah but he was exclusively
22:00
dating herring ladies who are still
22:02
shampooing her first time
22:06
okay it is time for fact number three
22:09
and that
22:09
is chozinski my fact is that the north
22:12
pole
22:13
is moving so fast that we can't keep up
22:15
so
22:16
what the next polar expedition is going
22:18
to go on indefinitely they're just going
22:20
to be running after it yeah
22:22
chasing it this is a real worry
22:25
this is the magnetic north pole we're
22:26
talking about and specifically when i
22:28
say we can't keep up our phones can't
22:30
keep up our maps can't keep up
22:32
so there's this thing called the world
22:33
magnetic model and basically this
22:36
is the model that works out where north
22:38
is and it's updated periodically and it
22:40
was supposed to be updated i believe in
22:42
2020
22:43
and then they had a quick look at where
22:45
the north pole has got to since 2015 or
22:47
something when it was last updated
22:48
and it's moved so fast they've got to
22:50
update it now because all of our maps
22:51
are wrong
22:52
and so this is announced by scientists
22:54
at the national center for environmental
22:56
information
22:57
and they said because of unplanned
22:58
variations in the arctic region
23:01
uh it's if you tried to get to
23:03
the north pole
23:04
sorry that's the part of the official
23:06
press release um
23:09
i slipped out of the quote marks without
23:11
making that clear
23:13
on the current model if you tried to fly
23:15
to the north pole using you know your
23:17
phones without the update you'd end up
23:18
25 miles away from it which is quite
23:20
fast oh i could walk 25
23:22
miles in the arctic
23:25
do we know why it's um why it's moved
23:28
no we don't know so it's always
23:30
fluctuated because the
23:31
we think it's because that this big
23:33
molten core of iron
23:35
in the middle of the earth and it's
23:36
sloshing around and so that is causing
23:38
this magnetism to slightly slosh around
23:40
but we really don't know why it's
23:41
accelerating so fast
23:43
so it suddenly started massively
23:45
speeding up over 30 years the rate of
23:47
distance moved per year
23:48
has sped up from 15 kilometers a year it
23:51
was moving
23:52
to 55 kilometers a year and now we don't
23:54
know why we don't know what's happening
23:55
in the middle of the earth
23:56
it's causing this and this is just to
23:58
make it clear this is not the
24:00
normal north pole which is the bit that
24:02
the earth spins on this is where
24:04
the mag where your magnets point i mean
24:06
i don't know who you are to label one
24:08
normal
24:10
but yeah so it's not the geographic
24:13
north pole
24:14
which is where your compass was the top
24:15
of the is where your compass is going to
24:16
apply
24:17
i believe that the magnetic south pole
24:21
is not moving mm-hmm it's moving a
24:24
little bit it's not moving as much
24:25
but it's slowly getting more out of
24:27
kilter so the opposite of the magnetic
24:29
north pole is not the magnetic south
24:30
pole
24:30
yeah with absolutely so weird it's crazy
24:33
i read that um
24:34
so you were saying that they were they
24:35
had to redo it and announce it so they
24:38
finally got all the stuff together all
24:39
the information about where the magnetic
24:41
north pole is they were about to release
24:43
the information for people who needed it
24:45
and then suddenly in america that
24:47
government shutdown happened
24:49
and they weren't able to release it so
24:50
they had to sit in limbo with the
24:52
updated information and anyone who is
24:55
you know 25 miles
24:56
closer to the north pole than they
24:58
thought was suddenly unable to access
25:00
it yeah it affected millions of people
25:03
and i think it's moving towards russia
25:06
isn't it it's currently
25:07
still in canadian territory but it's
25:09
moving up towards siberia
25:11
putin's declaring war on it well i am
25:14
i read that in 2001 russian researchers
25:17
made the world's biggest magnet
25:19
and i'm not saying that that's what
25:21
caused it
25:23
but they created a 2 800 tesla magnetic
25:27
field
25:29
by getting a massive magnet and then
25:31
doing a massive explosion around it so
25:33
it really pushed it in and this was the
25:35
biggest
25:35
magnetism that had ever been created on
25:37
earth wow wow
25:39
and i'm not saying i'm not saying it's
25:40
anything to do with that well i didn't
25:41
know we were in the business of
25:42
encouraging conspiracy theorists
25:44
what did he gain from seizing the north
25:47
pole though
25:49
[Laughter]
25:54
santa
25:56
give me that good bad list trump
26:03
um so i was looking at sort of the
26:05
history of the north pole
26:07
um and there were people really didn't
26:09
know what was up there
26:10
in the past uh because nobody uh had
26:12
been there
26:13
so um yeah um so this is related to
26:17
uh the hollow earth theory uh while
26:19
we're on conspiracy theories so
26:21
this was uh proposed by edmund halley of
26:23
halley's comet
26:24
fame in 1692 he suggested the planet was
26:27
a series of shells
26:28
inside each other because that would
26:31
explain anomalous uh astronomical data
26:33
you know when stars appear to move back
26:34
and forwards
26:35
so that was his great explanation for it
26:37
um
26:38
but this theory got taken on by other
26:40
people and it evolved and in 1812 there
26:43
was a war veteran called john i think
26:44
his name was sims
26:45
s-y-m and he wrote that the earth had
26:48
massive holes at the north and south
26:50
pole and that that was the way into
26:52
the hollow earth and that the entire
26:54
earth inside that he called them sims
26:56
holes
26:57
and he campaigned to launch an
27:00
expedition to the north pole
27:01
uh so that he could go into the sims
27:04
hulls and
27:05
explore what was on the inside of the
27:06
earth and congress voted
27:08
on funding yeah i mean they voted
27:11
against funding
27:13
yeah but hitler was obsessed with it
27:14
wasn't it hitler
27:16
yeah he he had expeditions like i think
27:18
i'm right in saying this i only know
27:20
this from reading a tie-in indiana jones
27:22
book called
27:22
indiana jones and the hollow earth but
27:24
sounds good
27:26
but in that hitler does go uh
27:29
exploring for the hollow earth
27:32
we have to have some basic standards of
27:35
acceptable sources
27:38
but they're written based on history
27:40
like with
27:41
the art of the covenant and the the
27:43
aliens just thinking back to a young dad
27:45
in his jester's costume
27:47
squatting over the cat litter train
27:49
reading hitler indiana jones stories
27:52
you know um not only is it the north
27:54
pole that we're sort of losing track of
27:56
gps wise but
27:57
australia as well whoa yeah australia
28:01
well never mind um
28:05
australia moves um a lot it's shifted by
28:08
4.9
28:09
feet since 1994. that's not so that's
28:11
not a lot
28:12
is it not well australia's massive
28:15
and four feet is not massive oh but for
28:17
a whole thing
28:18
to shift that way yeah they had a but
28:21
you're not going to get to as rock and
28:23
be four feet away and go i can't see it
28:28
anywhere
28:31
yeah good point um but i programmed the
28:34
boat to stop right at the end of
28:35
australia so we're just going to step
28:36
off the boat onto presumably
28:38
a pier that will be waiting for us there
28:42
but there was a bigger problem um i
28:44
don't know if anyone here uses
28:46
bing maps um you know you use bing maps
28:49
of course saturn uses base microsoft
28:52
it's on microsoft so
28:53
um unfortunately it turns out that i
28:56
can't believe you use bing maps that's
28:58
was genuinely not expecting especially
29:00
caused me some problems in the past but
29:01
go on
29:02
well yeah like for example if you were
29:05
looking for melbourne because
29:06
bing maps had melbourne placed off the
29:08
coast of japan that's not for the same
29:13
reason as the four feet thing
29:15
yeah this explains when we played
29:18
australia dan you were four feet away
29:20
every gig
29:21
you were just off in the wings and i was
29:23
in japan
29:26
so here's the weird thing bing maps is
29:28
updated not completely but a bit
29:30
by information via wikipedia now
29:33
obviously wikipedia
29:34
is often tampered with and in this
29:37
circumstance when they did an update
29:39
they had ingested someone who tampered
29:41
with where melbourne was
29:42
and suddenly bing maps was registering
29:44
off the coast of
29:45
japan well so bing isn't the only one
29:48
right apple maps had serious problems
29:50
so in 2012 they dropped google maps as
29:52
their provider and they went to apple
29:54
and maybe people remember there were
29:55
some serious issues for instance there
29:57
was an australian town called mildura
29:59
which was placed 75 kilometers from
30:01
where it actually was
30:03
problem is that it was in victoria and
30:05
it was sort of in the bush
30:06
so there were four separate incidents in
30:08
the space of a week where groups of
30:09
travelers
30:10
went so were hiking to this town ended
30:12
up 75 kilometers away in the middle of
30:14
the remote australian bush in 40 degree
30:16
heat
30:17
and all had to be rescued
30:20
also if you search for manchester united
30:22
football club it directed you
30:24
to sail united i think so
30:27
it's like an under-12s team or something
30:29
[Laughter]
30:31
it's for ages five and above sorry um
30:34
and it had satellite images that it
30:36
advertised this is apple maps again but
30:39
it hadn't worked out how to penetrate
30:40
the clouds
30:41
so a lot of its satellite images if you
30:43
went to look at somewhere it was just
30:44
you were above the clouds who just saw
30:46
cloud cover what a weird
30:48
football team to have a policy of
30:50
accepting anyone above the age of five
30:52
you're going to get very mixed range of
30:53
abilities
30:56
time for the final fact of the show and
30:58
that is my fact my fact this week
31:00
is that the british vegetarian movement
31:03
was started
31:04
200 years ago by a man called reverend
31:07
cowherd yeah
31:11
and this was in salford um in england
31:14
and this was 200 years ago he was the
31:17
reverend of this chapel and in january
31:20
1809
31:21
he stood at the pulpit and he made a
31:23
plea to say to all of his congregation
31:25
we need to stop eating meat
31:26
they all agreed and that was the
31:28
fundamental beginnings of vegetarianism
31:30
in the uk yeah wow and he was called
31:33
cowherd
31:35
um yes so he said that if god had meant
31:37
us to eat meat then it would have come
31:39
to us in an
31:39
edible form like a fruit so
31:42
makes sense sushi is
31:46
arguably fine but cow heard he he wrote
31:49
hymns
31:50
that were pro-vegetarianism so he wrote
31:53
one hymn called
31:54
little lamb who ate thee
32:00
amazing uh he wrote another one called
32:02
eaters of flesh
32:04
eaters of flesh could you decry our food
32:06
and sacred laws
32:07
did you behold the lamb can die and feel
32:10
yourself the cause
32:12
lo there he struggles hear it moan as
32:15
stretched beneath the knife
32:17
i mean this is pretty pretty tough stuff
32:20
isn't it that is something to rhyme with
32:21
knife because that's not a good ending
32:22
to the poem
32:23
um its eyes would melt a heart of stone
32:26
how meek it begs for life wow
32:30
because we did all just have quite a big
32:32
meaty curry before we came on stage and
32:33
i'm now feeling quite guilty as well as
32:35
sick
32:36
yeah i like um my thing
32:39
that i like about this fact obviously
32:40
it's vegetarianism started by a man
32:42
called
32:42
cowherd and i love those little name
32:44
connections when they go ante the thing
32:46
that you're talking about and
32:48
weirdly the whole setup of vegetarianism
32:51
in that period of the 1800s
32:54
was completely rife with that kind of
32:56
names that were connected to either
32:58
animals or
32:59
or meat so the key groups that formed
33:01
the vegetarian society
33:03
which eventually got in its name in 1847
33:06
um were people who were called the bible
33:08
christian church which was
33:09
what um he was a part of cowherd you had
33:12
the concordium which was a boarding
33:13
school and then you had the readers of
33:14
the truth tester journal
33:16
so concordium which was the high school
33:19
sorry the boarding school in 1837
33:21
they were located in ham common nice
33:24
that's where they were and then the
33:26
truth testers who were the
33:28
magazine that were pushing it were it
33:30
was taken over the editorship
33:32
by a guy called william horsle no one
33:35
yeah so you suddenly have horse in there
33:36
and then the uh the truth testers
33:39
um they they basically they got this
33:41
other guy who um
33:43
who wrote a very important letter who's
33:44
called william oldham
33:47
yeah so then in 1847
33:59
and so in 1847 they officially named the
34:02
vegetarian society where william
34:04
oldham was the treasurer um and horsle
34:07
was the um elected secretary and that
34:10
conference that they had to name it was
34:11
in ramsgate
34:15
when you sort of climb back to the end
34:17
it did sound like a crazed
34:18
person like we need to call a doctor by
34:21
the way for the people at home he really
34:22
did climax at the end of that
34:24
the herring of fleeing the area as we
34:26
speak it's like synchronized spawning on
34:29
the stage
34:31
well one of the other pioneers was a man
34:33
called i hate to add to dan's crackpot
34:35
theory william lamb
34:36
he was a doctor in 1815 he came up with
34:39
what he called a water and vegetable
34:40
diet
34:41
and he said it would cure acne
34:43
tuberculosis scrofula
34:45
asthma and lots of other diseases wow it
34:47
didn't i don't think it did but it
34:49
probably wouldn't have worth if you've
34:51
got this graph give it a go
34:52
yeah you know they they nearly weren't
34:55
called uh vegetarians vegetarians
34:57
oh what were they going to become so you
34:59
know there were lots of potential
35:01
pythagoreans was one of them was it
35:03
that's true that's an old one
35:04
pythagoras supposedly sorry i'm actually
35:06
meaning vegans
35:07
so vegans were nearly not called vegans
35:10
um
35:10
so in 1944 there was a member of the
35:12
vegetarian society in london
35:14
uh who was called donald watson and he
35:16
set up a new newspaper for vegans he
35:17
wanted to go
35:18
a bit further with the vegetarianism and
35:21
uh
35:22
he asked his readers for suggestions as
35:23
to alternatives and they came up with
35:25
things like
35:26
dairy ban so that would be the noun i am
35:28
a dairy ban uh
35:30
or benevole like instead of omnivore or
35:33
carnivore or benivore someone who eats
35:34
good things
35:35
or beau monger
35:39
i'm a bowmonger um so it was a big thing
35:41
in the 19th century the vegetarian
35:43
movement
35:44
it was a big thing in london and there
35:46
was one vegetarian restaurant in london
35:48
in 1878
35:49
and by the 1880s there were 52 so it
35:52
suddenly took off
35:53
but the most popular one around this
35:55
time was started by
35:56
the best real tennis player in the world
36:01
wow there's a guy called used to smiles
36:03
and he was basically
36:04
the a real so you know real tennis is
36:07
sort of like weird indoor royal tennis
36:08
precursor to tennis and he was the world
36:11
champion basically from 1898 to 1911
36:14
he was the best player in the world and
36:15
he was also obsessed with fad diet
36:17
and he was a vegetarian and he opened
36:19
this restaurant that was incredibly
36:21
popular and it had stuff on the menu
36:23
like little
36:25
acronyms on the menu like we have today
36:26
we have a v vegetarian he had
36:28
nnn which meant very nourishing and
36:32
he also had next to many of his items
36:35
fu and that meant free from uric acid
36:40
but oh obviously i love my meals free
36:43
from uric acid
36:44
i always ask free from uric acid
36:47
it was quite a big thing then because
36:49
it's of course gout but he was a bit
36:51
weird he wrote an article once about how
36:53
everyone should be able to live on a
36:54
diet of two plasmon biscuits and one
36:56
lentil a day
36:57
one lentil just the one yeah
37:01
don't overdo it wow you know in
37:03
australia you get
37:04
kangatarians oh yeah i was a terrain in
37:08
australia where are you yeah
37:09
okay so if anyone here doesn't know what
37:10
that is kangatarian is where you um eat
37:13
purely kangaroo and no other meats
37:15
and there's a there's an ethical and
37:17
moral logic
37:18
behind the idea of becoming a
37:19
kangatarian uh one is is that one of the
37:22
big problems we have with farming cattle
37:24
is the methane
37:25
the farts are ruining the ozone layer
37:27
whereas kangaroos
37:29
really emit a very very tiny fraction of
37:31
the amount that a cow does so if you
37:33
started farming them
37:34
that would be fantastic for the
37:36
environment although one of the reasons
37:37
that also it's ethical is that they're
37:38
not farmed so they're wild
37:40
they're a whole host of people they're a
37:41
massive pest aren't they they're
37:43
they're a pest to yeah i always think
37:46
pest is a subjective term isn't it we're
37:48
probably oppressed for them as much as
37:49
they are to us
37:50
but they're very hard to catch though
37:52
because they're always four feet away
37:54
from where you actually thought they
37:55
were
37:59
so there this is a whole theory there's
38:02
a guy called jackson landers who's
38:04
written a book
38:04
proposing that vegetarians who want to
38:07
be vegetarians for
38:09
uh planetary reasons but they they they
38:12
like meat
38:12
he suggested they should only hunt and
38:14
eat invasive species
38:16
so and he wrote a book where he did
38:17
exactly that so uh
38:19
he ate pigeons in new york city okay
38:22
which i think is brave
38:25
yeah there's a whole theory behind it
38:27
again i i don't like to be a
38:29
here but i always think invasive species
38:31
is a very human
38:32
term isn't it because that implies they
38:33
have a concept of nationhood
38:35
which most animals don't so they're like
38:37
i'm allowed to be in new york
38:39
the pigeons they're not they don't have
38:42
the kind of strict immigration policies
38:44
that humans have i think
38:46
at time of recording anyway
38:50
um the so on sort of stigma against
38:53
vegetarianism this is a weird thing um
38:55
there was a study by the university of
38:56
southampton and it found
38:58
that men in particular don't like
39:01
choosing vegetarian dishes when they're
39:03
with other men particularly for fear of
39:05
being ridiculed
39:06
and this study was a year long it was
39:08
called man food
39:10
um and it
39:13
the sample was small it was only 22 men
39:15
so it was not a comprehensive
39:17
city-wide thing but basically
39:20
if you even men who don't like meat or
39:23
men who find it hurts their digestive
39:25
system
39:25
or men who've been literally asked to
39:27
meet eat less meat by their doctor
39:30
all see themselves as green they want to
39:33
eat meat particularly around male
39:34
friends because they think it's sort of
39:37
cool and presumably that's western
39:43
[Music]
39:49
it's two football teams in southampton
39:51
isn't it 22 men
39:53
yeah they had a game of football the
39:56
[Music]
39:58
there was a study done in canada which
40:00
actually showed that you can calm a man
40:03
down
40:03
by showing him a picture of a piece of
40:05
meat
40:06
[Applause]
40:08
no you can't
40:23
don't worry lads chill out
40:26
if i was a general i would make all my
40:29
soldiers carry pictures of me
40:30
on their rifles on the bayonets to
40:33
completely neutralize the opposing army
40:35
it'd be like a kebab wouldn't it bonus
40:39
it's such a great idea
40:43
they what it was is that they had 82 men
40:47
sit down and an actor read out a script
40:49
to them and if the actor ever stuffed up
40:51
and as the actor was reading they were
40:53
looking at different pictures
40:54
every time the actors stuffed up they
40:57
were told to
40:58
send a loud sound to the actor to to
41:00
sort of
41:01
uh as punishment for stuffing up so they
41:04
would stuff up and they would press this
41:05
button and there would be levels of
41:06
loudness
41:07
whenever the actors stuffed up while
41:09
they were looking at a piece of meat
41:12
they decided to not really give any
41:14
punishment whatsoever okay so maybe it's
41:16
more that they're distracted by the meat
41:18
no it's it's um
41:20
according to the they they were calmed
41:23
by it i'm doing my best here
41:26
this is my study are there any
41:27
speculations as to why yes
41:29
actually this is really interesting it's
41:31
because the idea that um
41:33
men once they see meat and it's in a
41:35
cook form yeah it's so they can see the
41:37
charcoal grilled kind of
41:38
nice it's a slab all that's been
41:41
properly barbecued
41:42
but also they think it's caught like i
41:44
don't need to go hunting i don't need to
41:46
be
41:46
the man who's going to be aggressive and
41:48
stuff i can calmly eat my meal now
41:50
and again this is not my study but i
41:56
but you wasted everybody's time with it
42:01
so is reassuring them that they're gonna
42:04
get
42:04
some meat they're they're thinking of
42:06
meal time with their families they're
42:08
thinking this is a nice image
42:09
yeah yeah yeah this is a pretty picture
42:11
frame i got another thing about
42:13
um this is about veganism this time um
42:15
president eisenhower from america
42:18
his great-granddaughter thinks that
42:20
veganism is going to help us to contact
42:22
aliens
42:22
great this is actually this is
42:26
fractionally more plausible than the
42:27
last
42:28
thing you ran up the flagpole that she
42:32
said we have to understand that we are
42:33
multi-dimensional beings and based on
42:35
our frequency perceptions and vibratory
42:37
levels that we are functioning from
42:39
we are going to see different things so
42:41
that's her sorry that's eisenhower's
42:43
great granddaughter um she thinks that
42:45
meat holds us down the density of our
42:47
bodies and if we want to connect with
42:49
the higher beings um the vegetables are
42:51
going to be much lighter and
42:52
it's interesting because because some
42:53
political families you just think oh
42:55
they've got so much you know power
42:56
stored in the family they're just going
42:58
to be
42:58
in the front of politics for generations
43:01
to come i don't think the eisenhower
43:02
family is one of these families
43:04
they're never going to elect an idiot to
43:06
the president of the united states are
43:07
they
43:09
it's also not super reassuring what she
43:11
says that implies that if you adopt a
43:12
vegetarian or a vegan diet you're just
43:14
going to float away
43:16
is that the implication that's true
43:20
okay i can't believe we're ending on
43:22
that but that is
43:24
that is it that is all of our facts
43:26
thank you so much for listening if you'd
43:28

01:05
okay
01:06
on with the show
01:21
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:24
no such thing as a fish
01:26
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
01:28
live from sheffield
01:37
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
01:40
here with anacizinski andrew hunter
01:43
murray and james harkin
01:44
and once again we have gathered round
01:46
the microphones with our four
01:48
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:50
and in no particular order
01:52
here we go starting with you andy
01:55
my fact is as a child the naturalist
01:58
frank buckland
01:59
learned to differentiate different kinds
02:01
of animal urine
02:02
by taste alone
02:03
[Laughter]
02:06
how did this happen well so he was the
02:10
son of another naturalist
02:11
uh a guy called william buckland this is
02:13
with victorian uh
02:15
we're talking here 19th century and um
02:18
william buckland was an amazing guy and
02:20
uh he you know
02:22
taught his children lots and they grew
02:25
up surrounded by animals
02:26
so instead of having a hobby horse to
02:28
ride on they had a dead crocodile
02:31
okay so and as part of his education he
02:33
learned about different kinds of animals
02:35
is that so you know which pet to tell
02:36
off when someone weaves on the floor
02:38
oh yeah who did that i'm just going to
02:42
check
02:44
freddie that's a very good idea yeah
02:47
because they had loads of animals around
02:48
the house yeah like for instance william
02:50
buckland
02:50
um he was a naturalist like you say he
02:52
likes experiments he likes to do that
02:54
kind of thing
02:54
so um there was one time he was in bed
02:57
and he was thinking about fossil
02:58
footprints because they just found all
03:00
these new footprints
03:01
and he came up with an idea of how they
03:02
might be formed so he woke up his
03:04
sleeping wife
03:06
and asked her to prepare a slab of dough
03:08
in the kitchen
03:09
so he could get his pet tortoise to walk
03:10
across it so he could have a look at the
03:13
footprints that it made
03:14
it's all right that's so cool and they
03:16
so frank's at william's son
03:18
frank's house seems like it was riddled
03:20
with animals there was an account from
03:22
1877 of a journalist who went to physics
03:24
he was quite famous
03:25
and he said they opened the door and
03:27
they immediately retreated because there
03:28
was a jaguar in the doorway with
03:30
monkeys seizing its tail and denuding it
03:33
of fur
03:34
and then the butlers were like don't
03:35
worry he won't hurt you it'll be fine
03:37
um there was a jackass laughing jackass
03:41
which i think is a kookaburra their word
03:42
for kookaburra
03:43
chasing live mice up and down a glass
03:45
jar with a battalion of cats waiting
03:47
underneath
03:48
and there was a battalion and there was
03:51
a parrot that kept on calling cabs from
03:53
the front window as soon as they arrived
03:56
but apparently was equally ready to hail
03:58
an omnibus if they so desired
04:01
yeah i read a story of a guest um i
04:03
believe it was with frank it might have
04:04
been with william but um they tripped
04:06
over in the night down the staircase
04:08
over a hippopotamus
04:10
they weren't expecting yeah what yeah
04:12
was it alive or dead
04:13
it was a dead baby hippopotamus and it
04:16
was a small child and she fell all the
04:17
way down the stairs and he was like
04:19
be careful you could have damaged that
04:21
[Laughter]
04:23
it sounds like their whole life was just
04:24
incredible adventures with animals
04:26
because buckland
04:27
both bucklands really were popularizers
04:29
of science as well as
04:30
actual researchers and scientists but he
04:33
wrote lots of memoirs and lots of
04:34
exciting books which which sold
04:36
you know hundreds of thousands of copies
04:38
so for example one one account he gave
04:40
he was trying to make a cast
04:42
of a three meter sturgeon uh but he
04:44
could only borrow it for one night so we
04:46
had to do it really fast
04:47
um and he had to get it he woke his wife
04:49
up yeah
04:51
wait he did he had to he had to get it
04:52
downstairs and into the kitchen so what
04:54
he did was he tied a rope around
04:56
its tail because it was really heavy
04:57
it's three meters long he let it slide
04:59
downstairs in front of him and sort of
05:01
pulled the you know
05:02
pulled the rope towards oh my god and
05:03
unfortunately obviously sturgeons are
05:05
very very slippery
05:06
and it got away from him and it crashed
05:08
down the stairs and it smashed into
05:10
the kitchen and these are his words he
05:12
said this sudden and unexpected
05:14
appearance of the armor-clad sea monster
05:16
bursting open the door instantly created
05:18
a sensation
05:20
the cook screamed the housemaid fainted
05:22
the cat jumped on the dresser
05:24
the dog retreated behind the copper and
05:26
barked the monkeys went mad with fright
05:28
and the sedate parrot has never spoken a
05:30
word since
05:33
and we just couldn't get a taxi from
05:34
then on
05:37
well he used to chase the cook around
05:39
the house with a dead goose squeezing
05:41
its voice box
05:42
to make it squawk at her well was this
05:44
in childhood
05:45
no no as a grown-up
05:49
we should say that you've already
05:50
mentioned that these guys were uh
05:52
scientists but these were
05:53
like proper scientists these these two
05:55
guys really were
05:56
um they were um sharing notes with
05:59
darwin about ideas
06:00
they were probably famous in their time
06:03
although frank didn't believe in
06:04
evolution
06:04
no actually neither of them did but
06:06
frank especially didn't believe in
06:07
evolution
06:08
and to prove it he did a lot of
06:09
interviews with pongo the gorilla
06:12
after which he deduced that the creator
06:14
had drawn a vast line between human and
06:16
monkey
06:17
so he wasn't getting much out of the
06:18
interview i don't think i reckon pongo
06:21
went away and thought the same thing
06:22
i'm sure but he did like to eat animals
06:25
as well didn't he frank so
06:27
he deliberately moved closer to um
06:29
london zoo so that he could eat them as
06:31
soon as they died
06:32
in the zoo because he he liked to eat
06:34
animals that were all different animals
06:36
not just like
06:36
you know meat that we might do so frank
06:38
and william didn't they oh yes they did
06:40
yeah
06:41
when he was living near the zoo they a
06:42
panther had died
06:44
and so that for him was like i've never
06:46
had panther i really want to try that
06:48
so he wrote this is from his writings he
06:50
said i wrote at once to tell
06:52
his friend who worked at the zoo to tell
06:53
him to send me down some chops
06:56
it had however been buried a couple of
06:58
days but i got them to dig it up
07:01
was not very good
07:04
culinary advice no one needed
07:08
it but he kind of had also he was
07:10
obviously doing this before
07:11
lots of animals became endangered so
07:13
slightly different times
07:15
it's still gross it's still gross i'm
07:16
not saying it's not gross i'm just
07:18
but he but he there was a purpose behind
07:20
all this mad eating that he was doing
07:22
because he helped to found this thing
07:23
called the acclimatization society
07:25
and they said well um people need food
07:29
to eat they need protein
07:30
turkeys and pheasants are not native to
07:32
britain they were introduced and they've
07:34
been a
07:34
brilliant success what else can we
07:36
introduce that will
07:38
because they were worried that the
07:39
population was going up and we won't be
07:41
able to feed ourselves
07:42
exactly so they just had banquets every
07:43
year where they tried all sorts of stuff
07:45
and said what can we introduce
07:46
because after brexit we'll all be
07:48
digging up the panthers as well
07:51
okay it is time for fact number two and
07:54
that is
07:54
chozinski my fact this week is that in
07:56
the 1980s
07:58
romania lifted up and relocated dozens
08:00
of buildings
08:01
often with their residents still inside
08:04
them
08:06
so why on earth did they do that well so
08:08
this was in the 1980s in
08:10
romania and many in bucharest it was
08:12
under chao cescu who wanted
08:14
as a classic dictator fashion to create
08:16
this enormous palace for the people
08:18
which involved bulldozing basically the
08:20
entire city and he destroyed
08:22
hundreds of buildings it was very
08:24
devastating because it was a really
08:25
picturesque
08:26
town which was sort of flattened but
08:29
there were a few heroes who thought okay
08:31
rather than let him destroy these
08:32
buildings let's quickly move them
08:33
and so they got to work and they moved
08:36
dozens of almost a dozen churches and
08:37
they moved
08:38
lots of other buildings including a
08:39
hospital a bank and sometimes
08:42
whole apartment buildings which they
08:43
just move up like
08:45
pick up and shift a few hundred yards
08:47
with the people still
08:48
inside them they must have told the
08:50
people inside mustn't they they did
08:52
although there was one occasion where uh
08:54
they that people have been told that
08:55
they were going to be moving their
08:56
buildings at 9 00 a.m
08:58
and so most of the residents thought
08:59
i'll just pack my suitcases and get out
09:01
for that little period and it turned out
09:03
it was 6am so they all got up at night
09:04
looked out their windows and were like
09:06
oh my god
09:08
this was mainly one guy wasn't it who
09:09
came up with the idea um who passed away
09:12
just this year
09:13
um and um i'll uh i'll attempt to say
09:15
his name and then anna can say it
09:17
correctly after me
09:18
uh eugenio lloyd also
09:21
wow i mean you got the first letter of
09:24
his name
09:25
completely wrong it's an eye not an l
09:27
one oh
09:28
that's an eye
09:32
okay you're to chesco yeah
09:36
eugenie jordan that's who i said and
09:39
um so he he died this year very sadly um
09:42
and he got the idea for it because he
09:45
hated the idea that
09:46
these this was a rescue mission these
09:47
were meant to be demolished and he
09:49
thought that's unacceptable
09:50
a lot of these were very beautiful
09:51
churches that he wanted to survive
09:53
and so he was sitting in a restaurant
09:55
one day and he saw a waiter passing by
09:58
carrying on a tray the the drinks that
10:00
he was bringing to a table and he looked
10:01
at that tray system
10:02
and he thought that's how we could be
10:05
doing this and then he started a search
10:07
for the largest waiter in the world
10:11
yeah you sounded so much like jeremy
10:14
clarkson
10:16
uh he didn't do that he built some rail
10:18
tracks he basically put on many railways
10:20
didn't he
10:20
uh that he so he could sort of roll them
10:23
along
10:23
into their new area so if you go to
10:25
bucharest now then you can see
10:27
these old buildings sort of hiding
10:29
behind the huge ugly new soviet ones
10:31
there'll be a lovely little church
10:32
suddenly
10:34
um so the actually that parliament that
10:36
was built you know that everything else
10:38
was being demolished and moved to make
10:39
way for
10:40
um it wiped out one-fifth of the
10:42
historic center of the entire city
10:44
that's how big it is um and it took a
10:46
third of the country's budget
10:48
for several years a third of the budget
10:50
of the whole country and
10:51
uh it was so it was planned by ceausescu
10:54
but the chief architect
10:55
uh anchor petrescu uh was only 28 and
10:59
the bbc described her as arguably the
11:01
world's worst architect
11:03
oh i've seen that it's not that bad i
11:05
think it looks quite nice actually all
11:07
right yeah
11:08
and one of the buildings that they did
11:09
destroy and didn't move was
11:11
brent kovanesk hospital and the reason
11:14
they did that is quite
11:15
long-winded so um basically david steele
11:17
who was the leader of the liberal party
11:19
in in britain gave ceausescu a pet dog
11:22
who ciaucescu absolutely loved okay so
11:26
um he made the dog a corporal in the
11:28
army
11:30
i mean he was a dictator he did crazy
11:32
like that
11:34
and then they went to this hospital and
11:36
the hospital had had problems with rats
11:38
and so they got cats in the hospital to
11:40
chase after the rats and then the dog
11:42
came in
11:43
and got in a big fight with one of the
11:45
cats and then because he'd been injured
11:47
by a cat
11:48
ceausescu went i'm afraid this hospital
11:50
has to go
11:52
and the very next day the order came in
11:54
for the hospital to be demolished
11:56
all because this corporal dog had been
11:58
beaten up by a cat
12:00
at what point do you realize you are the
12:02
bad guy when you're
12:05
wow i mean this this dog was called
12:07
corbu um
12:08
he was really loved by ceausescu um so
12:11
much so that
12:12
the romanian ambassador in london used
12:14
to go to sainsbury's every week to buy
12:16
win a lot prime to send back to
12:18
bucharest in a diplomatic bag
12:21
wow yeah he was crazy um he used
12:24
and in fact the guy uh jordachesku got
12:27
permission to move all of these
12:28
buildings but chances were so impatient
12:30
to knock them down that he knocked a lot
12:31
of them down
12:32
even though they were supposed to be
12:34
moved and there was one that he wanted
12:36
to knock down but
12:37
all the workers refused to do it was
12:38
this beautiful old church i think it was
12:40
medieval
12:41
and so he had to release people from
12:42
prison to employ them to
12:44
knock down this building but his palace
12:46
was incredible
12:47
so his palace which he called the
12:49
people's palace i think or powers of the
12:51
people which is one of those ironic
12:53
titles it's union hall featured two huge
12:56
spiral staircases and that was so that
12:58
he
12:58
and his wife elena could descend
13:00
simultaneously from different sides of
13:02
it
13:03
and also he made them rebuild the
13:05
staircase twice that he was supposed to
13:07
walk down because
13:07
he was really short and very paranoid
13:09
about his height so as soon as they made
13:11
the steps a bit too hard for him to
13:13
stretch down
13:14
he was i know get rid of it it makes me
13:15
feel small wait how short was he wasn't
13:17
a borrower
13:21
there are a thousand steps to descend
13:22
one meter
13:24
that's amazing i mean that's still there
13:26
as well isn't it that yeah yeah god yeah
13:28
i've got one more factor
13:29
actually about ceausescu so yeah as
13:31
we've said not a nice guy
13:33
had 20 000 political prisoners really
13:35
just
13:36
such a bad guy um he ruled that you had
13:38
to have at least five children or face a
13:39
fine
13:40
wow i know five five but
13:44
so he has had a state visit to
13:47
britain he had a state visit to britain
13:49
in 1978 and it was a big
13:51
political thing because you know we were
13:54
trying to pry
13:55
uh pry romania away from the soviet
13:58
union
13:58
and they were kind of semi-independent
14:00
of that but anyway it was very
14:01
embarrassing and it was a you know it
14:03
was the most embarrassing
14:04
uh state visit until last year um
14:08
anyway so that you know it was awful but
14:10
during that visit is one of my favorite
14:11
and
14:12
ever anecdotes happened which is that uh
14:14
queen elizabeth
14:15
hid in a bush with her dogs to avoid him
14:17
[Laughter]
14:19
she really didn't want to have him she'd
14:21
be having a terrible time and then she
14:22
was walking her dogs in buckingham
14:24
palace gardens
14:25
and she saw him coming the other way and
14:26
she jumped into a bush amazing
14:29
he was really paranoid that people would
14:30
poison his clothes
14:32
so he only wore clothes that had been
14:34
under constant surveillance
14:37
he also um when he met queen elizabeth
14:39
he washed his hands with alcohol
14:41
immediately after shaking her hands
14:43
because he was worried that he'd been
14:44
poisoned wow what you'd have to be
14:47
pretty top level to recruit the queen to
14:49
be an assassin
14:51
it's always the person you least expect
14:56
wow just on buildings in romania yeah
14:59
the weird thing about this is
15:01
this wasn't the only instance in which
15:03
people in romania were in buildings that
15:05
were suddenly moved
15:06
so um there was also a separate project
15:10
in alba yulia which is another city in
15:12
romania
15:13
where there was this big soviet actually
15:15
apartment block
15:16
and he charges then wanted to build this
15:18
huge boulevard
15:20
and he happened to want to build it
15:21
right through the middle of this soviet
15:22
apartment block so the only thing to do
15:24
was cut it in half and shift one half to
15:26
one side of the road and one half to the
15:28
other
15:29
way um apparently it was very smooth it
15:31
took 5 hours and 40 minutes and one
15:32
woman put a glass of water on her
15:34
balcony throughout the whole thing and
15:36
none of it spilled
15:37
wow very impressive but sometimes
15:40
because they move buildings on rollers
15:41
in other countries too
15:42
sometimes yeah it's rare but it happened
15:44
so in boston in 1869
15:46
that long ago they had to widen the
15:48
street so they had to
15:50
say to the hotel on the street can you
15:52
just move back a bit
15:53
um like and it took three months because
15:56
they obviously it was the 19th century
15:58
and um
15:58
but over that time the first floor
16:01
businesses
16:01
and all lots of residents stayed in
16:03
place during those three months
16:05
and the amazing thing was that plumbing
16:07
and gas services stayed on
16:09
because they had flexible tubes
16:13
that's so cool but it's so confusing if
16:15
you're going to visit your friend
16:16
who you haven't seen for a couple of
16:18
months and you find yourself knocking on
16:19
an empty space where the door used to be
16:21
yeah
16:22
that actually happened there's a place
16:23
called hibbing in america where they had
16:25
to move because there was a mine
16:26
underneath the town
16:27
and um there was a few things that
16:29
happened so there was a
16:30
woman who went into labor in one town
16:33
and then gave birth in the other town
16:34
because they moved the whole town
16:36
wow and because they moved the entire
16:38
town house by house to this new place
16:41
they put it back not exactly in the same
16:43
way as they left it
16:45
and so people who had like grown up
16:46
there came back
16:48
you know 30 years later and they're like
16:50
i'm sure there used to be a co-op there
16:51
that's so good that's amazing it was in
16:54
a in america in 2016
16:56
um they wanted to knock down rosa parks
16:59
house
16:59
and they wanted to demolish it and no
17:01
one was really sticking up for it and
17:03
there was one artist
17:04
who said we can't let this happen so he
17:07
bought it
17:08
for 500 american and this is in detroit
17:11
and he said we we have to keep this
17:13
house so
17:14
he looked to people to to sell it to to
17:16
say
17:17
can you can you now take on the costs
17:19
and maybe we can relocate it but no one
17:21
took it
17:21
so he had to bring it home with him to
17:23
berlin
17:24
and rosa parks's detroit house was
17:27
dismantled and rebuilt
17:29
in berlin and was sitting there for
17:31
about two years
17:32
and um it went back to america and then
17:35
i think it might have to move back to
17:36
berlin because they don't want it again
17:38
what yeah this is absolutely true so the
17:40
house was completely dismantled
17:42
shipped to berlin and sat in the
17:43
backyard of this artist's house
17:46
wait why is it now having to go back
17:47
there surely if they don't want it a
17:48
second time you just gotta
17:49
chuck it away she won't mind he wanted
17:51
to get it back there so he kept saying
17:53
let's get it back there
17:54
so annoying for a woman you know who's
17:56
kind of main
17:57
claim to fame and publicity and her big
17:59
moment was not moving from a spot
18:01
[Laughter]
18:06
i wonder which is frustrating which is
18:08
the back of the bus
18:09
out of berlin and america
18:13
and we're gonna have to move on very
18:14
shortly to our next fact i just got one
18:16
little thing
18:16
yeah it's it's just that um so i was
18:18
trying to find out what the biggest
18:19
thing you can move a thing on is
18:22
so okay so do you mean the thing on
18:24
which the thing is
18:26
exactly the thing which is on top of the
18:27
thing which i'm moving the lower thing
18:29
the thing supporting the bigger things
18:30
these are all great google search terms
18:33
so it just it's just a cool thing so
18:35
nasa they have to move sometimes a
18:37
launch
18:38
tower and i didn't know the launch tower
18:39
has ever moved but sometimes they have
18:40
to drag them around
18:41
and they've got a they've got a thing
18:43
which is called a crawler a crawler
18:44
transporter
18:46
and it's massive okay so you have to
18:49
have a degree in engineering just to
18:51
drive it
18:52
um there are only four qualified drivers
18:54
on the planet um there are
18:56
there are only two of these things in
18:57
the whole in the whole world um and
18:59
you only drive it for 35 minutes even if
19:01
you are one of the drivers and then you
19:02
have to swap with someone else because
19:04
it's just so mentally exhausting
19:06
driving a nasa launch tower which weighs
19:09
uh five million kilos so it's big wow um
19:12
one gallon of petrol gets you about 15
19:14
yards
19:16
is it like a maximum speed limit of like
19:18
one mile an hour or something
19:19
yeah it's really slow so there are just
19:22
petrol stations literally just back to
19:24
back
19:25
all the way constantly pulling in and
19:28
out
19:30
and actually just one super quick
19:31
building removal in 1903
19:34
there was a mansion called the captain
19:36
samuel brown mansion in pennsylvania
19:38
and it had to be demolished because they
19:41
were building a railway
19:42
and a descendant of the original owner
19:43
said would you mind rather than
19:44
demolishing it just moving it 160 feet
19:47
up that massive cliff next to it that
19:49
would be really nice
19:50
and so they for some reason the
19:52
authorities agreed to this
19:53
and so 160 feet is quite a lot almost
19:56
sheer
19:57
cliff so they had to excavate the entire
20:00
cliff and they put these giant shelves
20:01
in it
20:02
so they put four enormous shelves and
20:04
then they lifted it up on
20:06
winches one shelf at a time that were
20:08
powered by horses
20:09
they needed 20 000 beams to do it so
20:12
pulled it up onto one shelf plopped it
20:14
down
20:14
horses had a rest pulled it up onto the
20:16
next one
20:17
and it eventually cost more than the
20:19
original house it cost to build
20:21
and then extremely soon afterwards it
20:23
was completely destroyed in a fire
20:25
[Laughter]
20:29
embarrassing very bad okay it is time
20:32
for fact number three
20:34
and that is my fact my fact this week is
20:37
when at home freddie mercury slept
20:40
in a queen-size bed
20:44
so nice to know that um this was uh
20:48
freddie mercury's
20:49
final home that he lived in it was in
20:50
london he bought it from a big banking
20:53
family called the family so he
20:54
referred to it as the house
20:56
and his partner jim hutton who was with
21:00
him for about the last seven years of
21:01
his life
21:02
and he gives a fantastic description in
21:04
this book he wrote memoir about
21:06
his time with freddie called mercury in
21:07
me uh in which he describes the top
21:10
floor
21:10
of freddie's london house which was
21:12
three rooms that were
21:13
the walls were smashed down and made
21:15
into one big room there was a big dome
21:17
and he said in the corner
21:18
was freddie's queen-sized bed and uh
21:21
yeah and do we know if it was
21:23
deliberately chosen for the word play
21:26
no i it probably wasn't it's just a nice
21:28
little detail that is skitted over as
21:30
he's describing the room
21:31
yeah yeah i have read that book as well
21:33
or i got it on kendall and then i
21:35
i've just searched through it for
21:37
references to beds
21:40
so you've read it yeah yeah the only
21:42
other reference i could find to how he
21:43
liked to sleep
21:44
was that when they went to japan he
21:46
embraced the way of life of the japanese
21:48
and liked to sleep on the floor
21:50
so he really liked sleeping on the floor
21:52
um so he but he didn't really embrace it
21:54
as far as learning the language because
21:55
he only learned two words in japanese
21:57
domo and mushy mushy which he said at
22:00
every opportunity
22:02
so freddie mercury was a very
22:03
interesting guy i i
22:05
i found that he once had a verbal spat
22:07
this is one of the famous stories about
22:09
him he once had a
22:09
verbal spat with um sid vicious from the
22:11
sex pistols
22:12
and he managed to infuriate sid vicious
22:15
by deliberately misnaming him
22:17
simon ferocious
22:21
did he have four extra teeth he did yes
22:24
that he had four extra teeth behind his
22:25
first teeth
22:26
really is that why he had such
22:28
protruding first teeth
22:29
frontiers yes it is because he used to
22:31
be called bucky balsara that was his
22:33
nickname at school because
22:34
buck toothed and he was born uh farrock
22:37
balsara he was born in zanzibar and his
22:39
parents were originally
22:41
indian weren't they and so yeah farrock
22:43
balsara bucky balsara
22:45
yeah he never got rid of them because
22:47
the worry was it would affect his vocal
22:49
cords he had such a fantastic reign so
22:51
his problem in life was do i go for
22:52
vanity or do i go for what i love music
22:54
and he went for music
22:56
so queen was very famous for having big
22:57
extravagant parties
22:59
um and there are lots of lurid stories
23:00
about you know dwarves with cocaine on
23:02
their heads and all this stuff
23:03
but roger taylor the drummer said
23:06
another thing they had at their parties
23:08
i can't believe this they had a
23:09
basically a specific party consultant
23:11
he said we had a man whose job was to
23:13
find unusual people
23:15
and in america he hired a guy whose
23:17
thing was
23:18
to lie on the ground covered in these
23:20
great big cold meat collations that
23:22
americans love
23:23
he would be completely covered by meat
23:25
and then he would shift and make the
23:27
meats move
23:29
the idea was to freak people out i could
23:32
imagine that freaking
23:33
out and he said i had a load of greg
23:35
sausage rolls on the table and suddenly
23:36
one of them wiggled around
23:38
[Laughter]
23:40
wow so just draped in salami lying on
23:43
the ground covering me and this huge
23:45
pile of meat would start
23:46
sort of writhing around i think that's a
23:49
great party trick
23:50
but surely people can tell if i went to
23:52
get me off something i think i could
23:54
tell if i was getting it off a plate or
23:56
a person
23:58
or was it so maybe it was so hard
24:00
covered in meat so covered
24:01
he was completely covered in meat i
24:03
can't that was this thing how did he
24:05
breathe did he have like a straw coming
24:06
out through the meat
24:07
he must have done right i imagine you
24:09
would have to have a straw yeah
24:11
always look out for the straw if you see
24:12
a big pile of meat yeah
24:14
or he could have had a scuba gear on
24:20
to cover the oxygen tank and the
24:22
flippers of course so
24:25
i would roll up bits of salami
24:28
and then breathe through them brilliant
24:30
yeah so do you know that the um
24:32
bohemian rhapsody the movie let's now
24:35
want all these oscars
24:36
why do you want to stop talking about
24:38
meat man
24:39
it's the single greatest party band
24:43
we've ever heard of what was i thinking
24:47
sorry
24:49
apparently there was also a woman who
24:50
offered for a hundred thousand dollars
24:51
to decapitate herself with a chainsaw
24:54
what i don't i'm not sure they had that
24:57
at the party
24:58
i don't think so that's quite a low
25:01
price for doing this
25:03
it's kind of irrelevant the price isn't
25:05
it
25:07
what's she going to spend it on maybe
25:10
some blue tack
25:16
so if i could just mention a fact
25:20
so bohemian rhapsody um we rami malik
25:23
was the
25:24
actually playing freddie mercury but it
25:26
was originally when it's been in
25:27
production for many many years in
25:28
pre-production rather and
25:30
sasha baron cohen ali g was meant to
25:32
play
25:33
freddie mercury and he got fired because
25:35
he wanted it to be the more
25:37
the meat man party kind of stuff going
25:39
on and the decapitation and they said no
25:41
we need to
25:42
do it differently but he said this
25:43
interesting thing which was he was
25:45
talking to one of the members of the
25:46
band
25:46
didn't name who um but he said the
25:49
person the band member said you know
25:50
this is such a great movie because it's
25:52
got such an amazing thing that happens
25:54
in the middle
25:55
and sasha said well what happens in the
25:57
middle of the movie and he said well you
25:59
know freddie dies
26:00
and so sasha went but what happens in
26:03
the second half of the movie then
26:06
like that's why people are there to see
26:07
it they're there to see freddie and they
26:08
said well you know
26:10
the the they then see a band that goes
26:12
from strength to strength
26:13
so the original idea was that we were
26:15
going to watch how queen
26:16
sort of became who they really were post
26:18
freddy
26:19
really yeah and i'm not sure that i mean
26:21
they've done some good things but the
26:23
only real fun thing i could find
26:25
uh in musically from brian may who was
26:27
the guitarist was that
26:28
in 2003 he set up a band with brian
26:31
blessed
26:32
um i mean here we go yeah
26:35
they were part of an animal rights
26:37
groups to protect the badger
26:39
um is it a good uh yeah yeah they were
26:42
they
26:43
they um they were called team badger um
26:45
and
26:47
yeah and they released a song uh which
26:49
was called save the badger badger badger
26:52
and um and then they formed another band
26:55
uh with david attenborough
26:56
and slash the guitarist from guns n
26:58
roses oh my god
27:00
to create a super group this is brian
27:01
may um and they were called the artful
27:03
badger
27:04
and um and they released a song
27:06
dedicated to badges called badger
27:07
swagger
27:08
i'll be honest i want to watch this film
27:11
um
27:12
in the second half freddie vampire
27:14
freddie mercury comes back but
27:15
he's got extra teeth so he's more of a
27:18
risk
27:19
but we should probably say since brian
27:21
may's on topic that um
27:23
he is a really cool guy in his own right
27:25
so he finished his thesis his doctoral
27:27
thesis maybe you guys know that he's a
27:28
physicist
27:29
um and he wanted to do physics and then
27:32
he got involved in this whole queen
27:33
shenanigan
27:34
but he went back to doing his thesis and
27:36
in 2007
27:38
then he submitted it it's a survey of
27:41
radial velocities in the zodiacal dust
27:43
cloud
27:44
and he submitted it 37 years after
27:46
starting the research which is actually
27:47
harder than most theses because you have
27:49
to catch up on the intervening 33 years
27:51
of research
27:52
which have been quite a lot but he was
27:53
studying a super interesting thing so
27:55
zodiacal light
27:56
is this it's a misty cone of light that
27:59
appears
28:00
a few hours before sunrise in the east
28:02
or
28:03
a few hours after sunset in the west and
28:06
it's what we call false dawn so we've
28:08
all kind of seen it and you often think
28:09
it's sort of a
28:10
town on the horizon or something it's
28:12
actually the reflected sunlight sort of
28:14
shining off scattered
28:16
bits of dust in the solar system and
28:17
they only worked out really what it was
28:19
a few years ago
28:20
um but yeah that's well that's what his
28:22
whole thesis is on and he just did it
28:24
very cool i preferred his team badger
28:28
stuff
28:30
okay it is time for our final fact of
28:33
the
28:33
show and that is james
28:36
okay my fact this week is that according
28:38
to people who make their livings
28:40
walking on fire and walking on broken
28:43
glass
28:44
neither is as painful as walking on lego
28:49
amazing uh this is true so um
28:52
this was an article from the smithsonian
28:54
they were talking to a guy called scott
28:56
bell who is a former fire walking world
28:58
record holder
28:59
and he now runs a company where they do
29:01
walking on fire walking on glass and
29:04
walking on lego
29:05
and he still does the glass and the fire
29:07
but he refuses to do the lego stuff no
29:10
way
29:10
and they're basically the reason is that
29:12
walking on fire as long as you do it
29:14
quite quickly
29:14
is not that bad at all because the
29:16
conductivity of the coals is not so
29:18
great
29:18
um the glass if you walk on it they
29:20
really make it very very small and so
29:22
when you step on it it kind of moves
29:24
around underneath your feet
29:25
but lego do not move at all and so and
29:28
they're really hard
29:29
and they're really pointy and i don't
29:32
need to tell you guys that it's
29:33
painful when you stand up there
29:35
and so when you're walking across them
29:36
there's nowhere for them to go they just
29:38
stay there and they just dig into your
29:40
feet and they're really really painful
29:41
and so he refuses to do it
29:43
it's such a it's a really good article
29:44
this specifically because they talk
29:46
about
29:46
how much mass lego can withstand before
29:49
it crumples or goes
29:51
and every single brick can withstand a
29:53
massive 400 kilos
29:54
before it even starts moving what it
29:57
means is that
29:57
you know that scene in die hard where
29:59
bruce willis is crawling over broken
30:00
glass
30:01
if he'd been crawling over lego that
30:02
would have been a really exciting scene
30:04
[Laughter]
30:08
just the glass bit in that article they
30:10
got that confirmation that it hurt more
30:12
to go on lego from a
30:13
a cabaret performer called bazoo the
30:15
clown spelled k-l-o-u-n so this is a guy
30:18
who juggles balls of barbed wire
30:21
and he lets people staple dollar bills
30:23
to his chest
30:24
he also walks on glass and he confirmed
30:26
lego is just
30:28
way worse yeah have you seen there is a
30:30
thing called the lego
30:31
well i think there are some crazy
30:33
youtube people who did a thing where
30:35
they did a lego treadmill challenge so
30:38
you're running on a treadmill
30:40
but people in front of the treadmill are
30:42
pouring lego from a bucket onto it
30:44
and it just looks like the worst thing
30:46
in the world that's a really good prank
30:48
to play at the gym
30:48
isn't it if you want to
30:52
so you can't you can't walk on lego but
30:53
you can't swallow it can't you
30:55
so swallowing you're basically fine
30:57
because that's why
30:58
if i need to walk into a room where a
31:00
child speed i always walk in on my mouth
31:07
this is that they put holes in the legs
31:09
of like they put sorry they put holes in
31:11
the heads of lego pieces
31:13
so that if kids swallow them they can
31:15
still breathe and in fact to really
31:17
check this is okay
31:18
there were six scientists uh a short
31:20
while ago in the uk
31:22
and australia who swallowed lego pieces
31:24
themselves to allay parents fears that
31:26
it would be a bad thing
31:27
so they all swallowed these heads and
31:30
they said that they all had different
31:31
techniques
31:32
so yeah they had to swallow their heads
31:33
and then work out how long they took to
31:35
come out the other end
31:36
and so i mean they didn't work it out
31:38
they just waited for it to come out and
31:40
that was the amount of time
31:41
well no but the working out it comes
31:44
from the search because
31:46
searching through your own feces can be
31:47
quite difficult and they said they all
31:49
used
31:49
different techniques so they used
31:50
chopsticks or forks
31:52
uh some of them squashed their poo into
31:54
a ziploc bag so that they could find the
31:57
lego piece in it if it was there
31:59
um and sorry does everyone else not put
32:02
their poo in a ziploc bag
32:04
[Laughter]
32:05
and he always hangs it on a tree as he
32:07
walks around
32:12
must be so confusing if you had corn for
32:14
dinner the night before
32:16
they actually literally said this they
32:18
said they didn't eat corn because that
32:20
would be too confusing because those
32:21
little yellow bits yeah
32:22
dan you're a born scientist
32:26
and anyway there were six scientists and
32:27
for five of them the lego
32:29
head came out within uh three days what
32:32
happened what about the one
32:33
six dead
32:36
yeah yeah but you've got a five and six
32:39
rounds no it just never came out but we
32:40
think
32:45
he didn't look in the bag properly but
32:47
they all survived
32:48
the experience because you would just be
32:49
thinking for the rest of your life
32:51
i wonder if it's still in there the face
32:55
would gradually get sadder and sadder as
32:56
it stayed in you
32:59
everything is not awesome
33:10
there is one uh awesome lego thing there
33:12
is a crab uh
33:13
who lives in a shell made of lego is
33:16
there
33:16
only one known to science but um how did
33:19
he get the
33:19
he wouldn't have built it himself he
33:22
lives at legoland
33:23
so really he's called harry the crab and
33:26
he's a hermit crab and they
33:27
they're the ones who move into empty
33:29
seashells so um
33:31
the the staff there they made him a
33:33
shell
33:34
out of lego and they gave him the choice
33:36
of lots of shells
33:37
and the lego one and he chose the lego
33:38
one really yeah and there are videos of
33:40
him online just scuttling around with
33:42
his lego house
33:44
if you work at legoland you're known as
33:46
a model citizen
33:48
nice so they call themselves that's
33:51
great that's good though isn't it
33:52
what if you employ a criminal
33:55
are you still cool than that i didn't
33:58
know where the name lego
33:59
actually came from like the origin of it
34:01
so it
34:02
means play well in danish which i think
34:04
we maybe have mentioned before
34:06
but i didn't know that it was uh the
34:08
result of a competition in 1934
34:10
by ollie kirk christensen who's the
34:12
person who basically invented
34:14
lego and he came up with a competition
34:17
to name the new company that he was
34:19
setting up the toy company
34:20
and he opened it up to lots of friends
34:23
and family and people in his business
34:24
and employees
34:25
and he offered up a bottle of his own
34:27
homemade wine
34:28
as a prize so
34:32
at the end of it the winning entry was
34:34
the name
34:35
lego and it was his own entry
34:41
cheers just i had this
34:44
weird echo in my head of you saying he
34:46
offered a bottle of his own urine i
34:47
think as we've been talking about frank
34:48
buckland
34:49
and about did i say his own name
34:54
no but homemade wine is another way of
34:55
putting it isn't it well
34:58
very true geo this is this is
35:01
just i found this quite fascinating
35:02
because i don't understand maths but
35:04
um you if you have you know what a
35:07
qualifier
35:09
how are your royal institution christmas
35:11
lecture series coming up
35:14
so if you have a um a piece of lego that
35:18
has eight studs in it
35:20
and then you had six of those the
35:22
combination
35:23
of connecting those six different pieces
35:26
to an eight
35:27
studded lego brick is over 915 million
35:31
possibilities of how you can collect
35:33
those combinations
35:34
yeah all the lego in the world could
35:37
build you
35:38
ten towers to the moon if you want to go
35:40
with nine friends
35:42
you don't need hang on each of you
35:45
climbing up one
35:46
piece of lego uh one lego tower i'm
35:49
sorry one lego tab but
35:51
is one piece wide i believe so yes yes i
35:53
would i'm not doing that i don't think
35:55
the integrity would hold
35:56
yeah i would rather have one tower ten
35:58
pieces wide yeah
35:59
and then just have people follow you
36:01
behind you that makes a lot
36:02
i'm gonna redo my architectural plans
36:05
for this you do
36:06
not understand math um
36:09
so they did a study quite recently
36:11
another one where they put a bucket of
36:13
old lego bricks inside a washing machine
36:16
and just let it run they let it run for
36:18
70 minutes of 40 degrees celsius
36:21
and they then took it out to see what
36:23
had happened and they found that some of
36:25
the bricks had just automatically stuck
36:26
together
36:27
cool this is really cool right so they
36:29
found that um
36:31
quite a lot of two bricks are stuck
36:32
together but then there were some as
36:34
many as six or eight of them had stuck
36:36
together
36:37
and what people who did this study said
36:40
now it's a bit of a stretch but they
36:42
said that it was a bit like the
36:43
primordial soup that happened at the
36:45
start of life
36:47
whoa and the building blocks of life are
36:50
like the building blocks of
36:51
lego and maybe all of the rna and dna
36:55
and proteins all came together in the
36:57
same way as lego
36:58
is isn't it yeah wow
37:01
we are all washing machine legos yes
37:05
imagine if you put a bunch of lego in
37:07
the washing machine opened it up an hour
37:09
later and there was a massive pirate
37:10
ship or something
37:13
if you did it enough times that must
37:14
happen
37:16
infinite monkeys an infinite typewriter
37:19
infinite washing machines with infinite
37:20
amounts of lego inside will eventually
37:22
form a pirate ship
37:27
we're gonna have to wrap up i've just
37:28
got one more fact about trending on
37:29
things you don't want to tread on okay
37:31
it's a fact from the news this week and
37:33
it weirdly it involves ziploc bags
37:35
um so in cheshire this week a resident
37:38
in middlewich
37:39
he was really annoyed about the amount
37:41
of dog poo around and
37:43
he's 47 he walks his dog and he decided
37:45
there was too much dog poo about
37:46
so he said i'm going to turn it into a
37:48
competition and he told the local
37:50
newspaper
37:51
i had a spare 20 pound note that i did
37:52
not need so i put it in a ziplock bag
37:54
and hid it under some dog poo
37:56
and then notified his local neighbors
37:59
community
38:00
oh my god he said i posted it on
38:02
facebook and a lot of people got back to
38:03
me the woman who found it said she had
38:05
been looking for quite a long time
38:08
i did not shake her hand
38:10
[Laughter]
38:12
shall we wrap up okay that is it that is
38:15
all of our facts thank you so much for
38:17

00:04
[Music]

[Music]
00:14
hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:18
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:20
live from brighton
00:27
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:29
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:31
murray and james harkin
00:33
and once again we have gathered around
00:34
the microphones with our four favorite
00:36
facts from the last seven days
00:38
and in no particular order here we go
00:41
starting with you
00:42
andy my fact is that babies who live in
00:45
london are more rude than babies from
00:48
the west midlands
00:51
so what do they what do the london
00:54
babies do
00:55
they come at you with a knife they
00:58
they don't say thank you and they don't
00:59
say sorry um
01:01
and this is this is a study uh by
01:03
liverpool university we studied two and
01:04
a half thousand babies
01:06
sorry it must be babies of a certain age
01:08
because they don't think any like one
01:09
month old nobody say that's true
01:11
it's all about the first words that they
01:12
learned and it turns out the babies in
01:14
london
01:14
and whales weirdly are least likely to
01:17
include the word thank you among their
01:19
first words and normally babies are
01:20
quite polite as in the word sorry crops
01:22
up
01:23
quite a lot well they're always
01:24
up so yeah
01:26
i'm not surprised
01:29
if i shut myself seven times a day i
01:31
apologize all the time as well
01:36
they've not shat themselves they haven't
01:39
gone oh
01:40
god i am so sorry
01:44
they've just gone to the toilet that's
01:46
what's yourself no that sounds
01:48
like
01:49
if i if i went to the toilet seven times
01:51
a day i wouldn't complain
01:52
no when it's in your pants it's
01:54
yourself
01:57
my son doesn't say and he's a londoner i
01:59
guess
02:01
what does he say he says no like a lot
02:04
wow yeah you'll be like can i have a hug
02:06
no it's it's really cutting actually no
02:09
is one of the more common
02:10
first words of babies and there are
02:12
quite a few babies a high percentage who
02:14
have no as their first word
02:16
say nothing else for the first three
02:17
months pretty much they just say
02:20
no no no no no like bohemian rhapsody
02:24
or too unlimited they're just like no no
02:26
no wow
02:28
yeah he just says no he says mommy daddy
02:30
and
02:31
guys i've shat myself
02:36
do we know why this is the case is there
02:39
any are they
02:40
and they're not ordered in other ways
02:41
they just don't like to say please and
02:42
thank you yeah
02:43
they're not uh i don't think they're
02:45
noticeably impolite in other ways it's
02:47
just
02:47
yeah i don't know what the reason behind
02:48
it is actually presumably their parents
02:50
aren't teaching it to them or is it
02:51
quite random what babies i don't think
02:52
babies
02:53
say the first one is just a random word
02:56
it's kind of it's gonna be a word you've
02:57
heard before i mean the um
02:59
they so i would have assumed the baby's
03:02
first word is something that parents are
03:03
attempting to
03:04
teach them exactly or is it just
03:05
something that the baby picks up
03:07
so it means that babies in london are
03:09
not hearing those words
03:10
as regularly i think that was a
03:12
suggestion anyway uh other common first
03:14
words or early words at least
03:16
include carrot cake doggy quack
03:19
banana and bird poo
03:23
wow really who's saying that a lot to
03:27
their children
03:28
is that london specifically i know that
03:29
was in this study it was all regular
03:31
things and another thing is that um this
03:33
is in all regions actually
03:34
um one of the names that children are
03:36
most likely to learn
03:37
after mummy and daddy is peppa
03:42
flat out that's my son learned that
03:44
before he said mommy and daddy
03:46
i'm not lying peppa is is love pepper he
03:49
loves pepper
03:50
yeah pepper is his hero turmeric is the
03:53
other one
03:56
[Laughter]
03:58
that's a london baby all right
04:04
they're surprisingly clever babies
04:05
aren't they they um they can count
04:07
from extraordinarily young so they can
04:10
count at five months old to an extent
04:12
which i find incredible because if you
04:13
look at a five month old
04:14
they can barely move their head and you
04:17
know they're tiny but
04:19
there was this study done which
04:20
basically showed five months old this
04:22
screen on a stage it's a big screen on a
04:24
stage and then they took out a mickey
04:25
mouse doll
04:26
and they showed it to the kid and then
04:27
they put it behind the screen and they
04:29
took out a second mickey mouse doll
04:31
put that behind the screen and then they
04:33
lifted the screen up
04:34
and if there were two mickey mouse dolls
04:36
there the kid was like
04:37
fine looked away quite quickly if there
04:40
were three mickey mouse dolls there then
04:42
the kid would stare at it for ages which
04:44
is the only way that we know if a baby
04:45
is confused or surprised or anything is
04:47
they just stare for a long time
04:48
because it's so confused because it
04:49
knows it's counted to and you reveal
04:51
three
04:52
on the other thing about them being
04:53
surprised and looking at things so
04:55
this is why peek-a-boo is such a great
04:58
game
04:58
for babies and for all of us actually um
05:02
no it's um so that basically they are
05:05
surprised when
05:06
when things they like sort of testing
05:09
there's a theory of
05:10
object permanence which is that you know
05:12
things are still there even when you
05:13
can't see them
05:14
so even if you're hiding when you appear
05:16
again it's
05:17
it's sort of surprise and confirmation
05:19
at the same time that you that you're
05:20
correct
05:21
so babies laugh more in normal peekaboo
05:24
than they do
05:25
in trial versions of peekaboo where the
05:27
adult hides
05:28
and then they reappear as a different
05:30
person that's not funny to a baby
05:34
they like peekaboo because it's
05:35
predictable yeah
05:38
so okay because they know that it's
05:40
wrong if they've
05:41
they're a different person exactly so
05:42
they're like sort of yes
05:44
standard stuff i also did not know that
05:46
um so they'd love the big bang theory
05:48
for example because it's very
05:51
basic obvious stuff
05:54
the tv show or the actual theory
05:56
[Laughter]
05:59
very obvious yeah but i did not did you
06:02
know that peekaboo is a style of boxing
06:04
see wait is this boxing where you put
06:05
your hands in front of your face
06:07
okay and then do you whip your hands
06:09
away and give the man a shot at you
06:11
no you do and then you whip your hands
06:13
out of the way and it's mike tyson there
06:14
instead
06:15
[Laughter]
06:18
it's not that you cover your eyes
06:19
because obviously that's very bad boxing
06:20
no technique
06:22
they're quite into punching actually
06:23
babies aren't they or they can they can
06:25
get quite aggressive
06:27
so this was a another study that was
06:29
done about
06:30
how our adult behavior can impact very
06:32
young children's behavior
06:34
and they did this experiment with really
06:36
young kids with like young toddlers
06:38
and what they did was they had some kids
06:40
watch an adult
06:41
beat up a punching bag clown you know
06:44
like a big toy clown
06:45
so i would have loved to have been the
06:46
adult in this experiment so the adult
06:48
got to beat the crap out of this clown
06:49
and then some other babies
06:56
so there was another clown which didn't
06:58
get beaten up where the adults just
06:59
treated it nicely
07:00
and there was another control group that
07:02
did nothing and the kids who'd seen an
07:04
adult beating up the clown
07:05
not only did they then when they were
07:07
unleashed on the clown
07:08
beat it to shreds like really attacked
07:11
it but they improvised new weapons out
07:13
of whatever they could see
07:15
to really try and make so there was like
07:16
a dark gun was left in the room and
07:18
there's some quite true
07:20
that's not improvising a weapon
07:24
picking up a dart gun yeah they didn't
07:26
build the dart gun out of a mop
07:29
an orange
07:33
maybe they maybe they did there was a
07:34
dark guy in the corner of the room you
07:35
can watch this on youtube there's like a
07:36
two-year-old kid
07:37
who goes up to the clown and holds a
07:39
dark gun to his head and starts
07:40
whispering scary stuff in his head
07:46
and then lots of people said but it's
07:47
okay it's a punching bag clown it's what
07:48
they're for
07:49
and so they repeated the experiment but
07:50
using a real person dressed as a clown
07:52
and they also beat the crap out of him
07:54
really yeah oh my god that's amazing um
07:57
actually on
07:58
um aggressiveness in children i don't
08:00
have kids so i don't know if this is
08:01
common
08:02
but i was surprised to read that they
08:04
often bang their head against the bed or
08:06
the crib
08:07
or the wall and they'll do this at
08:09
around six months of age quite a lot of
08:11
children
08:12
will just start head banging things and
08:14
apparently the reason they do it can
08:16
last up to 15 minutes
08:17
and the reason they do it is it gives
08:18
them a surge of adrenaline because like
08:21
if you get
08:21
hurt for instance you get some
08:22
adrenaline and then that helps them to
08:24
sleep afterwards because they get these
08:26
surge of adrenaline and then it gives
08:27
them a kind of a downer
08:29
apparently this is true we're cool
08:31
they're like that and from the reaction
08:32
i think
08:33
it's not a common thing i've not seen my
08:37
son do that
08:38
but apparently like because it is quite
08:40
relatively cut or you know it does
08:42
happen but whenever any parent sees it
08:43
they're like holy
08:45
right there's a thing that kids have i
08:47
haven't got any research on this i just
08:48
remember
08:49
learning this at the time when i had my
08:51
son um that
08:52
kids at the beginning they have no
08:54
separation between
08:55
what's like every their vision is quite
08:58
solid so
08:59
3d objects are not so great but one of
09:00
the things is perception of size is a
09:02
thing that they don't fully get
09:04
and then they hit a certain age where
09:05
suddenly they realize that they're tiny
09:08
and everyone else is massive and it
09:10
freaks them out they're suddenly
09:12
surrounded by giants and it's a really
09:14
traumatizing moment for kids
09:17
so you can really take advantage of that
09:20
moment
09:23
well there is this weird thing that they
09:25
that we think that they see everything
09:27
upside down
09:28
at first really yeah so you know there's
09:30
this thing where you see things upside
09:31
down
09:32
uh because that's the way the light hits
09:33
your retina it hits it in the wrong
09:35
heads it upside down and then your brain
09:36
reverses the image and you see it
09:38
you see a correct image but actually the
09:40
light enters your eyes and shows you an
09:41
upside down image
09:42
so we think that before babies work out
09:43
how to flip the images because they're
09:45
idiots
09:46
they they can't see the right way up for
09:48
the first week of their life so
09:49
everything is upside down for them
09:51
that's crazy
09:53
and also they can do mirror writing
09:55
which i only learned this recently and
09:56
to any parent i think this is quite
09:58
standard i learned it from a parent who
09:59
was like oh yeah she's at the stage
10:01
where she's doing mirror riding
10:02
she was australian um and but to her
10:05
everything did look upside down because
10:06
she was australian
10:08
true um but yeah a lot of kids
10:11
toddler age the natural way they write
10:13
is proper mirror writing like leonardo
10:15
da vinci did that we can't possibly do
10:17
naturally as humans and then they just
10:18
grow out of doing it do you make kids
10:20
that do this
10:20
yeah yeah yeah it's incredible that's
10:22
crazy um we're gonna have to move on
10:24
shortly to our next fact
10:25
um i just one small interesting thing
10:27
just on the idea of rudeness and babies
10:29
um in thailand
10:31
uh because of superstitions there's a
10:32
common thing that's done which is
10:34
you never say that a newborn baby is
10:36
beautiful you always call it ugly
10:38
so for the first it's the idea that by
10:40
calling them ugly um ghosts would be
10:42
scared away and so on
10:43
and yeah so for the first few weeks of a
10:46
baby's life
10:47
they're just being called butt ugly in
10:49
the philippines is that
10:50
no that was in thailand i don't know if
10:53
it happened in hong kong because i used
10:54
to get called definitely happened in
10:55
bolton
10:56
[Laughter]
10:58
i was a genuinely ugly baby and my one
11:00
of my best friends her mum
11:02
came to see me first person to see me
11:03
after i was born and she tells me the
11:05
story now she said i just couldn't bring
11:07
myself
11:07
to even find the words to say that you
11:09
were in any way beautiful or you were
11:11
just
11:11
you were just so ugly and the the first
11:13
thing that was said about me was she
11:14
looked me and went oh
11:16
how interesting
11:17
[Laughter]
11:20
and then you work for the company quite
11:22
interesting that's yeah
11:24
that's how it all began in her face just
11:26
on another thing on rudeness
11:28
and how rudeness can affect us so
11:30
there's lots of studies that are done
11:31
that have shown that it's extremely
11:32
infectious
11:33
in a way that we can totally understand
11:35
because what it does is if someone's
11:37
rude to you
11:37
it takes a lot of mental energy to
11:39
respond to that it's quite draining
11:41
working out your impulse control and not
11:43
punching them in the face
11:44
and then you become weaker your impulses
11:46
come weaker so therefore you're then
11:48
rude to the next person
11:50
and it's to the extent that um it and it
11:52
really damages our mental faculties
11:54
uh in various other ways so it also
11:56
makes us stupider so as soon as
11:57
someone's rude to you
11:58
it makes you stupid to the extent that
12:00
if you even read
12:02
words that sound like they're rude so
12:04
there was a study where people were
12:05
asked to read the words
12:06
interrupt obnoxious and bother don't
12:09
know how rude that is
12:10
um but after that they've performed five
12:14
times worse on a mental task so if you
12:16
were to read for instance the daily mail
12:19
yeah or watch a winnie the pooh episode
12:22
um
12:24
is that rude
12:28
okay we need to move on to our second
12:30
fact of the show
12:32
and that is my fact my fact this week is
12:35
in 17th century japan
12:37
the super rich would protect their homes
12:39
from burglars by installing
12:41
musical floorboards so
12:44
like the piano in big
12:48
yeah no this is not quite that it's um
12:50
these were called nightingale
12:52
floors and the idea was that they worked
12:54
out uh that
12:55
in japan if you had a palace and you
12:57
were worried about let's say
12:59
you're the head of the palace being
13:00
murdered by ninjas or anyone good at
13:02
creeping in
13:03
what you would do is you would have
13:05
creaky floorboards
13:06
and the creaky floorboards would alert
13:08
everyone to uh to the fact that someone
13:10
was there
13:11
now some people just have creaky
13:13
floorboards but these were specifically
13:14
designed and they were very expensive to
13:16
install
13:17
and what it was was underneath the
13:18
floorboard that was a nail that went
13:20
along a bracket and it produced a
13:22
frequency sound that sounded a lot like
13:24
a nightingale singing a song the bird um
13:27
the nightingale
13:28
bird you can see clips on youtube as
13:29
opposed to the victorian
13:37
they were all confused
13:40
so i'm glad we're clarified yeah so it
13:42
was really cool but my favorite thing
13:43
about this whole fact
13:44
is obviously there are people patrolling
13:47
the grounds of the
13:49
of the palace so what do they do because
13:51
they need to walk over these floorboards
13:53
so what they ended up doing was agreeing
13:54
on a system of rhythm
13:56
that would effectively be playing a song
13:58
as you walked and if they heard the
13:59
rhythm they'd be like oh it's mike
14:01
you know as opposed to oh wow that's
14:04
very clever they have in japan quite
14:06
exciting
14:06
sort of burglar defenders even today
14:09
they have
14:10
in shops modern day shops in japan often
14:12
have this bright orange sphere
14:14
that's next to the till if you're buying
14:15
something and what it actually is is
14:17
it's a paintball
14:18
and they're trained as shopkeepers in
14:20
japan to throw this paintball at someone
14:21
if they try to rob the shop
14:23
and the idea is that it will leave this
14:25
mark on them and then they'll be
14:26
identifiable so
14:28
just look for the guy covered in orange
14:29
paint and they probably get uh trained
14:31
in it they get told to throw it actually
14:33
at the person's feet
14:34
because then it will splash up onto them
14:36
and they're more likely to get covered
14:38
in paint
14:38
and then if you if you missed the if you
14:40
missed the rubber then you have to run
14:42
out to their getaway car
14:43
and throw the anti-crime ball at the
14:44
guard at the car instead that is
14:46
pretty cool and the police can find it
14:48
yeah i was looking at kind of
14:50
weird home innovations that have been
14:51
done because this is a cool floor
14:53
have you guys heard about the
14:54
self-seleucing house the help
14:56
the
15:00
the sleuthing house would be a house
15:02
that solved the crime after being
15:04
burgled
15:05
it would be a sherlock holmes
15:15
well yeah this was no sluicing
15:19
i don't want my house loose it's loose
15:22
it's going to explain what a sluice is
15:28
[Laughter]
15:30
so okay so it washes rinses and dries
15:33
itself
15:35
right okay so this was this was invented
15:37
in 1980
15:38
by a woman from oregon called francis
15:40
gabe and
15:41
it was basically the whole house was a
15:43
massive dishwasher
15:44
and so she there was only one of these
15:47
ever built amazingly
15:49
and she lived in it it was the prototype
15:50
and it had a she was a
15:52
genuine inventor and a true eccentric
15:54
because there was a sprinkler in every
15:55
room
15:56
so she would go around with an umbrella
15:58
and she pressed
15:59
a button in each room and it just soaked
16:02
the whole room with sudsy water and then
16:05
she pressed another button
16:06
and then a second spray would would
16:08
blast it with warm water so all the
16:09
water runs off
16:10
uh in the floor um you know through
16:12
drains and then
16:14
uh jets of warm water uh dry the house
16:18
so what did i say one air will try the
16:20
house so jets of warm air
16:24
dry the house and then it but the water
16:27
the water that runs off
16:28
through the drains goes through the
16:30
doghouse and the dog gets washed too
16:34
and where do you put the tablet
16:39
but then well like even if like things
16:41
like electronic tablets for instance
16:42
anything electronic would just get
16:44
that's true she her a lot of her life
16:45
was spent
16:46
devoted to buying new products devoting
16:50
ways to not
16:51
wash the bed or the books as well so she
16:54
had to invent waterproof jackets for
16:55
books and she had to invent a waterproof
16:57
cover for the bed
16:58
and it was more bothered that it was
16:59
worth frankly
17:01
but it did happen it was real that's
17:02
really good um did you know on floors
17:05
they used to cover floors with herbs
17:07
this is just another thing about you
17:08
know when you watch
17:09
period dramas they need to start getting
17:11
right that the first use for mint really
17:13
in this country in medieval times was
17:15
you sprinkled it on the floor because
17:16
this is when people had sort of stopped
17:17
washing a bit
17:18
late medieval tudor times and everything
17:21
stank
17:21
and so what you had was you had lots of
17:23
mint and herbs that you strewed over
17:25
floors that's really cool and like
17:26
shaken back
17:30
are they those crisps where you shake
17:31
the salt in no
17:33
admittedly that is not a 2019 reference
17:37
is this as old as these renaissance it
17:40
was what you used to do is when you
17:42
hoovered
17:42
this was in probably the 70s so even
17:44
before i was born but you would
17:46
like put this weird like almost like um
17:48
washing tablet
17:50
smell stuff on your carpet and then you
17:52
would hoover over it and it would make
17:53
it smell
17:54
exactly like this oh okay it's like that
17:56
like the 70s
17:58
the royal family had a herb strewer it
18:00
was one of the royal court
18:01
it was introduced by charles ii in 1660
18:04
and lasted for a couple of hundred years
18:06
one you know you had the groom of the
18:08
stool you had your lady in waiting and
18:09
you had your herbs through her
18:10
and they had to strew herbs all over the
18:12
floor nice amazing um i have a thing on
18:15
um sort of alternative alarm systems to
18:17
what would be
18:18
you know seen as an average one to use
18:20
uh there's this is a very weird one
18:22
um there was in um marbella there was a
18:25
lady who was um in her house and she got
18:28
robbers came in tied her up and she was
18:30
on the bed and they were stealing all
18:31
the stuff
18:32
and then what happened was is and this
18:34
is the story that they tell
18:35
they suddenly started noticing that the
18:37
woman on the bed was in a lot of family
18:39
photos
18:40
surrounding the bed and bits of the
18:41
house with the actor dolph lundgren
18:44
um who is who is in rocky iv he's the
18:47
big
18:47
russian dude quickly realizing that that
18:49
was the husband
18:50
of the woman that they had on the bed
18:52
and thought we got to get the hell out
18:54
of here right now
18:55
and they bolted for that reason that is
18:57
a really good idea isn't it if i live on
18:59
my own then i get a load of photos with
19:01
me and mike tyson
19:03
and just pretend that we're a couple and
19:06
then
19:07
it could happen and then when the um
19:10
burglars come then they'll run away yeah
19:13
but when he gets wind of that i think
19:15
you are in serious trouble
19:18
and we're gonna have to move on to our
19:19
next fact very shortly i've got one
19:21
thing about
19:21
burglars uh was is that
19:25
just sort of i liked i like the stories
19:26
of burglars being caught um
19:28
so there was in 2015 a burglar was
19:29
taunting police because they
19:31
they launched an appeal to try and trace
19:32
him on facebook and he was so cocky
19:35
that uh he wrote on facebook in answer
19:37
to the police comment
19:38
haha catch me if you can you won't see
19:40
me slipping
19:42
and then a news agency later spoke to
19:44
him and he said i've been walking around
19:45
near home so they're not trying too hard
19:47
and he was arrested later that day
19:50
that's uh just the facebook thing a very
19:52
similar thing there was a guy um who had
19:54
his house
19:55
burgled he got back and there's nothing
19:57
he can do
19:58
so he went on his computer and it turned
20:00
out that while the burglar was there he
20:01
had logged into his own facebook account
20:04
and failed to log back out oh
20:07
wow cool between 2013 and 2016 the
20:11
police in east kilbride
20:13
devon warwickshire camden and bristol
20:15
all issued warnings about secret signs
20:17
that burglars were using
20:19
and so what they would do is they would
20:20
put little signs on the floor next to
20:22
some houses
20:23
and it might be telling people that this
20:25
has already been burgled
20:26
or that a medium-sized dog lived here is
20:29
married to dolph lundgren
20:32
some one of them meant supposedly
20:34
occupants are nervous and afraid
20:37
okay but then in 2016 west mercier
20:39
police pointed out that all these secret
20:41
signs so-called were actually made by
20:43
utility companies
20:44
and the sign that they said meant
20:47
nothing worth stealing
20:48
actually meant new lamp posts to go here
20:50
[Laughter]
20:55
okay we need to move on to fact number
20:57
three and that is
20:59
james okay my fact this week is that
21:02
according to
21:02
its ingredients list pepperami contains
21:05
108
21:07
pork
21:13
that actually means pepperoni is less
21:14
good at math than a five-month-old child
21:16
[Laughter]
21:18
how is that possible i saw this in an
21:21
old copy of new scientist and apparently
21:23
actually it is true so this is more of a
21:26
recipe than an ingredients list
21:27
and basically if you're making salami or
21:30
some kind of cured meat like that
21:31
then a lot of it is through desiccation
21:33
is how it cures
21:35
so you would have a load of pork and
21:36
then you would dry it out so it would
21:38
lose a load of the water
21:39
so it is possible to use 108 kilograms
21:42
of
21:42
pork to make 100 kilograms of pepper
21:44
army so it is true a sausage can lose up
21:46
to 50 percent of its weight
21:48
during the curing process and pepperoni
21:50
are very crafty with their advertising
21:51
campaign
21:52
so in 2017 they launched a mass porking
21:55
campaign
21:56
it's weird because to me that sounds
21:57
like an enormous pr error
21:59
what's the difference wasn't it
22:03
well they were trying to supposedly
22:04
doing it to highlight the growing
22:05
pothole problem in london
22:07
and they cordoned off 100 potholes and
22:09
filled them with pepper armies
22:11
it is as tough as tarmac isn't it
22:16
weird they do they've got a strong
22:17
history in advertising so i hadn't
22:19
realized that the pepper army
22:20
man like the living creature that is the
22:23
pepper army guy
22:24
was voiced by adrian ebbinson he was
22:27
this you know big
22:28
epitome of manhood wasn't he and they've
22:30
had to review him now so he used to be
22:33
this really masculine
22:35
macho bloke oh not the pepper army guy
22:37
as well
22:38
i'm so sorry
22:43
no god i don't want to spread that rumor
22:44
about the pepper army guy no
22:46
no it's pepper on me too actually
22:55
he's he has been modernized because of
22:58
arsenal
22:58
he's known a tuxedo he's just a
23:01
dedicated pork man
23:02
they're just making him have less
23:04
innuendo and macho behavior to cater to
23:06
a younger generation less
23:08
tolerant of 90s culture dried meat
23:12
[Laughter]
23:14
so dried meat is pretty much the old one
23:16
of the oldest meals we know about
23:18
existing
23:19
so ertsy the iceman uh long-standing
23:22
friend of the podcast
23:23
uh and a dead mummy found in the alps
23:27
uh one of his last meals was goat jerky
23:30
and so it's amazing how they found out
23:31
so they you know they found him frozen
23:34
up in the alps
23:35
you know very well preserved not
23:36
perfectly preserved uh he's a mummy
23:38
but um they they thought we could find
23:41
out what he was eating and his stomach
23:42
wasn't where it should have been
23:44
so his stomach was pushed way up under
23:45
his ribs because it moved a bit in the
23:47
five thousand years since he died
23:49
um so they had to defrost him for a bit
23:51
because he's normally
23:52
kept on ice to keep him that way and
23:54
then they had to use an endoscope to
23:56
pull out these blobs
23:57
from his stomach and intestines and they
24:00
had to analyze that and found out that
24:01
it was dried
24:02
strips of goat meat and that was one of
24:04
his last meals wow that's amazing
24:06
and it's so well preserved you could
24:08
probably re-eat that couldn't you
24:12
jerky jerky lasts forever yeah it's
24:15
amazing
24:16
on uh no okay it's just me
24:20
it's amazing your funding biz keep being
24:22
turned down isn't it anna
24:23
reason for wanting to study ice man
24:25
jerky sounds nice
24:28
um just on this is kind of salami pepper
24:30
armies like salami and
24:32
did you know that salami brought down
24:34
the people responsible for the biggest
24:36
diamond heist of all time
24:38
they were foiled by a piece of salami
24:40
this is in 2003
24:42
and basically it was this group of
24:43
robbers who broke into the vaults two
24:45
floors beneath the antwerp diamond
24:46
center and they stole a hundred
24:48
million dollars worth of like diamonds
24:50
and jewelry and all of that it's the
24:51
biggest heist ever
24:52
and uh they didn't know how to get them
24:54
whatever but in the area there happened
24:56
to be a guy
24:57
living there who always had people
24:59
dumping rubbish on his land and he used
25:01
to get really angry about it and
25:02
constantly calling the police and
25:03
whinging about it
25:04
so he called the police the next day
25:05
after this big diamond heist and said oh
25:07
i'm really annoyed i've got rubbish on
25:08
my land again
25:10
uh there's all this that well there's
25:11
some salami for a start someone's
25:13
chucked salami on my land and there's
25:14
also some diamond center envelopes which
25:16
could someone take away and the police
25:17
went somewhat
25:18
uh okay and it turned out the heist guys
25:22
had gone they'd robbed all this
25:23
stuff and then they'd eaten some salami
25:25
sandwiches earlier that they hadn't
25:26
finished
25:27
and then they just tossed them in the
25:28
ground and they found these sandwiches
25:30
and they did the dna tests
25:32
and they traced it back to the guy who'd
25:33
eaten them wow and then they said they
25:35
found the guy who'd eaten the salami he
25:37
rested the pig
25:39
so unfair
25:44
[Laughter]
25:46
not only that they found the main guy
25:48
who done it who was this guy called
25:49
notar bartolo
25:51
but then they went to his house and they
25:53
found the salami receipt
25:54
from the butchers where he'd got it so
25:56
then they went to the butchers and they
25:57
could tell by the receipt what time it
25:58
had been bought they checked the cctv
26:00
and they also then found the guy who'd
26:02
bought it
26:02
so there you go two birds one salami
26:06
that's so cool amazing just on pigs you
26:09
know that some
26:10
people have the ability to if they're if
26:12
you give them a plate of pork and they
26:14
start eating it
26:15
tell you the gender of the animal oh
26:17
come on yeah what
26:18
it's a genuine thing it's all to do with
26:20
a um receptor which is called andresta
26:23
stone
26:24
and and that's not how you say it um
26:27
so now that we've got that out of the
26:28
way let's do the right version
26:30
androstenone it's a steroid similar to
26:33
testosterone and it's found in male pigs
26:35
and there are certain people who are
26:36
able to detect that
26:37
way more than other people now most
26:39
meats weirdly if a pig is castrated
26:42
then that thing that andextratron
26:46
gets gets knocked down and so you can't
26:49
usually tell however
26:51
the the european union are going to say
26:53
that castration is inhumane so a lot
26:55
more people who have this will be
26:56
able as they eat to go i'm i'm sorry
26:58
eating a mess a nice
27:00
taste no it's a horrible taste so these
27:02
people are just
27:03
not going to be able to eat meat anymore
27:04
exactly they're tasting well no they'll
27:06
have to ask for
27:06
specifically female pigs to eat you
27:09
can't do that in a restaurant
27:10
yeah yeah you can't like say take these
27:12
sausages back and bring me a male one
27:15
no but it's true it's a genuine thing
27:17
amazing yeah it and it tastes horrible
27:19
so they that's why they do get rid of it
27:21
as well that's amazing do you know what
27:22
the longest salami ever was
27:24
uh no well it was a salami but you know
27:26
how long it was
27:27
have a bash five five thousand meters
27:31
five thousand
27:35
there isn't room for that anywhere no
27:37
one's got five kilometers of space
27:39
to put a salami in yeah but for a picnic
27:41
you could have it for a picnic
27:43
well if you wind it round no if you had
27:45
a very very long picnic and a very
27:47
there's open spaces
27:49
if you had if you're having it on a
27:51
runway at an airport
27:53
you could take the salami exactly well i
27:56
mean
27:56
it's it's still long it's not that long
27:58
but it's 1
28:00
152 meters and 16 centimeters
28:03
that's a long bit of music that's an
28:04
extremely long salami because down guess
28:06
5 000 meters we're all thinking oh it's
28:08
not 10 miles is it
28:11
it was made by a belgian company called
28:13
cox fresh
28:18
that was founded by a belgian man
28:21
in 1935 called charles de
28:25
and in 2016 they renamed cox fresh
28:28
charles which i think is sensible
28:32
very wise do we know what happened to
28:34
the salami that they made
28:35
um no i don't i imagine they sliced it
28:38
up
28:39
and then at it story checks out
28:43
and you said that like the end of the
28:45
bedtime story
28:47
and they all laid it up okay son good
28:49
night
28:51
what do you mean no
28:51
[Laughter]
28:55
stop banging your head on that thing
28:59
here have a nice clown to kill
29:02
um there was a this is just another one
29:05
that you'll like james because it's very
29:06
immature fact
29:07
um in taipei there was taipei was named
29:10
the world design capital
29:12
in 2016 and to celebrate they had
29:14
literally a massive sausage party
29:16
it was at the taiwan design center and
29:20
they made it all completely sausage
29:21
themed so it featured a smoky scented
29:23
sausage mist that descends upon visitors
29:25
as they enter
29:27
that sounds quite nice doesn't it really
29:30
i'm so glad we picked brighton home of
29:32
vegetarianism to bring these facts
29:35
they had a sausage festoon chandelier
29:38
very classy
29:39
and then some sausage carnival games and
29:41
the whole sausage fest was put together
29:43
by a designer called alice wang
29:49
we're gonna have to move on should we go
29:50
for it yeah okay it is time for our
29:53
final fact of the show
29:54
and that is chozinski my fact this week
29:58
is that baby songbirds have
29:59
inbuilt nappies this is great they don't
30:03
need pampers they've already got them
30:05
within themselves literally they're
30:07
called fecal sacks
30:09
and they are for particularly common
30:10
quite as good branding as pampers is it
30:15
they need to work on their pr strategies
30:17
uh it's most common in pasarein birds
30:19
which are basically songbirds so birds
30:21
like robins and bluebirds
30:23
and that it's basically it's only for
30:24
nestlings so it's only when they're
30:26
babies and they're in the nest
30:27
and you can't leave your poo just all
30:29
over the nest because that's very
30:30
unhygienic
30:31
and so what the little nest things do
30:34
when they need to go to the
30:35
is they turn their rear end towards
30:37
their parent they point their ass out
30:38
their parent
30:39
and they eject this white bag of poo
30:41
that's encased in a mucous membrane
30:44
and they eject it at the parent which
30:46
flies away and disposes of it
30:47
it's incredible yeah that's really cool
30:49
they sometimes eat it they sometimes eat
30:50
it as well yeah
30:52
for a really cool reason right it's well
30:55
no because sometimes
30:56
the baby has not digested everything
30:58
inside it so what you are effectively
31:00
getting
31:01
is like a package dim sum of just
31:06
it's just like a capsule and you take it
31:09
in and so the birds get a lot of
31:10
nutrients from it because yeah it's not
31:12
fully digested yeah but and also the
31:14
other advantage is
31:16
if you swallow it or indeed if you take
31:18
it away it means that no predators will
31:20
will find it because it smells and it
31:22
would it would attract predators
31:23
otherwise
31:24
yeah allegedly it comes with a handle no
31:26
it doesn't it does it comes with a
31:27
little handle
31:29
wow that's amazing like a briefcase
31:33
yeah or a plastic bag or yeah anything
31:36
with a handle really is what it is
31:39
and do they can they slap their beak
31:41
through the handle it doesn't feel like
31:42
it's going to be that good
31:43
i think they grab the handle with the
31:44
then they take it away although they
31:46
have to do a lot of it because
31:47
every baby bird produces one fecal sac
31:49
every hour throughout the day
31:51
so a lot of the parents job is just
31:52
distributing this stuff all around away
31:54
from the nest
31:55
to you know trick predator or to avoid
31:57
predators that's the other reason for
31:59
eating it is so that they don't have to
32:00
leave
32:01
because they're lazy no no no as in as
32:03
in you're immediately disposing of the
32:04
evidence
32:05
that would draw predators so quickly eat
32:08
the poo of your child
32:09
and then that's though there's no kids
32:11
here you know
32:12
you can't you know what even when
32:13
surrounded by muggers i would not
32:18
most muggers don't track their victims
32:20
by sniffing out their babies feces
32:23
we've never heard of police give it out
32:25
going well fortunately the potential
32:26
victim ate his own
32:28
[Laughter]
32:32
bluebirds have been seen festooning
32:35
fence posts and utility poles with these
32:37
fecal sex
32:38
wow like a dog walker might do with a
32:40
dog poop oh cool
32:43
no one's sure quite why they do that no
32:45
we don't know it could be to say that
32:46
this is my territory for instance
32:48
or it could be like they're claiming
32:49
they were going to walk back that way
32:51
and put it in a bin
32:53
and then they forgot yeah i think
32:55
blackbirds do this as well
32:56
and i've found that there's a blackbird
32:59
in tibet
33:00
it's the tibetan blackbird um and that
33:03
that's as like a species it's a species
33:07
called the tibetan blackbird but it's
33:08
latin name is turdus
33:10
maximus
33:14
well they're turdus turdus crows aren't
33:16
they
33:17
the brushes yeah yeah very turdy
33:21
um the great hornbill is another bird
33:23
that does exciting stuff with pooh
33:26
so this is they look very cool they've
33:28
got big bills uh
33:29
they hang around in like india southeast
33:31
asia that part of the world
33:32
and they do a cool thing when they're
33:34
rearing their chicks which is that they
33:37
build themselves a little prison the
33:39
mother basically goes into this big
33:41
hollow
33:41
in a large in a big fat tree trunk so it
33:43
builds a big hollow and then she seals
33:45
up the whole opening with her own feces
33:47
so she makes plaster out of her feces
33:48
she closes them all in to the completely
33:51
trapped and she creates this tiny little
33:53
slit
33:53
in the feces and that is where her mate
33:56
the father will come and deliver food
33:58
to all of them so they have to sit
33:59
inside this prison fragrance that make
34:01
delivers food through this little
34:02
letterbox
34:02
and it's also where she has to avoid the
34:04
feces of her chick so
34:06
every time one of the chicks poos then
34:07
they have to squash out this letterbox
34:10
and then yours are receiving food
34:11
through the same entrance which isn't
34:13
very hygienic at all
34:14
people have been doing that in my
34:15
letterbox as well i'm not sure
34:20
yeah sadly i don't know if they migrate
34:22
all the way to north london so
34:23
it could be another explanation i was
34:26
looking at a
34:27
bird that benefits from other animals
34:28
poo um so
34:30
there's a vulture in egypt called the
34:32
egyptian vulture
34:34
and amazing
34:37
well do they get these names
34:39
[Laughter]
34:42
and so what it does is it goes to cow
34:45
dung
34:45
and it finds the yellow bits of cow dung
34:48
and
34:49
it starts eating it and sort of
34:51
scrubbing its face inside
34:52
and the reason for that is it's helping
34:54
its beak to go to the brightest yellow
34:56
that it can go so it's effectively a
34:57
sort of makeup that it puts onto itself
35:00
but sort of sort of actually enhances
35:02
the yellowness anyway of their beak like
35:03
a
35:04
exfoliating kind of thing and is that a
35:06
to attract mates um didn't read that far
35:08
in the article but yeah i
35:09
imagine um uh yeah it is yeah we we both
35:12
did read the article
35:13
great so it's the carotenoids inside the
35:16
um
35:16
inside the poo which makes them go more
35:19
orange yeah
35:20
and it is to attract mates sexy everyone
35:23
loves a sexy orange beak
35:24
did you know that you drink some
35:27
dinosaur urine
35:28
every day yeah it goes with my 70 000
35:31
year old beef jerky
35:35
um this is i this is i think being
35:37
calculated that dinosaurs were around
35:38
for 186 million years
35:40
basically they had time to drink so much
35:42
that almost all
35:43
almost every single molecule of water on
35:45
the planet has at some point been
35:46
through a dinosaur's kidney
35:48
so cool so that's the cool thing you can
35:50
think next time you're having a
35:52
glass of water we should talk i think
35:55
we're talking about bird poop it feels
35:56
like we talk about guano
35:57
okay the most yeah we agreed to quit uh
36:00
guano is
36:01
basically has held up the peruvian
36:02
economy for about 200 years so
36:04
when you say held up you mean it
36:05
supported it rather than delayed it it
36:07
supported it
36:08
yes so this is bird poo and it is
36:11
specifically and burpee isn't extremely
36:13
useful fertilizer you probably know you
36:14
spread it on your fields um
36:16
so it's exported worldwide and a huge
36:19
percentage comes from peru
36:20
and that is because it has booby
36:22
pelicans and
36:23
guane cormorants who produce the best
36:27
guano
36:27
and it's because they have 80 of the
36:29
world's anchovy and this feeds them up
36:31
and basically there are a few little
36:32
islands that are just covered in it that
36:34
get harvested for their poo the whole
36:36
time so there's this one tiny island
36:38
guana peso where there are only two
36:41
guards allowed to live on it one of them
36:42
has been living on it for 13 years he's
36:44
the only person allowed
36:45
and he's there to fight off anyone who
36:47
wants to steal the bird poo
36:49
and then i think it's the case that it's
36:51
only like every 10 years that suddenly
36:53
hundreds of harvesters are allowed to
36:54
come and scrape it off the rocks
36:56
and sell it then they have to go away
36:58
and wait for it to read
37:00
there are birds living there as well as
37:01
in their constantly deposited constantly
37:03
leaving it there yeah
37:04
yeah they're not shipping it in these
37:06
islands are incredible some of them are
37:07
covered like 200 feet deep in poo
37:10
whoa and the guy is actually living on
37:13
the island
37:14
yeah lives there the whole time he does
37:16
say he misses his
37:17
family
37:20
um so america passed a law in the i
37:22
think the late 19th century which
37:24
legally allowed it to seize any island
37:27
which had guano on it
37:28
because it was so important and when you
37:30
say legally it was according to american
37:32
rules
37:33
it was yeah but in in 15 years britain
37:36
imported two million tons of guano
37:39
yeah with just whole thousands of ships
37:41
just full of guano
37:42
yeah uh bringing you know and fertilizer
37:44
yields rocketed yeah yeah
37:46
it was most of their income peru's
37:48
income for about 40 years was that
37:51
um and there was a guy there's a guy we
37:53
mentioned sometimes called william
37:54
buckland who's a naturalist
37:55
and he was around at the beginning of
37:57
the 19th century and he once pranked his
37:59
oxford college
38:00
using guano so it was in about 1804 he
38:03
got
38:04
hold of some of this which is pretty new
38:05
then and he
38:07
spread it on the grass in the main um uh
38:10
lawn of his college uh by night he
38:12
spelled out five letters
38:15
and that grass grew incredibly
38:17
powerfully
38:18
go on which lessons do you think you
38:19
spelled out what was that was it just
38:21
guanos
38:22
guano yes yes it was it's not the best
38:25
reveal i've ever had
38:28
i'm in i'm kicking myself for building
38:30
it up to be a big
38:31
you know yeah but then it grew
38:33
incredibly strongly up saying guano and
38:35
it's sort of super grass as it were
38:37
really very cool that's where the band
38:39
got the name isn't it
38:43
you know that and um there's a theory
38:45
that uh in
38:46
antarctica that in order for penguins
38:48
when they're about to go into breeding
38:50
season the way they need ice to be
38:52
melted in order for them to have a nice
38:53
patch
38:54
they all get together and they poo the
38:56
ice away
38:57
yeah so they all stand and huddle and
38:59
they all go for it and then the heat
39:02
the heat of the boom melts the ice and
39:04
then yeah that's the thing to say this
39:05
is a theory or
39:06
yes no no no they definitely do it the
39:09
thing is that we don't think they do it
39:10
intentionally
39:11
exactly so it's a theory that they're
39:13
doing intentionally that is like
39:14
the scene in alien resurrection where
39:17
i'm sorry to go all
39:18
film nerdy here but the the aliens all
39:20
kill one of the other aliens because
39:21
they've all got acid for blood
39:22
so to make their escape from the lab
39:24
they're in they deliberately kill one
39:26
and then it burns through the floor
39:28
of the room that they're in and that's
39:31
what the penguins are doing yeah
39:32
like that is kind of what they're doing
39:34
it's almost exactly the same as what the
39:36
people
39:36
they don't think they're using their
39:38
bodily fluids to get through a floor
39:40
surface that film's not going to do
39:42
nearly as well if they're just
39:43
on the flies
39:46
aliens squatting over anybody
39:51
i found another um and there's a beetle
39:54
which is called the three-lined potato
39:56
beetle and
39:57
in order to protect it from um it's from
39:59
uh
40:04
you don't know do you yeah
40:08
so it's a beetle um
40:11
and no one knows where it's from but
40:13
it's um
40:16
and uh so what it does is it has a big
40:18
problem with uh predators obviously like
40:20
all beetles it's uh constantly
40:22
um predatored on and it has
40:26
professors slow down
40:31
but no please don't slow down you know
40:34
that theory we mentioned earlier that
40:36
the more you
40:36
people are rude to you the stupider you
40:38
get
40:41
you're saying we've been shooting
40:42
ourselves in the foot really haven't we
40:43
over the years
40:44
five years at five years in there's
40:46
almost nothing left
40:47
you brought this on yourselves um yeah
40:50
so it basically in order to protect
40:52
itself it eats toxins and then the
40:54
toxins are
40:55
pooed out and then it grabs the poo and
40:57
it smothers its back
40:58
in the poo so it means that no animal
41:01
would ever eat it because they would die
41:03
from the poison of it
41:04
um and but then weirdly there's a
41:05
symbiotic relationship with an ant
41:07
that eats that but then protects the
41:09
beetle as a trade-off
41:11
so wow so no one's going to eat it but
41:13
it's never going to get a shag is it
41:15
really that's because there's not a way
41:17
to attract people
41:18
you're smearing poo on yourself that
41:20
it's it's not a controversial statement
41:22
i don't think so um we we need to wrap
41:26
up guys
41:26
can i just give uh just because this is
41:28
a bit about nappies bird nappies just a
41:30
thing i learned about human nappies so
41:32
people toilet train their kids
41:33
differently all around the world and i
41:35
was reading about a few of the different
41:36
countries the ways they do it so
41:38
in 2012 a study looked at vietnam and
41:41
found that all the mothers they looked
41:42
out there
41:43
trained their kids to wee on command
41:45
when they whistled
41:46
they made it so that they looked for
41:48
them very awkward at a football match
41:53
it was very clever so the mothers
41:54
basically when they saw that baby like
41:56
it was gonna
41:56
weigh or poo then they'd take it to the
41:58
toilet hold it over the toilet or the
41:59
potty and they'd whistle while they
42:01
pooed and it's a bit of a pavlovian
42:02
thing
42:03
where the babies were eventually trained
42:04
to wee only or poo only when their
42:06
mothers whistled
42:07
and so they could just schedule their
42:09
poos in it's
42:10
terrifying power that your mother will
42:12
hold over you though in later life
42:16
[Laughter]
42:21
you bring someone home that your mum
42:22
doesn't like she can just
42:24
embarrass you royally in front of them
42:27
mind you
42:27
as a woman in the hashtag me too what a
42:29
great way to deter wolf whistlers
42:35
they're not going to do that for long
42:39
okay that is it that is all of our facts
42:42
thank you so much for listening if you
42:43
would
42:44
like to get in contact with any of us
42:45
about the things that we have said over
42:46
the course of this podcast
42:48
i can be found on my twitter account uh
42:50
which is at schreiberland andy is on
42:52
at andrew hunter and james at james

42:58
account which is at no such thing or our
43:00
website no such thing as a fish.com we
43:02
have everything up there from our
43:04
previous episodes to upcoming tour days
43:06
that is it that is all of our facts
43:08
thank you so much we'll see you again
43:10
bryden
43:10
good nigh

=275
00:13
hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
this week coming to you live
00:21
from oxford
00:28
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:31
sitting here with anna chazinski
00:33
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:36
and once again
00:37
we have gathered around the microphones
00:39
with our four favorite facts from the
00:40
last seven days
00:42
and in no particular order here we go
00:45
starting with you andy my fact is
00:48
that hippos sometimes poo into rivers so
00:51
much
00:51
that all the fish downstream die
00:56
this is such cool science
00:59
this is yeah not if you're a fish yeah
01:01
if you're a fish this is a horror story
01:03
if you're a fish it's true
01:04
um so quick shout out to the scientists
01:06
who did this uh the team who did this
01:08
with scientist chris dustin and amanda
01:09
subuluski
01:10
and hippos poo a lot into rivers
01:13
basically pooing
01:14
is one of the main things that hippos do
01:16
and they do it they do it for
01:17
you know all sorts of purposes
01:19
communication and
01:21
mostly to get it out of their bodies
01:23
mostly for pooring purposes but uh it's
01:26
technically called organic matter
01:28
loading
01:28
that's what i call it
01:32
surely it's unloading uh it depends what
01:35
you're if you're loading the river
01:37
oh yes yeah yeah no i don't know you're
01:39
right you're right well i'm not sure i
01:40
am
01:43
but um so they eat a lot of grass and
01:46
they eat it uh
01:47
at night because it's cooler when
01:48
they're out of the river feeding and in
01:50
the daytime they wallow in the river to
01:52
stay
01:52
cool um so this was on a river called
01:54
the mara between kenya and tanzania
01:56
there are 4 000 hippos living in this
01:58
river and
02:00
these hippos deposit 8 500 kilos of
02:03
waste
02:03
every day into quite a short section of
02:05
river
02:06
and it turns into this huge sludge at
02:09
the bottom of the river
02:10
and then in the dry season the river
02:11
shrinks and dries up a bit
02:13
but then when it rains this massive
02:15
tidal wave of
02:16
hippo poo gets churned up and all of
02:19
this sludge gets washed down and it
02:21
doesn't have much oxygen in it because
02:22
of all the bacteria
02:23
which have been you know consuming the
02:25
poo so the water the oxygen levels in
02:27
the water
02:27
plummet all the fish die so it's bad
02:30
news if you're a fish
02:31
yes but it's good news if you're
02:32
something that eats fish and don't mind
02:34
a little bit of pooey aftertaste
02:36
yeah yeah you're definitely sending that
02:38
back if you're at a restaurant
02:40
the fish looks great it's just the hippo
02:43
all over it
02:46
so things like stalks vultures
02:47
crocodiles hyenas
02:49
they eat these fish really quickly once
02:51
they die off
02:52
and actually the the researcher says if
02:55
you weren't there to see it you wouldn't
02:56
know it was happening because it happens
02:57
so quickly that they come and eat all
02:59
this stuff
03:00
there's a really good way of the
03:01
nutrition cycle almost happening through
03:03
through
03:04
the um ecosystem they have to the
03:06
researchers who did this it was in kenya
03:07
wasn't it
03:08
um and they couldn't do it themselves
03:11
they couldn't go and analyze the poo
03:12
themselves because hippos are very
03:13
dangerous they're the most dangerous of
03:15
the large mammals
03:16
in the world actually in africa so they
03:18
kill estimates seem to vary between 500
03:20
and 3 000 people in africa every year
03:22
but so the brazilians didn't really want
03:23
to go near that so they sent in some
03:25
boats
03:26
and they got advice from a masai guide
03:29
who said disguise your boats as
03:30
crocodiles
03:31
and so they disguised their boats as
03:33
crocodile heads
03:34
which weren't around collecting data on
03:36
their poo that's amazing because they
03:38
get along quite well hippos and
03:39
crocodiles
03:40
they do um but actually it's a bit of a
03:42
relationship that seems a bit skewed
03:44
towards the hippo
03:45
um in that the crocodile just needs to
03:47
be a bit passive when it comes to a
03:49
hippo and them interacting i've seen
03:50
footage of a baby hippo using the back
03:54
of a crocodile
03:55
basically as a teething ring just to but
03:58
they do sometimes eat hippo babies it's
04:00
quite bold for it to be chewing on a
04:02
crocodile as a ring because
04:04
they do occasionally flip around and
04:06
swallow a baby which i imagine doesn't
04:07
happen with a natural baby's teething
04:09
ring so this
04:10
is very rarely um i feel like you'd have
04:13
a very strong case
04:14
yeah there's a few products on amazon
04:16
with one star reviews going
04:18
i ate my kid
04:23
it's actually what brought down toys
04:24
around isn't it but um yeah in this case
04:29
it's because the
04:30
the children obviously they could take
04:31
on it's when a mother is
04:33
babysitting near a crocodile and they're
04:35
watching the biting going on so the
04:37
crocodile has to just put up just take
04:38
it because they're like i i don't want
04:40
to start anything here i think i've read
04:41
that a hippo can bite a crocodile in two
04:43
which doesn't sound plausible but they
04:45
they're very very powerful they're very
04:47
strong jewels don't they they can easily
04:48
snap a boat into if they want to
04:50
like you know not a cruise ship but a
04:52
rowboat or something yeah
04:53
um just back to the organic matter
04:56
loading
04:57
thing so they they the thing they do
04:59
which is really communicative with other
05:01
hippos
05:02
um is that they use their tail as a
05:03
propeller and they spray it over a very
05:06
wide area
05:07
spray that poo they spray the poo over a
05:09
wide area because their tail is going
05:10
round and round and round like a
05:11
propeller
05:12
like hits in the fan isn't it it is
05:14
exactly that
05:16
that's it yeah they do seem to spray it
05:18
around willy-nilly
05:20
and they use it for flirting don't they
05:21
they're spraying so um they
05:23
both both sides both genders flirt with
05:25
their feces so the males will mark their
05:27
territory with this big spray of poo
05:29
which they can spray a couple of meters
05:30
with their tail
05:31
and then the female if she's impressed
05:34
will respond by turning round to face
05:36
him with her ass
05:37
so to not face him and to and then
05:41
she'll do the whizzing the poo wizzing
05:43
and it's called submissive defecation
05:46
do you know that hippos can't get
05:47
cholera and they think that one of the
05:49
reasons is because they throw their poo
05:51
around so
05:52
much so i surmise if humans start
05:54
throwing their poos around
05:56
eventually thousands of years and
05:58
millions of deaths
05:59
yeah you'll have humans who are covered
06:01
in poo but can't get cholera look
06:03
no one's saying that it's going to be
06:04
great it's like brexit no one's saying
06:06
that it's going to be great to start off
06:08
with
06:09
but eventually the colour is what
06:12
because it moves the pooh far away from
06:14
them well because they have a lot of
06:15
contact
06:16
to the um the bacterium or whatever if
06:18
they could get color earth they'd be
06:19
dead
06:20
is that right so they've got some sort
06:21
of immunity yeah okay
06:24
because they do eat it as well don't
06:25
they so god really
06:27
babies eat their mother's feces because
06:28
they have that unfortunate thing which
06:30
some species have where babies are born
06:31
without any functioning
06:32
intestines they don't have any live
06:34
bacteria in their insides
06:36
the only way they can get that is to eat
06:37
their mother's poo so as soon as they're
06:39
born
06:39
they've got to stop chowing down on that
06:42
um
06:46
we briefly mentioned hippo testicles
06:48
before but i found out just a little bit
06:50
more about them so i thought it's a we
06:52
should return to that wellspring um
06:54
so there's a great article in discover
06:56
magazine which is headlined why it's
06:58
nearly impossible to castrate a hippo
07:00
so the pro first of all you've got to
07:03
get pretty close to it
07:04
that's true yeah i can't do that with a
07:06
remote-controlled crocodile shaped boat
07:08
although you won't be able to use the
07:09
jaws
07:11
yeah but it's a bit they are a problem
07:14
in some places obviously because they
07:16
are a bit of a pest
07:17
um they're very prolific breeders as
07:19
well so they can produce 25 calves in 40
07:21
years
07:21
so before you know it you've got loads
07:23
of hippos um so
07:25
the problem with castration as a you
07:28
know
07:28
to spread it across you know loads of
07:30
hippos in a pest area
07:31
is that their testicles are hidden
07:33
inside their bodies
07:35
um and there's a paper in the journal
07:37
theriogenology
07:38
which names all the difficulties in
07:40
castrating hippos number one
07:42
the is apparently discreet um
07:46
i've used that excuse
07:50
it's just being polite um
07:54
and also the testicles are not in the
07:55
same place from one hippo to the next
07:58
so they can vary by up to 16 inches
08:00
between different animals
08:02
so if you cut in trying to remove the
08:03
hippos testicles they're not there
08:05
so a game of pin the testicles on the
08:07
hippo could lead to
08:09
pretty much stick a pin anyway you're
08:11
correct yeah
08:12
um but and the problem is that they can
08:14
retract further during surgery which
08:16
we've said they can retract them further
08:17
into their body they can flee
08:19
the surgeon's knife um and also it's
08:22
very hard to anesthetize a hippo i mean
08:24
there are so many problems
08:25
yeah just don't do it don't do it don't
08:26
castrate them although they are a pest
08:28
as you say and they are particularly
08:31
oppressed
08:31
of course in colombia right so this
08:35
hippo is known for really hanging out in
08:36
africa but pablo escobar in colombia had
08:39
this zoo the pablo escobar massive
08:41
colombian drug lord obviously was shot
08:42
in 1993
08:44
left behind his massive menagerie of
08:46
weird animals
08:47
and they got rid of most of them but
08:49
people didn't notice at the time i don't
08:50
think that he had a bunch of hippos
08:52
living in his lake
08:55
didn't spot him didn't spot him they
08:56
looked like rocks
09:00
so and they've bred and it was
09:02
eventually everyone's attention was
09:03
drawn to this in 2007 so he died in 1993
09:06
2007 fishermen started like you know
09:09
calling the local
09:10
council or whatever it is um and reports
09:12
my fish tastes a bit like hippo
09:19
sales have really plummeted no they kept
09:21
calling up and reporting creatures with
09:23
tiny ears and huge mouths
09:25
and they genuinely didn't know what they
09:27
were these people and they were hippos
09:29
and so now there are about 60 of them
09:31
that are just living in this tiny area
09:33
in the rivers and lakes and apparently
09:34
you'll be in this nearby town and you'll
09:36
see a hippo just wandering down the road
09:38
wow scary it's very exciting it's very
09:41
scary um we're gonna have to move on
09:42
in a second um i've got i found an
09:45
interesting thing
09:46
the first pharaoh of the united egypt
09:50
was killed by a hippo he was called yeah
09:53
king meneze and we only know it from a
09:54
single line as far as i can tell
09:56
by a historian called manatho who just
09:58
simply wrote menez was the first king he
10:01
was snatched and killed by a
10:02
hippopotamus
10:03
and nothing else we don't know we don't
10:05
know the circumstances we don't know
10:07
what he was doing at the time
10:08
what a legacy yeah we do know what it's
10:11
like to be
10:12
swallowed by a hippo or to half
10:14
swallowed
10:15
because there was a guy a few years ago
10:16
called chris broughton who was
10:19
on the zambezi and basically he said
10:22
before he knew it
10:23
he was inside a hippo he said i was
10:25
aware that my legs were being surrounded
10:27
by water but my top half was almost dry
10:30
i seem to be trapped in something slimy
10:32
there was a terrible
10:33
sulfurous smell like rotten eggs and a
10:35
tremendous pressure against my chest
10:37
my arms were trapped but i managed to
10:39
free one and felt around my palm pass
10:42
through the wiry bristles of the hippo's
10:44
snout
10:44
it was only then that i realized i was
10:46
underwater trapped up to my waist in his
10:49
mouth
10:49
wow it's not amazing that we know what
10:51
that's like and then he managed to get
10:53
himself he wriggled as much as he could
10:54
managed to get free
10:55
and there were people there who could
10:57
drag him away wow
10:59
so his arm was going up through the
11:01
hippo's airwaves and out of its nose
11:03
yeah no through the mouth he had didn't
11:05
reach further into the hippo
11:07
and then back out through
11:10
i thought he was coming up through the
11:12
nose out of the nose he climbed he
11:14
clambered his way out of the ear
11:15
in the end thank god he didn't go
11:18
through the anus he would have been
11:26
propelled
11:28
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:31
that
11:32
is chozinski my fact this week is that
11:34
there are monks in india who avoid going
11:37
out in the rain
11:38
in case they splash through puddles and
11:40
upset the microbes in them
11:42
and these are jain monks and people who
11:45
follow jainism so you know jane's the
11:47
people who basically don't believe in
11:48
harming
11:49
any living creature and this goes right
11:51
down to all bacteria which basically
11:53
live in everything and on everything
11:55
and so as soon as the monsoon comes
11:56
you're not allowed to leave your house
11:58
if you're jane because that you might
12:00
immediately be killing stuff because
12:01
they believe that these
12:03
tiny creatures which they called negoda
12:05
and they believed in
12:07
hundreds thousands of years before we
12:08
even discovered microorganisms
12:10
they believed that these tiny creatures
12:12
existed sort of everywhere in puddles in
12:14
damp environments
12:15
and if you touch them then they're going
12:18
to get upset
12:18
even die and so they can't go out in the
12:20
room if you hurt them in any way then
12:22
you go to hell
12:23
is that the idea or um you just won't be
12:25
reincarnated i don't think as well as
12:27
you might have
12:28
it's not as bad as hurting a human which
12:30
is a higher being but
12:32
it's still not ideal so these guys are
12:34
the ones who
12:36
sweep the streets so that they don't
12:38
stand on any
12:39
like insects and stuff is that yeah when
12:41
they wear masks so they don't inhale
12:42
them
12:42
and they don't go out at night because
12:44
you men someone said they don't go out
12:46
at night
12:46
because um you got the light's not good
12:49
enough and so you can't see what you're
12:50
eating and so
12:51
you might think you're eating a piece of
12:53
bread but it could be a bunch of small
12:54
insects
12:56
which i'm no gourmand but
12:59
i think i can tell the difference it's
13:02
incredibly
13:03
hard life being a jane um so jane
13:06
monks uh you know it's an older sister
13:09
religion of buddhism
13:10
so they're very very very keen to avoid
13:11
the pleasures of the flesh
13:13
um extremely keen so buddhist monks
13:15
shave their heads
13:16
jain monks pluck out their hairs one by
13:18
one in a deliberately painful ceremony
13:20
um buddhist monks beg for their food
13:22
jain monks are not allowed to beg
13:24
they're not even allowed to beg they
13:26
have to there's a hand gesture you can
13:27
make
13:28
a bit like they arch their right hand
13:30
over their shoulder which i think is
13:31
like this
13:32
it's kind of like the beginning of i'm a
13:33
little teapot
13:36
and that's to show hunger but they
13:37
cannot directly ask for food
13:39
oh really yeah and then but then if you
13:41
do that gesture then people do sometimes
13:43
give you something don't they yeah
13:44
people say that's
13:45
oh he's hungry yeah yeah because there
13:46
is the thing there there are basically
13:48
two main variants of jainism and one is
13:50
called de gamba and one is
13:52
fetamba and the digambars are the
13:54
skyclad or naked chains and they are not
13:57
allowed to own
13:58
any material possessions and this is if
13:59
you really strictly adhere
14:01
um so this is the monks and the nuns uh
14:03
so they have to be naked
14:04
all the time if they're those monks
14:06
because you're not allowed to own
14:07
clothes
14:07
uh because they're material possessions
14:09
and that causes stuff you can have an
14:10
iphone though can you
14:12
obviously you can have an iphone where
14:13
would you keep it
14:16
let's not go into that could you rent a
14:19
tuxedo for example because then you
14:20
don't own it you don't own it you're
14:22
just renting it oh yeah
14:23
but how would you pay for it good point
14:25
no money
14:26
i don't know if tuxedo rental existed
14:28
3000 years ago when they sort of
14:30
founded it so maybe they've updated it
14:32
but those ones can't even own a bowl so
14:34
they have to
14:35
ask for water by cupping their hands and
14:37
then it all slides through their fingers
14:38
before they can drink it i think they're
14:40
allowed to drink from gods aren't they
14:42
are they i think so yeah i think one
14:44
sectors are the other sex
14:46
i believe so wow well because the other
14:48
sects um
14:49
which are allowed to wear clothes is
14:51
still only allowed to wear white aren't
14:52
they
14:53
this thing about how they don't want to
14:54
hurt any animals um this
14:56
um if you look back in the in the
14:58
stories of their history
14:59
there were 24 jane ford makers they were
15:02
the prophets who kind of started the
15:03
whole thing
15:04
and one of them was so bothered about
15:06
not harming anything at all
15:08
that before he was born he floated
15:10
perfectly still in his mother's
15:12
womb sending not so much as a ripple
15:14
throughout the amniotic fluid to avoid
15:16
harming his mother
15:18
wow so thoughtful they're the epitome of
15:21
thoughtful
15:22
they're what we all should strive
15:23
towards yeah so some of them wear a mask
15:26
to stop uh inhaling insects but there's
15:27
controversy about the masks because
15:29
some people say uh that it's a good
15:31
thing to wear a mask because
15:33
the breath from your mouth is hot and if
15:35
you don't wear a cloth you might scorch
15:36
microscopic beings in the air
15:38
kind of like godzilla um
15:42
kind of he didn't wear clothes either he
15:44
didn't wear clothes but
15:46
um so some people say that if you do
15:48
wear a cloth
15:49
uh that might be a bad thing because
15:50
there's your breath is moist
15:52
and that might give rise to
15:53
microorganisms in the cloth um
15:56
so and then there will be more living
15:57
and dying because of you breathing
15:59
so they'll die when you handle it so
16:01
problem it's a tight rope isn't it that
16:02
you've got a walk
16:03
and it's slightly tougher for women
16:05
although i will say i think they have
16:06
much more egalitarian views than a lot
16:08
of mainstream
16:09
religions and generally they're kind of
16:10
great but they do have this slight thing
16:12
where
16:13
if you believe in the naked jainism the
16:15
sky clad chains
16:17
then women can't quite attain proper
16:20
enlightenment uh proper nirvana and that
16:23
is because
16:23
women can't be naked because it's
16:25
inconvenient for them apparently i don't
16:27
understand why it's more inconvenient
16:28
for women to be naked than for men to be
16:30
naked
16:30
seems equally inconvenient but also so
16:33
one woman can't be naked because
16:34
it's inconvenient and two women can't be
16:36
naked because they are intrinsically
16:38
harmful
16:39
and this is actually
16:43
based in the understandable belief that
16:46
women's periods
16:47
kill loads of creatures as they happen
16:49
so as
16:50
and i don't know what it i think maybe
16:52
they think it's just
16:53
i've never seen that body farm advert
16:59
well that was the idea menstruation was
17:01
basically the death of thousands and
17:02
thousands of these tiny organisms
17:04
and so you couldn't quite achieve
17:05
nirvana as a woman but you could come
17:07
still quite close
17:08
um i've got a tangential fact about uh
17:10
jainism and it's
17:12
it's actually to do with a lot of
17:13
eastern religions so we may have
17:14
mentioned before the
17:15
swastikas are quite big in hinduism
17:17
buddhism and jainism and they're big in
17:19
jainism
17:19
and i found out in the course of
17:21
researching this i didn't know this in
17:22
the year 2013
17:24
and in fact a few years since then there
17:25
was a a day
17:27
called learn to love the swastika which
17:30
was aiming to rehabilitate the swastika
17:33
because it's an ancient it seems to be
17:35
working
17:36
seeing a lot more of it these days it's
17:39
going
17:39
really well but to raise awareness of
17:42
the symbol and its history as a peaceful
17:44
symbol
17:45
tattoo artists around the world offered
17:47
people free swastika tattoos
17:49
this is true this happened and there
17:52
were lots of articles about it and there
17:53
was a report from the journal
17:55
international
17:56
which said this when a bb journalist
17:58
questioned one of the tattooists about
17:59
the probability that neo-nazis might
18:01
take advantage of the event
18:02
the latter answered that even if that
18:04
was the case these people will leave
18:05
with a symbol of love on their body
18:09
you've just got to let some things go
18:11
don't you i think
18:12
you've got to leave the swastika behind
18:14
there was a guy in america
18:16
that i read about years ago who um was
18:18
went through world war ii
18:19
and he lived in i believe it was ohio in
18:22
america whose name
18:23
was adolf hitler and he refused to
18:25
change his name he ended up becoming
18:27
famous for
18:27
people going you know people
18:29
interviewing him saying why have you not
18:30
changed your name from adolf hitler
18:32
and his response was uh i'm not going to
18:35
let one guy
18:39
ruin the good name of adolf hitler
18:43
um just a microsoft distraction just on
18:46
microbes
18:47
um i was looking up um lots of stuff
18:50
about microbes because of the puddles
18:51
and microbes in them
18:52
did you know that oregon has an official
18:54
state microbe
18:57
no i didn't know that what is that it's
18:59
baker's yeast
19:01
because it's very important to craft
19:04
brewers and craft
19:05
bakers if they exist but lots of states
19:08
have discussed having a
19:10
state microbe and i think so far
19:12
oregon's the only one which said well
19:13
they've got the best one haven't they
19:15
they've got a good one there are other
19:16
good ones um so wisconsin
19:18
proposed in its parliament uh
19:20
lactococcus lactis which is very crucial
19:22
for cheese production because you can
19:23
have cheese in wisconsin but that didn't
19:25
get through
19:26
um hawaii suggested a bacterium uh which
19:29
was found on a native shrub
19:30
but then there was a rival camp who
19:32
wanted a different state microbe
19:34
and was a huge argument in the hawaiian
19:35
parliament about some people said no we
19:37
want this one which lives in a symbiotic
19:39
relationship with a squid
19:40
and all the people all the people who
19:42
wanted the shrub ones said yeah well the
19:43
shrub lives in hawaii is it native to
19:45
hawaii and the squid lives everywhere
19:47
the squid one is vibrio fish scary isn't
19:49
it i love that microbe they should
19:50
definitely have gone without
19:51
the other one actually oh here we go all
19:54
right let's take this outside
19:55
on the bush are they good in such a
19:58
massive row that they scrapped the whole
19:59
thing
20:00
do we think america hasn't got its
20:01
priorities straight
20:03
it feels like they've got bigger fish to
20:04
fry um we're gonna have to move on very
20:06
shortly
20:07
can i just talk about how you can kill a
20:08
microbe if you really want to yes
20:10
yeah because there are pain in the ass
20:12
and antibiotics are struggling and so
20:14
people have been really looking into how
20:16
else we can kill microbes and they're
20:17
quite hard to squash
20:18
so actually this is something that james
20:20
probably have got wrong because they're
20:22
so small obviously they're
20:23
like a thousandth of a millimeter that
20:26
you can't they'll get into a crevice
20:27
before you can probably squash them
20:29
so there's a scientist called elena
20:31
ivanova and she works in australia
20:33
and she's worked really really hard to
20:34
create surfaces so smooth
20:36
that bacteria would just slide off them
20:38
without being able to hold on
20:40
but some of them can still cling on so
20:43
that's failed and she was really
20:45
panicking about what i don't know how to
20:46
kill these microbes
20:48
they're still clinging to my sliding
20:49
surfaces and so she wrote to another
20:51
scientist and asked if he had any ideas
20:52
and he said
20:53
try the cicada wing and whatnot but she
20:57
got a
20:57
cicada wing so you know cicadas they uh
21:00
took her wing off
21:01
and it turns out that if you put a
21:03
bacterium onto the wing of a cicada
21:05
it gets punctured all over spills all
21:07
its guts out
21:08
little bacteria guts and it leads to a
21:10
quick death and gecko's skin is even
21:12
better
21:13
it's really really it is hard to kill
21:15
them and it's really hard to kill them
21:16
by stamping you can do it if you really
21:18
put a huge amount of pressure on you
21:20
can't kill a bag
21:22
you can if you press food there's a
21:23
process called pascalization and if you
21:25
press food with 87
21:26
000 pounds per square inch right you
21:30
can make all the bacteria go pop i'm now
21:32
coming to your restaurant
21:35
we serve extremely flat food at
21:37
extremely competitive prices
21:39
um how heavy is that sorry 87 000 pounds
21:43
yeah it's a lot it's more than all four
21:45
of us put together okay
21:46
it's a lot more yeah buy some margins
21:49
but it depends how we
21:50
arrange it right so if i was wearing one
21:53
stiletto shoe and you all climbed on my
21:55
shoulders
21:56
then i think that that might be enough
21:58
uh concentration
21:59
of weight if we were all hippos
22:02
and that yeah but it's it's not a good
22:04
idea to do it so science abc they looked
22:07
into it and they said
22:08
stomping around your house in a bid to
22:09
sanitize or sterilize your floor is a
22:11
bad idea
22:13
honestly you don't want your family to
22:14
see you and think you've lost your mind
22:19
okay we need to move on to our next fact
22:21
it is time for fact number three and
22:23
that is my fact
22:24
my fact this week is that during the
22:27
second world war
22:28
while american pilots were flying over
22:30
enemy territory
22:32
not only were they shooting at that
22:34
enemy but they were
22:35
also often making ice cream at the same
22:37
time
22:39
how were they doing it it wasn't they
22:40
weren't just churning it while they were
22:42
no exactly so this this was a big thing
22:44
during world war ii that i'd
22:46
never read about before ice cream was
22:48
massive for the troops it was
22:49
it was to help them with calories and
22:51
sustenance and it was a food that got
22:52
banned by most other countries britain
22:54
for example banned ice cream
22:56
during the war yeah as a sustenance as a
22:58
rationing thing
22:59
basically because it's sugar and we
23:01
don't need to use all that sugar yeah
23:03
exactly they suggested a carrot on a
23:04
stick
23:05
as an alternative um that didn't go down
23:08
the carrot is the stick what what's the
23:11
point of shoving a stick up a carrot
23:12
just so it looks like an ice cream
23:14
i'm just saying that carrots can be used
23:16
as a stick because carrots don't melt in
23:18
the same way that magnums do
23:19
yeah you would have been court-martialed
23:21
at this point mate
23:24
just stick with the program it's a waste
23:26
of sticks
23:28
surely we need sticks for the war effort
23:31
do you know weaponry had come on
23:36
all in the stick battalion follow me
23:39
so what this was is that um they were
23:42
constantly making ice cream in very
23:43
creative ways during the war and one of
23:45
the things that they discovered is that
23:46
you could take
23:47
a sort of drum put all the ingredients
23:49
inside of it and attach it to the back
23:51
of a plane
23:52
so as you flew over you were reaching
23:54
about 30 000
23:56
feet up in the air very cold up there so
23:58
you had the coldness
23:59
to make it freeze but also the vibration
24:02
of the engine the machine
24:03
gun going we're churning all the ice
24:05
cream products around
24:06
so by the time that you'd sort of you
24:08
know down some enemy planes and landed
24:10
back on your aircraft
24:11
uh in the ocean you could go and have a
24:14
big scoop of ice cream off the back of
24:15
your
24:17
there surprise a guy called um jay
24:19
hunter reinberg who was
24:20
one of the first people maybe the first
24:22
person to do this uh and the first time
24:24
he put the ice cream too close to his
24:26
engines so it couldn't get cold enough
24:28
and so it's a bit like goopy they still
24:30
let it of course but then the second
24:32
time
24:32
it he flew um 33 000 feet
24:35
over palau and so he went high high high
24:38
enough so it was really really cold
24:40
and the good advantage of that is number
24:42
one it meant that the ice cream froze
24:43
but number two it meant that none of the
24:45
japanese aircraft could shoot him
24:47
because he was so high
24:48
and so they just kept shooting at him
24:49
and the bullets couldn't reach him so he
24:51
was just like watching it all going on
24:53
below him
24:55
wow yeah i kind of didn't realize how
24:57
easy ice cream is to make
24:59
i haven't tried it i have just read
25:00
about it still so maybe it's not yeah it
25:02
sounds
25:03
at the moment it sounds like you need a
25:04
plane
25:07
imagine if you got your pilot's license
25:09
just for that
25:10
but you can i was reading a like there
25:12
was a thing in the new yorker
25:14
by someone who said she went to a
25:15
friend's house and the friend said for
25:17
dinner
25:17
and the friend said great who's for ice
25:19
cream for pudding and everyone was like
25:21
yeah great
25:21
um and so the friend went away and she
25:23
came back and she had one
25:25
ziploc bag and then another much larger
25:27
ziploc bag
25:28
and basically she filled the small
25:30
ziplock bag with vanilla extract and
25:32
sugar
25:32
and then she closed that and then inside
25:34
the larger one she filled that with ice
25:36
and salt and salt
25:37
is the crucial ingredient for making ice
25:39
cream isn't it um and then she shook the
25:41
bag about a bit got tired passed it
25:43
around the table so it's quite a fun
25:44
past the parcel kind of dinner party
25:46
experience and um
25:47
by the time it got back rounded that's
25:49
ice cream but it's because ice and salt
25:51
makes an endothermic reaction so it
25:53
sucks all the heat out of
25:55
your ziploc bag with vanilla in it this
25:57
doesn't sound like a great party i have
25:58
to say
26:01
so um just uh other things that during
26:03
world war
26:04
ii they used ice cream for the us navy
26:07
so in order to get ice cream to a lot of
26:09
people um they had a lot of
26:11
of the navy ships that were out and
26:12
about there was one specific
26:14
ship which they spent a million dollars
26:16
converting at the time
26:17
which was effectively an ocean ice cream
26:21
factory
26:22
and it just that's all it did it created
26:24
ice cream it could do
26:25
10 gallons every seven minutes and it
26:27
would just go to various different navy
26:29
ships
26:30
and deliver them ice cream yeah wow
26:33
i was just looking at that amount that
26:34
it could do it's the equivalent of doing
26:36
one ben and jerry's tub
26:37
every five seconds wow did it need to
26:40
only be
26:41
in extremely rough seas all the time to
26:43
turn it up uh no because you've got the
26:45
engine kind of going around the
26:46
propellers and stuff like that yeah
26:48
it was still powered by the engine yeah
26:49
and also the enemy could always hear it
26:51
coming because of the chimes
26:54
it was a flawed system yeah but there's
26:57
reports apparently of
26:59
these boats these ships that when they
27:01
were attacked by the japanese if a
27:02
torpedo hit it there are a few accounts
27:04
of sailors before they were abandoning
27:06
ship and jumping overboard running to
27:08
the bit of the ship that had the ice
27:09
cream
27:10
scooping as much as they could into
27:11
their helmets eating that and then
27:13
jumping off so just a quick you know
27:16
bowl of ice cream before
27:17
that was in that was in the uss
27:19
lexington which had a lot of ice cream
27:21
on board wasn't it yes
27:22
yeah this is i should just very quickly
27:24
say i've gotten a lot of this
27:25
information from the atlantic
27:27
online the ocean yeah
27:30
i speak to oceans um just on
27:33
you mentioned chimes just now james so
27:35
um there used to be
27:37
i didn't know this in the uk i believe
27:38
250 000 ice cream vans
27:41
and as i say that that sounds insane
27:43
today there are fewer than 2
27:44
500 and one of the main threats to them
27:47
is can you guess
27:48
uh the sun yes yes
27:52
i kind of i guess yeah children growing
27:55
up
27:56
yeah but more come to replace them that
27:58
doesn't make sense yeah exactly yeah
28:00
is it um the health code people
28:03
yeah all these are really good answers
28:05
but there's one thing
28:06
that's you haven't mentioned yet double
28:08
glazing
28:10
because you can't hear the chimes if
28:13
you're double glazed
28:15
in 2017 the head of the trade body the
28:17
ice cream association
28:18
by the way awesome said that new homes
28:21
are so energy efficient they've got
28:22
double sometimes even triple glazing and
28:24
children might not
28:25
hear a van right outside their house
28:27
when it's playing a chimes so they
28:28
launched an app for smartphones called
28:30
van toot
28:32
which alerts you on your phone with an
28:35
electronic jingle if there's an ice
28:37
cream van nearby
28:38
it's really cool that's so cool in the
28:41
1980s in glasgow there was an ice
28:44
cream war between two gangs who were
28:46
selling drugs and stolen goods from ice
28:49
cream vans
28:50
oh yeah so it's really a drugs war
28:54
no james said it was done from ice cream
28:56
vans well the um
28:58
it was quite serious actually but it was
29:00
all in the news and everyone was
29:02
having to go at the strathclyde police
29:03
because they weren't solving all these
29:05
crimes
29:05
and the local newspapers called the
29:07
police the serious
29:09
chimes squad oh they should have they
29:12
should have called for magnum pi
29:17
very strong so you know
29:21
the the jingle so the jingle used to be
29:23
before it was playing music
29:25
it used to be a man shouting hokey pokey
29:28
um
29:29
because it's really cool that is the
29:31
italian for o
29:32
chippoke so it's a bastardization of
29:34
that and oche poke means oh
29:36
how small i have heard that a few times
29:43
because they about a tenth of italian
29:44
immigrants in the 1890s
29:46
were selling ice cream weren't they yeah
29:49
i think about 10 well about 10
29:50
with vendors and they were basically all
29:52
ice cream vendors and so that came about
29:54
but in the 19th century
29:55
so the ice cream wars is not the first
29:57
time it's been associated with
29:58
vice because in the 19th century ice
30:00
cream parlors
30:01
became a very big thing this is
30:03
especially in america and
30:05
it was because women basically weren't
30:08
really allowed to go to places on their
30:09
own unless they were chaperoned
30:11
and this started becoming more and more
30:12
of a thing as the century progressed so
30:14
you'd turn up to a restaurant they'd be
30:15
like where's your chaperone
30:16
and then they'd kick you out and so they
30:19
sort of came up with ice cream parlors
30:21
which became a place that women were
30:22
allowed to hang out by themselves
30:24
and they were called parlours to kind of
30:26
mimic the homey
30:28
cozy life that we ladies desire
30:31
and but they of course
30:34
turned into hotbeds of vice immediately
30:37
so there was all this disapproval
30:38
because it was thought that without
30:40
formal chaperones
30:40
women were just turning up and keeping
30:42
awful company and like
30:44
going out with really bad men and there
30:47
were rumors about ice cream
30:48
drugged with passion exciting vanilla
30:51
and
30:52
lots of there was a one one journalist
30:54
who wrote i think in the new york times
30:55
that he went into an ice cream parlor
30:57
and he saw a man and woman deep in
30:59
conversation who were
31:00
evidently man and wife though not each
31:03
other's
31:05
it's amazing that uh vanilla was so
31:08
because that's the shittest of all the
31:09
flavors
31:10
these days isn't it very raunchy back
31:12
then yeah yeah i love the uh i'll have a
31:14
hornetto please
31:16
nice you could say yeah you could you
31:18
could
31:21
we're gonna have to move on shortly
31:23
before cornets they used to sell ice
31:26
cream
31:26
in penny licks and these were little
31:28
this was in london and they used to sell
31:30
them in little glass
31:31
they're like glasses but they're a
31:32
little bit bigger and they're almost
31:34
like sun that what you put sundays in
31:36
what they would do is they would give
31:38
you your penny liquor put ice cream in
31:40
it
31:40
and then you would return it to them and
31:42
then they'd give it a quick wipe
31:43
and then put some more ice cream for the
31:45
next person yeah to do it sometimes not
31:47
even a wipe right
31:48
it was that was bad for the bacteria and
31:50
that is why ice cream cones
31:52
kind of became quite popular wasn't it
31:53
yeah because they were banned in 1899
31:55
because they were causing the spread of
31:57
tuberculosis
31:58
right that's bad
32:01
and then the cone came about and it was
32:03
a huge deal so this is the 1904 world's
32:06
fair that the ice cream cone
32:07
was invented well so there were
32:09
instances of it appearing kind of
32:11
in a few cookbooks in the 19th century
32:13
but it was suddenly made popular at the
32:14
world's fair
32:15
and it was this huge thing the 1904
32:17
world's fair so if any of you have ever
32:18
seen meet me in saint louis
32:20
and i don't know why the song is
32:21
pronounced like that but it was about
32:23
the world's fair that was in saint louis
32:25
and it was a huge deal so they had sort
32:27
of like bears made of prunes
32:29
at the world's fair and they had just
32:32
what everyone's always watching
32:35
what's the point of the bear made of
32:36
prunes everyone loves a prune
32:39
yeah true and there's an exotic thing
32:41
there you go i think they did actual
32:42
snarling
32:43
they had a massive landscape sculptured
32:46
entirely from butter they were showing
32:47
the new refrigeration technology
32:49
so they had they had a milkmaid milking
32:52
a cow but all of it was made of butter
32:55
and they had roosevelt on a teddy
32:57
roosevelt the president at the time on a
32:58
horse what was he made of peaches
33:00
it's all butter but anyway sorry they
33:03
made the ice cream cone there
33:05
because there was ice cream on display
33:06
and no one had thought of eating it like
33:08
on the hoof
33:08
and then they realized people wanted to
33:10
try it and so a nearby waffle vendor
33:13
curled his waffle round into a cone
33:15
shape and said try this
33:17
and hence the comb was invented but
33:19
there's this great historian who's
33:20
really looked into this
33:21
and she's found seven different people
33:24
who claim to have invented it at that
33:25
one fare
33:28
so there was a syrian guy a lebanese guy
33:30
a turkish guy someone from ohio all
33:32
saying they'd done it
33:33
but that's there was born the ice cream
33:35
cone well it's a simple history
33:40
and you know that it's better to eat ice
33:42
cream by licking it than with a spoon
33:45
so this is a theory and the reason is
33:47
that the flavoring ice cream is released
33:49
when the
33:50
fat content comes out of it and that
33:52
comes when it warms up
33:54
and because your tongue is warmer than a
33:56
spoon and it's got a larger surface area
33:58
it's better to put it on there and then
34:00
it kind of melts and you get the flavor
34:01
whereas if you do it with a spoon then
34:03
it's still cold when it goes in your
34:04
mouth and you don't get all the flavor
34:05
because you swallow it before you come
34:07
just a tip it's the top tip
34:11
there's a guy who can tell the
34:12
difference between 12
34:14
and 11.5 percent butter fat in
34:18
ice cream i bet he gets invited to a lot
34:21
of parties
34:23
uh he's an official ice cream taste
34:24
tester and he was called john harrison
34:26
he was the ice cream taste tester for
34:28
dryers 18
34:29
from 1980 to 2010 so for 30 years and he
34:31
had his tongue insured for 1 million
34:33
dollars in fact the company had his
34:34
tongue insured for one million dollars
34:36
they always say this so we we've insured
34:38
your tongue for one million dollars
34:40
what's the risk there isn't a gang of
34:42
roving tongue thieves
34:45
it's a very precious tongue i'd get it
34:47
if i could he'd
34:48
he wouldn't
34:52
no and before you can explain what that
34:57
means it is time for
34:59
fact number four
35:05
our final fact of the evening is james
35:08
okay
35:09
my back is weak is that in 1997
35:12
a town in saskatchewan held a referendum
35:15
on whether
35:16
the end of a toilet paper should hang
35:18
under or over the roll
35:21
and luckily that was the last time
35:22
anyone ever asked a stupid question by
35:25
means of a referendum
35:26
ever again
35:29
so this was a local election in
35:31
saskatoon which is in saskatchewan
35:33
and they were trying out new voting
35:35
machines basically and so
35:37
what they wanted to do was have a trial
35:38
question which was nothing to do with
35:40
any kind of politics and wouldn't kind
35:42
of get people
35:43
riled up and so they said
35:46
what do you think should be the official
35:47
town microbe
35:50
the question was are you in favor of
35:52
toilet paper in all public washrooms
35:54
being installed with the loose end
35:56
coming
35:56
up and over the front of the roll and
35:59
the answer was
36:00
eighty percent over okay and so they
36:03
said they didn't want it to be political
36:04
oh we've got a few other fans in here
36:07
oh okay that's definitely 52 in
36:09
sunderland they feel completely the
36:10
other way about it all right
36:13
uh but yeah one teenager did a science
36:15
project about it and did a survey
36:17
and found that liberals usually go for
36:20
over while conservatives usually go for
36:22
unwanted
36:22
really so actually it was quite
36:24
political after all
36:27
was it was it uh enacted as in did all
36:29
public washrooms
36:30
follow the overwhelming mandate of
36:35
i think it became the rule but they i'm
36:37
sure there isn't a person who goes
36:39
around checking them all
36:41
so it wasn't legally binding
36:45
far be it for me to criticize the
36:47
people's choice but i think they got
36:48
that absolutely wrong
36:50
oh really the toilet roll thing that's
36:53
insane and
36:54
there's no wonder liberals go for the uh
36:55
over the top because over the top weighs
36:57
so much more lure
36:58
because it easily gets you know more
37:01
yeah it absolutely does
37:02
waste more it falls down more easily
37:04
especially if you've got a cat it's not
37:05
cascading down
37:14
what was the moment that no such thing
37:15
as a fish really ended
37:20
wow i feel tense um
37:23
some more referendums that have happened
37:25
oh yeah um so well since that one works
37:27
so well
37:29
no but it's really interesting so lots
37:31
of uh america is really big on this so
37:33
in the usa they have extra referendums
37:35
kind of attached to votes that they're
37:37
having so you might have a
37:38
state or a national election and you'll
37:39
just append a few extra votes which are
37:41
yes no things normally
37:42
so and some of them are quite fun so in
37:44
2006
37:46
arizona voted on whether to give a
37:48
million dollars
37:49
to a single resident chosen by lottery
37:52
simply for voting
37:53
to encourage turnout it's a good idea to
37:55
get a million dollars it was called the
37:57
arizona voter reward act and they
37:58
rejected it
37:59
classic oh really yeah classic human
38:02
they think what if it's
38:04
not me there was a
38:07
there was a great one which was in
38:08
castlewood virginia and this was in 1997
38:12
and the question for the vote was should
38:14
we exist
38:18
and um they decided they shouldn't
38:22
and they no longer do what are you
38:25
talking about
38:26
i think it was quite a tiny community
38:27
that was right next to a bigger
38:29
community but it came with a lot of
38:30
extra taxes off the back of existing so
38:32
they said
38:33
let's let's not abolish themselves and
38:35
became part of russell county
38:37
yes but they had literally only existed
38:39
for a couple of years right they
38:40
signed this big petition saying we want
38:43
to exist we want autonomy
38:45
we want a government great let's do it
38:47
so they bloody did it and then
38:49
straight away they were like taxes what
38:50
are you talking about off
38:52
um and literally immediately the second
38:55
administration they put in power
38:57
was this mayor called roy castle whose
39:00
whole platform was to abolish their
39:01
existence
39:03
so people are able to change their minds
39:05
and have another vote a bit later if
39:06
they
39:07
feel like
39:14
very subtle by the way this show isn't
39:16
going out for about three more months so
39:18
knows
39:20
you'll be able to trade this for food
39:22
this episode of the podcast
39:26
you'll be able you'll be all sitting
39:27
around your carrot sticks at home
39:32
it's on a stick it's honest it's not
39:34
lipstick yeah i mean you can make carrot
39:35
into sticks that's the weird thing
39:38
um just and some other good referendums
39:41
in 1993 san francisco had a referendum
39:43
and it was on whether one specific
39:44
policeman
39:45
could patrol with a ventriloquist dummy
39:48
and
39:50
they got pretty into this so this is
39:52
this great guy called bob geary who
39:54
who was a community policeman and he was
39:56
given the remit
39:57
to make policing more creative and
39:59
ingenious and he did that by spending a
40:01
lot of money
40:02
on a big wooden ventriloquist dummy and
40:05
going about and practice he probably
40:07
learned how to do it he got all these
40:08
tapes he practiced in front of the
40:09
mirror
40:10
he called it and he called it brendan
40:11
o'smarty as sort of like a flip on the
40:14
idea of a dummy
40:15
and he dressed it up in police uniform
40:17
with a water pistol patrolled the
40:18
streets
40:19
and then eventually the person in charge
40:21
of police complained and said he had to
40:23
leave it in the car
40:24
and so he got enough signatures for a
40:26
referendum and it happened
40:28
and bizarrely the result i find so
40:30
unfathomable
40:31
the result of the referendum was just 51
40:35
to 49 in favour
40:38
against a policeman having a dummy i
40:41
reckon it's probably the other policeman
40:42
who when they call for backup and brenda
40:44
no smarty rockstar
40:50
with his water pistol hello there's a
40:53
very very very small fire that needs
40:55
putting out
40:55
he said brendan he did he cost seventeen
40:58
hundred dollars which in 1993 was not
41:00
nothing
41:01
yeah but they are he already owns it so
41:03
he doesn't need to buy a new one does he
41:05
i guess not no um still i'm part of the
41:08
49
41:09
saying no to officers it was kind of it
41:11
was to entertain children wasn't it
41:13
yeah to entertain people i think and he
41:16
did manage to apprehend
41:17
criminals with it apparently there was
41:20
more than one suspect that he took down
41:22
with a dummy in one hand
41:24
and the suspect in the other are you
41:25
kidding no i mean did he do good
41:28
bad cop with the dummy look
41:31
i'm managing to hold him off you but
41:40
i'm gonna he's gonna shout let me add
41:42
him let me add him well i'm drinking a
41:44
glass of water now
41:49
there was another just speaking of
41:50
entertainers in um sao paulo
41:52
uh there was a brazilian clown who was
41:55
called tirorica
41:56
who won an election um and he was going
41:59
for a federal deputy and this was in
42:01
2010
42:02
he it was a question as well uh which
42:05
was does anyone really want to know what
42:06
happens behind government doors
42:08
that was simply it and everyone went yes
42:10
someone's going to tell us the truth and
42:11
it won him the election but he was a
42:13
clown
42:13
and did he reveal did he i should have
42:16
read the rest of the article really
42:20
can i talk about house of lords votes
42:23
because they're quite weird
42:24
yeah um so first of all so lords aren't
42:27
allowed to vote for mps
42:29
which is fair enough there was actually
42:31
quite a good article looking at um
42:34
funny voting comments over the years and
42:36
apparently in 1948
42:38
then someone in america said that he
42:41
got in touch with the house of commons
42:43
because he was interested in the
42:44
qualifications for voting
42:46
in england so he called the reference
42:48
library in the houses of commons
42:49
and he received the following
42:50
pronouncement in great britain
42:53
any adult 21 years or over may register
42:56
and vote except peers and lunatics
42:58
and we make an exception for the latter
43:00
if they have a moment of lucidity
43:03
and that moment was in 2016
43:07
well they can't vote for mps but they do
43:09
have their own elections
43:10
and they're often quite weird so in 2016
43:12
there was a by-election in the house of
43:14
lords it was to replace a lib dem
43:16
peer called eric lubbock who was
43:17
actually a very cool guy
43:19
who wanted to leave his body to
43:21
battersea dogs home to vary their diet
43:23
but that's besides the point
43:27
anyway he died so someone had to replace
43:30
him and the only people qualified to
43:31
vote to replace him
43:33
are the other lib dem hereditary peers
43:35
of which there were three
43:36
and there were seven candidates so they
43:38
had a proper election
43:40
where three people voted for seven
43:43
candidates
43:44
wow it might be the only election where
43:46
there are more candidates than voters
43:48
that's really good there was um in 1862
43:51
there was a referendum in greece
43:52
because the people overthrew kengoto and
43:55
decided to hold a referendum to decide
43:56
who would take his place
43:58
there were 240 000 votes counted
44:01
and the winner was a guy who got six of
44:03
them
44:05
and that's because the greeks voted 95
44:08
for prince alfred who was british
44:10
but britain france and russia had signed
44:12
a treaty saying that no
44:14
person from any of those countries was
44:15
allowed to take over
44:17
okay so the guy who got six votes was
44:19
william of denmark
44:21
who took over and julie raid for 50
44:23
years
44:25
did you say how many votes the first guy
44:26
got alfred uh he got 95 percent of 240
44:30
000 so i'm sure you can work that out
44:31
yeah
44:33
there were 93 people who voted for
44:36
having a republic rather than
44:37
any king at all and there was one vote
44:39
to bring back ken gotto
44:43
i wonder who that was from
44:46
we're going to have to wrap up in a
44:47
second oh i've got one last fact about
44:48
presidential elections yeah which is
44:50
just it's
44:51
not really on referendums but this was
44:53
sent in by someone in the audience
44:54
tonight someone called charlie
44:55
guinness jennis oh yeah
44:59
and it's this is that in the 1948 u.s
45:02
presidential election
45:04
the democrats commissioned a
45:05
papier-mache donkey
45:07
which was designed to have smoke
45:08
belching from its nostrils to make it
45:10
look impressive and intimidating
45:12
unfortunately all the smoke came out of
45:13
its back end instead
45:21

[Music]

[Applause]
00:14
hello
00:18
[Applause]
00:34
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:36
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:38
murray and james harkin and once again
00:40
we have gathered around the microphones
00:41
with our four
00:42
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:44
and in no particular order
00:46
here we go starting with you andy
00:49
my fact is that sweden's public art body
00:52
has just commissioned an artwork which
00:54
will hire someone to do
00:55
nothing at gothenburg's courseware train
00:58
station
00:58
for the next 120 years
01:01
[Music]
01:06
120 years 120 years
01:10
so that can't be the same person for 120
01:12
years it might be we don't know about
01:13
medical advances in the next century
01:15
that's true it could be that so this is
01:17
a thing it's called eternal employment
01:19
and um
01:20
gothenburg has a new train station
01:22
called coursework and i don't if you can
01:23
tell at home but people here are very
01:24
excited about it
01:27
and there was a competition to provide a
01:29
public artwork
01:30
and there were two artists who one
01:32
called simon golden and jacob senebe
01:34
and they have uh half a million pounds
01:36
to spend
01:37
and they spent it on hiring an employee
01:38
to do whatever they like
01:40
forever as long as you check in and
01:43
check out of your work each day
01:45
you will get 21 600 kroner a month
01:49
which is enough to buy five beers here
01:55
uh but then we the application you can
01:57
still go for this by the way uh the
01:59
application deadline
02:00
is the 15th of december 2025.
02:04
okay yeah yeah and their duties will be
02:06
taken up while the lack of duties will
02:08
be taken up
02:09
on the 15th of march 2026.
02:12
okay so if you're bad with deadlines
02:14
like me you can put that off for another
02:15
six years
02:17
and there's a job description online
02:19
which is quite poetic
02:21
it goes there's a scent do you smell it
02:24
the scent of something we smell it it's
02:27
seaweed
02:34
your seaweed you want to be seaweed you
02:37
shall be seaweed
02:39
you know that thank you for knowing
02:42
thank you for seaweed
02:44
you're standing there right there
02:46
standing like what
02:48
like a prawn a positive prawn
02:52
a flexible prawn an unpretentious prawn
02:56
a goal-oriented prop thank you
02:59
thanks wow
03:03
so i think that tells you everything
03:04
that you have to do for this show yeah
03:07
any questions does that sound more
03:10
normal in swedish
03:12
yeah google translates on a hell of a
03:14
genre
03:15
so i like that um the way it's going to
03:17
be as well is once the station is open
03:19
the applicant has been
03:20
uh chosen and he's got or she has
03:22
residency of the job
03:24
there's going to be fluorescent lights
03:25
that go on on the station level um or
03:28
the platform levels to let
03:29
all passengers know that the the person
03:32
doing nothing
03:32
is at work they're they're here either
03:35
doing something
03:36
or absolutely nothing and you can't tell
03:39
who they are if they're on the platforms
03:40
but there's going to be two rooms that
03:42
they can go to
03:43
one is a glass room where you can see
03:45
what they're doing
03:46
and the other is just a closed-off room
03:49
yeah which they can just choose to sit
03:50
in
03:51
and you never see it but actually they
03:52
don't have to stay on in the train
03:54
station at all
03:55
as long as they clock in and clock out
03:56
they could bugger off all day that's it
03:58
but there are things you can't do so you
04:00
can't go and get another job
04:02
um that is seen as not playing the game
04:04
um but the job
04:05
does come with a pension and with
04:07
holiday yeah so you get a holiday from
04:09
doing nothing
04:11
it's not actually a brilliantly paid job
04:14
it's fine
04:14
but if the salary is pretty below
04:17
average
04:18
um so yeah and i reckon in 120 years
04:22
it's going to be worth literally well
04:23
it's going up it's going up it
04:25
increases by 3 a year so and if you die
04:28
um they will just give the job to
04:30
someone else yeah
04:31
so i think that's how jobs work
04:33
generally
04:36
every company falls
04:39
i guess we need to retire that role with
04:42
a person serving at the counter of
04:44
mcdonald's
04:45
it's just gonna have to be an empty
04:46
counter now
04:49
we should say what its purpose is really
04:51
which is they are making a point
04:53
uh so it's inspired by thomas piketty's
04:55
capital in the 21st century that very
04:57
trendy book for anyone
04:59
claiming to be academic yeah got some
05:00
cheers um
05:02
so it's about the return on capital
05:04
being
05:05
higher than the average increase in
05:07
wages so it's basically
05:08
there's this art prize money which was
05:11
seven million kroner i think
05:12
and the idea is that they're gonna
05:13
invest that and the return on that
05:15
investment is going to yield that
05:16
personal salary
05:18
for 120 years so the idea is money
05:21
makes more money than humans do which is
05:24
depressing but still fun for that person
05:27
who's doing it
05:29
can i say a very quick thing about so
05:31
this is art
05:32
meets train station um and
05:36
so the most ambitious crossover in movie
05:39
history
05:42
and so i was looking into sort of
05:44
entertaining art sort of things that
05:46
were going on with train stations and i
05:47
read this fact which is in london
05:49
in our underground station we have the
05:51
very famous iconic
05:53
mind the gap oh yeah lime the gap which
05:55
is set so
05:56
when that was initially recorded it was
05:58
recorded by a sound engineer called
05:59
peter lodge and he got an actor who was
06:01
a well-known actor of the time
06:03
and he got him to record it he recorded
06:04
mine the gap and stand clear of the
06:06
doors
06:07
and after it was recorded and they were
06:09
sort of getting ready to send it out
06:11
the guy suddenly said i want royalties
06:13
for every time
06:17
you can't have that that's insane and he
06:19
said no that's that's my deal so they
06:21
cut him off and they were gonna
06:22
re-record it but they listened to the
06:24
recording of the sound engineer peter
06:26
lodge
06:26
who was testing the microphones going
06:29
mind the gap
06:30
and they went that's good enough
06:34
was the he was the original voice of the
06:36
london underground the sound engineer
06:38
testing the microphones
06:39
that's great yeah because we have a very
06:41
quite a famous thing
06:42
in in london about the mind the gap
06:45
announcement or maybe the station
06:47
announcement at one station i can't
06:48
remember which which was recorded by a
06:49
guy who died a few years ago
06:51
and then they changed the recording
06:54
because you know
06:55
someone else got it they thought they
06:56
jazzed up the station and the widow of
06:58
the guy who died wrote to the station
07:00
didn't she
07:00
and said please can you change that back
07:02
that's you know the only time i hear my
07:03
husband's voice
07:04
yeah his name was oswald lawrence it was
07:06
embankment station it was on the
07:07
northern line and they changed it back
07:09
so she could always hear his voice
07:11
yeah that's really nice yeah speaking of
07:15
uh
07:15
london um so there's oh
07:18
it is kept impractical
07:22
you're not even gonna like where this
07:23
goes so uh if you live in london there's
07:26
another job you can get which seems
07:28
quite cushy
07:29
it is to become a luxury product tester
07:33
and for that you get a 75 000
07:36
pound salary which is about 100 000 us
07:38
dollars
07:39
and you get to test supercars yachts and
07:42
private islands
07:44
wow okay so uh this morning i applied
07:46
for this job
07:49
let's see this is where you look up jobs
07:51
testing luxury islands i
07:53
found out there is a man whose job is to
07:55
watch paint drying
07:56
this is a real job uh he's and he's a
07:59
real person he's called keith jackson
08:00
and he works for an industrial paint
08:02
firm and
08:04
a big part of his job is assessing the
08:06
drying time of industrial paint
08:09
and that doesn't sound important does it
08:13
he might have a break he'll probably
08:15
have a break imagine if he has a break
08:16
for 15 minutes he comes back and it's
08:18
already dry
08:20
that's a bad day in the office isn't it
08:22
for [ __ ] sake
08:23
do you think payne is like a watch pot
08:25
do you think it boils as soon as your
08:27
back is turned
08:29
but no there is a the reason it's
08:31
important that it happens
08:32
is because sometimes you paint things
08:34
and then you need to know
08:35
how long the paint will take to be dry
08:37
so for example london underground
08:39
yeah they can only be painted stations
08:41
between three o'clock and five o'clock
08:43
in the morning
08:44
and then it has to be dry enough to walk
08:45
on so this is a very high-stakes
08:47
situation
08:48
wow this takes a medium
08:51
low to medium to medium but he said
08:55
he said people do laugh and find it
08:57
amusing when i tell them what i do
08:59
um he said it could be described as the
09:01
most boring job in the world
09:03
but it is a very important one washing
09:05
pain dry sounds quite easy
09:07
but it can be stressful at times
09:11
so also while you're looking at jobs of
09:14
watching paint dry i was looking at jobs
09:16
of watching pornography
09:19
and apparently there's a nightclub in
09:21
denmark that's hiring someone to watch
09:23
20 hours of pornographic films for 2
09:26
500 pounds equivalent and the reason is
09:29
they want to select the best parts of
09:31
the soundtrack that they'll make a
09:32
playlist of that they'll play in the
09:34
nightclub bathroom
09:37
sure that's the reason
09:40
i've been looking at some kind of jobs
09:43
that sound
09:44
some people who are kind of lazy at work
09:47
so this
09:47
obviously would suit this job at the
09:49
train station would suit someone was
09:50
quite lazy at work there have been some
09:52
good
09:52
people who have been in the past so
09:54
there was a civil servant
09:56
called carlos reggio he was a spanish
09:59
civil servant he
10:00
skipped work for a decade he used to
10:02
clock in at 7 30 in the morning and then
10:04
he'd return to work to clock out at four
10:05
in the afternoon
10:06
so he's perfect for this station job uh
10:09
he took home a 50 grand salary
10:11
and he then when he was caught and it
10:14
was discovered that he'd just been
10:15
skipping work for
10:16
over 10 years he then admitted to it
10:19
fine and then there was an art
10:20
exhibition
10:21
put on in the town that used a council
10:23
venue and the exhibition was called
10:25
love for valencia the works of a man who
10:28
never worked and it was booked under
10:30
what turned out to be a fake name
10:31
and uh they discovered later it was put
10:33
on by him this man who'd skipped work
10:35
the whole time
10:36
as kind of appearing to his own glory
10:39
having skipped work and there were
10:41
paintings there were sculptures and
10:43
there were bronze busts of this man
10:46
talking about how he'd succeeded in not
10:48
working the council discovered that it
10:50
was him who booked it and they cancelled
10:52
it
10:52
but i discovered that he got no charges
10:54
he got no big fine he was suspended from
10:56
work
10:57
not even fired speaking of doing nothing
11:01
um there is a hotel with a or there was
11:04
um
11:04
the hotel still exists but they used to
11:06
have a suite called the checkout suite
11:08
and if you did nothing and you use no
11:10
internet then you get the suite for free
11:14
okay so it worked out how much internet
11:16
you were using and how much work you
11:17
were doing
11:18
and if you use the time to just relax
11:20
and do nothing they gave it you for free
11:22
this was the hotel ballara which is in
11:24
gothenburg
11:26
which is the hotel we're staying and at
11:28
the moment
11:30
so i spoke to the receptionist this
11:32
afternoon uh and she said it ran for
11:34
three months and
11:35
every single person who went there
11:37
managed to get it for free
11:39
there must be something of the people of
11:40
gothenburg that are just quite happy
11:42
sitting around going you know what
11:44
i'm just going to chill you know what if
11:45
you've got a few sheets of
11:47
slightly damp paint the time flies by
11:53
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:56
that
11:57
is chozinski yes my fact this week
12:00
is that ninjas sword sheaths have
12:03
removable tips
12:04
so that if they ever had to hide under
12:06
water they could use them like a snorkel
12:08
to breathe
12:10
that's so cool it's so great so they
12:13
brought the sword with them as well
12:14
right
12:14
yeah yeah you do bring this all that's
12:16
the main thing but basically being in
12:18
ninja was all about kind of adapting to
12:20
your environment it was like being a
12:22
sort of 15 to 17th century japanese
12:24
james bond it really was they had all
12:26
these gadgets
12:27
and one of them was the sword and the
12:29
scabbard they would use it like a
12:31
snorkel because hiding underwater was a
12:33
major part of being
12:34
a ninja well so what
12:40
i find it hard to put this into words
12:42
but what yeah
12:43
what so why would you need to be
12:45
underwater so
12:47
basically the the what a ninja was was
12:50
it was sort of like the flip side of a
12:53
samurai
12:53
so samurai in japan were very well
12:56
respected honorable noble fighters
12:58
and the ninja was the sneaky mercenary
13:01
agent
13:01
they were very very looked down upon at
13:03
the time they were around which and they
13:05
were
13:05
they had their heyday the 15th or 17th
13:07
century in japan and their function was
13:09
basically espionage so there were spies
13:11
and deception
13:12
and surprise attack and covert methods
13:14
and they did a lot of hiding and running
13:16
away
13:17
and one of their main ways of hiding was
13:19
using the water so
13:20
certain ninja texts from the time
13:22
advised that
13:23
in daytime hide underwater so it's not
13:26
to be seen
13:27
you just spend the whole day underwater
13:29
and so you need this snorkel-like thing
13:31
on the end of your sword
13:32
and so the scabbard end can double as a
13:34
breathing tube um
13:35
one of the texts that i read advising
13:37
ninjas said that the
13:39
end of your scabbard if you had the
13:40
removable tip taken off could also be a
13:42
hearing aid or a megaphone
13:45
cool wow
13:48
it could also be used as a step ladder
13:50
for climbing over fences
13:52
oh yeah but you'd sort of jab it into
13:54
the wall and i think
13:55
it might be what i imagine that this
13:57
might be wrong because this just came
13:58
out of my imagination but um
14:00
you know like with a sword you have that
14:02
like crossbit that yeah that kind of
14:04
hides your hand
14:05
i thought if you turned it upside down
14:07
you could just step on it oh
14:09
that was good even if you stabbed it
14:10
into the wall you could bounce off the
14:12
sword
14:13
yes can i tell you a cool thing that uh
14:16
ninjas could do
14:17
so ninjas had incredible abilities
14:19
according to the old text one other
14:20
thing they could do is they could tell
14:22
the time of day
14:23
by looking at a cat's eye
14:26
so if you asked a ninja what time is it
14:28
and a cat was around they could look at
14:30
the cat
14:31
and they would study the pupil of the
14:33
eye which changes during the day
14:34
according to the sun
14:36
and if they say if they can't see the
14:37
cat it's night time
14:41
[Applause]
14:44
[Music]
14:52
it's more difficult to carry a cat
14:54
around to know the time than it is to
14:56
just
14:58
guess the time but it would be a party
15:01
trick
15:02
as you would say everyone at the party
15:05
knows you're a ninja do they
15:07
they didn't go to parties their whole
15:09
raise on detroit was considering their
15:22
they can do that um look
15:25
so patronized by these guys sometimes uh
15:28
they could read cat's eyes and
15:30
also um sorry can we just do account
15:32
size actually change according to them
15:34
they do vary slightly because of the
15:35
amount of likes so the rest yeah yes but
15:37
that's not a reliable indicator of time
15:39
is it because
15:40
if you're in a dark room but it's midday
15:42
and you look at the cat and the cat's
15:44
eyes are massive you think oh great it's
15:46
night time i can leave my darkened room
15:48
it's not it's midday you're going to be
15:50
spotted immediately no but
15:52
this is a completely unworkable system
15:54
it's not a system
15:56
yeah i'm so angry
16:01
it's like saying they have an ability or
16:03
they're going to do it 24 hours a day it
16:05
must be a lie it's
16:06
you know they do it when a cat's around
16:08
like that's
16:09
you know i can do stuff on a cat around
16:11
that i won't need to do when it's not
16:13
around
16:14
we don't need to know about your private
16:15
life
16:17
um this might be a good moment to
16:20
mention that
16:21
uh it's very difficult to study ninjas
16:23
because there's little solid evidence
16:24
and a lot of rumor about what they could
16:26
do
16:27
so there are a few really really good
16:29
texts like the book of ninja which i'm
16:31
sure dan is drawing from here
16:32
uh but a lot of people are sort of
16:34
playing the ninjas could fly
16:36
or that they could read minds or they
16:37
could go invisible and that was all
16:39
[ __ ]
16:40
but they could do it but there are
16:41
narrowest at noon when you see their
16:43
eyes
16:44
narrow at noon do you know it's 12 p.m
16:46
one way they could tell the time which i
16:48
thought was quite cool that was in one
16:49
of the books and this was
16:50
written in like the 1630s i think was
16:53
they said a way to see if time is
16:54
passing if you're hiding at night to
16:56
ambush
16:57
is work out which nostril you're
16:58
breathing out of because your nostrils
17:01
so you know how
17:02
you're only ever breathing out of one
17:03
nostril at a time and this swaps around
17:06
sporadically
17:06
and the rule was that it swaps around
17:08
roughly every hour
17:09
and so if you're aware that your
17:11
nostrils have just swapped
17:12
then an hour's gone by all right all
17:16
right ninjas
17:17
synchronize your noses
17:21
can i just say yeah there are some
17:24
people who think that ninjas weren't
17:25
really a thing
17:27
like that they they didn't exist
17:30
nearly as much as is now believed by
17:32
popular culture
17:33
and the because there's so little
17:35
evidence of it so there was a japan
17:37
expert from the university of leeds
17:38
who said that ninjas effectively didn't
17:41
exist in the world that's what the
17:42
ninjas want you to think yeah
17:44
they're so good at hiding they're all
17:47
just underwater
17:49
um so the kind of the thing of someone
17:51
basically the the idea of someone
17:52
running around in black pajamas
17:54
is not coherent as an idea because it
17:57
would be very obvious um
17:59
so if it's
18:02
mostly agricultural land at this time in
18:04
history so you'd be dressed as a farmer
18:06
if you were a ninja if you see a guy
18:08
running around in black soaking wet
18:10
pajamas with a cat under his arm
18:19
he gave an example actually um so the
18:21
year is 1600
18:22
two of your enemies are fighting a
18:24
battle so you send a couple of guys
18:25
dressed as farmers to the area to watch
18:27
the battle and report back about what's
18:29
happening that's ninja work
18:30
so that's the kind of a lot of it was
18:32
more i think observation
18:34
than you know nunchucks and throwing yes
18:37
but it was extremely
18:38
surprising so like historians that
18:40
people tend to think are very
18:41
trustworthy from that period recorded it
18:44
there's a guy called fujibayashi
18:45
who recorded a lot of the ninjas methods
18:48
and they were bound by a sort of
18:50
spirituality
18:51
which was ruled by five elements and
18:53
these elements were wood
18:55
fire earth metal and water and these all
18:57
represented different ways of fighting
18:59
or hiding or getting away
19:01
and they're really funny so he recorded
19:03
like the ways you'd use these different
19:05
elements so
19:06
in the water one it would be for
19:07
instance you'd use your sword as the
19:09
breathing tube
19:10
or you would have to be trained to throw
19:12
large quantities of duckweed on water
19:15
that you think you might escape through
19:16
later
19:17
so that you could then hide among its
19:19
leaves and float with them to safety
19:21
okay yeah very clever the i found a
19:25
one that might be the uh an earth method
19:27
if that's one of the elements so
19:29
there's apparently a skill called uzura
19:31
kakurei
19:32
which is curling oneself into a ball to
19:34
look like a rock
19:38
so you believe that one no i
19:41
i actually don't but then there's
19:44
someone who comes disguised as some
19:46
paper and they can just be
19:47
[Laughter]
19:50
um you know it's just saying that they
19:52
don't carry animals with them cats with
19:54
them but they did
19:55
supposedly carry crickets with them
19:57
boxes of crickets
19:59
and the idea was if if they needed to go
20:01
somewhere but they were a bit noisy
20:02
they could then release the crickets and
20:04
the crickets would make qrikety noises
20:06
and then they could quickly
20:07
shuffle over to where they need to be ah
20:09
that's good okay how do they keep the
20:11
crickets
20:11
quiet um they keep them in a jar
20:15
or a box this is
20:18
this is much more plausible than the cap
20:20
thing so far so i'm
20:21
they also used to wear fake children
20:23
feet
20:25
the crickets the ninjas um
20:30
so it is said i need to say it is said
20:32
it is rumored um
20:34
that the uh ninjas used to wear on the
20:36
soles of their shoes
20:38
sort of either children's feet or an
20:40
elderly woman's foot i don't know what
20:42
that looks like
20:43
so the footprints in let's say the sand
20:46
or like you know their soggy feet coming
20:48
out of the river be like oh a child must
20:49
have been
20:50
swimming in that so they wouldn't be
20:52
deceiving well it's true that american
20:54
cattle rustlers used to wear shoes which
20:56
had like cow
20:57
hooves on the bottom of them so you
20:59
would think that it was cows that had
21:00
gone past
21:01
or horses rather than yet humans and in
21:03
bhutan it said that yetis can take their
21:05
feet
21:06
and put them on backwards so it looks
21:07
like they've gone that way when in fact
21:09
they're on that way
21:10
i was really trying to help
21:13
okay it is time for fact number three
21:16
and that is my fact
21:18
my fact this week is that one month
21:20
before the french spider-man
21:22
successfully climbed the second tallest
21:24
building in the world
21:26
he was hospitalized after falling from a
21:28
seven foot tall traffic light
21:32
now this was to promote his climb of the
21:35
second
21:35
what was at the time actually the
21:37
tallest building in the world um
21:39
which was in taiwan and uh he was
21:42
climbing this traffic light
21:43
uh the photographer was there he slipped
21:45
fell got 40 stitches was hospitalized
21:48
and it jeopardized the actual climb
21:50
itself they thought he might not be able
21:51
to do it but
21:52
he did pull through wow and he is uh
21:55
an urban climber he is yeah his name is
21:58
elaine roberts
21:59
and um he is online i i don't know the
22:02
community that well but
22:03
when you see online he's sort of
22:05
regarded as the greatest urban climber
22:07
of our day i mean he's in his
22:08
mid-50s now i think he's about 56 and
22:10
he's still climbing extremely tall
22:12
buildings um it's amazing although he's
22:15
bound for climbing in britain
22:17
we don't like him uh he was i feel kind
22:19
of bad for him so he climbed the
22:21
heron tower in london very tall
22:22
skyscraper and he was arrested the
22:25
moment he reached
22:26
the top i just feel like so it took him
22:27
over half an hour and they just waited
22:29
for him
22:30
at the top and as soon as you got what
22:31
else are they gonna do they're not gonna
22:33
climb
22:33
down the thing are they it's only he's
22:36
only wasted half an hour i think that's
22:38
okay
22:39
you're right and then he's wasted the 20
22:40
weeks suspended jail sentence that he
22:42
got
22:43
500 pounds well he also in 2012 he was
22:46
spotted
22:46
inside the sharp building in london and
22:49
the building's owners subsequently
22:51
obtained an injunction preventing him
22:52
from ever returning to their building
22:57
so he realized i'm on the wrong side
23:00
he's bouncing up the stairs guy this is
23:01
easy
23:03
so he's grabbed over 150 skyscrapers and
23:06
one thing he says is that the first two
23:08
meters are almost the most
23:09
important because after that the police
23:12
can't grab your feet
23:13
[Laughter]
23:17
as anna was saying um the police are
23:19
often there waiting for him when he gets
23:20
to the top of a building and i read in
23:22
interviews that the only thing he has on
23:23
him is chalk for his hands as he's
23:25
climbing and he wears special shoes
23:27
but that's not quite true because i
23:29
think what he also carries on him
23:30
is his hat so he knows what time it is
23:36
box of crickets so no one can hear him
23:38
coming
23:40
his climbing shoes are actually in the
23:41
shape of an old woman's feet
23:47
well it looks like the old woman climbed
23:49
the south face of the building
23:52
oh no when what he actually does carry
23:54
with him is his passport
23:56
and his lawyer's number and he just
23:57
hands that to the police as soon as he
23:59
gets there
24:00
but is it is it surprisingly common
24:01
thing like urban climbing
24:03
it's uh something that there are quite a
24:05
few heroes of urban climbing in 2016
24:08
there was a guy who got in trouble
24:10
because he tried to scale trump tower
24:12
and he spent three hours doing it he was
24:14
using suction cups
24:16
on his hands like handling his hands and
24:17
feet in fact so it was massive suction
24:19
cups and he reached the 21st
24:21
floor but nypd were desperately trying
24:24
to catch him it was bizarre to watch so
24:25
they kept on sort of smashing windows up
24:27
the building to try and reach out to
24:29
grab him and they couldn't get him
24:31
um they kept trying to impede his
24:33
progress by climbing through air vents
24:34
and stuff
24:35
i think and they just couldn't do it and
24:37
eventually they set up two massive air
24:39
bags like mattresses
24:40
in case he fell down just below him and
24:42
on the pavement
24:43
and he was asked afterwards why he'd
24:45
done it so
24:46
there was this huge rigmarole took three
24:48
hours reached the 21st floor and then
24:50
the police sort of
24:51
sprung out of the window and grabbed him
24:52
and pulled him in said why on earth have
24:54
you done that and he said look i'm just
24:55
a political researcher and i really
24:57
wanted to meet donald trump you know uh
25:00
just we were talking about alain robert
25:02
yeah um he has vertigo really he suffers
25:05
from vertigo
25:06
and vertigo is sort of feeding the urge
25:08
to throw yourself off a great height
25:10
isn't it it's not fear of heights no
25:12
inner ear problem which makes you dizzy
25:14
and stuff oh i thought then you got the
25:16
urge that
25:17
you felt like the ground was coming
25:18
towards you i think you feel very i
25:20
think
25:20
you feel very dizzy and you feel a bit
25:22
unstable yeah and he's had that since
25:23
1982 and he's still done it yeah yeah
25:26
he had it after he was showing students
25:28
how to climb with his hands behind his
25:30
back
25:30
and then fell 26 feet off the wall yeah
25:34
oh he's he's married with three kids and
25:37
i read an interview with his wife
25:39
because they said you must be you know
25:40
you know freaked out every single time
25:42
he goes and climbs the building how are
25:44
you feeling and she sort of kind of said
25:45
well i knew what i was getting into
25:46
really because when she first met him
25:48
both of his arms were in plaster casts
25:50
from before
25:52
the one thing that defeated him in
25:53
london um in 20 and 2002
25:56
was the weather uh he got three quarters
25:58
of the way of number one canada square
26:00
in canary wharf and it was so cold wet
26:03
and windy he just got completely stuck
26:05
and had to be rescued by a window
26:07
cleaning
26:09
it's lift but it's got a long and
26:11
illustrious history
26:12
urban climbing which by the way is
26:15
called it's got a number of names it
26:16
could be called
26:17
edify searing or stagofly so that's the
26:20
official term for it and i really like
26:22
the etymology of this
26:23
so the greek stegos is a roof so it's
26:26
lover of roof so it's like climbing up
26:28
onto roofs
26:28
it's from the same root as what's like
26:30
the other word that you'd have seen with
26:31
stegosaurus
26:32
yeah it's in the same root as
26:33
stegosaurus because that means
26:35
roofed lizard because when they first
26:37
found the stegosaurus
26:38
they saw people climbing up it
26:42
they had a roof on top no it was uh so
26:44
they thought that the plate
26:46
on top of a stegosaurus would be
26:48
horizontal rather than vertical so they
26:49
thought that it had a roof
26:51
over it so it's called roof lizard that
26:53
sounds cool it is cool
26:54
but an urban climbing ostagofully has a
26:57
long history in oxford and cambridge
26:59
university so the first urban climber
27:02
was a guy called jeffrey winthrop
27:04
young who published a book called the
27:06
roof climber's guide to trinity
27:07
at college at cambridge and it gave
27:10
really detailed instructions on which
27:11
route to take up
27:13
and then there was another guy called
27:15
noel howard simmington
27:16
who wrote one in 1937. again nine
27:19
climbers guide to cambridge
27:20
and his pseudonym was whipple snake and
27:23
this is so weird the person who reviewed
27:25
his book and wrote about the details of
27:27
climbing up cambridge buildings was also
27:30
called whipple he was called tom whipple
27:32
so the modern day cambridge building
27:34
climate is called tom whipple i don't
27:36
know
27:37
no way well i don't know if it's the
27:39
same tom whipple i'm sure it will be i
27:41
know the circles are moving
27:42
nice have you guys heard of the human
27:45
fly
27:46
hang on there's no anecdote well he's
27:49
he's a journalist yeah he is he's a very
27:52
nice guy tell us about the human fly
27:57
his name is tom
28:00
so okay we need to move on actually um
28:03
no no
28:04
so the human flight was a guy called
28:06
henry gardner and he was one of the
28:07
first
28:08
really impressive uh building climbers
28:10
he was in the 1910s and 20s
28:12
he climbed 700 buildings without gear
28:15
frequently wearing a suit
28:17
um and he was paid to do it by companies
28:21
to promote their offices in the new
28:23
skyscrapers
28:24
so in 1916 he climbed to the ninth floor
28:26
window of a skyscraper
28:28
climbed into the window of a bank branch
28:30
and opened an account at the bank
28:32
those were the stunts he did um or he
28:34
would do that you know
28:35
open an insurance thing and he was he
28:37
was really really famous
28:38
we don't know what happened to him he
28:40
went missing in 1925. oh really he
28:42
probably fell off a building didn't he
28:44
if he were to guess i i yeah i'm afraid
28:47
um that rubber guy does it for money now
28:49
doesn't he
28:49
right he basically does it sponsored and
28:51
he usually uses actual climbing gear and
28:53
stuff like that
28:54
but actually a lot of people do die so
28:56
um this harry gardner who was
28:59
actually it was grover cleveland the
29:00
president who nicknamed him the human
29:02
fly
29:03
apparently and he said that 120 of those
29:06
who
29:06
sought to imitate me in this hazardous
29:08
profession have fallen to death
29:11
so he was saying that that happened and
29:12
people have looked into this scientists
29:14
have looked into it there's been a study
29:15
in 2006
29:16
and they said in every country there is
29:18
an excess of male deaths due to
29:20
potentially avoidable reasons
29:25
um according to their theory this is
29:27
what they quoted as saying
29:29
men are idiots and idiots do stupid
29:33
things
29:39
and on that note we need to move on to
29:42
our final fact of the show
29:44
and that is james okay my fact this week
29:48
is that in the early eurovision song
29:50
contests
29:51
songs could not be performed in public
29:53
before the event
29:55
one danish song was banned after the
29:57
composer
29:58
whistled it in a tv broadcasters canteen
30:01
wow this is incredible so yeah this was
30:04
in the bit where you had to become the
30:07
danish entry
30:08
and there were six different songs and
30:10
this guy was just in the canteen having
30:11
his lunch and he was just kind of
30:13
whistling it to himself
30:14
and then they did the actual thing where
30:16
they performed it and the people were
30:17
there going
30:18
this sounds a bit familiar wasn't it and
30:21
then they got banned
30:22
no way was he maybe secretly doing it to
30:25
try and
30:26
seed the tune in people's minds or is
30:28
there no suggestion of that
30:29
you know what i haven't thought of that
30:31
but yeah i mean probably not
30:32
i think that's a very cynical take what
30:35
an amazing song that they were like
30:37
wait that's the song i heard in that
30:39
canteen a week ago
30:40
yeah what a shame it couldn't enter yeah
30:43
that's true what a great whistler he
30:44
must be
30:46
whistling everyone is a better whistler
30:48
than they are a singer
30:50
it's easier to match a tune that you've
30:52
heard whistling than it is singing there
30:54
are some people who can't whistle right
30:56
i've met a few people who count myself
30:58
right
31:01
so yeah well okay hang on
31:05
if you can whistle you are a better
31:08
whistler probably
31:09
than you are saying that it's much weird
31:11
tell me about tom whipple
31:14
that's interesting really well they've
31:16
looked at that that's not just your
31:17
opinion
31:18
it's not just my opinion they're
31:19
studying wait this isn't this isn't an
31:21
opinion
31:22
they've been studied they've done
31:23
studies to test the pictures
31:26
asking people can you repeat this tune
31:28
sung or repeat it
31:29
uh and it's because i mean you know it's
31:31
obviously much easier to make a tune in
31:33
a musical instrument because they're
31:34
specifically designed to match specific
31:35
notes
31:36
um but muscles are just a bit less
31:38
precise
31:41
in your opinion
31:44
you know the um when the eurovision song
31:46
contest first started
31:47
britain decided we didn't want to take
31:49
part in this eurovision song contest
31:51
so we decided to have our own british
31:53
song contest
31:55
of british popular songs um which was
31:58
won by dennis lotus who was born in
32:00
south africa
32:04
the thing that i don't really understand
32:06
about eurovision and
32:07
i think it is bigger here than it is in
32:09
britain but is the constant insistence
32:11
every year that it's not political it
32:12
should never be political and it's just
32:14
about the music when it is so patiently
32:15
political i don't understand why
32:17
everyone doesn't embrace that
32:18
so there have been like everything about
32:20
the history of eurovision
32:21
in 2009 though it was just after the
32:24
russia georgia conflict and
32:25
georgia had to withdraw its entry
32:28
because the organizers had told them
32:29
they had to change their lyrics and the
32:31
title of their entry song
32:32
which was we don't want to put in which
32:35
is a very
32:36
unveiled reference to
32:39
putin so yeah and then
32:42
it's back and forth all the time yeah
32:44
there was um
32:45
it's when it first came it was possible
32:46
in europe together
32:48
um but turkey pulled out in 1976 because
32:51
greece were taking part
32:52
uh but then greece pulled out in 1975
32:54
because turkey were taking
32:56
part um greece censored ireland in 2008
32:59
because they mentioned macedonia and
33:01
they sent
33:01
finland in 2007 for being satanic but
33:04
then
33:04
finland censored israel in the same year
33:06
for mentioning nuclear weapons
33:08
and this year israel's embassy
33:10
complained to the netherlands after they
33:11
parodied their eurovision winner
33:13
and iran moved all of its diplomats from
33:15
azerbaijan in 2012 and protested it
33:17
hosting the contest
33:19
even though iran's nothing to do with
33:20
eurovision
33:22
and when israel won in 1978 the tv show
33:25
in jordan told viewers that belgium had
33:27
won
33:29
and in 1973 portugal arrested the writer
33:33
of its own
33:33
song because they thought it wasn't
33:36
fascist enough
33:41
there you go so glad i'm so glad we're
33:44
all friends together
33:47
um do you know um salvador dali was
33:49
involved with the eurovision song
33:51
yeah in 1969 the stage so it was in
33:53
madrid
33:54
and the stage had this giant sculpture a
33:57
metal sculpture on stage and that was
33:58
designed by salvador dali but not only
34:01
that he also designed their press
34:02
material all the press packages and
34:04
stuff yeah that sounds like an early job
34:06
yeah it does doesn't it yeah
34:07
now he was a man who had trouble telling
34:09
the time
34:09
[Laughter]
34:11
[Music]
34:15
the the 1978 one was particularly
34:18
controversial so it
34:20
1978 was uh the one that israel won i
34:23
think and
34:23
during the contest it became obvious
34:25
that israel was going to win and
34:27
most arabic countries were transmitting
34:30
it on their
34:30
tv stations and they cancelled the
34:33
transmission as soon as it became
34:34
obvious so they would just
34:35
quickly flick to another channel with no
34:37
explanation and actually you say that
34:39
jordan said that belgium had won and
34:40
they just replaced their transmission
34:41
with a bunch of daffodils
34:45
very cool subtle um there was a you
34:48
mentioned the
34:49
british equivalent yes um there was a
34:51
soviet union equivalent as well which
34:53
was called intervision the individual
34:55
contest and it only happened four times
34:58
and um we've spoken about this before is
35:00
this was the
35:01
way that you voted it was that
35:05
a lot of people didn't have telephones
35:06
uh in the soviet union
35:08
so you had to turn on your lights if you
35:10
liked the song
35:11
and you had to turn them off if you
35:12
didn't like the song and they just
35:14
measured the load on each country's
35:15
electricity network
35:18
and that determined how many points you
35:19
got nice that's clever
35:24
and it was like it was amazing it was it
35:26
was the wild west
35:28
of songs of song contest so for example
35:30
one entrant in those
35:31
in those four years stayed on stage for
35:33
45 minutes
35:36
just kept going until they were removed
35:38
the thing about that is that um
35:40
you had to i think someone else pointed
35:42
this out in an last class reading
35:44
you had to sit in pitch dark for all of
35:46
the songs you didn't like
35:47
so you can't turn your lights on
35:52
how miserable you don't like the song
35:53
anyway also bizarrely canada was
35:55
an entrant in two of the i think four
35:57
years that that was going they have
35:59
weird entrance like the fact that
36:00
australia
36:01
is in eurovision is obviously a bit
36:03
weird and also
36:04
a bit painful because they have the
36:05
highest score on average
36:07
the australians i'm a nazi
36:10
[ __ ] your mind so good we've been in
36:14
five times and then
36:15
three of those five we've made it to the
36:16
top ten yeah if you weren't
36:19
what did you come this year
36:23
i feel we're all on a loser against
36:25
sweden
36:27
yeah do you know if you actually go to
36:28
the eurovision song contest
36:30
what you um what you have to do is
36:32
adhere to very strict rules about what
36:34
can go in with you
36:35
so like most places you go to there's a
36:37
list of things that aren't allowed to be
36:39
taken into a venue
36:40
um but with the european song contest
36:42
it's things like
36:43
helmets adhesive tape golf balls are not
36:47
allowed
36:47
and shopping trolleys they specify
36:50
shopping trolleys
36:51
and this it just feels like that each
36:53
year they're responding to one
36:54
disastrous entry
36:56
so i think about within the last decade
36:59
the greek team performed on a trampoline
37:01
did they yeah okay so that i don't know
37:03
if trampolines are on the list
37:04
no i mean no because this is for the
37:06
people coming it's not for the people
37:08
i'm sorry it's for audience people sorry
37:10
there hasn't been there hasn't been
37:11
someone in the eurovision subcategories
37:13
just
37:13
singing and hitting golf balls into the
37:15
office
37:19
it would be so unsurprising yeah so
37:22
there was the russians who came second i
37:25
think
37:25
a few years ago with that team of
37:28
grannies
37:28
who baked bread on stage yeah
37:32
i mean it is a strange contest there was
37:34
um in 1985
37:36
the contest was held in gothenburg
37:41
it's such an easy way of getting the
37:42
cheers shameless
37:44
uh and the um it was very popular
37:47
amongst
37:48
british viewers and a lot of people
37:50
tuned in where you wouldn't
37:51
really think they would do and that's
37:53
because the swedish entry was
37:54
entitled bra vibrationite
38:02
is that is that some kind of milking
38:06
tool
38:09
well for the people who are in this room
38:11
i believe it means good vibrations
38:19
in 1997 um denmark's entry was a wrap in
38:22
danish about a guy who had fallen in
38:24
love with a woman from directory
38:25
inquiries
38:28
in 1980 norway's entry was a song about
38:30
the construction of a hydroelectric
38:32
power plant
38:35
estonia in 2013 had a song which
38:38
repeatedly just said the phrase a local
38:40
man called korsakov
38:41
went to latvia yesterday
38:45
and in 2006 lithuania had a song
38:48
called we are the winners which just
38:50
said we are the winners again
38:51
and again and again and again and they
38:54
came sick
38:56
i want to know if they ever found the
38:57
local man called corsica
39:01
um we're gonna have to wrap up guys uh
39:03
well okay one more thing
39:04
yeah um the first person to get nilpoi
39:07
as in no points in eurovision
39:09
uh was a guy called jan tegan from
39:12
norway
39:14
okay but he became a national hero
39:17
because he got no points
39:18
and um his song was number one for two
39:21
months
39:22
and remained in the top ten for three
39:24
more months afterwards
39:26
and he also had the number one album
39:28
called this year's loser
39:32

01:05
oh my really all four thousand
01:08
genuinely um
01:13
now with your massive metal hand you
01:14
just put in the air
01:16
are you actually what have you got
01:20
so you have a chip implant in your hand
01:22
an rfid
01:23
little chip implant cool very i need to
01:25
trash a lot of the abusive stuff i had
01:31
that's so cool wow so we've got cyborgs
01:33
in the audience
01:34
this is this is a different gig to any
01:36
gig we've ever done before
01:38
so this is it sweden is going cashless a
01:41
fifth of people in sweden don't use
01:43
uh atms anymore and so more than four
01:46
thousand people in the country
01:47
have these little microchips and they it
01:49
lets them pay for
01:51
for rail travel and for food and
01:54
official rail firms you know register
01:56
your hands and they
01:57
you can just pay with your hand and you
01:59
can order diy kits and there are
02:01
sometimes people do it at parties they
02:02
have implant parties
02:04
yeah yeah it's chip and beer parties
02:06
they're called
02:08
fish and chips party you can have i
02:10
don't know if that happens i just made
02:12
that one up but
02:13
if it doesn't please start it you cyborg
02:15
get on it
02:18
it's been around for a while hasn't it
02:20
people have been trying to make this
02:22
catch on and it feels like it is
02:23
happening so
02:24
i think there was a girl called left
02:26
anonym
02:27
and i can't remember where she was from
02:29
but this is in about 2010 and she
02:31
realized that
02:32
a lot of the technology that people were
02:33
advertising to have sort of implanted
02:35
was quite expensive across a few hundred
02:37
quid
02:38
and so she was one of the pioneers of
02:40
sort of biohacking yourself
02:42
and she decided inserting random things
02:45
under her
02:46
skin at one point she said she inserted
02:48
some device that she'd
02:49
sort of made using a vegetable peeler
02:51
and vodka to sterilize herself
02:55
wow but now she's quite famous so sorry
02:58
she didn't put a vegetable peeler inside
03:00
her body because it wouldn't work if
03:02
it's inside your skin i
03:03
don't know anything with that the first
03:06
thing that's peeling is
03:07
your own skin yeah no it was she i guess
03:10
she opened up her skin with a vegetable
03:12
peeler and then inserted a little techie
03:14
device
03:14
wow oh look desperate times that's
03:17
amazing
03:18
i almost became a cyborg myself did you
03:21
yeah back in england i did a
03:23
tv thing where i was talking about
03:24
cyborgs and they said would you be up
03:26
for having
03:27
the little it's rice sized little rfid
03:30
chip
03:30
implanted in my hands and i said yes and
03:32
i and i went there and the guy came and
03:34
he had it with him
03:35
and i got a call from my wife and she
03:38
said if you become a robot man you are
03:40
not coming home tonight
03:41
and yeah but you could just bash down
03:44
the door probably
03:50
so i had to fake the the thing so i
03:52
still got the injection it's a big it's
03:54
a big scary injection it's like a straw
03:57
and it goes in between your forefinger
03:59
and your thumb
04:00
and i had it pushed right in and i still
04:02
have a scar from where i should be aside
04:04
okay so you so what you're saying is
04:06
your wife said you couldn't do it
04:08
you still have a scar but you really
04:10
didn't do it yeah
04:13
and what powers was it going to give you
04:15
you can get on a bus and tap it like a
04:17
jedi and it will just go poop
04:18
but it doesn't work in the uk does it it
04:20
doesn't work it's not officially
04:22
recognized in the uk i think if you cut
04:24
out the
04:24
whole chip from an oyster card it might
04:26
i presume yes
04:27
it does there was a there was a guy who
04:30
um took out the chip from an oyster card
04:31
he didn't put it in his body but he put
04:32
it on the top of a wand and he dressed
04:34
like a wizard
04:35
so yeah he used to walk up to the oyster
04:39
and go
04:44
but there are lots of risks there it's
04:46
it can't go wrong so
04:47
um it obviously it's it's very safe to
04:50
do but there are risks with the human
04:52
factor so
04:53
uh this last november a writer for the
04:55
website vice he got an
04:56
implant and he wrote it up and one of
04:59
the first things you have to do with the
05:00
one he had
05:01
you have to secure it with a pin number
05:03
unfortunately he was at a party at the
05:05
time
05:06
and he said uh he woke up the next day
05:09
hung over and he couldn't remember
05:10
the pin number for his own hand
05:14
but luckily he had it tattooed on his
05:16
other hand
05:21
that is amazing yeah but actually some
05:23
people think
05:24
that um it is the mark of the beast to
05:27
have these things you know from the
05:28
bible the idea that there's a mark which
05:30
tells you if you're the devil or
05:31
something
05:32
and apparently the passage in revelation
05:34
13 15
05:36
says also it causes all both
05:39
small and great both rich and poor both
05:41
free and slave to be marked on the right
05:44
hand or the forehead
05:45
so that no one can buy or sell unless he
05:47
has the mark
05:50
and that's kind of the idea that these
05:52
people want us to have everyone to have
05:53
these things and you won't be able to
05:54
buy things without it
05:56
so what satan's come to earth to do is
05:58
make sure we can get a free
06:00
bus ride with our fingers and also he's
06:02
got a stat small
06:04
also i haven't seen evidence of anyone
06:06
paying with their forehead
06:08
i mean you feel pretty stupid well
06:11
that's why i was reading an faq
06:13
um by someone called kyla heffernan uh
06:15
because this person was talking about
06:17
a um it was a company that was getting
06:19
the people to have these chips
06:22
uh and one of the questions was do you
06:23
have to lose your hand if you lose your
06:25
job
06:27
which the answer is no okay um but then
06:30
she also said to this thing about
06:32
revelations it says it's in your right
06:33
hand or your forehead but she says that
06:35
actually many people get the microchip
06:37
in the non-dominant hand
06:38
so it can't be to do with the devil well
06:41
i'm glad we finally cleared up whether
06:42
or not it's the mark of the beast
06:46
you do get some hacks in the head though
06:48
there's
06:49
one of the another sort of pioneer of
06:51
this biohacking is a guy called neil
06:53
harbeson
06:54
and his device is mostly in his head and
06:57
it's actually quite useful so sometimes
06:58
these things can correct problems that
07:00
people have
07:00
and so he has achromatopsia which is
07:03
like extreme colorblindness he can't see
07:05
color
07:06
at all he sees everything in grayscale
07:08
and so he's had this antenna
07:10
sort of implanted and then it kind of
07:11
comes over his head
07:13
so it looks like he's wearing one of
07:15
those big reading lights or something
07:18
it's called an ibog and it's mounted
07:21
into his very clever yeah and it's
07:23
mounted into his skull and basically it
07:25
receives signals from the visible and
07:27
the infrared
07:28
light spectrums and then it translates
07:30
them into sounds that he can hear
07:32
and so then he can because he's an
07:33
artist so he needs to be able to paint
07:34
in the right colors
07:35
and so he can match up the colors that
07:37
he's got labeled with the exact colors
07:39
that are around him
07:40
and it's very cool and he also says that
07:42
singing grayscale is more of
07:44
a gift than a curse because you
07:47
see much better at night apparently so
07:50
he sees better at night he has a good
07:51
memory for shapes and they're very
07:53
useful in the military he claims because
07:54
they don't get fooled by camouflage
07:56
so they actually get employed sometimes
07:58
in the military to be able to detect
08:00
stuff
08:00
because you can't you're not fooled by
08:02
camouflage if you're not seeing color
08:04
because you can't do that green leafy
08:06
colored thing looks a lot like all the
08:08
other leaves but surely
08:09
absolutely everything looks like
08:11
absolutely everything else
08:18
yeah i don't know if i trust neil at all
08:20
but that's his claim
08:23
um there are smart gravestones these
08:26
days
08:26
so in johannesburg sometimes uh thieves
08:29
will steal
08:30
slabs of marble because they can be very
08:32
valuable so
08:33
these days the smart graves they have a
08:35
microchip in them
08:36
and if someone tampers with the
08:37
smartgrave it sets off an alarm it calls
08:40
security and it texts
08:42
the relatives of the deceased i think
08:46
i would just make it go
08:50
get off my gravestone you can't you
08:52
can't text the robber
08:56
that only works if the relative
08:57
relatives have turned up
08:59
just oh you mean as soon as it gets
09:02
tampered with
09:04
that's even better that's even better
09:08
it couldn't be it couldn't be that hard
09:10
to rig up just a single hand
09:12
about a foot below the soil to just go
09:16
that is a brilliant idea yeah so good
09:19
yeah although it's gonna freak you out
09:21
every time you visit your grandma's
09:23
grave
09:25
oh god i knew i shouldn't step on that
09:26
bit
09:28
um it's very hard to put a chip a
09:31
microchip of this kind
09:32
into a starfish bizarrely and are they
09:35
crying out for this biohacking as well
09:38
that's why that's why you never see a
09:40
starfish on the train it's because it
09:41
doesn't have the
09:42
chip very sad that's because you can't
09:45
get the oyster in there is that one
09:51
no this is so this was in um it was in a
09:54
university in southern denmark and they
09:55
put a microchip inside a
09:57
starfish and they came back to the tank
09:58
a few days later and it was laying there
10:00
at the bottom of the tank and they
10:01
thought that's so weird it's expelled
10:03
the chip from for how did how did this
10:05
happen so they put chips
10:07
into 53 other of these starfish
10:10
to see what would happen and they
10:11
monitored it and they noticed that it
10:13
took days but it just moved it slowly
10:15
out the body but not through the point
10:17
of entry
10:18
which is the most obvious place for it
10:19
to go back out it went almost in the
10:21
opposite direction
10:22
and it would move ten percent of the
10:24
distance uh from where it was put in
10:26
every day to be expelled and it has no
10:29
problems doing it no pain as far as they
10:30
can tell maybe they thought the people
10:32
who put it in were guarding the entrance
10:34
yes gotta go out the back
10:37
i have a really quick fact about um
10:39
microchips and about the inventions of
10:41
microchip so this is a fact from the
10:43
times newspaper
10:44
and it's about transistors you know the
10:46
tiny switches that you get on microchips
10:47
so
10:48
you used to be able to get thousands on
10:50
then you could get millions
10:51
these days you can get 30 billion
10:53
switches on an area of microchip the
10:55
size of a fingernail
10:57
30 billion wow yeah so this is the fact
11:00
of the times because obviously
11:01
um you know transistors have had to get
11:03
a lot smaller over the years for this to
11:04
be possible
11:05
the fact is if a house had shrunk at the
11:08
same pace that transistors have
11:10
you would not be able to see the house
11:11
without a microscope
11:14
oh that's how much they've shrunk over
11:16
the years and that is actually a lot
11:18
like
11:19
the most expensive flats in london these
11:20
days
11:21
[Laughter]
11:25
i just one one tiny thing i wanted to
11:27
say about biohacking is that it really
11:29
serves a purpose
11:30
for people who have had certain problems
11:32
as i said before
11:33
and it serves a particular purpose if
11:35
you've had legs amputated or arms
11:37
amputated and you have prosthesis and
11:39
this kind of smart technology
11:40
means that they can be really advanced
11:42
so i was looking at some people who've
11:44
had
11:44
smart technology implants like that and
11:47
there's a personal trainer called jack
11:48
ayers
11:49
and he was talking about the different
11:51
prosthetic legacy house so
11:52
there are these companies which provide
11:54
prosthetics for every occasion
11:56
so you can buy a whole bunch and he said
11:58
i've got my water leg that i wakeboard
12:01
in
12:01
i've got my sports leg which is just a
12:03
roughy tufty smash it up and it won't
12:05
break
12:05
he said he's got an electric leg which
12:07
is just for walking but you don't really
12:09
run in it i've got a spare mechanical
12:11
leg
12:11
and then there's a pause and then he
12:13
says of course i've got my most
12:14
important leg i've got my wooden
12:15
pirate's legs
12:24
it is time for fact number two and that
12:26
is james
12:27
okay my fact this week is that queen
12:30
elizabeth the first
12:32
ladies in waiting would try on her
12:34
underwear every morning to make sure it
12:36
hadn't been poisoned
12:40
what a quick thinking excuse from that
12:43
maid when the queen came in
12:45
i wish i thought of that when my wife
12:47
called me that time
12:50
that didn't happen but how how um
12:54
how would that work how long would they
12:55
have to wear the underpants for before
12:57
they knew
12:58
oh good question so um first of all
13:01
we it's it's quite controversial what
13:03
kind of underwear um
13:04
queen elizabeth war because it wasn't
13:06
very common that women would wear
13:08
underwear in those days especially not
13:10
um very wealthy women
13:12
but we do know we we know according to
13:13
her accounts that she did have
13:15
some draws or you know knickers but she
13:18
definitely had stockings she definitely
13:19
had corsets
13:20
and in 1560 there was um her secretary
13:23
of state who was called william cecil
13:25
she was worried that the catholics were
13:26
coming to poison her
13:28
and he realized that the back doors of
13:30
the chambers were kind of places where
13:32
servants came in and out and no one
13:33
really
13:34
paid attention to the laundresses and to
13:36
the tailors and the wardrobers
13:38
so he thought this was a perfect way
13:40
that someone would be able to poison her
13:42
and so they decided that they were going
13:43
to do this and so the lazy ways would
13:46
try on the royal underpants
13:47
and they would wait to see if there was
13:48
any burning sensation
13:50
um they didn't know about thrush back
13:54
then
13:55
so that would be the worst thing
13:59
wouldn't they if
13:59
you know if they had thrush and then
14:01
just someone gets executed
14:03
some laundress actually i always think
14:05
that with food tasters what if you get
14:07
your food taster who's allergic to
14:08
peanuts or something
14:10
oh yeah well this was the weird thing
14:12
the food tasters they went
14:14
way further than we would think of a
14:16
food taster now just trying it a bit
14:18
so um you they would sometimes kiss
14:21
and lick the plates and the cups and the
14:24
cutlery
14:24
of the king all his cutlery was
14:27
pre-licked
14:28
all his plates everything and apparently
14:30
they would have to go kissing everything
14:32
they had to kiss the tablecloth
14:33
um the seat the cushion on the seat
14:36
everything
14:37
so i think yeah cause louis xiv employed
14:39
324 people specifically for that didn't
14:42
he
14:43
a big team of people if you've got to
14:45
lick every bit of
14:46
cup that's dinner's going to go cold if
14:49
it's one guy
14:52
edward the sixth of england had servants
14:54
test his chamber pot
14:56
to see it was poisoned and i don't know
14:58
how they tested that
15:01
there's a splashback that's going to get
15:03
him
15:05
uh maybe no i think it was that you
15:07
sneak in you powder a pounder
15:11
henry viii had a similar thing so the
15:12
idea is that there are poisons that can
15:14
leach into your skin
15:15
if you get your bare skin on them so he
15:17
might sit down on the chamber part of it
15:19
yes i remember ages ago on the podcast
15:21
we spoke about a
15:22
um i think it was a king who sat down on
15:24
the toilet but there was an assassin
15:26
underneath who put a sword up his bun
15:27
[Music]
15:29
that's a slightly different thing
15:32
like you're not going around the king
15:34
has been poisoned
15:41
you're not getting a like a taster who
15:43
goes around and then he's got a massive
15:44
sword through his tongue
15:45
and he's going oh tried to lick the
15:47
toilet again did you
15:50
it's true that's why they call it
15:51
arsenic i think
15:55
[Applause]
15:58
but she was she was paranoid elizabeth
16:00
or actually she wasn't paranoid but it
16:02
was cecil who was paranoid and so he was
16:04
the person who looked over her
16:06
final years and he does sort of sound
16:08
like a
16:09
pervert and i'm sure he wasn't but when
16:11
he makes this
16:12
he's not going to sue us now he is
16:14
you're right he's bloody pervert
16:16
um so yeah he he ruled that all garments
16:19
that touched her body bear
16:21
would be circumspectly looked into and
16:24
um
16:25
he used to warn her about all these
16:26
poisoning threats which there were
16:28
coming from all around the continent she
16:29
had lots of enemies at one point he
16:31
warned her that they'd been threatened
16:33
by the prospect of a poisoner who was
16:35
going to be a burly italian man
16:37
with a black beard called stefano
16:42
just look out for that
16:46
um so did you know the method that they
16:48
had to detect poison because as well as
16:50
testers and
16:50
and like the king's 300 official liquors
16:53
they had
16:55
um they had unicorn horns or what was
16:57
supposedly unicorn horns obviously they
16:59
weren't
17:00
um but you would wave it over your food
17:02
like a wand at an airport
17:04
or a security wand or a tube station or
17:06
a tube like
17:08
imagine a oh yes i got it
17:13
nice so they would wave it over food and
17:16
allegedly if there was poison in the
17:17
food
17:18
the unicorn horn would sweat and start
17:20
shaking
17:21
and we now know what these were they
17:23
were uh the tusks of
17:24
narwhals you know the numbers yes whales
17:27
yeah
17:28
yeah and pope boniface had a stash of
17:31
knives allegedly
17:32
uh made from narwhal or they were they
17:34
were made from narwhal and so if you
17:36
touched your food and it had poison then
17:39
your cutlery would start to sweat
17:40
yeah and they would fully disintegrate
17:42
if you poured something into them and
17:44
they just fell to pieces or exploded
17:46
that it was thought that was signified
17:48
that something was poisoned
17:49
but they were sought after and royalty
17:51
loved them so there was a british
17:52
explorer called martin frobisher
17:54
and he did a big expedition and he came
17:57
back in 1577 with a six foot long tusk
17:59
and he said it came from a unicorn of
18:01
the sea
18:02
which again was a narwhal um and the way
18:05
he tested
18:06
if it had the ability to neutralize
18:08
poison is he put a whole bunch of
18:09
spiders inside it and he said all the
18:11
spiders had died
18:12
and therefore it's a poison tester and
18:17
very cool the queen elizabeth kept it
18:19
next to the crown jewels
18:20
as like she really valued that highly
18:22
yeah you know cleopatra
18:24
yeah she killed herself uh supposedly
18:26
with an asp
18:28
snake biting her uh but the story about
18:31
her death is that she experimented first
18:33
with the idea of poisoning herself with
18:35
deadly nightshade the plant
18:37
and apparently she asked a slave to try
18:39
the juice
18:41
and she then observed the slave and
18:43
found that the death was not as quick
18:44
and painless as she would like
18:47
so she then went with the snake instead
18:52
okay it is time for fact number three
18:54
and that
18:55
is chozinski my fact this week is that
18:57
the world champion
18:58
polo player builds swimming pools for
19:01
his horses whenever they get injured
19:03
and it's so sweet actually sorry he
19:06
builds a new swimming pool
19:07
every time it gets injured yeah i i
19:09
think he builds one for each new horse
19:11
that gets injured because you can't
19:13
share a swimming pool as a horse
19:17
so um not to contradict you but i do
19:20
think it's just one swimming pool that
19:22
he gets them to swim in
19:23
because he has a lot of horses he in
19:25
fact i think has the most privately
19:27
owned amount of horses
19:28
he does although you do have to have
19:29
multiple pools and in fact so this is a
19:31
guy called adolfo cambiazzo who's this
19:34
amazing argentinian guy who's been the
19:36
world leader in polo for twenty actually
19:38
i was just wondering do you think he
19:40
has misunderstood how to play water polo
19:48
another team drowned again today
19:52
amazing he's world champion he's never
19:54
understood the rules
19:57
um but yeah he loves his horses and so
19:59
he like breeds he breeds them all
20:01
all the horses that he competes with he
20:03
breeds personally and he
20:04
grows special grass for them and feeds
20:06
them this special diet on his massive
20:08
farms
20:09
and he says if they have a little bit of
20:10
pain uh or if they have a pulled muscle
20:12
then
20:12
i dig a swimming pool for them where
20:14
they do laps and in fact
20:16
i was i emailed today our producer at qi
20:20
who is called piers fletcher and he is
20:22
very into polo
20:23
so i was asking him about this and he
20:25
was saying this is actually quite common
20:26
to give top-end horses hydrotherapy so
20:28
it's
20:29
kind of these small pools which are
20:30
basically like a lock in a canal
20:32
and with a treadmill at the bottom of
20:34
them and they just walk along them and
20:36
they exercise against the resistance of
20:38
water
20:38
wow or in pears's case he used to just
20:40
pull horses through the middle of a
20:42
river because that's the poor man's
20:43
place that's why we're doing it yeah
20:44
he this guy also he's very big into
20:47
cloning horses
20:48
he's done it many times he's he's got
20:50
one horse that he's cloned 14 times
20:53
and it because he loves these horses and
20:55
um what's amazing about this it's said
20:57
that
20:57
this particular horse that he's had done
20:58
14 times that during matches
21:01
he'll even swap to a different cloned
21:03
horse
21:05
that's like a tennis player changing a
21:06
racket for the exact same racket it's
21:08
weird the horse swapping so i didn't
21:10
realize that in polo you just swap
21:11
pauses constantly
21:12
so it split into these sections called
21:15
chuckers and
21:16
it's sort of between four and eight
21:19
about i think it's about seven and a
21:20
half minute periods that are called
21:21
chukkas that constitute a match in polo
21:24
and if you're a professional you'll use
21:25
at least one horsepower chuckle
21:27
sometimes two
21:28
and you'll just quickly go and swap a
21:29
horse so yeah he's got all these clones
21:31
and he's constantly like you know number
21:33
one number seven
21:34
number five of the same same variety
21:37
amazing he's supposed what was his name
21:38
that guy
21:39
uh he's called adolfo cambianzo oh yeah
21:41
he's supposed to be
21:42
is he the best polo player in the world
21:44
yeah the last 22. i read
21:46
i read that sometimes um he can gallop
21:49
at 40 miles an hour for the entire
21:51
length of the polo field
21:53
bouncing the ball on his mallet with no
21:55
one able to get anywhere near him before
21:57
he just hits it into the goal
21:58
wow and the other players like him so
22:01
much i think he's so great that they'll
22:02
just watch him play instead of tackling
22:04
him
22:07
that's incredible imagine playing
22:09
against federer just standing there
22:10
being like that's fantastic sir
22:14
this guy uh cambiasso he's quite humble
22:16
because
22:17
is he argentinian he grew up in
22:20
argentina
22:21
and he was interviewed by the financial
22:23
times in 2011
22:24
and he said i will never be a
22:25
millionaire and i don't want to be
22:28
and then the reporter pointed out that
22:29
he is a millionaire
22:33
many many many times older
22:37
so that well there is another kind of um
22:39
polo where
22:40
you i don't think can change your animal
22:42
halfway through and that's elephant polo
22:45
so i spent a bit of today this happens a
22:48
lot
22:49
particularly in southeast asia so it's
22:51
different in some ways the mallets have
22:53
to be a lot longer
22:54
that's one element of the game of course
22:57
of course
22:57
all the bowl would have to be massive
22:59
yes
23:00
[Laughter]
23:02
or the elephant's tiny yeah so
23:05
they chose that workaround the long
23:07
mallet probably simplest
23:09
um but i just i started reading the
23:11
rules the official rules of elephant
23:13
polo today and they're just quite nice
23:15
you know so
23:16
um they obviously have to have a rule
23:17
for what happens if you fall off your
23:18
elephant halfway through
23:21
they just stop um but um
23:24
but also you have to wear a traditional
23:26
hat while you're playing elephant polo
23:28
that's really important can it be any
23:30
traditional hat
23:30
like no no it's like some people with a
23:34
sombrero
23:36
they're really strict it has to be a
23:37
solo topi or oh sorry or any other polo
23:39
hat there you go it could be any hat
23:42
just have to wear a hat
23:44
[Music]
23:46
but if you're it says here should a
23:48
players or elephant driver's hat fall
23:50
off the game is not stopped
23:51
but the hat must be recovered
23:53
immediately
23:55
players and elephant drivers must not
23:56
continue play without a hat being worn i
23:59
don't know why it's so important
24:00
what are you joking you don't know why
24:02
you need to wear a hat if you're riding
24:04
in a quite violent and very fast-paced
24:06
game on the back of an elephant
24:08
i think it's a protection it's like a
24:09
helmet isn't it i think it's i didn't
24:11
realize that okay
24:12
yeah yeah
24:19
are you going to look like a right
24:20
when you come up with your
24:21
sombrero
24:26
so they stop play if they come off today
24:28
because in horse polo
24:30
you don't stop play if you fall off but
24:32
you did used to
24:33
so this is actually something that our
24:35
friend pierce told me that it used to be
24:37
that as soon as someone falls off you
24:38
have to stop but
24:39
in 1936 a british player called humphrey
24:43
guinness
24:44
so he was playing a match and he thought
24:45
they were literally about to score the
24:46
opposition was about to score a girl the
24:48
ball was heading towards the goal
24:49
and so he just hurled himself off his
24:51
horse
24:52
and you have to stop so they had to
24:54
disqualify the goal and then after that
24:56
they said maybe we should change that
24:58
rule with these
24:59
british are involved
25:02
um we're gonna have to move on in a
25:04
second guys so our final thing um if you
25:05
really wanted to reclaim
25:07
the traditional polo image you could
25:08
play uh kokoburu which
25:10
is kyrgyzstani traditional polo um
25:14
so the ball is a dead goat
25:18
and the whole game is basically
25:20
everyone's on a horse
25:21
and you're just it's really tiring to
25:24
play obviously
25:25
because especially for the goat
25:30
most of the game is just you and your
25:31
team trying to pick up the goat
25:33
uh and the other team is also trying to
25:35
pick up the goats you're just wrestling
25:36
it weighs about 40 kilos this goat
25:38
you just have to pick it up and carry it
25:40
on your horse to the you have to sort of
25:42
shove it under your leg in the saddle
25:44
that's a hard that's
25:46
that's a real sport that's a really
25:50
silly
25:50
idea there's also you can if you want to
25:53
stay in the uk you can play penny
25:55
farthing polo
25:56
which is actually quite a hardcore sport
25:59
because
26:00
the world leader i think in penny
26:02
falling polo is a guy called neil lawton
26:04
and he's the guy who trained bear grylls
26:06
so he went up everest with bear grylls
26:08
he's been up everest a few times i think
26:10
he's gone around the whole of the uk on
26:11
a jet ski he's flown a june buggy from
26:14
london to tim
26:15
timbuktu he's been on a shackleton
26:17
memorial expedition to antarctica
26:19
and now he is competing in sussex in
26:21
penny farthing polo championships
26:25
sad decline
26:26
[Laughter]
26:28
okay we need to move on to our final
26:30
fact of the show and that is my fact
26:33
my fact this week is to prevent spoilers
26:35
getting out
26:36
some game of thrones scripts were built
26:39
to self-detonate
26:42
yeah that's why they all have such bad
26:44
injuries if you watch it
26:46
it's floated in their hands yeah this
26:48
was revealed by the the guy who played
26:50
jaime lannister in the
26:52
in the show um the idea was
26:53
unfortunately it's not as exciting as a
26:55
mission impossible explosion of a script
26:57
oh i haven't seen that
27:03
i'd say that
27:07
ah damn it yeah that's the big bit of
27:09
the movie
27:10
when tom cruise's script explodes
27:14
he didn't know any of his lines after
27:16
that yeah
27:18
but uh yeah so um it's it is a digital
27:20
script that they all get and as soon as
27:22
the scene has been shot
27:23
a button gets pressed somewhere and
27:25
every single copy disappears explodes
27:27
into
27:28
the cyber web yeah sorry i'm sorry
27:31
wow i'm in a room full of cyborgs and i
27:34
used
27:35
cypress cyber wear blow down yeah you're
27:38
right it is all
27:39
it's all digital though isn't it so it
27:41
means that the only paper on set
27:42
is starbucks cups
27:46
i assume
27:49
i assume that's some sort of spoiler but
27:51
i can't work out
27:53
so they have a real problem with their
27:55
stuff being um
27:56
spoilers so what um people fly drones
27:59
very near where they're filming and this
28:02
is a massive problem because
28:03
they can just spot scenes being filmed
28:05
and you know they can find out that way
28:07
so what game of thrones did when they
28:09
were making it they filmed
28:10
some of their scenes they were in
28:12
northern ireland they filmed some of
28:13
their scenes very close to belfast
28:15
airport because it's a designated no
28:17
drone
28:18
area but surely it's also a designated
28:20
no dragon area
28:21
[Laughter]
28:24
that's true wow is that so are there
28:26
some shots where easyjet just comes
28:28
flying
28:31
they also do have drone zappers for when
28:33
they can't fly near belfast so
28:35
it's a drone killer that can intercept
28:37
like it's a digital thing it can
28:38
intercept drones
28:39
and immediately force them to land wow
28:42
that's scary
28:43
i've had so i haven't seen game of
28:45
thrones has now finished i have been
28:47
trying desperately to avoid spoilers you
28:49
both have seen it james and andy um
28:51
and i thought it was amazing at the very
28:53
end went no
28:55
well so today i was again looking we're
28:57
talking about game of thrones and
28:58
spoilers had to be very careful
29:00
looking and i found that in fact in
29:01
america there is a
29:03
thing whereby if you don't like someone
29:06
you can have
29:07
this website called uh spoiler dot io
29:10
send a spoiler anonymously to someone
29:14
that you hate
29:15
yeah that's terrible yeah
29:19
it costs it costs 99 pence
29:22
sorry 99 pennies american to do this and
29:26
you give them the number and there's an
29:27
faq that i read on the page for
29:29
you know how does this how does this
29:30
work and so you know what would what
29:33
what inspired you to do this they said
29:34
that it was a lady
29:36
who had done this with an ex-boyfriend
29:38
who she hated so much that she just kept
29:39
texting him
29:40
game of thrones spoilers and he thought
29:43
that was amazing i just need to do that
29:45
and the final question of the faq is how
29:47
do you sleep at night
29:49
and the guy wrote pretty well actually i
29:51
have a machine that simulates the sounds
29:53
of the ocean
29:54
so he's fine now here's the thing i
29:57
went to check out the site
29:58
and right at the top was the spoiler of
30:00
how it all ends
30:03
[Applause]
30:05
i didn't set up the site and i guess you
30:08
weren't going onto the site in order to
30:09
spoil your
30:10
what you know that's fair enough yeah
30:12
that's on them um
30:13
the worst people for spoilers are the
30:15
actors in these shows aren't they
30:18
yeah they are not to be relied upon so
30:21
apparently robert downey jr is a
30:22
particular bad one
30:24
so he was involved when he was writing
30:26
on a film a couple of years ago
30:28
and they actually made fake scenes for
30:30
him to help
30:31
write without his knowledge so that he
30:33
wouldn't give away the actual plot
30:34
spoilers yeah
30:36
there's a guy called tom holland who i
30:38
think plays spider-man
30:40
and well you're not going to like him so
30:42
much after this
30:44
he's he's so not trusted because he's
30:46
given away so he's leaked so many plot
30:48
twists in the past
30:49
that he's never given full scripts to
30:51
act out he's just given the scripts bit
30:52
by bit
30:53
and he's also made to act out a whole
30:55
series of fake scenes
30:56
so that he doesn't know which is real
30:58
and which isn't no but it's not it's not
30:59
even that even in the real scenes that
31:01
they're filming
31:02
a lot of the people that he fights are
31:04
cgi characters
31:06
they don't tell him who he's fighting in
31:08
the cgi
31:09
in the real scene he'll be like who am i
31:10
fighting they're like you don't need to
31:12
know
31:12
and he'll say well what shall i do just
31:15
make some kick moves and stuff
31:17
but how big is he they'll give it away
31:18
we can't tell you so he has
31:20
no because he's very famous for he says
31:22
consistently he says that he has to act
31:24
opposite a tennis ball sometimes
31:26
that's just what they use to show him
31:28
where it is
31:29
they're all terrible the avengers
31:31
they're basically terrible at spoilers
31:33
and like because
31:34
even so mark ruffalo for instance um
31:37
complained that he had to do five
31:38
different endings for avengers end game
31:41
so that he wouldn't know which one was
31:42
the real one although in fairness he did
31:44
once accidentally live stream the first
31:46
20 minutes of thor ragnarok on instagram
31:51
[Laughter]
31:56
so um you know am i allowed to spoil
31:59
star wars uh like the original the
32:02
original trilogy guys
32:04
you've had time you've had time to see
32:06
it so this is the really weird thing
32:08
about
32:09
two years before the second star wars
32:11
film was released
32:13
dave prouse who was the huge guy who was
32:15
the physical body
32:16
of darth vader he was speaking at a
32:19
fan event he was speaking to over a
32:21
thousand fans and he started just
32:23
imagining what's going to happen in the
32:25
next few films and he
32:26
joked that at the end of the third film
32:29
it would be revealed that luke and
32:31
darth vader were father and son he
32:33
revealed this two years before the film
32:34
came out
32:35
no one knew at this point wait so he he
32:37
that wasn't a coincidence he
32:39
he didn't tell you
32:46
he wrote an autobiography which was
32:47
called straight from the force's mouth
32:52
which is good i thought a better title
32:54
would have been the empire strikes
32:55
hardback
32:56
that would have been and i i told that
32:59
someone who met him and he went
33:04
apparently yeah token attempted being
33:07
polite
33:08
yeah um spoilers obviously
33:11
can be it's hugely irritating if you
33:13
follow something and you you have a
33:15
spoiler
33:16
uh get told to you and it can really
33:18
bring up anger and
33:19
in fact there was a story that was in
33:20
the paper a few years back where in
33:22
antarctica
33:22
two russian science researchers who were
33:25
living there
33:25
there was a stabbing incident and the
33:27
reason was because
33:29
one of the science colleagues kept
33:30
revealing the ending of all the books
33:32
that this guy was planning to read
33:35
and it got so aggravating that he
33:37
stabbed him
33:39
the guy survived um but yeah that's
33:42
well things get pretty tense on
33:44
antarctica don't they yeah other
33:46
spoilers the first
33:47
use of the word spoiler to mean what we
33:49
mean it today what it is today
33:51
was in 1971 it was in a magazine called
33:53
national lampoon
33:55
and the idea was they were going to put
33:56
the spoilers of horror movies
33:58
so it would reduce the risk of
34:00
unsettling and dangerous suspense
34:03
in their viewers so if you didn't really
34:05
want to be shocked by a movie you could
34:06
read these spoilers and it would tell
34:08
you what was going to happen oh really
34:09
so you're actually doing someone a favor
34:11
yeah it was their idea yeah
34:13
well there are there have been studies
34:14
which have claimed different things
34:15
about whether spoilers are
34:18
affect your mood and your enjoyment of
34:20
the thing um some studies say
34:22
that spoilers make you enjoy a story
34:24
more because you sort of you know
34:26
what's going to happen you don't know
34:27
how they're going to get there and
34:28
another study has claimed that it makes
34:30
you enjoy a story
34:30
much less and that you get really
34:33
consistently you find it less fun
34:35
uh if you know what's going to happen
34:36
but the ones who say that you enjoy it
34:38
more i
34:38
think are complete i have to
34:40
say because that they make you read a
34:41
short story and they just tell you at
34:43
the start what the end is whereas
34:45
the whole thing is that it's something
34:46
that you've been invested in and built
34:48
up to over weeks and weeks isn't it so
34:49
you can't really
34:50
simulate that then you love dickens of
34:52
course which and they have spoilers at
34:54
the start of every chapter don't they
34:55
they tell you what's gonna happen
34:56
they do yeah but it's not i don't i
34:59
don't love him
35:00
like for the thrill i don't know if the
35:01
big reveals at the end of every chapter
35:04
although that used to be such a big
35:05
thing so spoilers sort of the idea of a
35:07
spoiler came about in the mid 19th
35:09
century really and the concept that that
35:11
might be a really bad thing to reveal
35:12
the ending
35:13
but just before that dickens was writing
35:15
the old curiosity shop
35:17
and there's and i'm really sorry if you
35:19
haven't read this but i'm afraid
35:20
you're too late so there's this little
35:22
nell is perilously ill
35:24
at one point in the old curiosity shop
35:26
and you probably know it was released in
35:27
installments
35:28
and the installments got to america
35:30
after they had been released in britain
35:32
and people were so desperate to know
35:34
what happened to little nell because
35:36
they just knew that she was ill
35:37
that whenever the british people arrived
35:39
in the new york docks and started
35:40
disembarking the ships they would riot
35:43
they would literally write at the docks
35:44
begging them to tell them what would
35:46
happen to little nell
35:47
and they'd be screaming is she is she
35:48
alive is she alive
35:50
wow and you actually you didn't give
35:52
anything away about whether she was
35:53
uh alive or not no i didn't you're right
35:56
you're right she dies
35:59
[Applause]
36:00
[Music]
36:02
um we're going to have to wrap up very
36:03
shortly a couple of really quick things
36:05
about game of thrones yeah yeah let's go
36:06
for it um
36:07
so this is uh i can't quite believe this
36:10
but
36:10
um so a lot of it's filmed in northern
36:12
ireland because it has the right kind of
36:13
terrain and stuff
36:14
uh according to the la times almost one
36:18
percent of the population of northern
36:19
ireland has been an extra in game of
36:21
thrones
36:22
wow and there's 1.9 million people who
36:25
live there
36:26
i've got a friend who was in game of
36:27
thrones really and he was there
36:29
the whole time and literally you cannot
36:31
see him at all
36:32
because they just have so many extras
36:34
and they're just the battle scenes are
36:36
so massive
36:37
yeah so i've seen him dressed as a
36:39
dothraki but
36:40
we just never saw him on screen at all
36:42
right believe me we tried
36:43
[Laughter]
36:45
in china they uh it's very common that
36:48
people will
36:49
download it illegally and that's because
36:51
you can watch it legally
36:52
but china disapproves of all sex
36:54
violence and supernatural horror
36:59
so in 2014 one internet
37:03
person said that okay they've caught all
37:05
the fight scenes all the nude scenes
37:07
all the dragons uh i guess that's okay
37:09
if all you want to watch is a medieval
37:11
european castle documentary
37:16
that's so good and you're playing it
37:18
pretty fast and loose with the word
37:19
documentary i think
37:22
i like that initially it was meant to be
37:23
a short story
37:25
no really when he started writing it he
37:27
thought this is going to be a great
37:28
short story
37:28
and then he's like well this is still
37:30
going what's going on here and
37:32
here we are all these years later um one
37:34
of my favorite things is that during the
37:36
filming this is just a little filming
37:37
fact about it um
37:38
emilia clarke uh who played mother of
37:40
dragons um
37:42
she uh was doused in so much fake blood
37:44
during a
37:45
scene um where she has to eat a horse's
37:47
heart um that during a break when she
37:49
went to the toilet she was so covered in
37:51
this blood that she couldn't
37:52
get herself off the toilet she was stuck
37:56
there as a
37:57
yeah the blood had sort of just
37:58
congealed
38:00
if only she'd had a toilet yes
38:05
does she does she die in the end via
38:07
sword up the bun by any chance
38:10
don't tell me don't tell me don't tell
38:11
me imagine if the answer was yes
38:16
that's how they all die
38:21
that would be amazing that would be
38:22
incredible if there's just one character
38:24
that you never see but he's just a
38:25
serial
38:26
sword of the bug murderer
38:30
the liquor he's the only other guy who
38:32
survived
38:33
never see him because he's busy licking
38:35
all over
38:39

01:07
think so yeah go to richchange.com you
01:09
can find out where i'm coming
01:10
amazing and uh most importantly of all
01:13
you've got a fact
01:14
so we're gonna start with fact number
01:15
one and that is richard harry here's my
01:18
fact
01:18
adolf hitler had size 13 feet
01:23
which i discovered this week uh on my
01:26
own podcast
01:27
uh because i'm obsessed with the film
01:30
the cobbler
01:30
starring what adam sandler yeah in which
01:33
adam sandler inherits a magical cobbling
01:35
machine
01:36
if you're interested in this stand just
01:38
listen to any of richard's podcast
01:40
it's literally everywhere in which if he
01:42
puts on the feet of the shoes of
01:43
someone whose shoes have been cobbled on
01:45
that machine he turns into that person
01:47
which is fine so i asked people who they
01:48
would turn into but you've got to have
01:49
the same size feet so it's
01:51
quite a hard question to answer unless
01:53
you know
01:54
especially for adolf hitler yeah well my
01:55
guest said you know who knows how you
01:57
know how big was adolf hitler's
01:59
feat for example and we didn't know but
02:00
then someone googled it and it was
02:02
size 13 which just seems it seems big
02:05
massive for
02:06
what i thought was a very short man but
02:08
he's five foot eight
02:09
five foot nine something like nice 165
02:12
centimeters but
02:13
size 13 is because gigantic yeah stephen
02:16
fry has size 13 feet doesn't
02:17
he and he's what six foot six and
02:19
something like that usain bolt he has
02:21
size 13 feet
02:22
is he tall usain bolt yeah famously yeah
02:25
yeah
02:26
it's hard to tell because they're it's
02:27
just so fast you can't see it
02:29
well meg ryan who is i believe the same
02:32
height as hitler
02:33
um five foot eight i don't think that's
02:34
the brush we can tie her with
02:37
it's on her cv it's the top line i
02:40
believe my ride's safe she's five foot
02:41
eight and she has big feet she's got
02:43
11 she's wearing size 11 shoes wow yeah
02:46
that's huge is that a us-11
02:48
yeah will be hang on that's completely
02:50
different i take back a lot of myself
02:52
well i don't know if the adolf hitler 13
02:55
is u.s or
02:55
euro or english isn't there somewhere
02:57
isn't there is it
02:58
usa or europe where they're in the 40s
03:01
that's yeah that's the european that's
03:02
european
03:02
i
03:14
yeah actually rich what is your source
03:15
for this fact well google
03:17
okay but then google just said what size
03:20
are out of it
03:21
it says 13. one says 13 and a half
03:24
and uh then i found a 56 page
03:28
medical report from the cia that was
03:30
based on
03:31
the doctor who had seen hitler over from
03:34
1936
03:35
to his death and he had a lot of facts
03:38
on and i've read
03:39
how many balls he had well that was that
03:41
was i was interested to look into that
03:42
and
03:42
it says there's nothing wrong with this
03:44
genitalia which is uh
03:46
he had a farting problem from that
03:47
medical report right i could tell him
03:49
yeah he was
03:50
very flatulent what was it gastro
03:52
problems in his tummy
03:54
all information he had as well so he had
03:55
a very blocked nose
03:57
oh no no i don't think
04:01
i don't think we're making that noise
04:02
not yet not about hitler poor old hitler
04:05
he was uh i did his bmi in 1936 it came
04:08
out 22.5 which is a pretty good bmi
04:11
i think that's i think that's my bmw is
04:13
it yeah you got the same as hitler
04:14
it's not the top line of your cv though
04:16
i'm afraid it is um
04:18
but it's kind of weird because you start
04:19
i started looking up the historical
04:21
figures and you can't find anyone's
04:23
foot size it's something that's not
04:24
really recorded very really yeah you're
04:26
right you can find celebrities sometimes
04:27
if they've got big or small feet
04:29
yeah that's um you tried to look up a
04:31
lot of celebrity
04:32
foot sizes and you just found a load of
04:34
fetish sites you
04:35
just there are lots of people who have
04:37
these websites where they're interested
04:38
in celebrities feet
04:40
uh and i wish you have your voice
04:41
slightly broke when you said that
04:43
well i'm i'm now embarrassed
04:48
i was reading about um celebrity shoes
04:51
and there's a little theory
04:52
uh so i don't know if we can class um
04:54
hitler in the celebrity
04:56
yeah we can put him in there right so um
04:58
celebrities when they go he's not going
05:00
on celebrity
05:01
you know get me out of here yeah yeah
05:02
anybody would now that's the point all
05:04
those
05:04
that kind of level of the politician
05:06
that's the way they become successful he
05:08
would be all over do you think he's like
05:09
the harry redknapp i think he's like ann
05:11
whidicum of
05:12
his day yeah so um a thing that is
05:15
uh that i read that certain celebrities
05:17
do when they're going on the red carpet
05:19
is they often wear
05:20
much larger shoes than their foot size
05:22
that's a common thing in hollywood
05:23
because
05:24
well often when you're going out you're
05:26
wearing new shoes aren't you and you
05:27
haven't broken them in
05:28
so if you're wearing a shoe that fits
05:29
your foot perfectly you're going to get
05:31
blisters you're going to mess up your
05:32
feet
05:33
so when you're on the red carpet there's
05:34
often photos of celebrities who've got
05:36
huge gaps at the back of their heels
05:38
if it's if it's a woman wearing heels no
05:40
yeah and they will just fall off
05:42
constantly on the red carpet it's all an
05:43
episode of cinderella
05:44
every time someone walks down it's just
05:47
it's a j-lo does it yeah it's a it's a
05:49
thing
05:49
no it's a thing wow okay apparently you
05:52
know
05:53
the more you say it the more likely it
05:55
will be to be true if there are any
05:57
celebrities out there please write in
05:58
and let us know everyone knows
05:59
everybody's listening to this show no
06:01
that's absolutely right and quite right
06:02
from them um their our feet are getting
06:05
bigger
06:06
apparently which i find really weird but
06:08
there was a survey done in 1951
06:10
i think and it looked into people's shoe
06:13
sizes as well as other stuff
06:14
and apparently the average suit size for
06:16
a woman then was size
06:18
three which is insane because i don't
06:21
know any women with size three feet
06:22
kylie minogue
06:24
i don't know her though she's probably
06:27
listening though
06:28
so is it true that we're evolving that
06:30
way because maybe only big-footed women
06:32
are having sex and having children yeah
06:34
bigfoot of women became incredibly sexy
06:36
in the late 50s
06:37
and yeah we bred out the small footed
06:39
ones it was a great triumph
06:41
i the theory is uh the explanation i
06:44
read
06:45
is that we're getting fatter and so
06:47
we're pushing
06:48
ourselves down on our feet and we're
06:50
flattening our arms what i don't know it
06:52
is to do with body size increasing they
06:54
think i actually think those studies
06:55
must have also been flawed because i
06:56
don't believe shoe size has gone up
06:57
three sizes so now the average for a
06:59
girl is size six
07:01
but it's not like we've all got tiny
07:03
skeleton feet and massive
07:04
flabby fat it's not about the fatness
07:07
it's about the arch
07:08
being pressed down spreads out a bit so
07:11
you do get you get wider feet as well
07:13
for example and also
07:14
the other reason is better nutrition
07:16
yeah if you're a child and you have
07:18
better nutrition you will just be bigger
07:20
and that means
07:20
your feet will be bigger as well dan you
07:23
were like this like one retailer called
07:24
it
07:24
bigfoot britain nice
07:28
that is very cool i did do some i got
07:30
sidetracked doing bigfoot research while
07:32
i was
07:32
doing this well the links came up i had
07:35
to read it you know
07:36
the investigation continues wait does
07:38
bigfoot actually have
07:39
big feet yeah hence his name well i've
07:42
never actually pictured his feet
07:44
does he have a big feet for a big foot
07:45
that's the question yeah
07:47
in the 50s bigfoot had was just called
07:49
foot
07:50
[Laughter]
07:53
do you know who had the biggest feat of
07:54
all time no it's the tallest man of all
07:57
time who is called robert wadlow
07:59
uh he had size 37
08:02
or 36 uk size feet he had real problems
08:06
finding shoes obviously because he was
08:07
the only person in the world with this
08:09
eyeshadows
08:11
and he um he's imagining him walking
08:13
past a clark's
08:14
sale and thinking maybe this time
08:16
[Laughter]
08:18
oh well he when he was at high school he
08:20
wanted to play sport he wanted to play
08:21
basketball because he thought he could
08:23
stand next to the hoop and just put his
08:24
hand
08:25
over the hoop to stop anyone from
08:27
scoring yeah
08:28
but he couldn't get training shoes made
08:30
quickly enough so he could never play
08:32
as a speaker well he's only standing by
08:34
the thing he was just
08:37
some socks is there a rule that says you
08:41
have to wear
08:41
shoes that must be it must have been
08:43
worth building making those shoes in
08:45
order to have that guy
08:46
blocking the
08:50
chicken we can win every game there
08:52
could be some six-year-old
08:54
worse it's going to be nil nil
08:55
[Laughter]
08:57
yeah you'd squeeze your feet in he
08:59
should have done an ugly sister you can
09:00
bend them over
09:02
and apparently most people do surveys
09:03
always say that something like
09:05
40 of women say they wear smaller shoes
09:08
and
09:08
they should which again i'm very
09:10
skeptical about so i don't really know
09:11
anyone who doesn't wear their shoe size
09:12
but
09:13
do they just claim that their shoes are
09:15
smaller than they are to seem more
09:17
dainty
09:18
no because that no because they're
09:20
saying i've got big feet but i'm wearing
09:21
small shoes and it's really painful
09:22
you can't go to a shop and say i'm size
09:25
three and they're just shoving it on
09:27
are you sure no no definitely three well
09:29
they do that's the idea because people
09:30
are
09:30
embarrassed so apparently um you reach a
09:33
ceiling at nine as a woman i don't know
09:35
what it is as a man and however large
09:36
your feet are above that you just go for
09:38
a size nine because it's too
09:39
embarrassing
09:40
um so a lot of people i think men just
09:42
like to have bigger feet don't they they
09:44
pretend that they're bigger because it's
09:45
more masculine to have bigger things
09:46
because of that fictional correlation
09:48
thing
09:48
yes it's really interesting because i i
09:50
sort of vaguely assumed that
09:52
there was something in the foot size to
09:53
um to penis size thing
09:55
and lots of studies have just found
09:57
nothing
09:58
no correlation rather
10:04
it's all based on studies um where so
10:07
for example a study of
10:09
uh 104 men by university college london
10:11
they measured penises when both soft
10:13
and gently stretched and they
10:16
found no correlation i actually measure
10:18
my penis on one of those shoe sizes
10:21
what are you fitting it for
10:25
you've been kicked out of so many clarks
10:27
branches
10:29
okay who around this table would go back
10:31
in time to kill hitler if you could
10:33
um anyone uh dandy you were doing that
10:37
yes
10:38
i wouldn't because i understand the
10:39
butterfly effect if you killed him none
10:41
of us would exist yeah i read a ben
10:43
elton novel
10:44
where this was none of the novels don't
10:47
get me into
10:48
alternate histories none of them work if
10:50
you change one thing in history
10:52
certainly that long ago of that
10:53
magnitude especially then yeah
10:55
nobody is the same nobody who's alive
10:57
now would be alive
10:58
that's because different people would
11:00
have hooked up different people be alive
11:01
and dead there'd be different children
11:02
none of us would be because my parents
11:04
both met up over the love of hitler
11:08
yeah they were both buying nazi
11:10
memorabilia just how many people went to
11:12
war in the second world war with one
11:14
partner
11:14
who then ended up having children with
11:16
someone else because they were dead
11:17
that's the first thing but even
11:18
you know but just even if you meet
11:20
someone a day after have sex
11:21
two minutes later that's a different
11:23
person coming out that's true
11:25
i just don't think that this podcast is
11:26
about discussing these huge
11:27
philosophical questions you've posed
11:29
james
11:30
well i'm already getting weirded out so
11:33
the fact is that men
11:34
are more likely than women to say that
11:36
they'll go back to kill hitler
11:38
and the reason according to
11:39
psychologists is men prefer utilitarian
11:41
ideas and women
11:43
prefer deontological arguments so men
11:46
are more likely to do things that help
11:47
everyone
11:48
and women are more likely to think well
11:50
actually there are moral reasons why i
11:52
shouldn't do this particular thing
11:53
never mind what the outcome is yeah also
11:55
it's always baby hitler
11:57
you always go back and kill hitler as a
11:59
baby and women are going to go no i'm
12:00
not going to do that because i think a
12:02
few men would like to
12:03
mind killing babies can i clarify i'm
12:04
not in that case
12:08
i would go back and honorably challenge
12:10
hitler when he was at his absolute
12:11
physical peak
12:13
well what is that going to do us
12:17
how old would you let hitler get to
12:18
before you kill him
12:20
um i'd say after his first world war
12:23
service
12:23
i would say it's probably too late
12:25
because then the nazi party i think you
12:26
should
12:27
aim for probably when you could just
12:28
about beat him at your current
12:30
so maybe when he's about 14. i reckon
12:34
you could beat 14 year old hitler yeah
12:35
he was pretty weak he's
12:36
his name he couldn't breathe properly
12:38
yeah with those feet though he
12:40
just crushed you you know exactly um
12:43
sorry just to clarify i would actually
12:45
like to go back to weimar germany and
12:47
improve the social
12:48
uh and economic conditions to the point
12:50
at which
12:51
hitler doesn't get a chance i had no
12:53
grievance to exploit
12:55
such a shame i'm going to cut this out
12:57
[Laughter]
13:00
hitler was um hitler was very
13:03
unfashionable
13:04
apparently um so i was looking into his
13:06
clothes shoot starting with shoes and
13:08
working my way up
13:09
he was in 1946 i was going to say he was
13:11
very unfashionable
13:13
he was quite the fashion i'd argue he's
13:15
still out of fashion a little bit
13:16
yeah his reputation's never come back
13:18
has it
13:20
um he even in his day didn't wear very
13:23
fashionable clothes so he had a sort of
13:24
personal
13:25
um valet or valet uh who despaired off
13:29
him apparently there's this really weird
13:30
account from the valet of
13:32
trying to dress hitler and saying that
13:34
he'd lay out new clothes for him every
13:36
day that would suit him and then hitler
13:37
always refused to wear them but then
13:39
weirdly um nazi chic as in wearing nazi
13:43
clothes is a thing that's not
13:44
outrageous in some parts of the world so
13:47
i didn't realize this in parts of
13:48
asia so in thailand sometimes it gets to
13:50
the news here that someone's got in
13:51
trouble in thailand because
13:52
a class of school children will be
13:54
wearing ss uniforms
13:56
and it does happen and it doesn't have
13:58
the same association as there as it does
14:00
here and
14:00
there was an interview with someone in
14:02
thailand i think saying it's not really
14:03
taught as an ideology it's taught as an
14:05
objective piece of history
14:07
and so nazi outfits have become fancy
14:09
dress so it's fancy dress yeah yeah okay
14:11
yeah whereas they wouldn't wear like a
14:13
mao zedong hat that that would be
14:15
right um very upsetting i used to wear
14:17
that in
14:18
sydney what hitler no not hitler clothes
14:23
we were only in sydney last year who do
14:26
you think you are prince harry
14:28
no i went when i did a trip back to uh
14:30
china when i was 18
14:31
i bought in tiananmen square one of
14:33
those mao communist hats jesus christ
14:35
and that is a whole combination of bad
14:37
things
14:37
yeah i shouldn't have done i know um and
14:39
i well this is what's worse i went
14:41
canvassing for the labour party
14:43
um just before i left the country to
14:45
move here and it was a really hot day
14:46
and i only had one hat
14:47
so i wore that hat yeah um while i was
14:50
handing out the leaflets
14:51
and yeah they they asked me to stop they
14:54
haven't been in
14:55
power suits yeah i can't picture the mao
14:57
zedong
14:58
it's a green like with the red star on
15:01
it okay i don't know what you mean yeah
15:02
yeah yeah yeah
15:03
no no it's not like i love mao zedong
15:05
kind of
15:06
yeah the cap those ssc uniforms don't
15:08
say i heart hitler that wasn't uniform
15:16
that was the first time i ever saw you
15:17
because i've already got news for you
15:18
just sort of looking like hitler
15:20
yeah why was that again well i was
15:21
trying to reclaim the mustache for
15:23
comedy because charlie chapman had it
15:24
before hitler and i was just interested
15:26
in why
15:27
that symbol has taken the brunt of
15:29
hitler's
15:30
you know disapproval because there was
15:32
lots of things he did for having a
15:33
bmi of a 22 point whatever that wasn't
15:35
that yeah that's not the
15:37
you're not in trouble for that so why
15:38
and that mustache was very popular
15:40
before hitler and
15:40
hitler obviously popularized it as well
15:42
but a lot of a lot of comedians had it
15:44
first i was sort of just interested in
15:45
the symbolism of it
15:46
but then i also then had it for a year
15:48
which was a disconcert did you get
15:51
very bad reactions from some people or
15:53
not really and the worst thing that
15:54
happened i mean most people laughed at
15:56
you just
15:57
the second you'd passed a few people
15:58
looked a bit shocked and
16:00
upset but the worst thing that happened
16:02
was i was on shepard's bush green at
16:04
about midnight one night walking along
16:05
and a man was coming out of a white van
16:06
he saw me and went well done mate you're
16:08
a man after my own heart
16:10
which was uh it was just chilling like
16:12
you know he was sort of going
16:13
if only i was as brave as you i would
16:15
display my nazism
16:16
uh on my face well he was a charlie
16:18
chaplin fan it good so you know
16:20
that's it assumptions but the show was
16:23
about
16:24
the importance of voting in an attempt
16:26
to stop the rise of right-wing politics
16:27
so you know i'm glad comedy works so
16:29
well
16:29
[Laughter]
16:31
you just reminded everyone of what they
16:33
were missing
16:37
[Applause]
16:40
okay it is time for fact number two and
16:43
that is
16:44
chozinski my fact this week is that in
16:46
the indigenous and mexican language of
16:48
chalcothonga
16:49
tech it is impossible to ask anyone a
16:51
question
16:52
how did the translation of your
16:53
emergency questions go down there
16:55
i didn't sell any copies out there now
16:57
it's explained
17:00
that's what it is okay explain this is
17:03
the is
17:04
sorry was that uh that was a question
17:06
sorry that's flames
17:07
it wasn't meant to be so aggressive so
17:09
anna why don't you tell us what you mean
17:11
yeah there was an order um so these are
17:13
researchers a
17:14
place or a company called idibon which
17:15
is a language processing company and
17:17
they sort of
17:18
coded applied code to 239 languages to
17:22
look at how they worked so to look at
17:23
things like
17:24
how you order subjects and objects and
17:26
verbs and
17:28
how a language makes clear things like
17:30
an order or a negative or a positive
17:32
or a question and charcoal mixed tech uh
17:35
is
17:36
is spoken by about 6 000 people in
17:38
mexico
17:39
and it was determined to be the most
17:42
unusual language in the world
17:44
so it shares fewer things with any other
17:46
language than than any other languages
17:48
and there was no mechanism for showing
17:49
you're asking a question so there's no
17:51
way of saying are you all right
17:52
as opposed to you you're all right but
17:55
there's also
17:57
there's no difference between saying are
17:59
you all right and you are all right
18:01
yeah you're a bit of all right yeah
18:03
they're not accidentally cracking onto
18:04
each other constantly
18:06
i was just trying to sex it up but
18:08
there's no way there's no way of saying
18:09
to someone
18:10
um do you fancy a drink would you like
18:13
to get married and then would you like
18:14
to have some children which has been
18:16
presumably why only 6 000 people
18:18
in the world speak it yeah you have to
18:20
just kind of do you
18:21
andrew hunter murray take this one sorry
18:23
i don't know
18:25
it's very demanding because it's always
18:26
it would all be you fancy a drink you
18:28
want to marry me yeah
18:29
so you're just the only people are
18:31
getting married are very aggressive men
18:33
and very client women
18:35
okay i agree why can't they just go up
18:38
at the end of the statement to make a
18:40
question that's why
18:41
they don't know they do tones but that's
18:43
with that i mean the problem in the uk
18:44
is that people do that with
18:46
non-questions now don't they
18:47
yeah you go just everything goes up at
18:49
the center at the end of the sentence
18:51
but that would be the solution for these
18:52
people to be able to ask questions but i
18:53
guess it's not a problem
18:54
i guess they could but they don't mind
18:57
they don't want to ask questions they
18:58
don't want to know
18:59
they're very uncurious there must be one
19:01
question they need which is are you
19:02
asking
19:02
are you telling that's the question
19:06
that's made for you need you're them
19:11
but that's one of the things which makes
19:12
english so weird is that we flip
19:14
order to make a question yes it is
19:17
is it true yeah yeah and then japanese
19:19
has for example the word you just add
19:21
you just add a particle and that is a
19:23
magical transforming particle
19:25
so is that in japanese so sodeska
19:29
is it means is that so and that's much
19:31
more common isn't it
19:32
so i think only two percent of languages
19:34
do the word switching dodge is another
19:36
one very
19:37
unusual so we are quite special in that
19:39
way yeah
19:40
do you know what the second least weird
19:42
language is least weird
19:44
yeah so the most normal after hindi
19:46
hindi is the most normal
19:47
i'll say welsh there's a language called
19:49
puree pecha
19:51
which is another mexican language and
19:52
the third least weird language so the
19:55
third most normal language i'll say
19:56
welsh
19:57
it's yeah you're going to keep firing
19:58
are you i think
20:00
mexico mexico mexico for a while and
20:02
then
20:04
i'm afraid it's ainu which we've talked
20:06
about before but
20:07
it's spoken by about 10 people um that's
20:10
japanese
20:10
japanese in hokkaido in japan so that's
20:14
one of the most normal languages spoken
20:15
by about 10 people
20:17
hindi is the most normal language and
20:19
that's spoken by what nearly a billion
20:20
people yeah
20:21
yeah hindi has one unusual feature that
20:24
they found
20:25
and that is something called predictive
20:27
possessions
20:29
so you can say anna has a glass of wine
20:32
or you can say the glass of wine is
20:34
anna's but you can't say
20:36
anna's glass of wine in hindi you can't
20:38
have the possessive
20:40
thing so that's the only thing that's
20:42
weird in hindi have you guys heard of
20:44
the indonesian real dialect nope no this
20:46
is a great one
20:47
so this is claimed by the linguist john
20:50
mcwater to be the most economical
20:52
language in the world
20:53
so it's there's a phrase i am makam
20:57
and that just means chicken eat okay but
21:00
it can
21:00
also mean variously the chicken is
21:03
eating
21:04
chickens are eating a chicken is eating
21:06
the chicken is eating
21:07
the chicken will be eating the chicken
21:09
eats the chicken has eaten
21:11
someone is eating the chicken someone is
21:14
eating with the chicken
21:16
the chicken that is eating and where
21:18
when the chicken is eating and a few
21:19
others
21:20
who's eating with the chicken stuff as
21:23
the chicken or are they
21:25
upset ordering at a restaurant
21:27
as well no i have the chicken
21:34
it's the language of sitcoms isn't it
21:36
yeah yeah
21:37
i wanted to eat with the chicken
21:39
[Laughter]
21:42
so it's economical but no one has any
21:43
idea what anyone else means i think so
21:45
yeah
21:45
great that's incredible the really cool
21:47
language i like is the ypno
21:49
language in papua which is where
21:51
everything is conceived
21:53
everything directionally when we say go
21:55
over there or whatever is conceived in
21:56
terms of uphill and downhill
21:58
um so for instance if you're talking
22:01
about where
22:01
um where the door is you'll say oh it's
22:04
just uphill
22:05
or if i was saying oh whereabouts is
22:07
james now oh he's just downhill
22:09
and everything is up so i am if i'm
22:12
downhill from you
22:13
yeah how do i know whether i'm uphill or
22:16
downhill
22:17
so there they have uh because it's quite
22:19
a small place they have a certain
22:20
geography where everyone kind of knows
22:22
where the highest point in the island is
22:24
the area is everyone knows what the
22:25
lowest point if you're talking about
22:26
time
22:27
then the oh the fireplace is always
22:29
downhill apparently so if you're in a
22:31
room
22:31
you have to check where the fireplace is
22:33
so i guess behind me
22:35
at the moment is the thames so all of
22:37
the land kind of goes towards attempts
22:39
so you could argue that i'm
22:40
downhill of you even if i'm not quite
22:42
down yeah unless there's a fireplace on
22:44
the opposite side of the room and then
22:45
that trumps the thames
22:47
and then you're up hillary fireplace is
22:49
always the trumping
22:50
card i think the fireplace is the trump
22:52
card yes unless you're talking about
22:54
time
22:54
in which case the past is always
22:56
downhill and the future is uphill
22:58
features are pillars okay it used to be
23:00
a fireplace salesman
23:02
where on the terms
23:06
an aboriginal language which i was
23:08
reading about that i didn't write down
23:09
but
23:10
there's that they judge everything by
23:11
north east south and west that's the
23:13
direction of everything yeah wow
23:14
i think yeah that's a lot of average
23:16
australian average is that easy to know
23:18
though like
23:19
you have to know where you are you have
23:20
to know where you are all the time at
23:21
all times you can't do any other
23:22
directions in north east south and west
23:24
but there was a study where they or they
23:28
did an investigation where they looked
23:29
at an aboriginal person who had then
23:31
gone to a different country
23:32
and they realized that instinctively
23:34
that person still knew always what was
23:35
north east south africa
23:37
so they are instinctively orienting them
23:39
that's an iphone i'm not sure
23:43
um another language another cool
23:45
language yeah okay so
23:47
um this language is called kiche and it
23:50
was
23:51
spoken by the mayans in guatemala and
23:53
what i love about this
23:54
is if you're speaking to children
23:57
normally humans would kind and most
23:59
languages would kind of talk a little
24:00
bit
24:01
higher like a bit higher like that and
24:02
if you're speaking to someone
24:05
if you're speaking to someone who's a
24:06
higher status than you you speak lower
24:08
but in their language it's completely
24:09
the opposite
24:12
when you speak into someone of a higher
24:13
status you put your voice in a higher
24:16
pitch
24:17
i think that's amazing that's cool i
24:19
want to do that when you meet the queen
24:20
it's oh very nice to meet you
24:23
are you lost little girl it's very
24:25
creepy
24:29
i like there's a um there's a language
24:30
called tamiya called tabijk
24:33
spoken by the toureg and they
24:36
so in 1984 there was the prince song
24:40
purple rain there was also the movie
24:41
purple rain they did a remake of that
24:43
movie
24:44
uh 30 years later um so the exact movie
24:47
was just a remake in their language
24:49
unfortunately in their language they
24:50
don't have
24:51
a word for purple so the movie was
24:54
released
24:54
as rain the color of blue with a little
24:57
red in it
25:01
brazil language well someone claimed has
25:03
no numbers or colors in it so my 20
25:05
month old
25:06
son could go there and rule the place
25:09
that's pretty much all he can do
25:11
you can't play snooker can you no and
25:14
they and also which i don't understand
25:15
someone says but this is controversial
25:17
it's their own language with no
25:19
recursive no recursion in it which is
25:22
the ability to insert phrases into
25:24
phrases but i didn't quite
25:26
grasp that what you can't you can't put
25:29
a phrase in a phrase you can't say
25:30
daniel schreiber is that what it
25:32
is
25:32
it's something along those lines i think
25:34
that's something we should adopt in the
25:35
english language
25:38
these guys are really cool so their
25:40
language is
25:41
one of the most tonal languages in the
25:43
world so it's different kind of tones as
25:45
you're speaking
25:46
and so a word which is
25:49
you can pronounce that or haha
25:54
or kaka doesn't matter what the
25:56
consonants are it's just the tones
25:58
yeah and so it means that you could kind
25:59
of talk with your mouth full
26:01
or you can whistle words and stuff like
26:03
that because it's just about the tones
26:04
it's not about the consonants because
26:06
it's like you've got um blank scrabble
26:09
tiles
26:10
that you can just put into the words as
26:12
you wish yeah as long as you get the
26:14
bits in between right
26:15
sure yeah it is a bit like it's like so
26:18
when i was saying um
26:21
yeah it's the same as saying i right
26:25
or whatever so no matter what kind of
26:27
tone you make
26:28
yeah that's very cool isn't it i like
26:30
the scrabble analogy though i think that
26:31
really worked well
26:32
oh thanks i understood that cheers sorry
26:35
andy i don't know
26:39
james it simply didn't make sense
26:44
um this is about linguistics right and
26:46
so
26:47
it's about language we don't want
26:48
language yeah how it's evolved just get
26:50
to your very tenuously linked
26:52
thing well it's only because i was
26:54
reading
26:55
some gnome chomsky stuff who is
26:57
obviously very related to like how
26:58
language evolves and
26:59
i hate him um wow i think he's so
27:03
miserable too much wine for anna i think
27:05
um and we can't get in another celebrity
27:08
feud
27:08
not with noam chomsky it's always after
27:11
two glasses of wine she starts
27:12
like it's every time known
27:16
he feels the same about me it's fine but
27:18
so no
27:19
chomsky is obviously like father of
27:20
linguistics this amazing like einstein
27:22
figure in the linguistics world so i was
27:24
on this linguistics forum i was just
27:25
looking at
27:26
how language has evolved and this forum
27:28
put a big
27:29
chomsky quote at the top and it was
27:30
about the first article he'd ever
27:32
written so he wrote his first article
27:34
when he was 10 years old
27:35
and it was about the he was like the
27:38
fascist forces had conquered barcelona
27:40
essentially the end of the spanish civil
27:41
war and it was all about the spread of
27:43
nazi power and stuff this guy was 10.
27:45
so it's the top of this forum this
27:46
academic forum this person posts this
27:48
quote from him and is like
27:49
thoughts guys and the comment
27:51
immediately below it was
27:53
that sounds incredibly boring um and
27:55
then the comment below that was
27:56
when i was 10 i wrote about an evil
27:58
jack-o'-lantern that terrorized kids on
28:00
halloween but he had a heart of gold and
28:02
was just misunderstood
28:04
and then the entire rest of the thread
28:06
is them analyzing the jack-o'-lanterns
28:10
it does sound a lot better yeah doesn't
28:12
it sounds amazing you'd rather read that
28:14
definitely yeah good on them
28:19
[Applause]
28:21
[Music]
28:24
okay it is time for fact number three
28:26
and that is
28:27
andy my fact is that king george iii
28:29
once went to a safety demonstration
28:31
which involved putting the king in a
28:32
house
28:33
and setting it on fire wow yeah that
28:36
doesn't sound very safe
28:37
it's extreme well that was i guess
28:39
that's the that's the trick isn't it
28:40
with the safety demonstration you try
28:42
and do something that looks unsafe and
28:43
you say i've tricked you you're quiet
28:45
and he survived right so
28:46
for another 40 years he's the longest
28:49
reigning king
28:51
is he the longest one longer king yeah
28:53
victoria and elizabeth
28:54
at both queens
28:58
years he was 59 years 60 days or
29:00
something he was looking for
29:01
wow wow although he wasn't very good at
29:04
it was he
29:07
well he lost america he's been
29:08
reassessed i think that's a little bit
29:10
over the year i mean i think he got a
29:12
bad rap at the time i mean
29:13
he was thinking of bad raps have you
29:15
seen hamilton
29:18
uh he he's meant to be the best thing in
29:20
hamilton uh in georgia
29:22
oh he's so good but uh it's not him he
29:25
is dead now
29:26
she is right now the extreme safety of
29:28
the demonstration
29:29
and his long range it couldn't keep him
29:31
alive past the age of about 80 which he
29:33
made it too
29:33
a lot of stuff went on in his in i was
29:35
surprised actually i don't i don't know
29:37
very much about uh
29:38
that that period of history even though
29:39
i studied history and i'm surprised how
29:41
much happened in his reign and yeah he
29:43
lost a lot of stuff
29:44
as well as the plot yeah being the main
29:46
thing which was actually very sad wasn't
29:48
it um
29:48
so he did go very mad his illness was
29:51
diagnosed as
29:52
flying gout can i just say i think candy
29:56
is desperate to tell us the story of
29:57
this
29:57
house on fire no no we don't we can go
29:59
into the broader sociological
30:00
implications of his reign
30:02
it's such an exciting story
30:06
andy please back to the burning building
30:07
yeah yeah well how does that happen
30:10
so i should say where this comes from
30:11
this is a book called 1776 a london
30:13
chronicle which is all about only stuff
30:15
happening in 1776
30:16
very busy year lots of innovations a lot
30:18
of stuff going on the american colonies
30:20
on the brink of being lost all this
30:22
stuff
30:22
and there was a scientist called david
30:24
hartley who had this amazing new way of
30:26
making a house fireproof
30:28
and it basically just involved putting
30:29
iron plates in it all the way through
30:32
like a magician and a box you know yeah
30:35
um so the king stood upstairs and
30:37
flaming pitch destroyed the lower half
30:39
of the house and he was absolutely fine
30:41
and this happened on the very day that
30:43
the news reached london of the american
30:45
declaration of independence
30:47
it was like it was a big day for georgia
30:49
third yeah wow yeah
30:50
wow slightly support the day it's a
30:53
great day i'm still upstairs in a
30:54
burning house and i'm fine
30:56
what's been happening while i've gone um
31:00
the uh the guy you're just talking about
31:01
david hartley um he has a sort of long
31:04
lasting legacy um around the world and
31:07
you know we're here in the west end
31:08
uh he is the person who invented the
31:11
fire curtain
31:12
that goes down in front of stages yeah
31:14
he hated fire didn't he what's his
31:18
problem with fire
31:19
let him fire have a few fires
31:24
he was thought of as an eccentric
31:25
because he didn't powder his hair
31:27
when everyone else did who george the
31:29
third or david harper david hartley
31:36
he also wore stockings with the feet cut
31:38
out because he thought it was healthier
31:40
and that made you an eccentric in those
31:42
days wow really that is interesting
31:44
you didn't need to do much did you
31:47
to be called an eccentric now you need
31:49
to work pretty damn hard i've been
31:50
trying for years
31:52
yeah and the house became popular um and
31:55
was was used throughout england you know
31:56
the plates method spread across the
31:57
country
31:58
but then other methods took over which
32:01
were more efficient and didn't involve
32:02
putting huge iron plates all the way
32:04
through the house
32:05
and then the house the original house
32:06
the test house very sadly caught fire
32:09
no yeah it had been extended beyond the
32:12
safe bit you know so it was an extension
32:14
and yeah so that extension caught fire
32:16
and then collapsed on to the fireproof
32:18
section
32:18
and then that caught fire you needed
32:20
some iron plates on the top to stop that
32:22
yeah wow how do you talk a king into
32:25
standing in a
32:26
flaming house i don't know if he's mad
32:28
it's easy that's true
32:31
they got the right king you're right
32:32
yeah and i think he was going a bit mad
32:34
around that time he had a few bouts of
32:36
madness through his life
32:38
one of them was just before the french
32:40
revolution so that must have been sort
32:42
of a round of applause there's a bit
32:43
a bit later than that um yeah when he um
32:45
when he did start to lose his mind at
32:47
one stage in 1819
32:49
he spoke nonsense non-stop for 58 hours
32:52
was it christmas time as well that one
32:54
year
32:58
it also says it was a bit racist
33:02
going on about brexit
33:07
yeah it sounds like you're really really
33:09
suffered and obviously it wasn't
33:11
understood nearly as much at the time
33:12
so you know he has this reputation but
33:14
he he he did obviously a huge amount of
33:16
stuff he was a very interesting guy
33:18
he was a hobbyist he wrote architectural
33:20
journal articles under a pen name
33:22
secretly
33:22
um he was interested in all sorts of
33:25
stuff yeah he had a huge
33:26
um capacity for wanting to know what was
33:29
going on in his kingdom i think
33:30
yeah he had a weird marriage to
33:34
a woman called charlotte charlotte of
33:36
mecklenburg strelitz
33:38
who was from this random german duchy
33:40
and
33:41
she was um she was very parsimonious
33:45
known for being pastemonious the only
33:46
remnant we have of her is a dish called
33:48
apple charlotte
33:49
apparently and that's apple charlotte is
33:52
a pudding that uses up stale bread
33:54
because she didn't want to waste
33:56
anything and she used to stamp
33:58
butter with the royal cigna so that the
33:59
servants couldn't eat it
34:01
to say this is our butter don't touch
34:04
she was famously ugly and there was a
34:06
quote about her
34:08
this is suddenly tipped over into
34:10
personal abuse
34:12
sometimes i feel like women haven't
34:14
taken enough flack in history
34:16
and we've got to send some abuse that
34:18
way so she was famously hideous
34:20
and one of the nobility said that as she
34:22
got older this is a famous quote that as
34:24
she got older
34:25
the bloom has at any rate gone off the
34:27
queen's ugliness
34:28
um since she fell off this carriage and
34:30
broke her nose she's actually quite
34:32
handsome
34:32
wow yeah but he married at the day he
34:35
met her didn't he yes
34:36
he was married on this day and he was
34:38
baptized in the day he was born george's
34:40
third because he was
34:40
two months premature which at the time
34:42
was like you know
34:44
definitely you're gonna die yeah but he
34:46
survived but they had a very happy
34:48
marriage
34:48
they were he was faithful to her which
34:50
you know what's the point of being king
34:52
yeah if you're going to be faithful to
34:54
your wife that's there's yeah and they
34:55
have
34:55
like 15. okay i so i'm just
34:59
i'm just almost making this up i think
35:00
but i thought that in his madnesses he
35:03
he actually did have affairs off the
35:05
back of he was just in
35:07
uh a hyper state right he wasn't really
35:09
aware quite old though and i think he
35:10
was
35:11
when he properly was mad he was like in
35:13
his 70s and 80s so i don't think he
35:14
would have been much of a threat and he
35:16
was blind
35:17
so i don't i think he might have he had
35:19
a lot of affairs with balls
35:20
and yeah and he shook hands with the
35:22
tree didn't he yeah
35:24
that's true he did yeah you know he
35:25
might been having affairs with flora and
35:29
it's foreign yeah yeah i don't know he
35:31
he definitely
35:32
did get off with her a lot yeah 15
35:34
children well like nine boys it's like
35:36
it's like he stayed faithful to one
35:37
woman had 15 children it's a real
35:39
you to king henry viii isn't it
35:41
just stick with one and just keep
35:43
plowing away and only one i think
35:45
13 of his children survived into
35:47
adulthood yeah i think so he's 13. yeah
35:49
but he
35:50
but he later refused his daughters the
35:52
ability to marry
35:53
he was he was so he was really happy
35:55
with his wife but i think he was so
35:56
worried about them making unsuitable
35:57
marriages
35:58
that um only three of his daughters
36:01
managed to marry in the end just because
36:02
he was such a tyrant about it
36:03
and he passed a law saying that if you
36:05
were a royal aged under 25
36:07
you could not marry without the express
36:09
permission of the ruling sovereign
36:11
and that law stayed in place until 2013
36:14
really
36:15
yeah wow yeah yeah i think he was
36:17
skeptical about marriage because
36:19
his sister's marriage had gone very
36:21
badly
36:22
um so his sister was caroline mathilde
36:24
and she'd married a guy called king
36:26
christian the 7th of denmark
36:28
when she was 15 and he was also quite
36:31
mad
36:32
um and he hung her but he didn't like
36:33
her at all with his 15 year old sister
36:35
so he hung my portrait in his lavatory
36:37
um as a show of how he didn't like his
36:39
wife so his wife yeah yeah
36:41
my sport he hung his wife's portrait in
36:42
the toilet and he was an obsessive
36:45
masturbator
36:46
he was wearing his face did he do it in
36:48
the toilet is that why the portrait was
36:49
there i think the toilet was the only
36:50
one we didn't do it
36:51
um really yeah he was so his daughter he
36:54
went to see doctors about this and
36:55
doctors were always trying to stop him
36:57
doing it but he once entered a feast
36:58
with his trousers around his ankles
37:01
and he had servants manacle him and then
37:04
beat him with rolls of paper
37:05
um and he visited england once and he
37:08
visited all the brothels in london and
37:10
then completely trashed st james's
37:12
palace
37:13
and so that was the per the man that his
37:15
sister married
37:16
i think george the third thought well
37:19
marriage hasn't gone well for her
37:21
let's protect women from further
37:22
excessiveness yeah that's right
37:24
so he saw a doctor i'd love to hear the
37:26
doctor's transcript
37:28
read that so the way to stop doing this
37:30
is okay you're masturbating you're
37:32
masturbating um
37:33
yeah just put it back away okay so yeah
37:35
so we have lots of medicines we have
37:36
like
37:37
okay you're masturbating again um we're
37:39
just gonna have to put that away again
37:40
okay are you doing very good um
37:44
it's very it's difficult to stop you
37:46
know you've got to be some people don't
37:48
you tell me
37:51
so queen charlotte we were talking about
37:53
yeah she had a
37:54
pet zebra who was presented to her by
37:56
the governor of the cape in south africa
37:59
and it was known colloquially as the
38:01
queen's ass
38:03
and there was a massive scandal when the
38:05
queen's guard were caught
38:06
charging people to expose the queen's
38:08
ass to public view
38:11
uh in 1764 the and you guys are really
38:14
holding this name very nicely
38:15
the newspapers printed a story that the
38:17
guard were charging people to see this
38:19
and then queen charlotte later bred this
38:21
zebra by getting a male donkey
38:24
and painting the back of it white and
38:26
black stripes
38:27
so that it thought that it was a zebra's
38:30
wow
38:30
ass us yeah exactly and it works wow i'm
38:33
going to try that with my own bottom
38:35
i'm going to paint my own bottom black
38:36
and white and see if i can get a zebra
38:37
to me
38:38
it's what i'm good at i've always been
38:40
quite obsessed with having sex with an
38:41
akapi which is
38:42
like a sort of zebra kind of thing but
38:46
from behind it's got a very nice it
38:48
looks like a sort of you've
38:49
always just they've got i was obsessed
38:52
with the carpe before
38:54
i've been seeing the carpet quite a few
38:55
times in london from behind it's like
38:57
it's got a very like leopard skin
38:59
trouser right you know so it looks like
39:01
a
39:01
lady's hindquarters so that's nice and
39:03
then i've realized as well and the cup's
39:04
got a very long tongue so you could be
39:06
there
39:06
and then they can't even have sex with
39:08
an animal
39:10
it doesn't i don't think this sounds
39:11
like an if i had to situation i think
39:13
there's too much thought that's gone
39:15
into this
39:15
if you don't have sex with me i would
39:17
paint my bottom black and white
39:18
it's just the one i would i wouldn't
39:20
mind yes it's that andy
39:23
we've all got one do they let you in
39:27
london zoo they don't
39:28
they do i'm a member i'm a member of
39:30
london
39:31
so i can go anytime it's a new meaning
39:33
to the word member of london too
39:37
wow okay good oh you donate enough they
39:40
let you masturbate freely
39:42
what are you donating
39:46
they're hoping i'm gonna create a new
39:47
hybrid creature that they can put in
39:50
imagine if it was successful oh god the
39:52
herring the herring zebra
39:54
tearing
39:55
[Laughter]
40:04
[Applause]
40:07
[Music]
40:08
no
40:10
let's bring the tone back up it is time
40:12
for our final fact of the show and that
40:14
is james
40:15
okay my fact this week is that female
40:17
hyenas
40:18
say hello by licking each other's
40:20
clitorises
40:22
crikey an uncompromisingly direct
40:25
greeting i would say
40:29
i just now feel like we're giving
40:30
richard ideas for his next trip to the
40:31
zoo
40:32
i'm just saying quite very nicely
40:36
is that why the other the male hyenas
40:38
are always laughing just out of sort of
40:40
awkwardness and excitement
40:46
okay so this fact was sent to me by text
40:49
[Laughter]
40:58
there was no name attached but the phone
41:00
number ends with zero six seven so you
41:02
know who you are yeah that's nearly my
41:04
number
41:07
i confirmed it in a book called wild sex
41:09
the science behind mating in the animal
41:11
kingdom by
41:12
karen bonda and yeah it seems that it
41:14
does happen so when females
41:16
arrive and see each other they stand in
41:18
a parallel position facing in opposite
41:20
directions
41:21
lift their hind legs display their fully
41:23
erect clitorises to each other
41:25
and then they smell and lick them and
41:27
this is because
41:29
female hyenas have extremely large
41:30
clitorises do they ever smell them and
41:32
not lick them
41:35
no i'm sorry
41:39
as very awkward in the hyena world it's
41:42
like you know when you give someone a
41:44
high five and they don't give you a high
41:45
five
41:46
it's exactly like that wow
41:49
yeah so and um this happens between um
41:53
females of different ranks and depending
41:55
on who licks first
41:56
depends on who is the most highest
41:58
ranking and they have they're like seven
42:00
inches long aren't they about seven
42:01
inches long
42:02
yeah they're they're essentially a penis
42:05
in appearance
42:06
and they get um erections so when
42:09
when they're copulating they get
42:10
erections and they also have a labia
42:12
that's used to look like testes
42:13
it actually does seem a bit like
42:15
zoologists have got the genders the
42:16
wrong way around
42:17
it does except that they give birth
42:19
through them
42:20
and then they give birth to them and so
42:21
that clarifies things yes and it's a
42:23
horrific
42:24
birth yeah yeah yeah like i think it's
42:26
the only animal birth that's worse than
42:28
humans because humans are not very well
42:30
adapted to give birth
42:31
because we've got um our hits are too
42:33
narrow um and our heads are too big
42:35
essentially
42:36
and so our birth is much much more
42:38
traumatic than almost any other animal
42:40
but hyenas it is worse because you are
42:41
giving birth through a penis yes
42:43
there's two types of erections which are
42:45
it's very useful to know
42:47
there's a social erection and a sexual
42:49
erection what i've got here this is a
42:51
social direction
42:54
and now i've got now i know about that
42:56
that's a good thing to know unless
42:58
anyone fancies having sex in which case
42:59
it can just
43:00
turn very quickly into a section where
43:02
does it is the time if you're interested
43:04
in
43:05
if you're interested it suddenly is a
43:06
sexual direction in my case i don't know
43:07
if that's the question
43:09
it turns just as you walk past the large
43:10
angular section of the zoo
43:15
it's very difficult for the males the
43:17
true males to
43:18
mate as well so they have to practice a
43:20
lot because being able to get your
43:22
genuine penis into this long clitoris
43:24
is a tough gig it's like darts
43:27
and so that it takes about two months
43:29
practice from male hyenas
43:31
before you are able to penetrate
43:33
properly yeah and then like probably
43:35
like crouching behind them and trying to
43:36
point the penis the right way
43:38
two months yeah yeah yeah you say that
43:40
but george the third brother-in-law was
43:42
practicing for a lot longer than that
43:46
but sixty percent of hyena cubs
43:48
suffocate on the way out
43:49
no no yeah yeah more than half because
43:53
you're in this long
43:54
tube holy moly that's crazy there's all
43:56
sorts of hyena mythology because of
43:58
because of the fact that so weird um so
44:01
uh and and just beliefs about them so
44:04
plenty of the elder
44:05
uh friend of the show he said that
44:09
keep writing in um he said that hyenas
44:11
are capable of
44:12
calling people by name because they're
44:14
quite how weird they sound slightly
44:16
human in the way they are
44:17
calling people by name and then killing
44:18
you when you go outside so they will
44:20
lure you out
44:21
so you think someone's calling you mimi
44:23
yeah
44:26
flinny the elder
44:29
get that hyena out of here there's also
44:33
in mythology have you heard of so
44:34
werewolves those were hyenas yeah which
44:38
is very exciting but they have a
44:39
different thing they have
44:40
so your classic werewolf will obviously
44:42
be your wolf
44:43
i'm sorry a human that turns into a wolf
44:46
with the wear hyena
44:47
it's often a hyena that turns into a
44:49
human all right
44:50
so at night time on a full moon you
44:52
might be talking to a human
44:54
and they will not be socialized at all
44:57
no because they spend five sixths at a
44:59
time as as
45:01
hyenas yeah so penis might be a clitoris
45:04
that's true yeah they're greetings you
45:06
can tell you've met wine
45:08
immediately as soon as they walk into a
45:11
party you know it's them
45:13
they must be disappointed how hard it's
45:15
to find the human clitoris though
45:18
what's going on not even here
45:24
oh i guess a lot of sympathy from fellow
45:26
men at the party at that point
45:28
i know right
45:32
uh walter rally thought that hyenas were
45:34
so disgusting that noah refused to let
45:36
them on the ark
45:37
and the species was only resurrected
45:39
after an unnatural copulation between a
45:42
dog and a cat
45:43
hmm okay yeah it's not as terrifying as
45:46
the
45:46
richard herring london zoo cafe creature
45:51
that might i've got some clitoris back
45:54
yes please
45:54
please um the clitoris is the only part
45:57
of the human body
45:58
that never ages a 20 year old clitoris
46:00
and nature or clitoris are
46:01
identical so you can't count the rings
46:05
they get slightly bigger sometimes
46:06
throughout life but then they don't
46:08
look they don't wrinkle i guess it's
46:10
there that is really good
46:12
that's extraordinary well that's yeah
46:14
and also i was surprised clitoris
46:16
the word clitoris only dates for that
46:18
only dates back to the 17th century is
46:20
in something i read and then the word
46:22
has only
46:23
only came up in america in the 1950s so
46:25
it took 200 years 300 years something
46:28
short and clitoris they were saying
46:29
clitoris for a long time before someone
46:31
thought this is a mouthful do we know if
46:32
it had
46:34
shortened that decline do you know if it
46:35
had a meaning before do you think it's a
46:37
good but i think it is
46:38
a latin word and i did that
46:44
yes so it would have had a different
46:46
meaning just a monk would
46:48
i guess go around with a with a clitoris
46:50
on his head yeah
46:52
i don't know what the romans called a
46:53
clitoris if they didn't call little
46:55
clitoris
46:56
one would have thought it was related to
46:57
the fact that women weren't thought to
46:59
be uh
47:00
they weren't thought to have any organs
47:01
yeah would experience they were thought
47:03
to have organs
47:06
they couldn't experience sexual pleasure
47:07
or anything but actually that's often a
47:09
myth
47:10
like it they often did like i think in
47:12
ancient greek
47:13
uh in ancient greece women often talked
47:15
about the pleasure you get from sex so
47:16
there must have been a concept of a
47:17
clitoris
47:18
yeah what was it called greek any greeks
47:20
listening plenty if you could ask
47:24
was it called a whipple tickle or
47:25
something do you always get that fact
47:27
sensitive well that was supposedly what
47:28
the g-spot was going to be
47:30
because it was doctor something was it
47:32
beverly whipple
47:33
who um no it was a doctor his name
47:36
started with g
47:36
the reason the g-spot's called the
47:38
g-spot is because it's named after a
47:39
doctor
47:40
and it's something like geistner starts
47:42
with g yeah gavin
47:44
i thought should we call it gavin
47:45
[Laughter]
47:47
if i discovered i wanted to have my
47:49
whole name wouldn't it be called the r
47:50
spot i want to be the richie spot that's
47:52
what i thought
47:56
the gavin it would stop serving its
47:58
purpose immediately
47:59
if you call it the cabin
48:07

=279
00:14
uh
00:18
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:22
no such thing as a fish
00:23
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:26
live
00:26
from berlin
00:35
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:37
here with anna chazinski
00:38
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:40
and once again
00:42
we have gathered around the microphones
00:43
with our four favorite facts from the
00:45
last seven days
00:46
and in a particular order here we go
00:49
starting with you andy my fact is that
00:52
pigeons
00:52
make better coast guards than people
00:58
in one specific way
01:01
what you're saying is they can fly down
01:02
and pull people out of the sea maybe
01:05
that'd be nice they look good in a red
01:06
swimsuit
01:08
they definitely do um so this was
01:12
an experiment that was done by the
01:14
united states coast guard in 1976
01:16
they they knew that pigeons have really
01:19
good eyesight and they started training
01:21
them to spot people who were lost at sea
01:23
so the coast guard would fly up in a
01:25
helicopter and they had a little
01:27
observation bubble on the bottom of the
01:29
helicopter
01:29
and they put a pigeon in there and the
01:33
pigeon was strapped on a special
01:35
couch so like on a sofa
01:38
they're on a little mini sofa and he
01:41
must have been
01:42
half terrified and half very comfortable
01:44
yeah um
01:47
and they he they were trained these
01:49
pigeons to whenever they saw
01:51
in the ocean below them as a tiny scrap
01:53
of uh colored fabric
01:55
uh representing a person floating in the
01:57
sea uh they were trained to peck a
01:59
button
01:59
and that um that hit a light in the
02:01
cockpit and the
02:02
pilot would know okay there there might
02:04
be someone down there pigeons could do
02:06
it 93
02:07
of the time they saw the bit of fabric
02:09
humans only managed it 38
02:11
of the time wow so there's a huge
02:13
difference although wasn't there a thing
02:15
in this where humans managed at 38 of
02:17
the time
02:18
the first time around and then they were
02:20
told that the pigeons were beating them
02:21
and then the next time around they
02:22
managed it just over 50
02:23
of them yes yes that's true
02:26
that's crazy it's a good way to motivate
02:29
people is to tell them a pigeon is doing
02:30
better than you at this you know
02:32
the thing though the problem is is i
02:34
didn't realize they were on sofas the
02:35
problem is
02:36
a sofa is a very comfortable seating
02:38
position that you often fall asleep in
02:39
as you're hanging out
02:41
well they thought of this so
02:44
kidding well were you on this scientific
02:47
team dan
02:48
the the the pigeons in the helicopters
02:51
they had to be kept at a very specific
02:53
level of hunger
02:54
um they needed to be kept ambitious
02:57
right
02:57
for food so that was how they did it but
03:00
it was really it was a very successful
03:01
operation
03:02
and five years later in 1981 it was
03:04
officially recommended
03:06
that pigeons should be inducted into the
03:08
us coast guard
03:09
and that's why if you're in the sea now
03:11
and you look back you always see them at
03:13
the top of those ladders don't you on
03:14
the beach
03:15
with their jackets so exactly why are we
03:18
not seeing that
03:18
i think technology improved uh and
03:22
pigeons have not improved at the same
03:24
speed as technology
03:26
which is a real shame also couldn't they
03:28
only spot they were only trained to spot
03:30
three colors weren't they like red was
03:32
it red orange and yellow they were
03:34
trying to spot
03:35
so and that was the colors that they
03:36
were trying to peck when they saw them
03:38
out of sea
03:39
so it's only if someone is drowning
03:41
wearing red orange or yellow
03:43
yeah but those are three of the big
03:45
colors yeah you know
03:47
it's not like they train them to spot
03:48
move and teal
03:50
and a cerulean you know that would
03:53
that would obviously be a waste of
03:54
resources you're totally right
03:56
but and also if you're wearing blue at
03:59
sea
04:00
and you fall in then it's your own fault
04:02
yeah
04:05
so pigeons are good at a lot of things a
04:08
lot of other things
04:09
they can be trained to identify breast
04:11
cancer by looking at images of biopsies
04:14
and once they're trained they can get an
04:16
average diagnostic accuracy of 85
04:18
percent
04:20
but when you do a flock sourcing system
04:23
where basically you get a load of
04:25
pigeons and you get them to agree
04:26
whether there's a problem there they can
04:29
get up to 99
04:31
what whoa so what you're comparing
04:34
individual responses yeah so you get a
04:35
load of pigeons and you know what do you
04:37
think of this no you're not maturity
04:38
you're not getting a load of pigeons to
04:40
vote on
04:43
tell me it's worse than our current
04:44
system
04:45
[Laughter]
04:47
don't worry we've got a top team working
04:48
on this
04:50
but they're on their little coats and
04:53
have they tried
04:53
motivating doctors to do better by
04:56
telling them that pigeons are more
04:57
efficient than they are
04:58
because i think we should start doing
05:00
this on the podcast i actually think we
05:02
should set up a company where you get
05:03
little speakers in workplaces that just
05:05
go
05:09
and that sort of means i'm after your
05:11
job
05:13
they were amazing that pigeon so i saw a
05:15
pigeon do something so cool the other
05:17
day and i really nearly messaged
05:18
you guys really this is related to a
05:22
fact
05:23
um so i saw a pigeon do a somersault
05:26
and i'd forgotten that this happens and
05:29
i remembered that we'd mentioned that
05:30
geese whiffle they
05:32
flipped to the side so i was about to
05:33
send you a message saying there's a
05:34
pigeon impersonating a geese
05:36
oh geez sure you're german you don't
05:39
know how plurals do you
05:40
um so it wasn't a land-based somersault
05:44
it was a airborne well it was an
05:46
airborne one
05:47
um so they can do the airborne
05:48
somersaults but then yeah you've got
05:50
these birmingham rollers
05:51
who some are sold for for a living um
05:54
so sorry there's a p that's a kind of a
05:57
birmingham ruler is a kind of pigeon
05:58
and they can't fly beyond a few months
06:01
old
06:01
but they can do constant backflips and
06:04
what i read says
06:05
they do involuntary backflips i don't
06:08
like how annoying is that doing
06:09
involuntary backflips
06:11
and they have races so they are pigeons
06:13
that compete in a lot of competitions
06:15
well
06:16
humans compete using them and to see how
06:19
far they can backflip
06:20
and i think the record is just over 200
06:23
meters
06:24
a pigeon just repeatedly doing backflips
06:26
and this is what you saw the other day
06:28
at 200 meters i just saw a pigeon do a
06:30
somersault and it made me think
06:32
that's funny that would be i would feel
06:34
imagine you went to see your pigeon
06:36
doctor and he did a backflip just before
06:37
he told you your news
06:39
you'd think it was going to be good
06:42
was that was it good i'm afraid that was
06:44
an involuntary backflip
06:46
the news is very bad
06:48
[Laughter]
06:50
oh no dr pigeon and this is why they
06:52
haven't got far in the medical
06:53
profession
06:54
yeah because it's seen as insensitive
06:56
isn't it
07:00
wow well that's very cool what a special
07:01
thing to see yeah so cool
07:05
they are also very useful generally and
07:07
have been um hey here's a cool thing
07:09
you know you know when uh pigeons are
07:10
walking on the street and you see them
07:12
bobbing away like that
07:14
um i think we've mentioned this on qi i
07:15
don't think we've done on the podcast
07:16
but if you put them on a treadmill they
07:18
stop bobbing their head
07:20
so if anyone ever wants to see a
07:22
bobbleless
07:23
pigeon pop them on a treadmill
07:26
do we know why yeah okay i mean
07:30
um well the scientists know why i
07:36
i read a bit it didn't say it in the
07:37
headline it didn't say it in the
07:39
headline
07:40
um uh but hang on hang on
07:44
um okay so what it is is it turns out
07:48
they're not doing it
07:49
as a part of a movement need for
07:51
equilibrium as they're walking what it
07:53
is
07:53
is visually to understand the space
07:57
around them yeah they need to do it it's
07:59
purely for spatial awareness so what it
08:00
is is
08:01
like we have cicada in our eyes i think
08:03
this is it so our eyes kind of move
08:04
around all the time and that's how we
08:06
can see things if they always stay
08:07
completely still you won't be able to
08:08
see anything
08:09
yeah now pigeons and most birds don't
08:11
have that and so the way they see things
08:13
is by
08:14
always moving their head around yes and
08:16
then when you put them on a treadmill
08:18
yeah and that's where i stopped reading
08:19
the article the ways of what
08:22
how does that make their surroundings
08:24
their surroundings will stay the same
08:26
if they're on a treadmill who knows but
08:27
they've still got to see
08:30
what if a threat comes they can't just
08:33
stop being able to see
08:34
because you put them on a treadmill well
08:35
when have you ever seen an eagle on a
08:37
treadmill
08:39
mate she's seen a pigeon somersault i
08:40
think she's probably seen everything
08:43
i go to a very specialist gym and
08:48
sorry it's the other way around
08:57
they do a forward somersault which one
08:59
are we wrong about it
09:10
you know most comedy gigs you go to it's
09:12
just your
09:15
do you know i think that was a
09:16
long-winded way of saying your to
09:17
be honest
09:23
so um another use for another use for
09:26
pigeons
09:26
yeah uh you can use pigeons as fireworks
09:30
but it's it's frowned on it's very much
09:34
not frowned on and the reason is that
09:36
fireworks are very bad for the
09:37
environment
09:38
okay yeah and so what you can do but if
09:40
you still want lights in the sky
09:42
and you don't mind a little bit of
09:43
animal cruelty then
09:46
you can attack keep talking you can
09:49
attach
09:49
lights to the legs of trained pigeons
09:52
and get them to fly in certain
09:53
formations and it gives you the lights
09:55
in the sky but without the firework
09:56
stuff
09:57
oh wow that's very cool that happened in
09:59
brooklyn
10:00
a few years ago cool we need to move on
10:02
in a second to our next fact
10:04
oh i've got a few more fact things about
10:06
the ways animals see
10:07
because it's about animal vision so i
10:09
never knew this before
10:10
uh swallow tail butterflies there is
10:13
particular species of butterfly
10:14
they have eyes on their penises
10:18
to help them position themselves during
10:21
sex
10:22
and the females also have genital eyes
10:25
so they can position themselves
10:28
and they try they kind of make sense
10:29
when you think it makes sense yeah
10:31
um and they may because they also you
10:33
could just attach a gopro to yours and
10:35
then
10:37
yeah they would do the same thing these
10:40
problems for these butterflies is they
10:42
mate facing away from each other so it's
10:44
very hard for them to know when even if
10:46
they're in the same room as
10:48
their partner and they the way they
10:51
found this out
10:52
was that they tried blindfolding
10:54
swallowtail butterfly penises
10:56
no and they found that a successful
10:59
mating collapsed
11:00
oh my god wow
11:03
do they use the eyes for other things
11:06
like if you're married can they be like
11:08
i saw you throw that in the non
11:09
recycling bin
11:13
but what were you doing with your
11:14
at the recycling bin
11:15
[Laughter]
11:20
okay we should probably move on to our
11:22
next fact
11:23
i don't know what's going on tonight
11:25
this is
11:31
it is time for fact number two and that
11:34
is
11:34
my fact my fact this week is that
11:37
concrete
11:38
is stronger if you make it with carrots
11:42
this is this is a new finding this is
11:44
from lancaster university um and they
11:46
did these tests where
11:48
they started blending up uh extracts
11:50
from carrots and other root vegetables
11:52
into a just a household blender with
11:54
concrete and they mixed it up
11:57
and and they used it and they found that
11:59
it has an incredible
12:00
um it has resistance to cracks which is
12:02
far higher than you would get in your
12:04
average
12:04
uh concrete and it's 80 percent stronger
12:08
than what you would buy in a shop as an
12:09
average concrete so this is in early
12:12
uh stages for testing but possibly the
12:14
concrete of the future will be
12:16
carrot-based that's really good and one
12:18
big advantage of it is when you put
12:20
these little molecules in there
12:22
because they're like plants basically
12:24
they can lock up more co2 than normal
12:26
concrete would do
12:27
so actually it's good for the
12:28
environments as well oh that is good
12:31
yeah massively
12:32
yeah because concrete concrete is very
12:33
bad for the environment yeah it is
12:35
it's really bad yeah yeah it's very very
12:38
bad
12:39
you don't need to tell the people of
12:40
berlin how bad concrete is
12:43
get this so humans have been making
12:45
concrete for 9 000 years
12:47
right and that's yeah um but the oldest
12:50
concrete
12:50
in the world is 12 million years old
12:54
way yes it is
12:58
was that the same person from before
13:02
she won't believe anything we say our
13:04
nemesis the expert in everything has
13:06
arrived
13:08
who was making that then pigeons no
13:12
no um it's naturally occurring so it's
13:16
from a place where
13:18
there was some limestone and some oil
13:20
combusted naturally i think it's in
13:21
israel is where this site has been found
13:23
so they found this
13:24
basically natural concrete yeah that's
13:26
really good which is it presumably it's
13:27
bad for the environment sorry to go back
13:29
to that because there's just so much of
13:30
it so it's the manufacturing process
13:32
it produces a lot of carbon dioxide yeah
13:35
because it is i didn't realize it is the
13:37
most widely used material in the world
13:39
concrete
13:40
um which is kind of extraordinary and
13:42
they do this amazing thing with it so i
13:44
was reading about the building of the
13:45
burj khalifa
13:47
uh which is it's still the tallest
13:48
building in the world isn't it the best
13:49
beef yeah um
13:50
and so that is six so they have to
13:52
that's almost entirely made of concrete
13:54
and the way they do it the way they get
13:56
concrete to the top of it
13:58
used to be that you'd have these big
13:59
blocks of concrete and you'd have to
14:00
transport them to the top of a building
14:02
and dump them on top
14:03
but now there's the technology for for
14:06
you to pump up
14:07
liquid concrete to the top of a building
14:09
and so they had a
14:10
vertical concrete tube and they just
14:12
pump up
14:13
concrete 606 meters it's incredible
14:16
so you need an enormous amount of
14:18
pressure for this fluid to be pumped but
14:20
yeah and there's like
14:20
obviously the technology behind that is
14:22
bizarre like even carrying this tube
14:24
carrying the weight
14:25
of 606 meters worth of concrete is
14:28
pretty incredible
14:29
and i was reading an interview with an
14:30
engineer who worked on it actually and
14:32
he was explaining how
14:33
they trialled the system on the burj
14:35
khalifa by doing it horizontally through
14:37
pipes in the desert first
14:39
and then he said they had to source the
14:41
pump from germany
14:42
obviously he said um we used a good
14:45
german pump from someone in stuttgart
14:48
and the pump itself is called
14:51
putzmeister
14:57
which as he pointed out is a great name
14:59
for a bomb
15:02
so the putzmeister made the burj khalifa
15:04
um speaking so speaking of concrete yeah
15:06
dan do you know any animals that can dig
15:09
through concrete
15:11
i i do because you've said this once on
15:13
the podcast haven't you i have said this
15:15
on the podcast
15:16
um and uh so here's the fact
15:19
uh which these three question the truth
15:21
of um
15:22
if you corner a badger in a car park
15:26
it can escape you by digging through the
15:28
concrete
15:30
within yes way within
15:33
like 30 seconds yeah concrete
15:37
badger yeah it's impossible why they've
15:39
got incredibly sharp nails i bet they
15:41
have
15:41
but but they have of course they have
15:44
but concrete's really
15:45
hard anyway i'm gonna hand over to my
15:47
colleague who i think has more
15:48
information than me
15:50
so i know that you've said this on the
15:52
podcast and we always take the mickey
15:53
out of you for it
15:54
but i did find that there is an animal
15:56
that can dig through concrete and that
15:58
is the indian pangolin
16:00
and they have been reported digging
16:02
through concrete and into houses they
16:04
have extremely powerful claws that they
16:05
would normally use for opening up
16:07
termite nests ah so there is an animal
16:09
that can dig through concrete wait so do
16:11
you believe that
16:13
well this is true
16:18
yeah but let's put facts aside for a
16:20
second
16:23
and i was also looking into if there was
16:25
any i really really did look to see if
16:28
badgers could go through concrete i
16:29
really did luck
16:30
and the best i could find is there was a
16:32
story in the news a few years ago about
16:34
an american badger who was captured
16:36
burying the carcass of a cow ah
16:39
it wasn't through concrete but he just
16:41
basically found this dead cow
16:43
and he spent about three or four nights
16:45
digging a hole
16:46
so that he could put the cow into it and
16:48
then covered it all over so no one could
16:49
find it exactly it's to stop predators
16:52
from being able to eat it so they think
16:53
oh it smelled like a dead cow was here
16:55
oh it's gone and then they go away and
16:56
then the badger will go down
16:58
underneath and eat it see but i know a
17:00
lot about badgers so i'm telling you
17:01
that this is
17:02
this is a true thing um have you guys
17:04
heard of um
17:06
this is not the technical term but
17:07
crunchable concrete no
17:09
no this is i find this amazing um so
17:12
do you remember um there's been some
17:14
cases where planes
17:16
as they've landed or taking off have
17:17
overshot the runway yeah that's a big
17:19
problem because there's no method to
17:21
stop them at that kind of speed right
17:22
so a concrete has been invented which
17:24
has been nicknamed uh crunchable
17:26
concrete it's been around for a while
17:28
which is it's an extra stretch of a
17:30
runway
17:31
for a for an airport but the concrete is
17:34
made a bit softer
17:35
which means it can't hold the weight of
17:37
an airplane so as soon as the airplane
17:39
overshoots
17:40
and it goes onto this crunchable
17:41
concrete it's the equivalent of say
17:43
riding a bicycle that you can't stop
17:45
into sand it slowly starts slowing you
17:48
down by the fact that you are
17:49
slowly dipping into it and that's a
17:51
thing that they have at many airports
17:52
around the world now wow that's really
17:54
clever
17:56
do you know why washing machines
18:00
are so heavy is it because they have
18:02
concrete in them
18:03
yes no i've told this the wrong way
18:07
around
18:07
um can you think of any household item
18:10
that might have concrete in it brilliant
18:12
yes
18:15
[Music]
18:17
this i didn't know this and this is a
18:19
bit sort of this is
18:20
yeah i've never heard this i've not
18:22
heard this it's not a very sexy fact but
18:24
most washing machines have in the top of
18:26
them a 25 kilo
18:28
block of concrete which is to hold it
18:30
steady when it's spinning
18:32
in the later stages of the cycle right
18:34
that's what makes a washing machine so
18:35
heavy they're not very heavy except
18:36
they've all got this massive lump of
18:38
concrete wow and this is
18:39
obviously very inefficient because
18:42
transporting washing machines
18:43
is because they're so heavy it uses a
18:45
lot more fuel
18:46
so a student in nottingham has invented
18:50
or he's thought of this system where you
18:52
replace the concrete with an
18:54
empty plastic container and then you can
18:57
just fill that up with water
18:58
when you need 25 kilos weight at the top
19:00
of the machine and then you can just
19:02
empty it out at the end of the cycle
19:03
so it's lighter to transport it would
19:05
save thousands of tons of carbon dioxide
19:07
just shipping it around
19:08
we've only just thought of that we've
19:09
only just thought of that
19:11
that is on we need to put pigeons on
19:13
more
19:14
design we have to move on in a second oh
19:17
um
19:18
concrete you know reinforced concrete
19:20
yeah most most buildings with concrete
19:21
are made of reinforced concrete which is
19:23
concrete with big
19:24
metal bars all the way through a metal
19:26
framework that was initially used
19:28
only for flower pots no one thought of
19:31
using it for buildings
19:32
wow yeah it was there was a french
19:34
gardener called joseph monet and he was
19:36
unhappy with the flower pots available
19:38
to him and he thought i need a really
19:39
tough flower pot
19:40
and he devised a new version with steel
19:42
mesh and that was the first reinforced
19:44
concrete um just quickly on
19:45
water and concrete water actually is
19:47
really good for concrete at the start so
19:49
it hardens it because it's
19:51
in the concrete reacts with the water
19:52
and it causes it to harden but
19:54
this is actually related to something
19:56
we've said on the show before
19:57
which i have to update so in episode 44
20:01
we pointed out that roman concrete is
20:03
better than us
20:04
so concrete that was made two thousand
20:06
more than two thousand years ago
20:07
is stronger than ours and we don't know
20:09
why and we have since found out why
20:11
and it's because it's made of this
20:13
combination of volcanic ash
20:15
and seawater and lumps of volcanic rock
20:18
which is called potalana and
20:20
the volcanic rock actually reacts with
20:22
the sea water
20:23
and it hardens it so like the sea water
20:26
like creates different chemical bonds
20:27
within the concrete
20:29
and it hardens it so we know how they
20:31
did that now but so does that mean sorry
20:33
to interrupt does that mean that at the
20:34
start it wasn't as good as ours and over
20:36
the years it's gotten much better
20:38
because the sea water has hardened it it
20:39
was basically jelly the pantheon at the
20:41
start
20:44
the pantheon still 2000 years old the
20:46
largest unreinforced concrete dome in
20:48
the world
20:49
is incredible and then we just forgot uh
20:52
how to make
20:53
proper concrete and we've just
20:55
remembered so let's celebrate
21:00
okay it is time for us to move on to
21:02
fact number three
21:03
and that is james okay my fact this week
21:06
is that headlouse clinics
21:08
always see an uptick in business when a
21:11
new pixar movie comes out
21:12
[Music]
21:14
why is this is it because children are
21:16
sitting near each other
21:18
children all in the same place you're
21:20
gonna get lots of knits
21:21
and head lice uh and this is a real
21:23
thing so this was an interview with a
21:25
lady called melissa shaladay who
21:27
owns two hair salons in california and
21:30
she says that whenever these children
21:31
movies come out you get all children who
21:34
go together and the lice
21:35
they go from one head to another and
21:37
it's not just that it's um
21:39
selfies is another thing which is
21:40
causing lots of head lice in
21:42
in young people another thing is playing
21:44
on a sports team
21:46
so when you get in a huddle if they like
21:48
to jump between one head and another
21:50
and also during halloween because people
21:52
try on halloween costumes and they just
21:54
pass them on to each other yeah
21:56
although we should say so they don't
21:57
jump uh don't jump they so they don't
21:59
jump from one head to another which is
22:01
something i always find bizarre uh that
22:04
i can't i don't have children so i don't
22:06
know if they spend their time
22:07
rubbing heads constantly but i just
22:10
can't believe it happens that often
22:12
so they can't jump they can't fly they
22:14
just have to walk
22:16
and children are jamming their heads
22:17
together long enough that all these
22:19
things are just walky walkie-walking
22:21
yeah onto another head i i always had
22:24
head lice in australia like constantly
22:26
i had like in in my genuinely con
22:29
constantly in my bathroom i had a normal
22:30
brush and i had my headlights brush
22:32
every day i would just do a quick extra
22:35
swoop
22:35
and i can't remember putting my head
22:37
next to other heads well thank god for
22:39
that
22:40
but what was i doing with it because i'd
22:42
get rid of it it'd be gone and then
22:43
suddenly
22:44
i'm captain lice again and i don't know
22:46
what what that was
22:48
yeah weird i became quite fond of them
22:50
became quite what fond of them
22:52
really yeah because they you can see
22:54
with lice if they because they suck on
22:56
blood obviously
22:56
you should see the bit of red that fills
22:58
it up and i would mine were well fed
23:01
well the other thing with head lice is
23:03
not everyone gets itchy
23:05
with them um it's only if you're
23:06
allergic to their saliva that you get
23:09
headlocks
23:10
and actually that is most people but
23:12
there are some people who aren't
23:13
allergic to it and those people wouldn't
23:15
know that they had headlights until
23:17
their head starts crawling around yes
23:19
yeah okay
23:20
but we should say you listening to this
23:22
now
23:23
you you will feel your head itching now
23:27
that is normal you don't have lice there
23:29
is a condition
23:31
called delusional parasitosis where you
23:33
think you're infested even if you're not
23:35
so that's a proper condition but it's
23:37
just it's what you're feeling is normal
23:39
yeah um although we've got so we've got
23:42
three
23:42
kinds of lice right we've got head lice
23:45
uh which live in the hair
23:46
there are body lice which actually live
23:48
in the seams of your
23:50
clothing so as long as you change your
23:51
clothing more than once a month
23:53
you're basically fine um what what's the
23:56
date today
23:59
um and of course there's our old chums
24:01
the pubic lice
24:06
as they get called trouser shrimps
24:10
so and but they they are
24:13
two branches of the same family that
24:15
they split about 80 000 years ago
24:18
and um one went north and one went south
24:21
basically and
24:22
and they they can't this is something i
24:25
found out because they are now so
24:26
different
24:26
in their physicality apparently they
24:29
won't interbreed
24:30
except under laboratory conditions
24:33
right so you can make it happen when
24:35
there's a nice sofa there for them
24:38
i think they can't i think they can't go
24:41
on the other part of hair because their
24:42
claws are the wrong shapes right
24:44
yeah is that right yeah they're the
24:45
wrong size yeah what's interesting as
24:47
well is that as we get older
24:49
as we become adults our heads become a
24:51
bit more acidic
24:53
and lice don't like that that's why
24:54
they're predominantly found
24:56
in children and so you get any groups of
24:58
children getting together that happens
25:00
and james read out a list of
25:01
places where that is likely to happen
25:03
another place that it happened was on
25:05
the set of harry potter and the chamber
25:06
of secrets oh no
25:08
yeah the kids all of the kids got so
25:10
infested with a lice outbreak that was
25:12
happening
25:13
that they had to hold that's why that's
25:15
why in the third film they've all got
25:17
shaved heads
25:19
i never thought of that before
25:22
yeah it's not in the books so yeah so
25:25
they had to halt filming and they
25:26
brought nurses in who had to spend
25:28
ages de-lousing them all and they have
25:30
specific nurses
25:32
apparently so there are lice doctors um
25:35
which is in fact lice doctors is one
25:37
chain of lice pickers professional nice
25:39
pickers
25:40
and they're one of many and in fact
25:42
there was a study into lice
25:44
into how immune they are to various
25:45
treatments in 2015
25:47
and they recruited lots of professional
25:49
lyschomas
25:51
which is weird because you don't have to
25:52
be very skilled to comb lice out of your
25:54
hair
25:54
but this is what people are doing this
25:56
is present day present day yeah well
25:58
because in the victorian times there was
25:59
a role in hospitals which was
26:01
chief bug catcher and it was it was for
26:04
lice
26:04
and they at the time in the 18th century
26:07
were paid
26:08
more than surgeons were paid according
26:11
to
26:11
a very a very good source um lindsay
26:13
fitzpatrick who writes about this era
26:16
and medical curiosities um
26:18
she said that there was a guy called
26:19
andrew cook who claimed to have cleaned
26:20
up more than 20
26:21
000 beds that were all you know
26:24
life-ridden
26:24
um and yeah it was a huge it makes sense
26:27
it was a massive
26:28
disease causer i mean you would focus on
26:29
that but we should be clear headlines
26:31
can't do anything
26:32
i don't know why people make such a fuss
26:33
about them they can't harm you at all
26:35
and in fact
26:36
other cultures and other people in
26:37
history have been much more sensible
26:39
about them
26:40
so they used to be given as gifts
26:42
between friends and lovers
26:44
um they there's a thing in uh in
26:48
in the aztec period montezuma you know
26:50
the great aztec emperor
26:52
he used to collect lice and people would
26:54
give them to him as offerings and in
26:55
fact he eventually
26:57
employed someone to go and collect
26:58
headlights off his subjects
27:00
and bring them to him so he could keep
27:02
them in little boxes
27:03
so i think in fact when the europeans
27:05
got there
27:06
they saw all these ornate boxes and
27:08
thought you must have pearls and jewelry
27:10
in there and they opened them and they
27:11
were just full of dead lies
27:13
because wow it was a nice thing to come
27:15
up with apparently with the incas
27:16
there was a thing of tax collectors at
27:18
the time and one of the things for older
27:20
people who
27:21
for goods bought and so on they didn't
27:23
want to taxes highly it would be a
27:24
symbolic handing over of lice to them
27:27
as a that would be the tax you can have
27:29
six of my lives to be introduced
27:30
post-brexit actually when no one can
27:32
afford actual money
27:34
i'm going to be rich
27:36
[Laughter]
27:38
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:40
the show and that is
27:42
anna my fact this week is that in 1926
27:46
poland sent the us a birthday card that
27:49
was signed by a sixth of its population
27:52
which was very generous that's
27:54
incredible of them um
27:56
so this was this amazing moment it was
27:57
back in a time when poland was
27:59
incredibly
28:00
grateful to america because it
28:02
considered america's having basically
28:04
saved its skin in first world war and
28:06
given it independence for the first time
28:08
in like about 150 years um
28:11
and so it and then afterwards poland
28:14
would have been
28:15
destitute as would almost all of europe
28:16
had america not given a lot of charity
28:18
money
28:19
so as this thank you they sent a 30 000
28:22
page long
28:23
card on the fourth of july
28:26
it was 30 000 pages long it was actually
28:28
late because it took a long time to get
28:30
the signatures so it arrived in october
28:32
it was meant to arrive on the 4th of
28:33
july we all do that for birthdays that's
28:36
fine
28:37
i was just thinking in the office
28:38
whenever it's someone's birthday and
28:40
they give you a card and you have to
28:41
sign it
28:42
and by the time five people have done
28:44
all the different possible ways of
28:45
saying happy birthday you've got nothing
28:47
left to say
28:48
but after 30 000 people have said it
28:50
yeah yeah imagine the imagination of the
28:52
30 000th
28:53
poll yeah imagine having a great one to
28:55
do and you read through them all and the
28:57
last one before you finally hits it no
28:59
wait it's more than 30 000 sorry
29:01
sorry that's how many pages yeah it was
29:03
ah so it was 30 000 pages
29:05
and it was 5.5 million people signed it
29:09
it really got around they delivered it
29:11
in the form of 111
29:13
bound volumes but it's quite useful now
29:16
because um it's all been digitized and
29:20
polish americans can do family history
29:23
research
29:24
and they can look up where their
29:26
ancestors were and which cities and
29:28
towns they came from
29:29
and but the thing is a lot of the people
29:30
who signed were children who were being
29:32
forced to sign it
29:33
so yeah they sent blank pages so they
29:36
had this massive book they were going to
29:38
send
29:38
and various pages went to various
29:40
different bits of poland and it went
29:41
they sent it to
29:42
you know the army and to cycling clubs
29:46
and to banks
29:47
loot singers apparently gave a very good
29:49
offering and they all sent back
29:51
stuff that was quite personal to them so
29:52
some of poland's most famous artists did
29:55
works of art in there cool um just some
29:57
greeting cards
29:58
and being sent a lot of them um do you
30:01
know there's a guinness world record for
30:02
the person who has received most okay
30:05
most birthday cards
30:06
most uh most get well cards oh get well
30:09
yeah um it's
30:10
so just but the idea of being sent a
30:11
card um there's a guinness world record
30:13
it's a guy called craig
30:15
shergold he was very ill and his friends
30:18
decided to do a chain letter in the
30:20
early this was um
30:21
i think in 1991 uh that went out on the
30:23
internet that said
30:25
send a get well card or a greeting card
30:27
to craig and let's
30:28
let's let him know that you're thinking
30:29
of him um he eventually by may 1991
30:33
received
30:33
33 million cards it just went so massive
30:38
it went so big but the biggest problem
30:39
was is that um
30:41
he actually got better which was
30:42
fantastic it was amazing um
30:44
and he was and he was really ill he
30:46
shouldn't have got better by according
30:47
to the doctors and he did it's fantastic
30:49
the doctor
30:50
is doing backflips all over the place
30:54
are you are you happy that i'm better no
30:55
no these are all involuntary
30:59
no but so he he received in that time um
31:01
33 million but the
31:03
the chain letter kept going around
31:05
different countries the
31:06
the name kept changing on it as well so
31:08
he just kept receiving
31:10
different bits of uh cards from people
31:13
all around the world and um so it's said
31:15
that since 1989
31:17
he has now received 350 million
31:20
greeting cards unfortunately he died
31:23
when he was crushed to death by a big
31:25
pile of greeting cards
31:26
it was got he got so big that the royal
31:29
mail gave him his own postal code for
31:31
his house
31:32
because it was just such a deluge and he
31:35
doesn't he
31:36
used to give interviews about what how
31:37
exciting it was and stuff he he doesn't
31:39
he's gone behind the scenes now he's not
31:41
a public figure the only time he really
31:43
comes out and talks to the press
31:44
is to say please stop sending me cards
31:48
well at least you haven't republicized
31:49
it tonight
31:52
um there were a couple of guys in 2016.
31:54
they were american
31:55
inventors uh sort of inventors of fun
31:57
silly products
31:59
they came up with a greetings card that
32:00
you can send to new parents
32:02
and it has a button inside and when you
32:05
press it
32:06
it starts to play the sound of a baby
32:08
screaming
32:09
at which lasts for three hours
32:12
and which will keep going even if you
32:14
destroy the card
32:16
and every time you press the button
32:17
again to make it stop it gets slightly
32:19
louder
32:23
wow and where can i buy this card
32:26
they sold out did they yeah that is
32:30
amazing yeah that should actually
32:33
win an award in the international
32:36
cards awards ceremony that is the best
32:38
card i've ever heard of
32:39
is that a thing and that is the thing so
32:41
that what do you get for congratulations
32:44
if you win it from your friends
32:47
you get the screamer uh no this is uh
32:50
the international greetings card
32:52
awards competition or the louise as
32:55
they're known
32:56
are so they're held in america they have
32:57
been since 1988.
32:59
and they seem to be quite a big deal
33:01
they're named after the
33:02
father or the grandfather of greetings
33:05
cards who was actually a german
33:06
immigrant to
33:07
america called luis prang and he made
33:10
the first line of
33:11
christmas cards in about 1875. and so
33:14
yeah they have this this big competition
33:16
and the winners are announced in may
33:19
during the national stationery show
33:21
which i know will all be attending um
33:24
next year we've missed it this year
33:26
sadly it was a few days ago
33:28
but i there was the uh greetings cards
33:30
association director
33:32
said there is nothing like the genuine
33:34
and lasting connection you get from
33:36
receiving and sending
33:37
a greetings card and he is called pete
33:39
dougherty
33:42
which i really like to think that pete
33:44
dougherty has been moonlighting
33:45
as the head of a greetings baby shambles
33:48
have played on this stage
33:52
but not recently because he's been very
33:53
busy at the national stationary
33:54
competition
33:55
just on christmas cards just while we're
33:57
talking about it um if you're an atheist
33:59
or a skeptic
34:00
um obviously christmas cards isn't your
34:02
thing so there's an alternative that's
34:03
been created
34:05
and it is celebrating the fact that
34:07
isaac newton
34:08
was born on the 25th of december so it's
34:11
called newton mus
34:13
and newton mus is a the skeptic society
34:16
have a party
34:17
around christmas time and that's what
34:18
will celebrate and they send each other
34:21
newton's cars as well and inside it
34:23
reads
34:24
reasons greetings
34:28
um the the smallest greetings card in
34:31
the world is so small that you could fit
34:33
200 million of them
34:34
on a single stamp wow it's been made by
34:38
some scientists
34:40
uh it's not a practical thing
34:43
but there's also the world's biggest
34:44
card the world's biggest greetings card
34:46
uh is 18 meters tall and 13 meters
34:49
across
34:50
it was in india that it was created by a
34:53
housing company
34:54
for more publicity um
34:57
but so i found that on the biggest card
35:00
you could fit 46 million stamps
35:03
so i wondered how many times you could
35:04
fit the smallest
35:06
card in the world onto the largest known
35:08
card in the world that's just simple
35:10
multiplication
35:11
yes
35:14
it's just simple multiplication it
35:17
actually is a really big number
35:19
yeah your calculator probably doesn't go
35:21
that hard my calculator didn't go that
35:23
high i had to go to a special online
35:24
calculator and then really carefully
35:26
check
35:27
the answer and that i thought i was
35:29
getting it wrong i'm so sorry
35:30
i've misjudged this whole situation that
35:32
does sound good i feel like i have
35:36
just give us a answer the
35:37
smallest card
35:39
ever made could fit on the largest card
35:41
ever made
35:43
hundred trillion times oh is that all
35:47
what yes anyway
35:50
that's the sum i did earlier today cool
35:53
the oldest
35:54
valentine's card the oldest valentine's
35:56
card in england was from 1477
35:59
and it was from marjorie brews to her
36:01
fiance john paston
36:03
and in it she says a few things and then
36:05
she says i beseech you
36:06
that this bill be not seen by
36:08
non-earthly creature
36:10
save only yourself anyway that's on
36:12
display in the british library
36:14
[Laughter]
36:19
um we're gonna have to wrap up guys oh
36:21
can i just do it like a really nice
36:23
birthday card fact
36:24
from britain in fact which is the so
36:26
britain's two
36:27
oldest men are called al smith and bob
36:30
wayton and they're both 111 now i think
36:34
and they were born by coincidence on the
36:36
same day
36:37
in 1908 so wait and send smith a
36:41
birthday card every year and smith sends
36:43
weight in a birthday card every year
36:44
and they send these really sweet
36:46
messages in them so they interviewed one
36:48
of them recently actually they
36:49
interviewed wayton on his birthday which
36:50
was the day we were supposed to leave
36:52
the eu
36:53
and he said which one
36:58
i've lost track um he actually said a
37:01
111 year old man said my own feeling
37:03
is that there were defects but we should
37:06
negotiate from the inside rather than
37:08
walking off the field with the cricket
37:09
ball and saying
37:10
i'm not playing which did make me think
37:12
we should start having over 100 year
37:14
olds in government
37:15
but they sent each other these sweet
37:16
cards so he sent the other guy a card
37:18
saying do keep in touch i wish we'd
37:19
known about each other earlier
37:21
and then we did it how nice is that
37:24
oh that is very cool but if they'd known
37:26
about each other like
37:28
50 years earlier it would have just been
37:29
two random men sending each other cards
37:31
for no reason
37:32
yes the whole ceremony can only function
37:35
because the two of them are the oldest
37:36
men in the country
37:38
[Laughter]
37:40
one more thing one more thing no
37:44
yeah of course of course of course just
37:46
because this is about america's
37:47
not under the sun is it it's another sum
37:49
no it's not
37:50
uh this is about america's birthday
37:52
right so the 1926 birthday which was 150
37:56
years of america
37:56
so good good calculation
38:00
did you have to go online for that one
38:01
as well
38:04
so 50 years before that would have been
38:06
1876 which is the 100th birthday of
38:09
america
38:10
right this is not the fact this is not
38:13
the fact this is just the setup
38:14
no no no no no no no you sarcastic
38:19
people
38:19
[Laughter]
38:20
right so they celebrated with a thing
38:23
called the centennial exposition in
38:24
philadelphia it was this
38:26
massive great you know thing the affair
38:28
basically they had of human achievement
38:30
it was in philadelphia 10 million people
38:33
visited a fifth of the american
38:35
population
38:36
they were massive displays they had all
38:37
kinds of stuff the biggest building in
38:39
the world
38:40
it was where they first had heinz
38:41
ketchup uh they first had
38:44
like they had the arm of the statue of
38:45
liberty because they couldn't they
38:47
hadn't afforded all the money for the
38:48
actual statue
38:49
so you could just pay to go up the arm
38:53
there were the best thing there was the
38:54
inventions and the inventions included
38:56
the first
38:56
typewriter um alexander graham bell's
38:59
telephone
39:00
a calculator a mechanical calculator
39:03
which now i see why you wanted to tell
39:05
this fact which
39:06
measured five foot by eight foot
39:09
which would have come in handy earlier
39:11
today
39:13
but the best invention was something
39:15
called
39:16
the convertible portmanteau which was a
39:19
suitcase made of rubber cloth which
39:21
converted into a bath
39:26
if you were traveling and there were no
39:28
baths available you could just have your
39:30
suitcase which folded into a bath
39:32
well your laptop's going to get wet
39:36
it feels like you do have to unpack the
39:37
suitcase first pretty right
39:40
i don't all suitcases convert into bars
39:43
but if you want them to i could rub a
39:44
tap in my suitcase
39:47
yeah i hadn't fully considered that yeah
39:52
well look thank you for that andy um

01:26
[Music]
01:38
oh
01:40
and welcome to another episode of no
01:43
such thing as a fish
01:45
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
01:47
live
01:48
from oslo
01:56
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
01:58
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
02:00
murray and james harkin
02:01
and once again we have gathered around
02:03
the microphones with our four favorite
02:05
facts from the last seven days
02:06
and in no particular order here we go
02:09
starting with you
02:10
andy my fact is that there was once an
02:13
olympic sport
02:14
where you had to dive into a pool and
02:16
then glide along
02:18
for a minute it was scrapped because the
02:22
main factor was how heavy you were
02:27
don't you think though like the main
02:29
factor in the running race is how fast
02:31
you are so why is it not fair to have
02:33
how heavy you are
02:34
completely it's completely that's that's
02:36
fair you can train to be heavy in the
02:38
same way you could train to run fast
02:39
really
02:40
i guess so you could see the winner
02:41
coming along before the game even starts
02:43
right
02:44
uh he's got gold well this was this was
02:47
the thing called the plunge
02:49
for distance was the official name of it
02:51
so basically
02:52
you dived in you weren't allowed to move
02:54
you weren't allowed to swim at all
02:56
you had to keep your head under the
02:57
surface of the water and then you were
02:59
timed and they saw how far you would get
03:01
in either 60 seconds or until you put
03:03
your head up above the water
03:04
and another thing is it's not a great
03:06
spectator spot is it
03:09
it it got called competitive floating
03:15
it's the least spectatory sport
03:17
imaginable
03:18
it it happened once in st louis in 1904
03:23
yeah and there were lots of reviews at
03:24
the time which were pretty negative
03:26
people said the competitors
03:27
merely throw themselves heavily in the
03:29
water and float along like icebergs in
03:31
the shipping lanes
03:34
and this this was in st louis in uh 1904
03:38
yeah yeah okay so um there was lots of
03:40
great things that happened in that
03:42
olympics in the water polo the americans
03:45
said that
03:46
instead of having a fully inflated bowl
03:48
you could have it
03:49
slightly inflated if that's a word
03:53
but actually to score a goal you had to
03:55
hold the ball underwater in the net
03:57
rather than throwing it and the germans
03:59
thought that this was complete nonsense
04:01
they called it soft water polo and
04:03
refused to compete
04:05
two of the winning american water polo
04:07
team were dead six months later
04:09
and they think it might have been
04:11
because the matches took place in the
04:13
lagoon
04:14
that was used as a sump for the animal
04:16
and vegetable waste from all the other
04:17
exhibits
04:19
[Laughter]
04:24
and the germans they brought their own
04:26
diving board for the diving competition
04:28
it was made out of a special coconut
04:30
matting and they insisted that all the
04:32
scoring be on the acrobatics you did in
04:35
the air
04:35
and it didn't matter how you entered the
04:37
water
04:39
yeah that was a massive controversy
04:41
wasn't it in the diving and this was
04:42
what was called the fancy diving
04:44
which is what used to be the name for
04:46
the high dive basically
04:47
and yet i think the person who won was
04:49
an american and the
04:51
guy who'd made the trophy to present to
04:53
the winner was german
04:55
and he refused to hand over the trophy
04:57
because he was so outraged
04:59
this is [ __ ] he just landed well the
05:02
stuff in the air was useless it was a
05:03
very interesting olympics
05:05
it was only 12 countries uh competed in
05:08
the 1904 olympics and it
05:10
largely was because no one wanted to go
05:12
to saint louis they just thought
05:13
it's too far away it's inaccessible so
05:15
but the americans said okay well we'll
05:17
just put more people in
05:18
so 81 of the people who competed in the
05:21
1904 olympics were americans
05:24
so there were 630 athletes in total 523
05:28
were americans
05:30
they won 239 medals
05:34
still a record to this day of most
05:36
medals won by a single nation
05:38
in the olympics i think the runner-up
05:40
was germany who got 13 right
05:43
but this was this is a thing this is a
05:44
controversy in fact even in norway
05:47
so um the usa the
05:51
that's where we are if the listeners
05:52
haven't realized
05:55
um so the usa fielded uh athletes who
05:58
were immigrants from europe who hadn't
06:01
actually become
06:02
u.s citizens uh yet so they were they
06:04
really weren't they shouldn't have been
06:05
competing for the usa
06:07
and the norwegians were still annoyed
06:08
about this in 2012
06:12
there was still officially requesting
06:14
that the results were changed
06:18
108 years after these olympics
06:23
we've got to write historical wrongs
06:24
where we can
06:29
uh you know james you were saying that i
06:31
think you said the germans brought their
06:32
own dive board yes um well actually
06:34
generally people did bring their own
06:36
dive boards to diving competitions
06:38
so this was until the 1960s basically
06:41
so the diving board that we know today
06:43
which is the really springy one and you
06:45
know when you see them dive and i always
06:46
think it's going to snap because it
06:47
bends so much
06:48
and that was invented by a guy called
06:49
raymond rood and he sort of tried it out
06:52
and i know it's a good name
06:54
um he tried it out in a neighbor's
06:56
garden for a few years and it worked
06:58
and so he brought it to the olympics in
06:59
1960. but before that divers would just
07:02
bring their own boards and then they'd
07:03
get there and they'd sometimes do some
07:04
swaps and they'd try out each other's
07:05
boards to see which ones they liked
07:07
and it was only when he brought his and
07:08
everyone requested his to the extent
07:10
that he had to
07:10
like telegram back or whatever to send
07:12
some more over because it was so in
07:14
demand that people were like should we
07:15
just use this one
07:17
did they bring the ladders as well or is
07:19
it just the i don't think you need a
07:21
special ladder so much so
07:22
i think to get up yeah you know i agree
07:26
you need a ladder
07:26
yeah yeah
07:32
unless you're also very good at the high
07:34
jump well that might be
07:36
what an event that would be where you do
07:37
the pole vault onto it and then dive off
07:39
it
07:42
do you know how they make those uh those
07:44
aluminium boards it's very cool
07:46
so they're made of aircraft-grade
07:48
aluminium which i didn't know
07:50
um and they take a massive cylinder of
07:52
aluminium and they heat it
07:53
to a very high temperature and then they
07:55
squeeze it through a massive press with
07:57
thousands of tons of pressure on it
07:59
so it's like pushing it through a
08:00
toothpaste tube basically
08:02
just sort of very hot aluminium
08:04
toothpaste
08:05
well the first one was made of a plane
08:08
wing
08:09
in fact sorry the first one was made of
08:11
an aeroplane wing before they actually
08:13
had penguins
08:18
i mean their wings are kind of flat
08:20
aren't they they're almost
08:21
archiving pods quite bouncy blubbery
08:24
quality if you get them in the right
08:25
season
08:26
and here are the antarctica team
08:32
sorry an aeroplane wing wow it was
08:34
actually made of an airplane yeah yeah
08:36
it was somehow less funny than a penguin
08:42
that's a long diving board though hey i
08:44
think you sort of cut it up
08:45
okay you don't want to be tired by the
08:49
time you've got to the end of the diving
08:52
ideally you want somewhere between a
08:53
penguin wing and an aeroplane
08:56
that's the official measurement and
08:59
there was
09:00
just another olympic thing so in 1896 in
09:03
the first olympics there was the
09:04
hurdling
09:05
and there was a massive difference
09:07
between the american team who could run
09:09
and then jump over the hurdles and the
09:11
greek team who would run up to the head
09:12
will stop
09:13
jump over and then start running again
09:17
who won
09:18
[Laughter]
09:21
so amazing was that part of their rules
09:23
because they kind of thought that was
09:24
the best way to do it
09:26
well no one had ever really done it
09:27
before
09:29
it's the first olympics wow no wonder
09:33
the greek empire fell in the end
09:36
it wouldn't be your instincts um
09:39
just on diving so in norway the
09:42
norwegians like to dive
09:43
and specifically one particular kind of
09:45
diving called i think it's dirt thing
09:48
is this a thing yeah it's insane
09:51
so this is i think it the translation is
09:54
death diving or deathing
09:55
basically and it's an annual thing and
09:58
essentially
09:59
it's a belly flop from 10 meters high
10:01
and so
10:02
you get on this diving has anyone ever
10:04
been to one of the competitions
10:06
yeah quite a few people it sounds insane
10:09
so i was watching a lot of videos of
10:10
this today but basically
10:12
these mad norwegian people go up 10
10:14
meters high and then you have to throw
10:16
yourself off and you basically do as
10:18
many impressive things in the air as you
10:19
can
10:20
and then you're judged largely on how
10:23
quickly you scrunch up at the end and
10:24
kind of avoid literally splitting your
10:26
body open
10:28
but it's really funny to watch because
10:30
the commentary is just these two guys
10:32
who are just constantly going oh oh oh
10:35
oh oh god
10:40
insane so there is a there's a dive
10:42
which is
10:44
theoretically possible there's a pair of
10:46
mathematicians
10:47
in the university of australia and
10:48
they've come up with the dive because
10:50
you know you have all these different
10:51
twists and some assaults and turns and
10:53
all this stuff
10:53
so they've calculated a dive that they
10:56
insist
10:56
is must be possible which is you have to
11:00
do one and a half somersaults and
11:02
five twists and that's in 1.5 seconds
11:05
um between starting to fall and thing
11:08
and so they say they've simulated it and
11:10
they say it's possible and any diver
11:11
that has been asked has said no
11:13
we can't do that um it is done by
11:17
mathematicians rather
11:18
yeah yeah by biomechanical scientists it
11:21
feels like they've just found the
11:22
perfect sphere
11:23
we have no air resistance and just
11:26
i don't know but i so desperately want
11:28
to see a queue of scrawny pasty
11:30
mathematicians
11:32
being forced onto a diving board to
11:34
prove they're working
11:38
and we're gonna have to move on in a
11:39
second to our next fact
11:41
just a couple more olympic things maybe
11:42
yeah um so at the first ever winter
11:45
olympics
11:45
in 1924 seven people who won medals were
11:49
dead
11:52
is that what the event where you had to
11:53
go under the snow for as long as
11:55
possible
11:58
um no the medals went to people who had
12:00
achieved great things in mountaineering
12:02
and so the british expedition to everest
12:04
in 1922 won despite the fact that a lot
12:06
of people had died
12:07
just one more mad olympic sport that
12:10
doesn't exist anymore
12:11
in 1908 in the olympics this was in
12:14
london in fact
12:15
dueling was a demonstration sport there
12:18
and
12:18
it was really great so it used a real
12:19
gun but it was it was
12:21
wax pellets so theoretically they
12:24
couldn't they weren't supposed to kill
12:26
you
12:26
they did travel at 87 meters a second so
12:29
they're going quite fast
12:30
um and then they they splat you expand
12:32
with a splat like an incredibly
12:33
dangerous paintball
12:34
um and yet they wore some protection so
12:37
they protected like
12:38
their extremities and they wore big head
12:40
protection otherwise it would kill them
12:42
and the winner so they also wore this
12:45
big black cloak
12:46
all over themselves and on the cloak in
12:48
chalk they had drawn out where all the
12:50
vital organs are and then
12:52
they did the jewel and the winner was
12:54
the person who
12:55
hit closest because it made a mark hit
12:57
closer to the most important vital organ
13:00
that's amazing so good and i was reading
13:02
the
13:03
an old newspaper report of it and there
13:04
was one pistolman who i'm going to
13:06
assume was a brit
13:07
who said he and apparently he announced
13:10
his intention to forego the head
13:11
protection
13:12
preferring to rely on the gentlemanly
13:14
honor code that it was bad form to aim
13:16
for the head
13:20
uh just on a similar thing in 1924 in
13:23
the fencing competition
13:24
the french judge and the hungarian judge
13:27
really fell out
13:28
and decided to have their own jewel
13:32
that november after the games they met
13:34
on the yugoslav italian border and
13:36
jeweled for over an hour
13:38
until both men were seriously injured
13:40
and nearby people had to stop the
13:42
contest
13:43
wow okay it is time for fact number two
13:46
and that is chozinski my fact this week
13:49
is that at polar park in norway you're
13:52
told not to wear wool
13:53
clothes in case the wolves confuse you
13:56
with a sheep
14:00
so this is something that's a danger
14:02
apparently this is
14:04
polar park which has anyone been
14:07
it sounds amazing okay so for those of
14:09
you who haven't it's this 300 acre
14:11
wildlife park and one of their main
14:14
attractions is this wolf population that
14:15
they've got there
14:16
and i was reading an article by someone
14:19
who'd been and visited
14:20
and she said she did meet the wolves so
14:22
you get to meet them they're sort of
14:23
tame and friendly you're told
14:25
but at the same time the main wildlife
14:28
keeper says
14:29
you've got to be quite careful so for
14:30
instance they show lots of interest in
14:32
anyone who is sick
14:33
limping or weak
14:34
[Music]
14:38
you're told when you meet them to kneel
14:40
down not sit so you can make a very
14:42
quick escape if suddenly they turn on
14:44
you
14:44
and you're told to remove all your wool
14:46
clothing otherwise um so i wrote to
14:48
actually the main wildlife keeper who's
14:49
a guy called stig slesson
14:51
to check up on this with him and i said
14:53
is this true that you can't and he said
14:55
yes people are told not to wear wool
14:56
otherwise you might have naked people
14:58
running around
14:59
after meeting the wolves it's that
15:02
sheepy smell they can't resist it there
15:04
are a lot of things that they say you
15:06
can't do if you're going there so you
15:07
can't wear
15:08
fur you can't wear gloves hats earrings
15:11
you can't be pregnant you can't be under
15:13
18 and if they knock you over you just
15:15
have to lay there
15:16
you can't move why because they might
15:19
eat you
15:21
i assume i assume but if they've knocked
15:23
you over they've got you right where
15:25
they want you yeah
15:26
so you just have to a wolf is a kind of
15:28
animal that chases after its prey
15:30
so if it knocks you over and you panic
15:32
and you run away then it might chase
15:33
after you
15:34
yeah but how far into the process of it
15:36
eating you
15:37
if it does start to do that yeah can you
15:40
deploy plan b
15:41
whatever that is well it sucks when plan
15:45
b is try to outrun a very fast animal
15:48
with neither of your legs left
15:49
[Laughter]
15:53
there was just one more weird thing that
15:55
the wildlife keeper said to me
15:56
in his email he said another thing that
15:59
we ask people not to do
16:00
when they meet the wolves is related to
16:02
the fact that wolves have very strong
16:04
senses and they have a very strong sense
16:05
of smell
16:06
so we don't encourage people to have sex
16:08
before meeting our wolves
16:10
what wait do you mean you don't mean
16:12
ever though
16:16
bring another virgin for the wolves
16:21
it didn't specify okay um so obviously
16:24
wolves are a little controversial here
16:26
because some parts of norway have a wolf
16:27
taxi
16:28
which is um for children going to school
16:30
in areas where there are wolves right
16:32
okay
16:33
um but uh the re-wilding is a big
16:36
thing and the way that you can rewild
16:38
the wolf is really
16:40
cool so step one is to watch
16:43
the wolves um in shifts to know when
16:46
they're going to mate this is your um
16:47
we need to what you need to have where
16:49
are they what sorry are they in a zoo or
16:51
something when you need
16:52
uh zoo wolves to mate so you then
16:55
calculate because i think they're
16:56
pregnant for about 63 days
16:58
there are there abouts yeah yeah
17:01
and then you search for a wild pack
17:03
which has recently had puppies
17:05
and uh you track them down you with
17:07
hopefully they've got collars on so you
17:09
know where they are
17:09
and then you need to carry the new
17:12
puppies
17:12
to the pack that you've found uh in
17:15
backpacks adorable
17:16
and and you need to get you need to get
17:19
to the
17:19
wolf's den and you need to go in and
17:22
then you need to take your new zoo
17:24
puppies
17:24
and roll them around in the urine and
17:26
the feces of the existing
17:29
wild puppies right and you also and you
17:31
sort of mix them up so they smell
17:33
completely alike
17:34
and then you retreat wow yeah really
17:36
when you leave the puppies behind and
17:38
then you hope that they
17:39
blend in yeah isn't that weird
17:43
imagine if you though were visiting the
17:44
park and you quickly needed a pee so you
17:46
went into a cave had a quick wash
17:48
and then they shoved their faces into
17:50
that you're now mummy
17:54
is that how it works oh my god
17:58
i thought i don't think my urine helps
18:03
anything though
18:05
okay um so the rewilding of
18:08
wolves and birds especially around
18:10
europe is quite big at the moment
18:12
you have quite a lot in france you have
18:14
quite a lot in germany and switzerland
18:15
that weren't there
18:16
even 20 years ago uh i was speaking to
18:19
my friend from latvia and was asking him
18:21
if they have them in latvia
18:22
and he i said do you have any wolves
18:24
there and he said oh yeah we've got
18:25
loads of wolves now
18:26
said do you have any bears and he said
18:27
we have one bear although sometimes he
18:30
goes over to lithuania
18:34
so they have 0.5 bears
18:37
bears are now extinct in latvia oh no
18:40
sorry
18:42
great news there was so they do seem to
18:44
be controversial here
18:45
there's um norway is split apparently
18:49
we agreed on this over whether wolves
18:51
are bad guys or good guys
18:53
um yeah okay so half of you are going to
18:56
leave
18:56
after i've said this but in 2009
19:00
one man personally offered a reward of
19:02
50 000 norwegian kroner for
19:04
information leading to a person who'd
19:06
legally killed a wolf so someone's
19:07
killed a wolf
19:08
he says here's his reward and in
19:10
response to that he was
19:11
completely so he was vandalized there
19:13
was rubbish dumped in his driveway like
19:14
huge piles of garbage
19:16
all of his outbuildings and his fences
19:18
were vandalized and one night he was out
19:20
of town
19:20
and his wife woke up to a loud buzzing
19:22
noise to find a group of people
19:24
encircling the house marching around it
19:26
waving chainsaws
19:29
well that's because he didn't make his
19:30
house out of straw ralph twigs right
19:36
there were um licenses given out in
19:38
norway to shoot
19:39
16 wild wolves uh the government decided
19:42
on a cull
19:43
and more than 11 000 hunters applied for
19:46
them
19:48
11 000. but we were very into
19:51
shooting walls for a long time weren't
19:52
we back when we had them before we did
19:54
the podcast
19:58
it was out on a shoot that we thought
19:59
you know we should we should do a
20:00
podcast
20:03
do you know i'm just speaking sorry
20:05
could you just what were you talking
20:06
about there
20:06
uh yeah so we were big into we were big
20:09
into hunting wolves so
20:10
they are always the archetypal bad guy
20:12
the wolf rather than the bear which is
20:14
much more likely to kill you
20:15
um and england had a serious wolf
20:17
problem it would kill lots of people's
20:18
sheep
20:19
and eventually everyone got so pissed
20:20
off about it that in the 13th century in
20:22
1281
20:23
king edward the first commissioned a guy
20:25
called peter the mighty hunter
20:27
corbett and andrew hunter murray would
20:31
be so much better if you had the mighty
20:33
as well that's a good point
20:36
i will consider it you've got to earn a
20:38
middle name like that i think
20:40
um and he definitely did so he was told
20:42
to exterminate all the wolves in england
20:44
and he did it so apparently by 1290 once
20:48
all the wolves were exterminated he'd
20:49
earned his nickname uh
20:51
england was rid of all the wolves that
20:53
was what was reported there were no more
20:54
deaths of um you know uh livestock by
20:57
wolves anymore and he was known from
20:59
then on as the unemployed
21:06
there are there are some monkeys which
21:08
have started domesticating wolves we
21:10
think
21:12
so this is really exciting
21:15
this is like dogs 2.0 basically
21:18
there are bits of ethiopia where there
21:21
are ethiopian wolves which is a
21:22
particular species and gallardo monkeys
21:25
and they're getting on really well
21:27
and the wolves don't eat the baby
21:29
monkeys when they're hanging around
21:31
together
21:32
and uh the galadas don't object to the
21:34
wolves so um
21:35
this is very similar to the way that
21:36
humans domesticated wolves in the first
21:38
place
21:38
and they will just sit next to each
21:39
other for a couple of hours at a time
21:41
just ignoring each other
21:42
so they seem to be deliberately hanging
21:44
out together
21:46
okay but hey so when when we're
21:49
traveling from one city to another and
21:50
you're just sat there
21:51
ignoring me i'm i'm domesticating you
21:58
[Applause]
22:01
no but like yeah anyway the wolves
22:04
the wolves seem to find it easier to
22:05
catch rodents when they're hanging
22:07
around with the monkeys and we don't
22:08
know why
22:09
okay so it might be there's a food
22:10
reward in it for them and so that will
22:12
be the next
22:13
uh big thing
22:16
big thing in what in
22:19
evolution they're going to be the new
22:21
humans and dogs is what you're saying
22:23
i'm trying to picture this did you
22:25
humans adults yeah
22:27
it works well wolves do team up with
22:29
other creatures for hunting so there was
22:31
a great headline in the washington post
22:33
which was wolves and hyenas hunt
22:35
together
22:36
prove middle east peace process is
22:38
possible
22:44
okay it is time for fact number three
22:46
and that is my fact
22:48
my fact this week is that this year
22:51
doctors in vietnam
22:52
saved a man's life by pumping 15 cans of
22:55
beer
22:56
into his body
23:01
if i just have to do that in norway
23:03
you'd have to mortgage your house
23:08
so this this was a guy who uh very sadly
23:10
was dying from alcohol poisoning he was
23:12
um
23:13
yeah so not so funny now is it
23:17
he's 48 years old and he fell
23:19
unconscious they took him to the
23:20
hospital and he had
23:21
huge levels of methanol in him um he had
23:24
more than a thousand times what would be
23:26
the recommended limit
23:27
um and so yeah so basically what they
23:30
had to do is they had to administer
23:33
more cans of beer into him because the
23:34
idea was that they needed to slow down
23:36
the
23:37
metabolizing process that his liver was
23:39
doing yeah and by by slowing it down and
23:41
by putting in total these 15 cans
23:43
one an hour they managed to slow it
23:45
enough that they could fix him yeah so
23:47
what it is is
23:48
that the beer contains ethanol and your
23:50
body
23:51
always does the ethanol before it does
23:52
the methanol so you put all this bearing
23:54
it's dealing with the ethanol and it
23:55
gives you a bit of time to get the
23:57
methanol out
23:58
but they did still need to suck the
23:59
methanol out didn't they otherwise you
24:01
just
24:02
got rid of all the ethanol you've pumped
24:03
in and then the methanol comes back
24:05
how do you suck methanol out of someone
24:08
does it
24:09
does it gather somewhere in your body
24:10
yeah it's through dialysis
24:12
okay yeah
24:15
so the kidney yes yeah cool
24:19
it's that sometimes it's just questions
24:21
and answers
24:24
but he survived so it's a good a good
24:26
ending that's a good story
24:28
but don't try it on any old illness i'm
24:30
not sure we're recommending it are we
24:32
no no oh well some people some people
24:34
recommended it so
24:35
okay yes we are but there are lots of
24:38
medicines which used to be just pure
24:39
alcohol basically
24:41
so that uh in the 19th century lydia e
24:44
pinkham's vegetable compound for female
24:46
complaints
24:48
it said it was herbal and it was
24:50
entirely alcohol basically and
24:52
it was it was aimed at women the slogan
24:54
was only a woman can understand another
24:56
woman's ills
24:57
right and women were encouraged to write
25:00
to lydia pinkham who was the woman on
25:02
the bottle
25:02
you know for personal advice and lydia
25:04
pinkham had a very large number of
25:06
typists who just replied for her
25:08
recommending that these women take
25:09
higher doses of mrs pinkham's
25:12
vegetable compound they kept this going
25:14
for 20 years
25:15
after lydia pinkham died wow really
25:18
yeah eventually i thought she's been
25:20
replying to these letters for a very
25:21
long time
25:23
yeah it is effective though alcohol in a
25:26
lot of ways i
25:26
it's probably the most medicinally
25:30
[Music]
25:32
and not for easing social situations
25:34
just in medicine
25:35
but i think it's probably the most
25:36
effective medicine that existed
25:38
in humanity for of many thousand years
25:40
in terms of its sterilizing
25:42
qualities right it's amazing sterilize
25:44
if you've got a wound um purifying water
25:46
so
25:47
the death rates in the 19th century if
25:49
people hadn't been able to drink beer
25:50
instead of
25:51
water attack water in most places would
25:53
have been much higher um it's a relaxant
25:55
and
25:56
so and they've been all these studies as
25:58
well and i might get into trouble for
25:59
saying this but
26:00
it's genuinely if you look rigorously at
26:03
the research
26:04
uh so there's a guy who looks at
26:05
hundreds of studies into the effects of
26:07
moderate drinking
26:08
and once you've controlled for all
26:10
factors so once you've controlled for
26:12
like
26:13
social factors economic factors age
26:15
weight stuff like that
26:16
even once you've eradicated those your
26:19
increased mortality
26:21
if you are a heavy drinker or an
26:23
abstainer
26:24
is higher than if you're a moderate
26:26
drinker so if you're an abstainer you
26:27
have
26:28
a 51 higher mortality rate or risk
26:31
than if you're a moderate drinker and
26:33
moderate is two glasses of wine a day
26:38
so and how many of you had so far
26:41
tonight ella
26:43
i got very big glasses i think it's
26:47
weird the recommended daily allowance is
26:48
half of that and
26:49
just on the medical thing about how it
26:51
was really important over history one
26:53
really weird thing is that the ancient
26:56
nubians
26:57
used to make beer and as part of their
26:59
beer they made this thing called
27:00
tetracycline
27:01
it was just kind of an off product of it
27:03
and this actually is one of our greatest
27:05
antibiotics
27:07
which was only invented in the modern
27:08
day in the 1940s
27:10
and so what loads of um archaeologists
27:12
have found is these bodies
27:14
with this amazing modern antibiotic in
27:16
it and they're like where the hell does
27:18
this come from they said it was the
27:19
equivalent of seeing an egyptian mummy
27:21
wearing ray-ban sunglasses wow
27:25
but it came from their beer yeah that's
27:27
very cool yeah
27:28
incredible see that's very cool and you
27:31
used to get prescriptions for alcohol
27:33
sometimes
27:34
during the days of prohibition so if you
27:36
were willing to pay six dollars
27:38
for a prescription uh you would get a
27:40
pint of alcohol in america when it was
27:42
banned
27:42
and one of the people who did this was
27:44
winston churchill right
27:46
so he was in america in 1931 he looked
27:48
the wrong way when he was
27:49
crossing the road and he was hit by a
27:51
car and
27:52
he had some complications and he had
27:54
months of medical problems he was really
27:55
in pain
27:56
and so he got a doctor to write him a
27:57
prescription and the doctor wrote
27:59
the post-accident convalescence of
28:01
winston churchill necessitates the use
28:03
of alcoholic spirits
28:04
especially at mealtimes
28:08
[Laughter]
28:11
but not beer you couldn't prescribe beer
28:13
there was this bizarre controversy
28:15
so people are really anti-beer for
28:17
medicinal reasons and
28:19
there was a guy called he was the
28:20
attorney general in america called
28:22
mitchell palmer and he was under a lot
28:23
of pressure from
28:24
brewers so he said fine give sick people
28:26
beer if it helps them which
28:28
it often would to relax you um and he
28:31
said
28:31
you could prescribe it at any time and
28:33
he said commercial drug stores should be
28:35
able to sell it from kind of soda
28:37
fountains
28:37
so there was almost a time where
28:39
pharmacies across america had a beer
28:41
fountain
28:42
during prohibition and then all those
28:45
bloody
28:46
um abolitionists got involved and said
28:48
that he couldn't do it
28:49
and he was kicked out and then
28:51
prescribing bureau at all was banned
28:53
wow but they do it today still in
28:55
american hospitals from an article that
28:57
i read where someone was visiting a
28:58
friend
28:59
and the food came in which was just the
29:01
classic lunch they get but on the
29:03
on the tray was a can of budweiser and
29:05
it's because certain patients if they're
29:07
going
29:08
let's say through a withdrawal that's
29:09
not helpful in their situation to be
29:11
suddenly cut off from alcohol so
29:13
this same patient was given it for
29:14
breakfast as well so it'd be sort of
29:16
you know eggs and budweiser for
29:18
breakfast and that goes on still it's
29:20
it's not necessarily seen as a bad thing
29:23
mariah carey had it
29:25
not not a person who gets a lot of
29:26
airtime in this podcast but
29:29
she was actually investigated by the
29:32
police
29:33
by the la department of children and
29:35
family services
29:36
because tmz reported that she had been
29:39
drinking
29:40
beer while she was breastfeeding she had
29:42
newborn twins and she said the nurse
29:43
told me to do it and the nurse had told
29:45
her
29:45
that guinness can help breastfeeders um
29:48
so it loosens up your milk and stuff and
29:50
actually i was talking to our boss about
29:51
this the other day and she was always
29:52
told that and she always did uh
29:53
it used to be told in the past it was
29:55
always said that you should drink
29:56
goodness
29:57
yeah i think yeah um or breastfeeding or
29:59
not breastfeeding really
30:01
that might have been when we were in
30:02
ireland a few weeks ago yeah they said
30:04
that we're gonna have to move on
30:05
soon oh one alcohol you might not want
30:08
to drink when breastfeeding or otherwise
30:10
is an icelandic alcohol made from a
30:13
whale's testicle
30:15
uh the guy who made it said we smoked
30:17
the testicle by the old icelandic way
30:20
with dried sheep [ __ ]
30:26
and this method gives the beer a really
30:28
unique smoke flavor
30:31
fancy some of that unique
30:34
okay what about this there's a beer made
30:35
from elephant dung
30:38
and they use coffee beans that have
30:39
passed through an elephant's digestive
30:41
system to make the beer
30:42
and instead of talking about an
30:44
aftertaste they talk about an afterglow
30:48
and there is a new whiskey that has been
30:50
made flavored with the anal secretions
30:52
of
30:52
beavers and on the website it says
30:56
the sac excretion exhibits bright and
30:58
fruit qualities
31:01
and rich leathery notes along with a
31:03
creamy vanilla aroma
31:08
you don't want creamy anywhere near anal
31:10
secretions if you're having to consume
31:12
them
31:15
i've got one more prescription that was
31:17
dished out just because this was about
31:19
you know prescribing beer effectively
31:21
um cambridge university have just
31:22
published a load of their patient
31:23
records from the 1590s to the 1630s
31:27
and they've got thousands and thousands
31:28
they've got 80 000 case notes
31:30
but they're incredibly hard to read
31:31
because obviously the writing is
31:33
extremely
31:34
um you know it's just very different to
31:36
our writing today but they've finally
31:38
put up a batch online
31:39
and the prescriptions uh include things
31:42
like
31:42
the broth of the testicles of a boar pig
31:44
beaten to a powder
31:46
and quite a lot of pigeons so one thing
31:49
that occurs frequently is
31:51
pigeon slippers a doctor would
31:54
frequently prescribe
31:55
you put a pigeon on each foot
31:58
and you just a dead pigeon oh and you
32:01
just cut it open
32:02
pop it on your feet walk around and what
32:05
is that supposed to help
32:06
uh i can't remember what it was actually
32:08
helping i mean
32:11
it doesn't help the pigeon very much but
32:13
and some
32:14
like they vary the prescription there's
32:15
one prescription which says a pigeon on
32:17
each foot
32:18
one says a pigeon on the neck and to
32:20
each foot
32:21
um another one just says half a pigeon
32:23
to each foot
32:25
it's not like when you split a
32:26
paracetamol in half it's like the
32:27
headache's not that bad
32:29
i'll just do the half pigeon today yeah
32:33
they did use two i don't even know why
32:36
i'm saying this but
32:37
let's say because i think this is what
32:38
it might be is they used to use
32:41
i think the anus of a pigeon to suck
32:43
stuff
32:44
out of buboes for the plague because it
32:46
has quite good suction
32:49
yes i thought it was snake bites as well
32:52
because it was i think okay plenty
32:54
recommended take a pigeon
32:55
shove it anus on your bite and it will
32:58
um
32:58
it will suck it out turns out it doesn't
33:00
and then you just die looking like an
33:01
idiot who held a pig
33:03
[Laughter]
33:06
but it wasn't it was for everything the
33:07
pigeon thing it wasn't just for playing
33:09
it was everything samuel peeps did it
33:10
one point always wife did i think
33:12
but what i know is it was a last resort
33:14
so if someone brought in the pigeon
33:17
you knew that that you were on your way
33:19
out i
33:20
i was reading a sauce which is like a
33:22
daughter was at her father's bedside
33:24
and he was really sick and he saw the
33:25
nurse bring in the pigeon
33:27
and he went i see i'm off am i
33:31
the thing that has never worked
33:34
thank you
33:38
okay it is time for our final fact of
33:41
the show and that is
33:42
james okay my fact this week is that if
33:45
you put
33:46
a bunch of millipedes in a nightclub all
33:49
their genitals will glow in different
33:51
colors
33:58
by the way if you've not been to a
34:00
nightclub with james it is
34:01
[ __ ] awesome
34:04
if you go to the nightclub with the
34:06
millipede it's like put your left foot
34:07
in and your left foot in and your left
34:09
foot
34:09
are you there
34:12
what night club are you going to
34:16
the under eight
34:20
that was the last time i was in what if
34:23
you're happy if you know it
34:26
let's get some railroad your boat up
34:27
there dj
34:28
[Laughter]
34:32
will you give this back some respect
34:34
please
34:35
what's the what why sorry okay so
34:38
these are flat-backed millipedes in the
34:42
genus
34:43
pseudo-polydesmus specifically and they
34:45
all look
34:46
almost identical regardless of their
34:48
species because they're just like two
34:50
centimeter long little brown things
34:52
but scientists have found out
34:56
scientists have find out that if you
34:58
shine ultraviolet light on their
35:00
genitals
35:01
then it's like a disco cool
35:05
it's all these greens and blues and some
35:07
of them are shinier than others and
35:09
stuff like that
35:10
and this is like a really good way of
35:12
telling the different species because
35:13
before we would you would have to
35:14
probably kill one and get the dna to see
35:16
whether it was a different species wow
35:18
so if you're having a nightclub and you
35:20
think what is that sort of middle-aged
35:21
nerd in the corner doing with
35:23
what looks like a bag of insects
35:27
i'm going to stick with the mirror ball
35:28
i think to decorate my discos
35:30
rather than a rotating ceiling full of
35:32
millipede dicks
35:37
do we know why this happens is it so you
35:39
can tell species is it so they can tell
35:40
each other
35:41
we actually don't know why which is it's
35:44
uh
35:44
um yeah all we know is that it's still a
35:46
mystery
35:49
but millipedes are basically blind yeah
35:52
so they wouldn't be able to see they
35:54
wouldn't get to enjoy it
35:55
they won't get to enjoy it probably ever
35:58
they don't know how great they look
36:00
really sad yeah very sad is it is males
36:02
and females
36:03
um i think it is just males okay
36:07
there has been this
36:10
and now i think it's both and now i
36:13
think it's just females
36:15
that will edit so nicely
36:16
[Laughter]
36:18
there has been this incredible explosion
36:20
over the last 20 years of
36:21
people discovering that basically all
36:23
animals glow fluorescents it's so
36:26
bizarre and it's weird that they never
36:27
discovered it before
36:28
so for instance just this year or i
36:30
think maybe last year
36:32
um a scientist accidentally discovered
36:34
that flying squirrels you know north
36:35
american flying squirrels glow pink
36:37
under uv
36:38
light and that was just he was out in
36:40
the forest it was a guy called john
36:41
martin a forestry professor
36:43
and he was shining a uv light up to look
36:45
for lychen and fungi and
36:47
some frogs that glow under uv light and
36:50
he noticed that all the flying squirrels
36:52
were
36:52
glowing pink and again we don't know why
36:55
i think maybe it's to blend in with
36:57
stuff like light chin so that predators
36:58
can't see them
36:59
maybe it shows that you're healthy for a
37:01
mate but how have we not shown
37:03
uv lights well the thing is humans we
37:05
can't see uv light so this has just been
37:07
a complete mystery for us for so long
37:10
there is a way to be able to see uv
37:11
light if you have your cataracts removed
37:14
some people if you have cataract surgery
37:17
some people can see ultraviolet light
37:19
and monet had this for instance um so it
37:22
is possible that monet would have been
37:24
able to see these genitals of the
37:26
millipedes
37:28
i should add i should add it is very fun
37:30
to go to a nightclub with james but you
37:31
do have to go and get your cataracts
37:33
removed before you go
37:35
it's a bit less fun that bit yeah so
37:37
they think that
37:38
after he had the lens out of his eye he
37:40
painted slightly different paintings
37:41
yeah his paintings were a little bit
37:43
more towards the purple side of the
37:44
spectrum
37:45
for that reason very cool um some
37:47
scientists have started making animals
37:49
fluorescent as well which is very
37:51
exciting
37:51
so at imperial college in london they've
37:53
started deliberately making mosquitoes
37:55
with fluorescent testicles
37:58
and it's just males again and there's a
38:00
there's a
38:01
really good reason for this which is
38:03
that so they were genetically modified
38:05
so there's a glowing protein
38:06
which only expresses itself in their
38:08
testicles and
38:10
the reason this is useful is you can
38:11
identify males and females very early
38:14
so you can release sterile males into
38:16
the world at large
38:17
without accidentally releasing any
38:19
female mosquitoes
38:21
because female mosquitoes are the ones
38:22
who spread malaria that's why it's
38:24
important
38:26
but when you said there's a really good
38:27
reason for this it did just sound like
38:28
your professor had walked into the lab
38:32
why the hell are those mosquitoes balls
38:33
glowing
38:35
there's a very good reason for this
38:39
just on things glowing there's a deep
38:41
seaworm called tomopterus
38:43
and it's transparent which is very
38:45
useful because it means it's much harder
38:47
to see it if you're a predator
38:48
and it can also make part of its body
38:51
glow on command
38:52
and then release that part as a decoy
38:56
oh cool wow but then it's lost part of
39:00
its body
39:01
yeah they can only do it so many times
39:05
that's very true yeah once you're
39:07
getting down to like making your head
39:09
glow
39:10
you're in real real trouble yeah that is
39:13
really cool
39:14
though yeah um there's a chameleon um
39:16
which will
39:17
if you put it under uv lights will glow
39:19
in the dark and like a little blue glow
39:22
and it's actually the bones that are
39:23
glowing and you can see them
39:25
under the skin whoa this is amazing and
39:28
we don't again we don't know why it
39:30
happens but it's basically you know
39:31
like if you go to a halloween party as a
39:33
skeleton yeah
39:35
and all you can see is the glowing bones
39:37
yeah these chameleons are like that
39:39
or maybe so maybe if a predator comes
39:41
they go oh someone's already eaten that
39:42
one
39:43
[Laughter]
39:46
[Applause]
39:48
um we're gonna have to wrap up very
39:50
shortly um do you know how
39:52
animals that eat bananas tell if a
39:53
banana is ripe
39:56
best before dates yeah no the uh the
39:59
color i would say
40:00
yeah so it's if it's blue
40:04
if a banana looks blue to most animals
40:06
that eat like insects and stuff
40:07
then it is ripe so if you shine a uv
40:09
light on a banana then it glows blue if
40:11
it's ripened and that's if the
40:13
chlorophyll is degraded so when it's
40:14
green
40:15
and unripe that's all that chlorophyll
40:17
as the chlorophyll degrades
40:18
then it glows blue in the uv so should
40:21
you
40:21
shine a uv light at the supermarket on
40:23
bananas if you want to really know
40:25
whether they're ripe or not i think so
40:27
but do you have to turn the lights off
40:28
as well if you do that
40:31
right everybody right i'm picking my
40:32
bananas turn all the lights off please
40:37
you've got to have a good relationship
40:38
with the store manager
40:41
uh is it true that here in norway uh you
40:44
have
40:44
uh uv passports oh yeah
40:47
that's very cool i think they might be
40:49
the only passports you put uv light and
40:51
it has a northern lights
40:52
effect over it yeah did any of you not
40:55
know that and you can go home and see it
40:58
yeah it is cool they're not the only
40:59
ones actually canada has it too and a
41:01
few more but i think maybe the first
41:02
yeah let's go with that let's go with
41:04
that
41:08
uh so there was a scientist called sean
41:11
davis
41:12
and he wanted to put bacteria into a rat
41:16
and see how it passed through the body
41:18
but he didn't really know how to do that
41:19
because it's quite difficult to kind of
41:21
get the stool samples and work out how
41:23
many bacteria there are
41:24
so he genetically engineered the
41:25
bacteria to glow in the dark
41:27
which meant that these rats whenever
41:29
they had a poo it glowed in the dark
41:31
who doesn't want that what is not
41:35
useful unless you keep your poos
41:37
somewhere
41:38
and these oh where did i leave that poo
41:43
and it's very unhelpful if you're trying
41:44
to hide a poo
41:48
on a dark night and this feeds directly
41:51
into anna's experience
41:52
because
41:56
andy's there turn off the lights because
41:58

00:14
uh
00:18
[Applause]
00:28
uh
00:36
and once again we have gathered around
00:37
the microphones with our four
00:39
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:41
and in no particular order
00:42
here we go starting with you jaczynski
00:46
my fact this week is that there was a
00:49
disneyland
00:50
in england 569 years before there was
00:54
one in america
01:06
just a field overrun with mice
01:12
it was a field so you're half right this
01:15
is from
01:15
a book a new book called a new
01:18
dictionary of
01:18
english field names which is said to be
01:22
that sounds like a hell of a read
01:26
welcome to anna toshinski's book club
01:30
membership one um this no it sounds
01:34
great and the telegraph actually did a
01:35
review of it this obscure book and
01:37
basically it's this guy who's gone back
01:39
and traced 45 000 field names
01:42
from various things like old tithe
01:44
records
01:45
and things like that he's called paul
01:47
cavill
01:48
and he's warning that and he's single
01:52
ladies
01:58
now they're playing the field
02:07
i'm not having this because i'm a huge
02:08
fan of pools um
02:10
he's he's warned that these field names
02:12
could be dying out no one seems to be
02:13
naming their fields anymore can you
02:15
believe it
02:16
oh no call the avengers
02:22
and yet they used to so it was really
02:23
important thing i'm actually surprised
02:25
farmers don't still name their fields
02:26
because
02:27
the reason you do it is if you've got to
02:29
say like oh if you're like you know
02:30
where's the collie
02:32
oh i left him in you know that field
02:34
that's like three along and five up
02:36
it's much easier to say oh i left them
02:38
in disneyland and
02:40
so this one was called disneyland
02:41
because it was this is in 1386 he found
02:44
the record as in the record was in 1386.
02:46
he hasn't been writing the book for that
02:48
long and
02:50
it was the disney family and they were
02:52
called that because they were
02:53
originally from a place called disney in
02:55
france and so that was why it was called
02:57
that i guess they had one field
02:59
but yeah they all used to be named well
03:01
there is there are still quite a lot of
03:02
fields which do have names so there is a
03:04
uk
03:04
field named database with over 200 000
03:07
fields
03:08
um and do you know what the most popular
03:10
name is what
03:12
big field
03:14
[Laughter]
03:17
yeah i saw people online uh so on
03:19
twitter they were sort of
03:20
it was asked does anyone know of field
03:22
names that might not be logged or just
03:24
is there one near you and a lot of
03:26
people responded my favorite one was
03:27
from a guy called tim
03:28
who said we have a first humpi and a
03:31
second humpy
03:32
so named as they're both humpy and one
03:34
is in front of the other
03:38
there was there was sodom sodom field
03:40
and gamora close
03:41
those field names that's quite creative
03:43
so they did seem to be quite creative
03:45
sometimes they
03:46
had um well they had ketchup piece in
03:48
northamptonshire
03:50
and that actually was a mushroom field
03:52
because ketchup the original ketchup was
03:53
made of mushrooms
03:55
so the first ever ketchup was made in
03:56
1727 out of mushrooms
03:58
if that's ketchup police there was
04:00
apparently there was a field called
04:02
please your honor and this was in essex
04:05
and it's thought apparently
04:07
to be the place where the lord of the
04:08
manor arranged to meet local girls
04:12
and i you don't want to think too much
04:14
about
04:15
the connection there um and actually for
04:17
the locals it was useful to know
04:19
these names right because if you had a a
04:22
field with the word dicor cich in it
04:24
um that meant that you knew that there
04:26
was water in it so you knew it was wet
04:28
and buggy
04:29
and if you if it was called yes your
04:31
honor or whatever you need to
04:33
need to leave it alone on friday nights
04:36
remember you knew something about these
04:37
fields before you went there
04:39
yeah yeah like if they're a weird shape
04:42
um
04:42
there was you got things like footed
04:44
stocking and ladies gown tail
04:47
if they were shaped like what those
04:48
things okay
04:50
could you get in trouble if you sold
04:52
your field with a misleading name
04:53
if i had a tiny field and i called it
04:55
big field
04:57
could i be sold for miss selling no
04:59
because i think only the biggest idiot
05:01
purchaser is going to buy a field off
05:03
you without coming and checking it out
05:05
not even asking for the measurements
05:08
mate it's called big field i'm not
05:09
telling you anymore
05:11
i'm in what was the book called anna uh
05:13
the book is called a new dictionary of
05:14
english field names
05:15
because there is a that's the new one
05:17
because there is a book called english
05:18
field names a dictionary which is a
05:20
previous book of english field names
05:22
and that is by a man called john field
05:27
no way
05:31
and it's not just the list of names in
05:32
his own family
05:39
that is amazing um we need to move on to
05:41
our next factory oh my goodness
05:43
then we should do some disneyland stuff
05:45
i guess or some disney stuff um
05:48
so between 1993 and 2010 miramax was
05:52
owned by disney
05:53
which means technically these are
05:55
current these are disney films
05:57
pulp fiction bridget jones's diary
06:00
scream gangs of new york and mansfield
06:03
park
06:05
um disneyland actually has a special
06:07
kind of invisible green
06:10
the resigners i don't think you can be
06:12
invisible and green can you
06:14
um or can you well no no not really but
06:18
it's
06:18
it's it was designed to conceal the less
06:21
glam bits because obviously the park
06:22
needs to have
06:23
you know unsexy stuff like um like bins
06:25
and fences and things and it's not
06:27
it's not part of the cool disney fantasy
06:29
is it so so
06:30
the designers came up with a particular
06:32
kind of green which
06:34
you don't really notice and they call it
06:36
no-see-um green
06:38
because you can't really see it although
06:39
i don't know what happens if you're
06:40
looking for a bin in disneyland it must
06:41
be quite
06:43
irritating um
06:46
so there's a thing about uh fields which
06:48
is that they have all
06:50
not all there's a thing about fields
06:54
which is that a lot of them have changed
06:56
shape in the last 40 years
06:58
really so they've gone from like ladies
07:00
gown to london stocking or
07:02
exactly yeah well they've got they've
07:04
gone from rectangular to circular
07:06
really so if you look at the farms in
07:08
america from above
07:10
they are circular all the fields are
07:11
circular uh and crop circles
07:14
no no no
07:17
the aliens it's not the aliens they're
07:19
here no we know what it is
07:22
it's it's it's circular fields because
07:24
it's better for irrigation so it's more
07:26
effective way you can have a well
07:27
almost in the middle of the field you
07:28
know yeah you have one of these kind of
07:30
um squirting fountains that goes in a
07:32
circle right yeah so it only hits
07:34
yeah it's really efficient and we know
07:36
the guy who invented it but
07:37
it's creating a massive problem because
07:39
it's sucking up all america's water
07:42
because it's so good that it means that
07:43
farmers then plant more intensively and
07:45
they grow crops which require more water
07:48
because they've got this more efficient
07:49
system so there's a thing called the
07:51
ogallala
07:52
aquifer which is under the great plains
07:55
in america
07:56
uh it's a huge underwater pond basically
07:59
um which covers 174 000 square miles
08:04
wow one pond for a given value of pond
08:08
um and it's being it's being it's being
08:10
emptied really rapidly and it's going to
08:12
take hundreds of thousands of years of
08:13
rain to replace it so there's a problem
08:15
oh
08:16
so they shouldn't have been so good
08:17
basically because they are good farmers
08:19
the americans
08:20
so they're the world's number one
08:22
exporter of
08:23
food by value which is kind of
08:26
unsurprising they're a big country
08:27
do you guys know what number two is
08:30
these guys
08:32
is it is it belgium it's belgium
08:36
yeah denmark denmark it must be denmark
08:40
they're number three the pearl dutch
08:41
can't grow a thing though it's
08:42
embarrassing
08:43
i know it is it is the netherlands that
08:45
it would and this is kind of
08:47
unbelievable
08:50
how are you so good at farming so the
08:52
number
08:53
by amount the world number two exporter
08:55
of food by value and they have 270 times
08:59
smaller land mass than the us and like
09:02
apparently they've just been all these
09:02
incredible farming
09:03
innovations over the last sort of 20
09:06
years um so there are greenhouses that
09:08
are like up to 175 acres big
09:11
one greenhouse i think all the
09:12
greenhouses in the netherlands
09:14
take up the size of manhattan or a bit
09:16
bigger than manhattan
09:17
and yeah wow so here we were making fun
09:19
of that field book and yet everyone in
09:21
the audience is like give me a copy
09:25
it's a it's amazing the netherlands is
09:27
so good at farming there is now a black
09:29
market in cow poo
09:32
it's really more of a brown market isn't
09:34
it
09:36
um it's because there's loads of the
09:38
netherlands this country produces 76
09:40
billion kilos of manure every year
09:43
okay and who's buying it uh
09:46
well you're only legally allowed to
09:47
produce a certain amount because it um
09:49
it's
09:49
you know quite a pollutive stuff if not
09:51
if it's not treated right
09:52
but there is manure fraud where people
09:54
trade it secretly
09:55
or they spread it on their land at night
09:57
to avoid being spotted
09:59
wow yeah this is obviously a good
10:01
fertilizer but you're not allowed
10:02
enough too much of it oh really
10:04
interesting any poo smugglers in tonight
10:08
that does sound like a euphemism
10:15
she sounds like quite a cute name for
10:17
your baby or something do you call your
10:19
baby that i feel like you could
10:20
poo smuggler yeah to call your baby a
10:22
poo smuggler that's what they're doing
10:23
all the time isn't it
10:25
they're not smuggling who yeah and
10:27
they're in the bottom
10:29
that's why you smuggle things
10:35
how often at an airport do the people go
10:38
up and go
10:41
what's this then sir
10:47
[Applause]
10:49
it is time for fact number two and that
10:51
is my fact
10:52
my fact this week is that every year in
10:55
japan
10:56
there is an annual anti-valentine march
10:59
held by a group known as the
11:01
revolutionary alliance of unpopular men
11:05
wow are they recruiting
11:10
i don't think they'd let you in on this
11:13
yeah this is an annual thing that
11:15
happens in japan these men
11:16
are sick of uh what they say is romantic
11:19
capitalism
11:20
and of course they're single and they
11:23
they go on street marches to sort of say
11:25
this is too much and uh it's currently
11:27
being led by
11:28
a guy called takayuki akimoto um
11:31
and he he likes to have placards and he
11:33
likes to take to the streets they only
11:35
do it uh once a year but obviously they
11:37
like to have anything that has groups of
11:39
people together to be protested again so
11:41
christmas is a big thing as well so they
11:43
they uh protest an annual christmas uh
11:46
march
11:47
um but unfortunately in 2018 they
11:49
couldn't get the permit for the park
11:50
they wanted to do it in so they had to
11:52
do it
11:52
indoors in a room instead so no one
11:55
really saw that one
11:56
um and they had to clear all the video
11:58
games out of the way and then
12:00
i mean apparently there aren't many of
12:03
them are there
12:04
no it's a handful it's double figures
12:06
yes yeah
12:07
i hope it's double figures um yeah it's
12:10
quite controversial in japan isn't it
12:12
the whole valentine's day thing people
12:14
have really gone off it
12:15
and it's because this is something we've
12:16
briefly mentioned before but actually
12:18
the 14th of february in places like
12:20
japan korea and thailand is just a day
12:23
when women
12:24
are supposed to give presents to men and
12:26
then exactly a month later
12:27
men are supposed to give presents to
12:28
women but it apparently it's really an
12:31
obligation and so women are getting
12:32
really pissed off because they feel like
12:33
on the 14th of february
12:35
they have to give chocolates for
12:36
instance to all of their male colleagues
12:38
and so women are saying you know i'm
12:40
spending hundreds and hundreds of pounds
12:42
every year on
12:43
colleagues i don't know or like just
12:44
giving them chocolates and then on the
12:46
14th of march the men have to do it
12:48
three or two times more so they have to
12:50
spend even more it sounds like it's got
12:52
kind of out of control
12:54
yeah but i think you know it's not that
12:55
bad for especially for countries that
12:57
export
12:58
vast amounts of flowers
12:59
[Laughter]
13:03
but there's this whole vocabulary of the
13:05
chocolate so this is called giri choco
13:08
or
13:08
uh obligation chocolate basically
13:11
obligation chocolate
13:13
nothing says i love you like obligation
13:17
um and there's also honme which is
13:20
chocolate for your true love
13:21
uh and there there are now tomo choco
13:24
which is friend chocolates
13:26
and the best kind jiko choco which is
13:29
chocolate given to yourself as an act of
13:30
self love
13:34
that's quite nice and apparently when
13:36
you say self-love you just mean
13:38
i just mean no no funny business
13:43
that's what it says on the card when you
13:44
get your chocolates you send to yourself
13:46
all right no funny business man you know
13:48
in china they also have a group
13:50
that is like the alliance of unpopular
13:52
men in uh
13:53
in japan they they have single people
13:56
who try to
13:57
pull pranks on valentine day in order to
13:59
stop
14:00
people having a good night so there was
14:03
one case in 2004 where a group of single
14:05
people in shanghai
14:06
purchased every single odd-numbered seat
14:09
for a cinema
14:14
that is strong isn't it it's very good
14:17
it's really good
14:18
yeah so yeah it was a movie called uh
14:20
love story um beijing love story
14:22
and uh yeah uh in the 17th and 18th
14:25
centuries
14:26
um valentine's was slightly different uh
14:28
for some places in europe
14:30
you would choose your valentine by
14:31
drawing lots
14:33
in a village so basically it would be
14:35
valentine's day and everyone would write
14:37
down their names
14:38
and they put it in a big hat and then
14:40
you pick one out and that would be your
14:41
valentine
14:42
and some people said that then the
14:44
courtship was obliged to last until the
14:45
following valentine's day
14:47
whoa you don't you don't want to get old
14:51
john the pooh smuggler do you
14:58
no actually this is a bit like how
15:01
romans did it
15:03
so romans basically had invented the
15:05
origin of valentine's day which was
15:07
lupercalia
15:08
which was around that february time and
15:10
that sort of morphed into valentine's
15:12
day day by pope a few centuries later
15:14
but yeah what they did was first of all
15:15
the men sacrificed a
15:17
goat and a dog and then they got the
15:19
hides of the animals they sacrificed and
15:21
they chased after women whipping them
15:23
and then the and the women wanted it
15:25
they they
15:26
queued up to be whipped because they
15:27
believed it made them fertile
15:29
um but after all that happened that
15:32
everyone was naked
15:33
and then i believe you've
15:36
buried the lead on this story
15:40
i thought you'd assume it's ancient rome
15:43
and then
15:43
everyone picked names from a jar just
15:45
like that and the name that you picked
15:47
from a jar was the person you were
15:48
paired up with to do
15:49
sexy stuff with for the duration of the
15:51
festival and that was their valentine's
15:53
and it sounds like
15:54
a hell of a lot of fun there's another
15:57
old english
15:58
um technique for valentine's day which
16:00
was
16:01
your valentine would be the first person
16:03
you laid eyes on
16:05
on the day okay so this led to some
16:07
people hiding below the windows
16:09
of the person they wanted today and then
16:12
as soon as they woke up just going
16:14
surprise
16:18
and that's actually mentioned in hamlet
16:20
um yeah ophelia says tomorrow
16:22
is safe valentine's day all in the
16:23
morning be time
16:25
i i am made at your window to be your
16:27
valentine
16:28
wow so yeah that's so cool yeah
16:32
uh valentine cards okay yeah uh so
16:35
there's there was a tradition in the
16:36
19th century as well as sending nice
16:38
cars of sending horrible valentines
16:41
to people they were called vinegar
16:43
valentines and
16:45
um they were there were specific cards
16:46
for all kinds of things so
16:48
there were cards where you could say the
16:50
recipient was drunk or ugly or stuck up
16:53
all kinds of stuff um there were
16:55
specific cards for grocers
16:57
being rude about them saying you've
16:58
cheated me on my groceries
17:01
which doesn't feel strictly relevant to
17:02
valentine's day but it's just a good
17:04
opportunity
17:04
there was one with a picture of the man
17:06
in the moon saying this is the only man
17:08
who smiles on you
17:13
and they were sent without postage paid
17:15
so you had to pay to receive it
17:23
and they were more popular apparently by
17:25
the 1880s they were more popular and
17:27
better selling than actual valentine's
17:28
cards that said nice stuff
17:30
and they're so weird if you look them up
17:32
there's one that's a coiled snake
17:34
with the head of this gentleman wearing
17:36
a top hat and it just says beware the
17:37
snake in the grass
17:39
and there's another which has they have
17:41
these really good rhymes quite often so
17:43
there's one whose rhyme is
17:44
you're as vulgar a cat as i'd wish to
17:46
meet and what's more you're devoured by
17:48
pride and conceit
17:49
but i fancy before very long you'll find
17:51
out that everyone thinks you're an
17:52
ignorant lout
17:54
imagine that on valentine's day well at
17:57
least it's something
18:00
roses are red violets are blue tell the
18:03
police
18:03
all the drawn smuggles poo
18:10
very creepy
18:14
i feel like old child is now more
18:15
important to this podcast than i am
18:19
um here's a kind of fun thing that you
18:21
can do on valentine's day there's a
18:23
french inventor
18:24
who has invented to make part of the
18:26
experience of the day when you're in a
18:28
couple
18:28
um even better it's a flatulence pill so
18:31
it's designed
18:32
so that you have it the beginning of the
18:34
date and if you need to go
18:36
and have a fight you don't need to leave
18:38
the table as i do
18:42
it's usually about this time the podcast
18:44
that you do guys
18:46
guys i'll be back stupid move
18:50
um sorry so what what effect does it
18:53
have
18:53
it stops you from starting no no it
18:55
sense your fart
18:57
so it makes it so it comes out smelling
18:59
gingery or rose-like or violet
19:03
how much more disturbed would you be by
19:04
a date if there are smells of ginger
19:08
we need to move on to our next fact in a
19:10
second uh in 2015
19:12
um seattle aquarium had a valentine's
19:15
event
19:15
in fact they have this every year where
19:17
you can watch octopuses have sex
19:20
um but the one in 2015 they had to
19:23
cancel in fact
19:24
um due to cannibalism concerns
19:28
because they were worried that their
19:30
male octopus called kong was too big for
19:32
his partner
19:33
and that he was going to eat her
19:37
when that happens when one person's just
19:38
a bit bigger than the other and they
19:40
accidentally eat their partner
19:46
should we move on to our next fact it is
19:48
time for fact number three
19:49
and that is james okay my fact this week
19:53
is that during world war ii the guns
19:56
of the ship the hms queen elizabeth were
19:59
cleaned
20:00
by wrapping the priest in a large cloth
20:03
and pulling him through the barrels like
20:05
a human pipe cleaner
20:13
so cool it does not sound very true does
20:16
it
20:17
but this is true and this was um so i
20:20
read this first of all in
20:22
a book which is called a field guide but
20:24
it's not about field
20:26
it's called the field guide to the
20:28
english clergy um by fergus butler galey
20:31
and it's about a guy called lancelot
20:33
fleming and this guy was pretty amazing
20:36
he was a priest and he was a priest in
20:37
the
20:38
um in the services during the war um but
20:41
there's loads of amazing things about
20:42
him he met his first wife after a
20:45
massive drinking binge
20:46
where he picked up and put on a
20:48
motorbike helmet
20:50
and then saw her in the street and said
20:52
to her i'm a space bishop
20:58
and three years later she married him
21:03
people weren't even going into space at
21:04
this point weren't they no
21:06
he was ah he was a man ahead of his time
21:08
wow
21:09
but they did know that space existed yes
21:12
and i guess they assumed you'd need to
21:14
wear a helmet there i guess
21:16
um did he volunteer himself for the
21:19
cannon cleaning um but yes he did he was
21:22
a very slight
21:22
man uh and so it was only for the small
21:25
cannons
21:26
it was up yeah so i looked at wikipedia
21:28
to see what the cannons were on the hms
21:30
queen elizabeth
21:31
and they had 16 6-inch guns
21:34
two three-inch guns and four five
21:36
centimeter guns
21:38
and i don't think it was those ones it
21:40
could he could have cleaned them a bit
21:43
[Laughter]
21:51
[Applause]
21:57
not the leg
22:00
i thought you would just be an
22:01
incredibly anyway so
22:04
but they also had some 15-inch guns
22:08
which you could just about squeeze in if
22:09
you had really thin shoulders and
22:11
a 21 inch torpedo tube so i think it
22:14
might be one of those two
22:15
chaplains in the army just very quickly
22:17
the modern day chaplain
22:18
uh in the us army is um flame resistant
22:24
how cool is that okay what do you mean
22:27
by that so um
22:28
this is from mary roach's book grunt um
22:30
and she points out the man of cloth has
22:33
various different cloths that he can
22:34
wear when he's going into
22:36
say a tank or if he's just out where
22:38
there's combat
22:40
so if if he's if he's uh sort of just
22:43
traveling with a field
22:44
artillery um he'll have us will have his
22:47
claws which will be
22:48
moderately flame retardant um insect
22:51
repellent as well
22:53
and 25 kevlar if he's in a tank mission
22:57
he's like really fire resistant it's a
23:00
really strong fire resistant but
23:02
um that's too expensive for day-to-day
23:04
use so
23:05
and then when he's back at just the camp
23:06
he's just wearing normal clothes but
23:08
yeah he's got
23:09
three different outfits for not catching
23:11
on fire
23:12
yeah fetch the asbestos priest
23:17
and he also he doesn't carry any weapons
23:19
but he does have an assistant with him
23:21
at all times who has
23:22
a gun so that's the that's the
23:24
protection
23:25
and they do they have all these things
23:26
that they have like um they have um
23:28
portable confessionals should they need
23:30
to have a quick confessional out in the
23:31
field
23:32
um they have containers that are turned
23:34
into chapels and they have extended
23:36
shelf life
23:37
communion wafers it's very cool no one
23:40
likes a stale communion way for today
23:43
so i was trying to find out about more
23:45
priests and there was someone called
23:47
hugh barrett leonard who was a british
23:49
clergyman who had a title which was
23:51
extraordinary confessor
23:53
which i think is a proper title but he
23:55
really pushed it so once when a woman
23:57
asked to hear confession
23:58
outside the church he just held up a
24:00
tennis racket between them
24:06
that's amazing the telegraph ram is a
24:10
picture
24:10
and it said that although he mostly
24:12
heard confessions in his room he was
24:13
prepared to do so behind a hedge
24:18
so good we have such a tradition of
24:20
weird clergy in the uk don't we
24:22
yeah there was a guy called the reverend
24:24
edward drax free
24:26
and his congregation tried to get him
24:28
out of the priesthood because he was
24:30
repeatedly drunk and he was stealing
24:32
lead from the church roof
24:35
and to stop them from getting rid of him
24:37
he decided to lock himself in this study
24:39
with his favorite maid abrasive pistols
24:42
and a stack of french pornography
24:46
that's a real slam on the maid i think
24:50
they're offended there's another guy
24:52
from the 1800s called reverend robert
24:54
hawker
24:55
and he was both a priest and a mermaid
24:58
that was that was the thing he really
25:01
wanted to be so
25:02
he made a wig out of seaweed um and then
25:04
he was naked apart from
25:06
oil skin around his legs and he rode out
25:07
to a rock uh which was called
25:09
beaut harbour and he sat on it and he
25:11
just would sing
25:12
uh and then go home and you know go to
25:15
church
25:16
when wasn't didn't didn't his sort of
25:18
mermaid rain
25:19
end or my man reign end when he went out
25:22
and he did this as a prank for the
25:23
locals
25:24
and everyone was looking at him through
25:26
their eye glasses they had at the time
25:28
and then he overheard one of the like
25:30
bigger burlier farmers going right i'm
25:31
going to go and get my gum we got to
25:32
shut him down
25:33
and he ducked under water and never
25:35
tried the prank again
25:37
um some stuff on maybe cannons or guns
25:41
yeah that's what the facts about so um
25:43
the cannon kind of came into europe in
25:45
the 16th century um before that they
25:47
used trebuchets
25:48
which was where they flung stuff along
25:50
and a lot of people like them because of
25:52
their
25:52
fallacism um for obvious reasons
25:56
so um at the siege of mirandola
26:00
the pope at the time pope julius was um
26:03
quoted as saying
26:04
now we'll see whose bowls are bigger
26:06
mine or louise
26:09
uh and and they also thought because
26:11
they were so um
26:12
phallic in shape they thought that if
26:14
you could make them excited
26:16
it would stop them from working and so
26:18
at the siege
26:20
honestly what yeah at the siege of
26:24
czech yang in 1861 to 1862
26:27
typing rebels had prostitutes take off
26:29
their trousers and moon the forces
26:32
in the hope that it would cause the
26:33
cannon to misfire or burst
26:39
no honestly it's history anna
26:42
that feels like a flimsy excuse by the
26:44
typing rebels
26:46
um wow well some ship's guns have things
26:49
called
26:49
uh tampions which comes from exactly the
26:52
same route as tampons
26:53
okay and these are basically plugs for
26:55
the guns and it's to stop the guns
26:57
inside rusting when they're not being
26:58
used
26:59
and there used to be an old method of
27:01
doing it which is really cool to stop
27:02
rust
27:03
they would just put a cannonball inside
27:05
the barrel and then slosh a load of
27:06
olive oil inside
27:08
and so then when the ship's bumping up
27:10
and down the cannonball rolls the olive
27:12
oil up and down the barrel and it
27:13
doesn't rust oh cool
27:14
it's very clever yeah i read about a um
27:18
a it's not a cannon it's a it's a gun
27:21
type it's and but it wasn't shooting
27:22
bullets this is a thing that would shoot
27:24
into the air
27:25
a bunch of mines that would be attached
27:27
to parachutes so mines like you would
27:29
get in the ground
27:30
the idea is that this was to stop ships
27:31
from being attacked by planes
27:33
so the planes would come the parachutes
27:35
would latch onto the planes tangle up
27:38
swing the mines into the plane and
27:39
explode the plane so that was the idea
27:41
it's incredible idea
27:43
um the problem was is they kept
27:44
launching these into the sky
27:46
and the airplanes could see them and
27:48
they knew what was coming so they could
27:49
get out of the way
27:50
so it never got them and what actually
27:52
they didn't really count on is there's a
27:53
lot of wind
27:54
out there and very often the wind would
27:57
blow the mines on the parachutes right
27:59
back to the boat that launched them
28:01
yeah and they suffered more british
28:02
deaths from that than they did
28:04
yeah where was that uh it was in i
28:07
believe it was in the second
28:08
world war um i but we can edit that out
28:11
because the torpedoes so you could have
28:15
torpedoes and ships
28:17
and they've just invented a new torpedo
28:19
that can fire humans
28:22
so this is i believe even though i
28:24
haven't seen it it's in you only live
28:25
twice
28:26
james bond gets in a torpedo gun and
28:28
gets fired through it
28:30
i read on the internet that may be true
28:32
or maybe not true
28:33
but apparently there's this new thing
28:34
where you can get in a little kind of
28:36
torpedo shape thing with you and your
28:38
mate
28:38
and it will fire you off and it helps
28:40
you to get closer to the enemy
28:42
um it's over a range of 10
28:46
it says 10 nm which i don't think is
28:49
nanometers
28:52
oh nautical miles
29:02
how do you survive the landing oh well
29:04
you're in the water the whole way
29:05
underwater
29:06
torpedo but these some of the earliest
29:08
torpedoes were
29:12
but some of the earliest torpedoes were
29:14
underwater ones and there was
29:16
oh my god
29:19
it's catching some of the earliest
29:23
torpedoes will ride a
29:24
rideable oh what time it is yeah in fact
29:27
some of the very first ones had two man
29:29
crews where you would get on it
29:30
and motor yourself along and then you
29:32
would um
29:33
leave the torpedo there next to the
29:35
enemy ship and then hopefully sail
29:37
around and back
29:38
yeah i've got one last thing which is on
29:40
religion and boats
29:42
bringing the two things in together uh
29:44
this is from this year two students
29:45
from christchurch academy in
29:47
jacksonville which is in florida
29:50
they were swept out to sea and uh it was
29:52
two of them then they thought they were
29:54
gonna be lost for um if they were gonna
29:55
die out there and they spent their whole
29:56
time praying to god
29:58
to be saved um and they finally were
30:00
saved by a passing boat and that boat
30:02
was called
30:02
amen how cool is that
30:06
very nice
30:08
[Applause]
30:10
[Music]
30:12
okay it is time for our final fact of
30:14
the show and that
30:15
is andy my fact is that between 1910
30:18
and 1912 the washington post frequently
30:22
tried to interview the president's pet
30:24
cow
30:28
and was she just very coy didn't give
30:31
interviews she was very chatty
30:33
according to the reporters of the
30:35
washington post so this was a specific
30:38
cow um she was owned by president
30:40
william taft who was president of the
30:42
time
30:43
she was actually the last cow ever to
30:44
graze freely on the white house lawn
30:46
her name was pauline wayne which is a
30:49
weird name for account
30:51
but she they ran over 20 stories about
30:54
her in this
30:55
short two-year period um so one of them
30:58
the reporter from the post asked her if
31:00
she was milked without her consent
31:02
and it reported that to each query
31:06
modest pauline returned from her soft
31:08
brown eyes at glance for speaking
31:10
reproach and indignation
31:13
which is to say in bovine he did not
31:17
it's very hashtag me moo
31:18
[Laughter]
31:21
[Applause]
31:26
she was very famous she was a very
31:27
famous cow you could buy souvenir milk
31:29
from pauline wayne
31:30
she was and she used to go on tour
31:32
didn't she yeah she got in fact she got
31:34
lost
31:34
at one point right so she would go on
31:36
tour around the country and so her milk
31:38
could be sold at agricultural affairs
31:40
and stuff
31:41
and once she was accidentally put on a
31:42
standard cattle car
31:44
with the masses instead with the masses
31:46
of cows instead of her
31:47
usual like private luxury cow coach
31:51
and she was taken to the slaughter i
31:53
think she was just she was missing for
31:54
two days and there was panic
31:55
across the land and she was just saved
31:58
it was this was in 1911 i think someone
32:00
just spotted her in time and said that
32:01
looks like the president's cow
32:03
how do you tell the difference between
32:05
the president's cow and a
32:06
non-president's cow
32:07
oh she kept on singing the stars and
32:09
stripes
32:09
[Laughter]
32:12
when she first came to the white house
32:13
she was actually a present from
32:15
a wisconsin senator um to taft and when
32:18
she first arrived
32:19
she was pregnant and the president
32:21
offered the calf to a local farmer
32:22
because he couldn't look after them both
32:24
and the washington times said that
32:26
pauline has not been consulted
32:29
but as a government employee she is
32:31
subject to the executive mandate
32:35
it just feels like in 1910 11 and 12
32:38
there just wasn't
32:38
that much going on and they really well
32:41
we don't really hear much about taft do
32:43
we because so
32:44
who was it was what uh theodore
32:46
roosevelt before him and
32:48
woodrow wilson or someone after him who
32:50
were quite famous and he just doesn't
32:52
really come up much
32:53
he's mostly famous for being very fast
32:55
isn't he yeah
32:57
he's the fattest ever president right he
32:59
is although we're not quite sure about
33:00
trump
33:02
but trump is definitely in the top two i
33:04
think yeah yeah
33:05
yeah he's mostly known for a myth isn't
33:08
he which is
33:08
he was said to have been stuck in his
33:10
bathtub he went for a bath and he
33:12
couldn't get back out again but
33:14
it's a complete lie um but that's one
33:16
thing that a
33:17
lot of people will say oh william taft
33:19
the guy stuck in the bath yeah
33:21
he wasn't that famous like um theodore
33:23
roosevelt was really famous
33:24
and one of the ways that he got he
33:26
carried on being famous is he
33:28
named the teddy bear or it was named
33:29
after him um the teddy from teddy
33:32
roosevelt comes from the teddy bear
33:33
and when theodore roosevelt left office
33:36
toy manufacturers
33:37
still needed to sell toys and so they
33:39
came up with something called the billy
33:41
possum
33:42
which was named after taft
33:46
and we all have one of those today
33:47
[Laughter]
33:50
how awful for your pet cow to have been
33:52
more famous than you
33:53
as the president and she wasn't his
33:56
first cow was she he had another one
33:58
in who died in 1910 i think and she was
34:00
called moolie wooly
34:03
and she died uh because she so he loved
34:07
them so much she used to keep them
34:08
stable with the horses and so she shed
34:10
the horse's food and she died after
34:12
eating too many oats
34:14
because she'd never been told the oats
34:15
were for horses apparently and even if
34:18
they had told her she wouldn't
34:19
understand
34:21
it's a very human tragedy um
34:24
this is a i i think this is true that
34:26
the you know the name
34:27
fido for a dog yes sort of archetypal
34:30
dog name
34:31
this comes from abraham lincoln's dog
34:34
fido
34:35
which i did where did he get the name
34:36
from do you know i don't know where he
34:38
got it from i guess
34:39
i mean it looks like latin i trust yeah
34:42
but lincoln's dog fido was also
34:45
assassinated
34:47
a few months after president lincoln was
34:49
assassinated no way
34:50
way by a dog
34:54
yeah by a dog wow it was at a dog
34:56
theater
34:57
yeah it's like crafts
35:03
i'm afraid i don't know who assassinated
35:05
it but it was a deliberate
35:06
assassination yeah i i feel like using
35:09
the word assassination
35:10
to describe fido's death trivializes the
35:13
death of abraham lincoln
35:14
but no i think we need to elevate fido's
35:17
death
35:18
just on pet cows there's one quite
35:20
famous cow emily the cow
35:22
and this is a cow who's very well known
35:24
in the 90s so in 1995
35:27
she was off to the slaughter in
35:28
massachusetts and she escaped so the
35:31
workmen at the sorted house were having
35:33
lunch i believe and she leapt over a
35:35
gate and fled and the workers saw her
35:37
and chased after her
35:38
couldn't catch her and she wandered the
35:40
state for 40 days
35:42
and the police were sent out with
35:44
instructions to kill on site
35:46
and they couldn't catch her and she
35:48
foraged in people's backyards and stuff
35:50
and it's thought that people sort of
35:52
helped her by leaving out
35:53
bits of grass in their back leaving out
35:56
bits of grass maybe
35:58
some of their backyards already
35:59
contained grass where did they leave
36:01
where did they leave the grass on the
36:02
lawn
36:06
that cow has been wandering around going
36:08
out i can't find any grass anywhere
36:11
i can't see the grass for the grass so
36:14
sorry maybe it was made of invisible
36:16
green
36:19
[Applause]
36:20
so she spent 40 days and 40 nights
36:23
effectively wandering in the wilderness
36:24
yes she was the jesus of the cowboys
36:28
she was seen once running with a herd of
36:30
deer and
36:32
she miracle a holy miracle go on she
36:35
alluded capture
36:36
well and she ended up in an abbey so
36:38
there you go so there was an
36:41
are you sure she didn't end up in an
36:42
abattoir because that just sounds
36:44
more likely no there was a place called
36:47
peace abby which was an interfaith
36:49
movement who saw the story went to the
36:51
abattoir and bought her for a dollar
36:53
she's still on the run at this point
36:55
and then they went to try and find her
36:57
and they caught her and she lived with
36:58
them for a further eight years happily
37:00
and she ended up being a bridesmaid in
37:03
two weddings

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
this week coming to you live
00:21
from copenhagen
00:27
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:30
here with
00:31
anna chaginski andrew hunter murray and
00:33
james harkin and once again we have
00:36
gathered around the microphones with our
00:37
four favorite facts
00:38
from the last seven days and in a
00:40
particular order here
00:42
we go starting with my fact my fact this
00:45
week is that
00:46
when 11 time grand slam tennis champion
00:49
bjon borg
00:50
came out of retirement he returned using
00:53
a wooden racket
00:54
and was coached by a 79 year old karate
00:57
expert
00:58
from wales
01:01
three years later he retired once again
01:03
having failed to win a single match
01:07
amazing this is uh this fact was told to
01:11
me
01:11
by a friend of ours the singer of our
01:13
theme tune uh ash gardner of emperor yes
01:16
um he he'd found this out and it's
01:18
absolutely true
01:19
it was a huge comeback he for some
01:22
bizarre reason didn't get a tennis coach
01:24
he found this
01:25
79 year old karate expert called ron
01:28
thatcher
01:28
yeah he was called ron thatcher but he
01:30
preferred to be known as tia johnsay
01:33
and borg called him the professor and
01:37
this guy ron thatcher he would always be
01:39
accompanied by two ballerinas
01:44
always always he had a massive hearing
01:48
aid
01:49
and um he would always wear white and he
01:52
always
01:52
sat 15 feet away from bog while he was
01:55
playing watching him through binoculars
01:59
wow was he qualified in any way to be a
02:02
tennis coach
02:02
he was um he was like a life coach to a
02:05
lot of people in hollywood at the time
02:06
and borg of course
02:08
when he did retire he kind of went into
02:10
a bit of a playboy lifestyle didn't he
02:12
so he was 26 when he retired
02:13
and then he came back age 34 and people
02:16
said at the time that the the wooden
02:17
racket thing
02:18
they said it was like showing up in iraq
02:20
with a musket
02:21
it was just such a controversial
02:23
decision to make but he was determined
02:24
that the old boys were the best
02:25
because yeah that was the old way and
02:27
then they went to graphite rackets and
02:29
um so he thought let me bring back this
02:31
this i mean basically it looked like he
02:33
was doing a karate kid movie
02:35
was using the old ways he had a karate
02:37
expert yeah it is it is odd to watch
02:39
because you can watch that
02:40
uh one of the first matches that he
02:42
spectacularly lost when he came back
02:44
and it's just it's a lot slower it's
02:46
like watching a sort of a five-year-old
02:48
tap it back over the net
02:49
and then a professional tennis player
02:51
smash it in their face
02:53
yeah the first game was in the monte
02:55
carlo open wasn't it and he lost in
02:57
straight sets
02:58
to um a guy called orazi who then lost
03:00
in the next round to ivanissavich
03:02
who lost in the next round to steve who
03:05
lost in the next round to prippitch
03:07
who lost in the next round to becca who
03:09
then got to the final
03:10
in the next game and lost to sergey
03:12
brigari so you could definitely argue
03:15
that borg was by far the worst player
03:18
but he was one of the greats i mean it's
03:20
worth saying for anyone who follows
03:22
tennis
03:23
now or is just aware of famous tennis
03:25
names like uh djokovic and federer
03:27
bjorg was he was huge oh him and him and
03:30
mcenroe and their rivalry
03:32
is the great rivalry that is alongside
03:34
nadal and federer really and their
03:36
big game in 1981 the last big game that
03:39
bjorn borg already played
03:41
in the us open was seminal and that was
03:43
also the last time that two players
03:45
really use wooden rackets so the two of
03:46
them were two of the very last people on
03:48
tour to use the wooden rackets everyone
03:50
was doing the modern stuff by this time
03:52
but he was very upset by it wasn't he so
03:55
he
03:55
lost to mcenroe wimbledon in 81 and then
03:59
at the us open final two months later
04:01
and he was
04:01
so upset that he and this is like
04:04
unheard of he just fled the court
04:06
so the moment he'd lost that game he ran
04:07
off for god he disappeared and there was
04:09
panic and there was particularly panic
04:11
because
04:11
there have been death threats against
04:13
him called in to the
04:14
you know to the courts a few hours
04:16
earlier so all the staff were like
04:18
where the has he gone he needs to
04:21
be here to accept his silver trophy
04:23
and b is he dead follow that car
04:26
and the man in the white suit and the
04:27
ballerinas
04:31
their rivalry was actually um made into
04:34
a hollywood movie
04:35
uh not too long ago which was called
04:37
borg versus
04:38
mcenroe brilliantly weird name well
04:42
they renamed the movie for nordic
04:43
country so it went from
04:45
borg versus mcenroe to borg
04:48
oh wow that's brilliant
04:51
no interest in mcenroe so good
04:54
i was trying to find out about um why
04:56
ten of players have so many rackets you
04:58
know because you see them they turn up a
04:59
couple with this huge number of rackets
05:00
and you think they wouldn't need that
05:02
many and so i started giggling why do
05:04
tennis players have
05:05
and the the options that it fills in
05:07
automatically the first one is so many
05:08
rackets
05:09
second one is skinny arms okay yeah some
05:12
of them do
05:12
sure um big thighs is the third one why
05:15
do they have big thighs
05:16
um big calves is the next one fifth one
05:22
shoes
05:24
right and what's the answer i don't know
05:27
you didn't read it what kind of
05:29
researcher are you
05:32
that's amazing well i mean bull got a
05:34
good reason for taking loads of brackets
05:36
on tour and that's that he just snapped
05:37
the strings
05:38
constantly because he had a mad racket
05:40
stringing
05:41
thing so his rackets were strung at
05:42
enormous pressure at 80 pounds of
05:44
pressure which was very tight so that
05:45
just means they used to snap
05:46
constantly he once brought he once went
05:49
through 60 rackets during one french
05:51
open game what
05:52
yes it's disruptive to the game that
05:55
would put you off
05:56
but he wasn't the smasher was he he
05:57
didn't smash his own racket no no
05:59
oh no far too boring for that um no it's
06:02
just it's just because they're too
06:03
tightly tightly strung but he had this
06:06
coach that's called leonard
06:08
bergerlin which i'm sure i've
06:09
mispronounced apologies but leonard
06:11
bergeron was totally devoted to him so
06:13
he'd sleep in a room with all of borg's
06:15
racquets
06:16
so that he could be woken up whenever
06:17
one of them snapped because if
06:19
if one of them stamped you had to leap
06:21
out of bed and cut all the other strings
06:23
so that you didn't warp the frame
06:24
and so he said like many times on tour
06:26
he just spent his whole night you know
06:28
having waking up jumping out of bed
06:29
quickly cutting all the strings of a
06:31
racket
06:31
going back to bed it's amazing um some
06:34
more stuff
06:35
on bad tennis yeah yeah uh there was a
06:38
game in florida in 2002 in on
06:40
amelia island um it was between ann
06:42
cramer and jennifer hopkins
06:44
it was a first round match and there
06:46
were 29 double faults
06:49
wow in the game okay uh but then they
06:51
realized the reason was that the
06:52
groundsman had put the box in the wrong
06:54
place
06:58
and made it three feet shorter than it
07:00
was
07:03
that's incredible wow but surely tennis
07:06
players can adjust
07:07
to where a line is that's their thing
07:09
right yeah so i suppose they all started
07:11
at the start these faults
07:12
yeah right yeah yeah yeah and also you
07:14
wouldn't adjust because you think
07:16
it can't be possible that this tennis
07:17
court is randomly three how long what
07:20
three feet it can't be that they've made
07:22
this three feet
07:23
shorter i must have just overhit it i'll
07:25
try again yeah
07:26
yeah i've got a fact about tennis balls
07:28
oh yeah this is so
07:30
to get to wimbledon the ingredients that
07:33
go into a tennis ball cumulatively
07:34
travel
07:35
50 000 miles okay
07:38
wow that's so what is the what's the big
07:41
killer there it all go well
07:42
the clay comes from south carolina the
07:44
silica comes from greece
07:45
the zinc oxide comes from thailand all
07:47
these things make their way to the
07:49
philippines
07:50
the wall has to go from new zealand to
07:51
gloucestershire in england and then back
07:53
to the philippines well they just hit it
07:55
back over there
07:58
and then the other ingredients are
07:59
bought and the tins are shipped from
08:01
indonesia and then the whole thing has
08:02
to go over the world
08:03
50 000 miles uh i have some a couple of
08:05
other eccentric
08:06
tennis players you're interested in that
08:08
these guys are from the real tennis days
08:10
so it's before modern tennis
08:12
and there was a real great eccentric
08:14
frenchman called la bay it was his
08:15
nickname
08:16
and he was he always played completely
08:19
topless
08:20
but he had a red ribbon around his head
08:21
and a red ribbon around his belly
08:24
he once played with a shoehorn you know
08:26
that you used to take your shoes off
08:27
and won against someone else whoa
08:30
he once played with for a bet he played
08:32
with a man riding on his back
08:35
and he won did the man did the man also
08:38
have a racket
08:39
okay yeah yeah that would be better than
08:41
that great yeah
08:42
and he also once played with a donkey
08:44
fastened to him
08:46
and again the donkey didn't have a
08:47
racket there either wait
08:49
i mean so he was standing beside the
08:52
door he was tied to a donkey
08:54
and he still won he still won who was he
08:56
playing was he playing babies
08:59
i don't know who he was playing and
09:00
there was another guy um called charles
09:02
de la haye
09:03
who played in full military uniform with
09:06
his racket and his right hand
09:07
and a musket and fixed bayonet in his
09:09
left
09:11
see i would deliberately lose to him
09:13
yeah
09:14
and there was another guy called raymond
09:16
masson who would play anyone who
09:18
challenged him but promised to jump in
09:20
and out of a barrel between every shot
09:22
a barrel a barrel so he had a barrel
09:24
there he'd play a shot jump in the
09:26
barrel jump out and then play the next
09:27
shot
09:29
these are all from a book about those
09:31
strangest tennis matches in history by
09:32
peter sedan i should say
09:34
and what these were
09:37
mid to late 19th century wow that was
09:40
incredible there was a um
09:42
what the best tennis player in britain
09:44
at the turn of the 20th century one of
09:46
the best
09:47
again a real tennis player was a guy
09:49
called eustis miles
09:50
and so he won an olympic medal in 1908
09:54
he was also a squash champion he was
09:56
amazing and then he also became sort of
09:58
the leading health fad promoter and he
10:01
sort of popularized vegetarianism
10:03
so he set up the biggest vegetarian
10:05
restaurant in london
10:06
all the suffragettes used to go there
10:08
because they love vegetarianism he
10:10
overlapped there
10:12
and and yeah he so he had this
10:15
restaurant but what i like about this
10:16
restaurant is that he was convinced that
10:18
uric
10:18
acid was really bad for your health this
10:20
was a fad in 1908 or whatever
10:22
and so he the first you know these days
10:25
when you have v for vegetarian next to
10:27
an item
10:28
on a menu the first instance of that was
10:30
in his restaurant
10:31
and it was fu which meant free from euro
10:33
cases
10:35
nice just on tennis players and food
10:39
in 2012 uh there was an article that
10:42
came out that said that
10:43
djokovic had bought the entire world
10:46
supply of donkey cheese
10:48
oh yeah
10:51
donkey cheese all the donkey cheese i
10:54
mean i know
10:54
oh god how much donkey cheese is being
10:57
made
10:58
it's quite big in serbia he's serbian
11:00
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's quite big
11:01
donkey cheese in serbia i think it's
11:03
called pool or pool or something
11:04
yeah that's it and he he has a
11:06
restaurant chain and he wanted to have
11:09
this brilliant
11:10
this cheese is very expensive and it's
11:12
made from donkeys it takes 25 liters of
11:13
fresh donkey
11:14
sorry it's not made from donkeys
11:18
it takes 25 liters of fresh donkey milk
11:20
to make a single kilogram of this cheese
11:23
and so they produce a certain amount of
11:24
year and djokovic just went in bought it
11:26
all up and yeah we knew that donkeys and
11:28
tennis players had such an
11:30
intelligent history um i've got one last
11:33
thing which was
11:34
i was looking into bjorn borg's
11:36
retirement and then obviously his return
11:38
to the game but i thought okay what did
11:40
mcenroe do when he retired this big
11:42
rivalry where did he go
11:43
we all know what he does now he's a
11:44
commentator and he plays on the on the
11:46
scene
11:47
for the older generations but when he
11:49
retired
11:50
his plan was to become a musician he
11:52
thought he was going to be a massive
11:53
musician
11:54
he spent years playing with a band and
11:56
he pulled out of finishing his first
11:58
album so there was an album that was
12:00
going to be recorded and released
12:01
and there's not been many reviews i
12:03
could find other than a bartender
12:05
of a bar that he played in who said he
12:07
couldn't sing to save his life
12:08
and one person who uh has heard the song
12:11
was
12:11
uh liam gallagher of oasis oh yeah
12:15
oasis were playing in america and after
12:17
the show a very drunk
12:18
and i think stone john mcenroe came up
12:21
to them and said do you want to smoke
12:22
some spliffs let's go back to
12:24
where he was so they said yeah john
12:26
mcenroe amazing
12:27
not in that voice they would never talk
12:29
like holy moly john macaron
12:32
yes please yeah so they went back to the
12:35
uh
12:35
to where he was and apparently so liam
12:38
gallagher sings the song that he
12:39
that he played to them in a totally
12:41
stoned state and i don't know if it was
12:43
air guitar a real guitar but the way
12:44
liam does it is
12:46
you cannot be serious
12:49
you cannot be serious was it in or was
12:52
it out that was his song
12:56
[Applause]
12:58
and sorry you don't know when you
13:00
listened to this you couldn't tell if it
13:02
was air guitar or real guitar
13:06
because i'm no musician but i feel like
13:08
even i can distinguish between those two
13:10
instruments
13:12
look we need to move on to our next fact
13:20
it is time for fact number two and that
13:23
is andy
13:24
my fact is that shrews cope with winter
13:27
by shrinking their own brains
13:30
so i don't think anyone believes you
13:33
yeah
13:34
they do shrews common truths we're
13:36
talking about that's the species
13:37
all right that's no way to talk about
13:39
them when you say cope is it is it a
13:42
sort of boredom thing or is it a
13:43
survival boredom thing sounds like how
13:46
interesting is life when you're a shrew
13:48
you know they're not coping with the
13:49
boredom of winter they're coping with
13:51
the cold of winter
13:52
i just cope is a you know i cope with
13:54
you telling me things
13:56
wow and it does shrink our brains
14:04
why do they do this why do they do it
14:06
well uh because it's cold as i think i
14:08
may have mentioned
14:10
so they this is a thing called the
14:13
daniel phenomenon it was discovered by a
14:15
polish scientist called august daniel in
14:17
the 1940s
14:18
um they they have you know they've run
14:21
very very hot shrews their heart goes at
14:22
1500 beats per minute
14:24
so they uh they are incredibly fast
14:27
lived animals and in winter they need a
14:29
lot of
14:30
food all the time but in winter it just
14:32
helps them if they reduce their own body
14:34
size yeah so
14:35
like sorry like shrews most animals
14:37
would kind of bulk up wouldn't they
14:38
before winter
14:39
and then kind of sleep but they can't do
14:41
it because their metabolism is so high
14:43
if they tried to eat loads of stuff they
14:44
would just burn it all off yeah so they
14:46
shrink the
14:47
on average they shrink by 17 percent uh
14:50
and they're they're about also they're
14:52
quite a lot brain they're 10
14:54
brain by mass which is most more than
14:56
almost any other mammal and so their
14:58
bones and their heart shrink by about 20
15:00
and it makes them stupider as well so
15:02
scientists is genuinely true
15:04
scientists have done experiments on them
15:07
they they always do their exams in the
15:09
summer like us don't
15:14
yeah they they used trues in spring
15:17
caught in the spring of the summer and
15:18
they put them in a box with some food
15:19
and they just went to the food then they
15:21
tried it on winter shrews with small
15:23
brains and they just
15:23
moved around aimlessly not moving
15:25
towards the food no but it's because in
15:27
winter they don't travel very far so
15:28
they don't actually need
15:30
spatial awareness in the winter so it
15:32
saves its safe time
15:33
that is amazing that's incredible yeah
15:36
they they are
15:37
they are very small shrews so is the
15:40
smallest mammal
15:41
the etruscan shrew and it's tiny it's
15:43
1.8 grams the weight of a playing card
15:47
and it's like it's like a tiny little
15:48
well they're not rodents actually i
15:50
don't think are they but it's a tiny
15:51
little mammal
15:52
um but and the etruscan true actually
15:55
its prey
15:55
is cricket so its main pros crickets and
15:58
qrikets defend themselves in this really
16:00
cool way so they do like a karate kick
16:02
so i think by the description that i
16:05
read
16:05
they sort of crouched to their head
16:07
they're almost doing a head stand
16:09
so they scrunch up their body and then
16:10
they spring one of their back legs
16:12
outwards like a karate kick
16:13
to kick the shrew in the face and so as
16:16
soon as the shrew
16:17
interrupts the cricket it immediately
16:18
recoils its face because otherwise it
16:20
gets kicked
16:21
wow well the the they've actually been
16:24
taught that karate move by a 79 year old
16:26
tennis instructor
16:28
from wales yeah my um
16:32
my favorite shrew is thor's hero shrew
16:36
um there was already a hero shrew but
16:38
they found another one and they call him
16:39
thor's hero shrew
16:40
and according to an article in nature it
16:43
can support the weight of a full-grown
16:45
man on its back
16:48
yeah wow it doesn't sound true does it
16:52
according to the article this is in 2013
16:54
it was in nature and it says it's the
16:56
equivalent of a human holding up a space
16:58
shuttle
17:00
oh i would love to see someone
17:03
a full-grown man just moving slowly
17:05
along the street
17:07
oh has he got those wheelie shoes no
17:09
he's got a shrew actually
17:11
i have a favorite true oh do you yeah um
17:14
we all do
17:15
uh the elephant shrew
17:18
oh yes i thought yeah yeah elephant
17:20
shrew uh so elephant shoes were named
17:22
elephant shrews uh because they have
17:24
these flexible noses which
17:25
sort of resemble an elephant looks a bit
17:27
like an elephant um
17:28
but then are they not they're not shrews
17:31
are they well it turns out they did
17:32
actual analysis on them discovered that
17:34
they're not shrews they're not true
17:36
shrews
17:37
um and actually genetically they're
17:40
closer
17:40
to an elephant than they are a shrew
17:44
by weird coincidence yeah
17:47
yeah so actually i don't have a favorite
17:49
shrew
17:51
you've got a favorite elephant yeah
17:56
anna favorite shrew favorite uh i like a
17:59
desert shrew
18:00
so a desert shrew has defecation
18:02
stations
18:04
that's just a fun name apart from
18:06
anything else i know i just like that
18:07
they know how to rhyme
18:09
um no they don't they haven't called
18:10
them that we have but um everyone poo's
18:12
in the same
18:13
place and it's away from where
18:15
everything else happens so it doesn't
18:16
sort of contaminate it and their feces
18:18
is corkscrew shaped
18:20
wow so they can open wine with their poo
18:27
would you like to taste the white no
18:32
i've got a favorite shrew i just got one
18:34
further through that we haven't talked
18:36
about yet
18:36
um which is the short tail true and they
18:40
have a really cool feeding mechanism so
18:41
they like uh insects they like to eat
18:44
insects and they eat them over the
18:44
winter
18:45
but they want to store them in their
18:47
nest for weeks on end because sometimes
18:48
they might run out
18:49
so um what they do is they have toxic
18:52
saliva
18:53
and they bite an insect which then falls
18:55
into a coma and gets paralyzed
18:57
and the shrew drags it back to its nest
18:59
and it just keeps it in there for weeks
19:00
and weeks
19:00
and every time one of its bits of food
19:02
starts moving and waking up
19:04
it wakes up and goes uh a shrew and then
19:07
the tree bites it again
19:08
and just knocks it out again that's
19:10
horrible wow that's your favorite shrew
19:15
that's absolutely terrifying life is
19:18
tough
19:20
that is a horror film you've been
19:21
abducted by it's true
19:23
and you're constantly pat so the moment
19:25
you think you're escaping you call it
19:27
shrews day
19:31
just on on winter survival tactics so a
19:34
lot of animals have kind of amazing ways
19:36
of surviving in the winter hedgehogs i
19:38
didn't know
19:39
they when they go into winter
19:40
hibernation they reduce their heartbeats
19:42
from 180 beats per minute
19:44
to very low so sometimes sort of an
19:46
average of maybe 10 to 20
19:48
to very low no an average of 10 to 20
19:50
but they can go down to two beats a
19:51
minute
19:52
whoa impressive right um
19:55
and also the red eared slider turtle
19:58
which is the most common turtle
20:00
pet really i think it doesn't hibernate
20:03
it does a thing called brew mating
20:04
which is like hibernating but
20:06
occasionally it wakes up to have a quick
20:08
drink and then goes to sleep again but
20:10
they survive
20:11
under so they'll survive in water they
20:13
go underwater and then it'll ice over
20:15
and they'll survive under the ice
20:16
without breathing at all so they cannot
20:18
breathe for weeks they just extract
20:20
oxygen from the water with their bottoms
20:22
with their cloakers
20:24
and just suck it out wow um so our
20:26
brains shrink human brains shrink
20:29
when you go past the age of 40 your
20:31
brain shrinks at the rate of five
20:32
percent per decade
20:35
i know i know you can tell the relative
20:38
age of everyone in this audience
20:42
came from if you saw me in the green
20:43
room earlier on there was some food in
20:45
the corner but i was just wandering
20:46
around
20:46
no idea where it was there's lots of
20:49
stuff about whether we could be shrunk
20:51
so does it there are cool
20:55
well i mean all of us like as an older
20:57
whole buddy
20:58
everybody's in our whole body shrunk
20:59
down yeah all of us whole body
21:01
right so there's a dutch historian
21:04
called arna hendrix and he has proposed
21:06
that humans shrink themselves down to
21:08
the size of chickens
21:10
because we would consume only two
21:12
percent
21:13
of the food and drink that we do now
21:15
yeah there was a movie about that wasn't
21:16
there last year uh downsizing
21:18
yes and um and it would really work
21:21
so this guy's
21:25
a bit of science it would work what how
21:28
do you do to our houses what would it do
21:30
to us
21:31
okay we don't reach anything
21:34
yeah fair point okay so that's a very
21:36
extreme you probably have to have one
21:39
normal sized human
21:40
next to you at all times right yeah like
21:42
bringing you things down from the top
21:43
shelf
21:44
we've got we've got that that's babies
21:47
wait does he say how we might do this
21:49
shrinking
21:50
um look i think it's more of a thought
21:52
experiment at the moment but
21:54
um other people so someone else has
21:56
proposed a similar thing even if let's
21:57
say we all make ourselves just 15
21:59
centimeters how are we going to do it
22:01
well it doesn't matter
22:02
just selective breeding i guess or
22:06
no hang on um and then what's the great
22:10
thing that happens we just consume much
22:11
less
22:11
look even if we make ourselves just 15
22:13
centimeters shorter we can all just
22:15
mutually do that okay and all this
22:18
degree we're just going to be shorter
22:19
that would be men would have 23 percent
22:21
less mass and women 25 percent less
22:23
that could offset a lot of climate
22:25
change we could save the planet
22:27
by just being slightly shorter by
22:29
chopping our heads off just drop our
22:31
heads
22:31
off
22:32
[Applause]
22:35
i feel like i've been duped now because
22:36
andy said yesterday oh i've looked into
22:38
a bit of
22:39
how we shrink ourselves stuff and so i
22:41
spent a lot of time looking at whether
22:43
honey i shrunk the kids was a feasible
22:45
prospect and i went on a website called
22:52
overthinkingit.com is really good
22:56
they debate at length whether this could
22:58
happen apparently the theory behind it
23:00
and honey i showing the kids if you
23:01
remember was that
23:02
uh the idea is you reduce the electron
23:05
cloud size
23:06
of a person which basically means you
23:08
reduce all the empty space
23:10
between the atoms so you know we're
23:12
mostly empty space
23:13
but then this i know this is going to
23:15
surprise you but this would not be
23:17
realistic
23:18
[Music]
23:19
because then you've taken out all the
23:20
empty space but you've got the same mass
23:23
so you're a tiny person smaller than an
23:24
ant with the same mass imagine an
23:27
ant as heavy as an adult human
23:30
and so you you definitely can't walk you
23:32
can't talk your vocal chords don't work
23:35
you're too small to absorb any of the
23:37
molecules you need to absorb
23:38
and actually so this is uh some you know
23:40
nerds online speculating and they said
23:43
they said you have very small electron
23:45
orbitals so i think the electrons are
23:47
very close to the center of the atom
23:49
so no bonds can properly form between
23:50
atoms so denser atoms
23:53
which you know the tiny people have will
23:55
be replaced or diffused so that the kids
23:57
would either evaporate
23:58
or just naturally grow back to normal
24:00
size
24:02
so that's the realistic ending of that
24:03
film
24:05
[Applause]
24:10
okay it is time for fact number three
24:12
and that is
24:13
james okay my fact this week is that
24:15
according to us
24:17
intellectual property law you are not
24:19
allowed to hold
24:20
any copyrights if you are the holy
24:22
spirit
24:27
it's true but okay
24:30
this doesn't affect anyone in this room
24:31
i don't suppose no
24:33
uh it's from the compendium of u.s
24:35
copyright office practices chapter 300
24:38
which is online and i've read
24:41
did you read all the pr preceding 299
24:44
chapters i did not
24:46
and it says that the uh u.s copyright
24:48
office will not register works produced
24:50
by
24:50
nature animals or plants or anything
24:53
created by divine or supernatural beings
24:56
and then it gives specific examples such
24:58
as a photograph taken by a monkey
25:01
a mural painted by an elephant
25:04
a piece of driftwood that has been
25:05
shaped and smoothed by the ocean
25:08
and an example this actually happened an
25:11
application for a song
25:12
naming the holy spirit as the author of
25:14
the work
25:16
so this is a genuine thing this someone
25:18
has tried to do this and they said we're
25:19
going to have to make a law against that
25:20
now
25:21
right but what's the problem it creates
25:24
if you say
25:24
i wrote this with the holy spirit i
25:26
suppose the problem is who
25:28
collects the royalties yeah yeah yeah
25:31
i don't see that i think they're just
25:32
saying stop saying that the holy spirit
25:34
wrote this song you obviously wrote it
25:37
mr mcenroe
25:44
i i do love it though when a
25:47
uh religious thing is treated as sort of
25:49
a mundane real thing
25:50
you know uh i i read in 2011 a poll
25:53
found that
25:54
52 of americans approve of god's job
25:57
performance
25:58
um wow yeah it was a poll though
26:01
did you say sorry 52 52 wow it's not
26:05
much higher than donald trump's approval
26:08
rating
26:12
another copyright religious thing in
26:13
2003 u.s legal review magazine
26:16
examined whether jesus uh had any chance
26:19
of holding copyright of his revelations
26:22
and it concluded that if jesus wished to
26:25
claim copyright protection for himself
26:27
for all his revelations
26:28
he would be legally entitled to
26:30
copyright protection so that's good
26:32
that is good that's going to be huge
26:34
news for
26:37
he'll be jesus relieved all right i'm
26:39
coming back
26:43
he just went up in a strop because
26:44
people get nicking his ideas
26:47
is this at all based on that story a
26:48
couple of years ago where a monkey took
26:50
a photograph and
26:51
it was determined that they couldn't
26:52
claim yeah that's the reference of one
26:54
of the examples yeah
26:55
got it yeah because so that was a
26:57
macaque wasn't it to a guy a
26:59
photographer called david slater left
27:00
his camera
27:01
in indonesia and some macaques came up
27:04
and found it really interesting and took
27:05
hundreds of photos none of them in focus
27:08
and um then he i think wikimedia
27:12
said that they could use them and refuse
27:14
to take them down he said but it belongs
27:15
to the monkey
27:16
and it doesn't so sorry uh
27:19
but did you know so we always talk about
27:21
how we kind of deal in facts so we often
27:23
say you can't copyright a fact
27:24
so obviously anyone can use this in any
27:27
way they like
27:28
but um actually that's based on the idea
27:31
that
27:32
something that you can copyright has to
27:34
be a creation
27:35
something that you've created with your
27:37
imagination that's original
27:39
but there is a tweak to that in
27:40
copyright law which says that you can
27:42
also copyright something that's been
27:44
achieved by
27:45
sweat of the brow and it's called the
27:47
sweat of the brow
27:48
doctrine and this is just so this is
27:51
basically about lists of facts
27:53
so if you've gone out into the world and
27:54
you've just collected lots of facts and
27:56
put them in a list
27:57
if you've sweated enough from your brow
27:59
basically
28:00
then you can kind of have a copyright as
28:02
a reward for the hard work you've gone
28:03
to wow
28:04
so there we go we should go back over
28:06
all of us how do they know how sweaty
28:08
you are
28:09
yeah we can feel each other's foreheads
28:11
after the show
28:13
determined um so this is a weird thing
28:16
so
28:17
in the usa uh it work goes into the
28:18
public domain once the author's been
28:20
dead for 70 years
28:21
um but you can fulfill of depictions of
28:24
those
28:24
things which have been copyrighted so
28:27
frankenstein the frankenstein's monster
28:30
is out of copyright because mary shelley
28:32
has been dead for a long time
28:33
but universal the movie company
28:37
they invented a look for him so if you
28:38
describe him as having green skin and a
28:41
flat head and bolt through his neck
28:43
you're breaching copyright on their idea
28:46
of what frankenstein is like
28:48
right okay yeah that's crazy the similar
28:51
thing
28:51
is the tarzan call that is a trademarked
28:54
call
28:55
i'm sorry i don't know that cool how
28:56
does it go yeah
28:59
[Applause]
29:03
i might remember it
29:04
[Applause]
29:11
i'm afraid you're in breach of copyright
29:14
wow you only get higher
29:15
though didn't you well fortunately i did
29:17
it in the voice of liam gallagher
29:18
[Laughter]
29:20
you only did half there and it's a
29:22
palindrome that call
29:24
yeah if you turn it around it's exactly
29:25
the same the other way around yeah
29:27
but there's there's an actual
29:28
description of what you are legally not
29:31
allowed to do if you were making that
29:32
call to make you legally in trouble
29:34
um and so they they write it down so
29:36
it's a 10
29:37
step call if you if you get it to that
29:40
then you're gonna get sued so
29:42
it's one a semi-long sound in the chest
29:44
register two
29:45
short sound up an interval of one octave
29:47
plus a fifth
29:48
from the preceding sound three a short
29:50
sound down a major third from the
29:52
preceding sound
29:53
for a short sound up from major third
29:55
from the preceding sound five
29:57
a long sound down on one octave plus a
29:59
major
30:00
third from the preceding sound six a
30:02
short sound up one octave from the
30:03
preceding sound seven a short sound
30:05
up major third from the preceding sound
30:07
it goes on for 10 steps
30:09
and i can't if you gave up at seven i
30:11
mean
30:13
wow i just
30:17
i just thought spoiler alert in case no
30:19
one's read the legal ramifications
30:23
so there's some new copyright laws about
30:25
to come in i think in the eu
30:27
it's either just coming here it's about
30:28
to come in uh it's gonna force
30:30
online companies to immediately take
30:32
anything down as soon as you say
30:34
that you've got a copyright against it
30:35
they don't have to check or anything as
30:37
soon as you say it they're going to have
30:38
to take it down
30:39
so a lot of people online are a bit
30:40
worried about it it went through by just
30:43
five votes but ten meps admitted later
30:47
that they've been confused and pressed
30:48
the wrong button
30:51
and it turns out and i didn't know this
30:53
if an mep presses the wrong button in a
30:55
vote
30:56
they're allowed to say afterwards and
30:58
have the record amended saying
30:59
i actually shouldn't have voted for that
31:01
but the law still has to stay as it was
31:03
yeah wow i have to say i used to work
31:05
for a politician who did that once on a
31:09
flagship policy of the party that i
31:11
worked for and he was the one deciding
31:13
vote and he didn't understand how the
31:14
system worked and he pressed the wrong
31:16
button
31:17
it was awesome and that
31:21
and that was brexit
31:22
[Laughter]
31:24
[Applause]
31:26
so mr t owns the copyright
31:30
mr and we're very honored tonight
31:33
i can't believe he flew all the way over
31:35
i know mr t
31:37
owns the copyright to i pity the fool
31:39
and he he makes money from that
31:41
catchphrase and sells it
31:42
but he does not own the copyright to the
31:44
name mr t
31:46
because that is owned by a company in
31:47
illinois which makes a foam t-shaped
31:50
scrubber
31:55
and one other thing about copyright that
31:57
i think is quite interesting is
31:58
this i think is a new law came in in
32:00
2014
32:01
which is that you can mash up someone
32:04
else's work to create something new
32:06
without permission now so you know when
32:08
you get mashups like cassette boy online
32:10
where um you know you take david
32:11
attenborough's voice and you put it over
32:13
some other hilarious
32:14
footage um you know what i'm talking
32:17
about right
32:17
um but you can you can reuse the
32:19
copyright copyrighted material as long
32:22
as it's for the purposes of parody
32:23
carrick ashore or pastiche
32:25
and so if you do that and then you're
32:27
taken to court then it's up to the judge
32:29
to decide if it's funny enough
32:33
so you've got to have a judge with a
32:34
sense of humor that's extraordinary
32:36
the craziest lawsuit i think i've ever
32:38
seen in terms of a trademark that
32:40
continually sues people
32:42
is you know the iheart new york t-shirt
32:44
i heart ny
32:46
that is owned by new york city and they
32:48
were constantly suing people for doing
32:50
parodies and knock-offs of it because
32:52
you would think that that's just an open
32:54
design that can be
32:55
used in 2005 they had i think over 3 000
32:58
lawsuits going
32:59
to sue people yeah and then there was a
33:02
coffee shop owner in new york who wrote
33:05
i tattooed on his fingers i coffee cup
33:08
and why and they sued him i mean it's
33:11
it's stuff like this this is how crazy
33:12
it gets and this is this has been
33:14
reported so i have to say this with a
33:16
caveat but the guy who actually designed
33:18
it
33:19
um who is a very famous designer in
33:21
america he designed the dc logo as well
33:24
he tried to do a commemorative version
33:25
of september the 11th when it happened
33:27
to reflect it
33:28
and they told him he couldn't or he
33:30
would be sued like that's how crazy
33:32
you cannot be serious is that john
33:34
mcenroe that's john mcenroe's
33:35
catchphrase
33:36
yeah that's going to cost us a lot of
33:38
money there
33:41
okay it is time for our final fact of
33:43
the show and that
33:45
is chezinski my fact this week is that
33:48
in the 18th century you could hire a
33:50
professional canary trainer to expand
33:53
your canary's singing repertoire
33:57
sometimes your canary is just not to
33:59
scratch you've got to get a private
34:00
tutor in
34:01
and this was the 18th century 18th
34:03
century and 19th century canaries were
34:05
an incredibly
34:06
popular common pet across europe and i
34:09
read this in a book called the animals
34:10
companion
34:11
which is a book that's just come out and
34:13
they were super fashionable
34:14
but they were fashionable because
34:15
they're amazing songs so if you've got a
34:17
canary that was a bit of a dud
34:18
in the singing department then you could
34:20
hire what was called a sifler
34:22
if you were french and then they'd teach
34:25
them to sing
34:26
so it's a human who would it's not
34:28
another canary yeah it's a human
34:29
yeah wouldn't that be nice
34:34
it was basically they had these really
34:36
little um
34:37
musical instruments didn't they and they
34:39
had they were called
34:40
bird flashlights yeah and they're really
34:42
really tiny little flutes
34:44
and what you would do is you don't give
34:47
the
34:48
canary the instrument yeah
34:51
do you no
34:54
so what happens is you you get your
34:56
canary it's just been born
34:58
you wait for a little while and as soon
34:59
as he starts to chirp then you
35:01
realize that that is a male because it's
35:03
only the males who chirp and then you
35:04
take him away from all of his mates
35:06
put him in a cage and cover it in a
35:09
canvas so he doesn't have any other
35:10
influence from anything else
35:12
and then you every day just go in and
35:14
play a little
35:16
and then he learns from that whereas he
35:18
would have learned from another canary
35:19
in the past
35:20
yeah right they're very good learners
35:23
the the story goes that
35:24
it was discovered sort of in the 17
35:26
early 1700s how brilliant they were when
35:29
juan canary started mimicking the sound
35:30
of very distant church bells playing in
35:33
the distance
35:34
and another canary apparently that
35:35
belonged to a tax collector
35:37
started incorporating a clink sound into
35:39
its songs
35:40
for the clink of money falling into his
35:43
sack of cash
35:44
amazing no they're good they come from
35:47
the canary islands
35:48
canaries so that's when where they were
35:50
first imported from by the spanish
35:52
who had the canary islands and that's
35:55
hence the name so the canary is so
35:56
confusing the canary islands are named
35:58
after canis dogs but then canaries the
36:00
birds are named after the islands
36:02
but the spanish would only ever export
36:05
the males so they could have a proper
36:06
monopoly on them so they started
36:07
exporting them in the early 15th century
36:10
but you could never breed them well you
36:12
couldn't for a long time yeah and also
36:13
it was only the males who could sing so
36:15
they were the only ones people wanted
36:16
but it's such a good scam because if you
36:18
only give males then no one else can get
36:19
it right
36:20
exactly but some rogue females got out
36:23
there and they people managed to breed
36:25
the germans i think actually it was the
36:26
germans who undercut the spanish trade
36:28
because
36:28
of their well it said like they were
36:30
just very organized about it they found
36:32
one female and they were like right
36:33
let's let's turn this into a good
36:34
business
36:35
and suddenly people the spanish sailors
36:38
weren't doing so well
36:40
there was apparent this i'm not sure
36:41
this is true but in 1622 there was word
36:43
that a spanish vessel had been stranded
36:45
on elba the italian island
36:47
with a cargo of male and female canaries
36:50
and they had escaped
36:51
and people sailed specifically from
36:53
tuscany to elba
36:55
just to catch some canaries because they
36:57
were worth their weight in gold
36:58
yeah they used to be a hangover cure in
37:01
ancient rome
37:02
did they yeah if you were really
37:04
hungover you would you would have a
37:05
deep fried canary and
37:09
that can't be yummy deep fried
37:12
yeah yeah okay it was the
37:16
foundations of scottish food
37:18
[Laughter]
37:20
but yeah a deep fried canary would be
37:22
what would happen it was thought that
37:23
they could
37:24
help lots of illnesses wasn't it like
37:27
so famously they were used in mines um
37:30
because they could tell when there was
37:31
gas there because they would kind of
37:32
faint before humans would
37:34
but also the miners would use it to
37:36
almost blot out
37:37
if you had like um an illness you would
37:40
kind of
37:40
rub a canary and the hope was that it
37:43
would kind of suck out the illness
37:45
oh i don't think it worked for canaries
37:49
it's worth a try i think those ones in
37:51
the mines are so interesting could you
37:52
know the last ones officially in british
37:54
mines were in 1986.
37:56
that's quite a recent tradition yeah and
37:59
there was a device created
38:01
in fact in 1896 which could revive them
38:05
and it was a special canary cage and on
38:07
top of it there's this big vial of
38:08
oxygen
38:09
and as soon as the canary collapses and
38:11
faints you say okay well it's not safe
38:13
so we better get out but also let's just
38:14
turn a little wheel
38:15
and it releases the oxygen into the
38:17
canary's cage and revives it
38:19
cool isn't that sweet so do they keep
38:21
the canary in the cage down there or you
38:22
have to save the canary on your way up
38:25
you have to you pull it back up with you
38:27
i guess you pull the canary back up and
38:28
then you put it in the cage right
38:30
yeah no the canary was always in a cage
38:32
when you went down there it was in a
38:33
little case
38:34
in a mine that's a recipe for disaster
38:37
of course i don't i don't know if sweet
38:40
is the right word for saying
38:42
they save their lives that's a nice
38:45
that's a
38:46
it's better than the alternative yeah
38:50
you know if the canary dies you can no
38:51
longer rub it on your
38:53
horrible body to cure your disease but
38:56
you can still eat it deep fried oh yeah
39:00
bad news the mine is dangerous good news
39:01
lunch
39:02
[Laughter]
39:04
they didn't have maybe the best lives
39:06
when they were being sold so
39:07
cause canary training in canary selling
39:10
was such big industry
39:11
then um it's they would literally uh
39:14
make these tiny little cages which would
39:16
just fit one canary
39:17
and it was proper industry there were
39:19
some places like in the hearts mountains
39:21
in germany
39:22
in the late 18th century where um you
39:24
know that the whole
39:25
industry was about breeding and selling
39:27
canaries and children were especially
39:29
good at making those cages because
39:30
they're very intricate and they've got
39:31
tiny little hands
39:33
um so they made these sweet little cages
39:35
and they had not a nice life but
39:37
if you were a canary bird trainer then
39:40
you were very worried about the spread
39:41
of disease amongst your canaries because
39:43
if they all die then
39:44
your industry is gone and so apparently
39:47
every few days
39:48
you'd book a room a few rooms in an inn
39:51
and you'd go in with all of your cages
39:53
and you'd release the canaries into the
39:55
few rooms while you scraped out the
39:57
cages for a day
39:58
and so if you're the innkeeper you're
39:59
just aware that three of your rooms have
40:01
just got a thousand canaries
40:04
i think you're aware when you try and
40:05
clean it the next day aren't you really
40:08
wow um the region of a bird's brain
40:10
which is responsible for song this is in
40:12
songbirds
40:13
uh it's four times bigger in males and
40:15
females
40:16
and also like a shrew it shrinks and
40:19
grows
40:20
with the year so when they're doing the
40:22
breeding season their brain will get
40:24
bigger so that it can do the singing and
40:26
then when they're not doing the breeding
40:27
season they'll get smaller that's
40:28
amazing
40:30
that's really cool so you've got to pick
40:31
the right time of year to go to a canary
40:33
gig
40:34
because they'll set this song he doesn't
40:37
remember the hits
40:40
just wandering around bumping into stuff
40:43
do you want to hear about the most
40:44
famous british budgie ever

40:51
shortly he was called sparky williams
40:54

40:57
obituaries i've read he spent six years
40:59
working as a character actor
41:01

41:04
a disc with his voice on 20 000 copies

00:19
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:23
this week coming to you live from
00:28
geneva name is dan schreiber i am
00:31
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
00:33
hunter murray and james harkin and once
00:35
again we have gathered around the
00:36
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:38
from the last seven days and in no
00:40
particular order here we go starting
00:43
with you anna my fact this week is that
00:46
jobs that have recently been added to
00:48
the u.s census include dough scaler
00:52
automotive window tinter and blimp pilot
00:57
these are the jobs of the modern world
00:59
apparently
01:00
what is it pilot well we'll come on to
01:03
that blimps are back in baby what is a
01:06
what is a dough scaler yeah it's a
01:08
really good question it's something to
01:09
do with baking
01:12
i see now i understand thank you
01:15
this is so the us has sentences every
01:18
every 10 years like a lot of places and
01:19
then every year they do the american
01:21
community survey where they still
01:23
interview lots of people and the way
01:25
they find out about the jobs people have
01:26
got is they just ask describe what you
01:28
do you know what do your roles entail
01:31
and then if enough people describe a
01:33
similar thing that doesn't yet fit into
01:35
a category they add that category and
01:37
enough people to describe the work that
01:38
goes into scaling dough
01:42
it's amazing to make dosuke they're a
01:44
new job there are a lot other there are
01:46
a lot of these jobs there's an entire
01:47
spreadsheet which i've read through well
01:49
i've read through the start of it
01:52
the first in the list is abalone
01:54
fisherman
01:56
it's all in alphabetical order you can
01:58
be an abrasive grinder
02:00
i know i am
02:03
if you have an abrasive grinder profile
02:07
there is alcoholic counsellor
02:10
which sounds like it's the counsellor
02:12
who's an alcoholic yeah oh yeah um oh
02:14
i'm your local councillor i just want to
02:16
like count on your vote
02:19
there is some people in america who
02:21
describe themselves as an animal killer
02:24
and also an animal eviscerator whoa
02:28
i know
02:29
and just
02:30
just let me do this
02:32
this is all things from the b um
02:34
categories okay so um baby nurse
02:38
now i'm not sure if that's a baby who's
02:40

03:20
you can do you say beef killer beef
03:21
kelly is that for people who are still
03:23
not sure if their cows dead and they
03:25
just
03:25
[Laughter]
03:28
really want to really make
03:31
i think so sure been in it for
03:33
you know some time presumably they're
03:35
all so they have the latest one up there
03:37
so i don't know if they're new i don't
03:38
know when they came in yeah it's a weird
03:40
thing because these um the census jobs
03:42
um it's sort of there's a lot of i guess
03:44
humor as well in it where people just
03:46
write a fake job down and those have
03:48
been collected over the years so these
03:50
these are obviously all real but um i
03:52
was reading it goes back to the 1881
03:54
census from the british
03:57
in britain sorry
03:58
um they have great ones that are on
04:00
there and this was tweeted by someone
04:01
called jordan erica webber she found
04:03
these so on the census in 1881 there was
04:06
artificial scone maker
04:08
um
04:09
body washer
04:11
body is in your bum bum
04:17
uh examiner of under clothing ferret
04:19
weaver fish bender grape dryer turnip
04:23
shepherd
04:24
and um
04:25
and 52 years in imbecile
04:29
i i read this list too that because some
04:31
people just put their sort of status in
04:34
life as opposed to um their job so one
04:36
person wrote fatuous pauper yeah
04:40
um another one wrote very feeble um
04:43
one person this intrigues me wrote
04:45
drowning
04:47
[Laughter]
04:50
i want to know about the circumstances
04:51
under which
04:52
then the answer to the next question was
04:56
i assume when i saw that it was for
04:58
rabid animals maybe drowning what uh you
05:01
know you have to drown an animal that's
05:02
gonna kill people we have to drown it
05:04
because i was like how are you gonna
05:06
kill a rabbit kitten what
05:08
why have you turned this back on me why
05:10
are you going to drown it
05:12
i'm sorry i'm fine i'll give my rabid
05:14
kitten to you next time i have one good
05:16
very much i'm actually only qualified as
05:17
a beef killer so uh
05:20
they're always doing weird stuff in the
05:21
olden days with animals like contorting
05:23
them into weird shapes like did you you
05:25
mentioned fishbench is that before they
05:27
invented balloons and they just had to
05:30
do it with the real thing children's
05:32
birthday parties were so traumatic
05:36
poodle but it was a cat before
05:40
they had they had a cow banger don't you
05:42
mention that cow banger and then the
05:43
fish bender which you mentioned
05:44
mentioned
05:45
but is a cow banger an abattoir person i
05:48
assume it must be and maybe there were
05:50
more fluid between what beef meant and
05:51
that you can kill it and banging
05:53
cow is
05:55
when the census happens in the usa there
05:58
are 600 000 people working on it which
06:01
means that the act of taking the census
06:03
alters the unemployment rate by 0.2
06:06
percent
06:07
so when they're going through is it just
06:08
like census taker census taker census
06:11
taker
06:13
you know there's a there's a weird thing
06:15
that happens uh with the american census
06:17
which is on the uh it's it's i think
06:19
it's done on april the 1st weirdly so
06:21
mustang must encourage a lot of people
06:23
to write bizarre things um except for
06:26
one place which is alaska where it
06:28
happens on the 25th of january and the
06:30
reason for that is because by the time
06:31
april the 5th comes around it's too cold
06:33
there so everyone's gone they've just
06:35
gone to warmer places and no one's there
06:37
to do the census
06:38
why do you think it's getting colder as
06:40
the year goes on sorry do you think it's
06:42
colder in april
06:44
in alaska than it is in january
06:48
[Applause]
06:52
the reason is
06:54
hang on we'll spend december and january
06:56
in alaska when it's lovely
06:58
but then we'll get out of there for
06:59
april 35 years at imbecile
07:02
[Laughter]
07:07
sorry i come from australia our seasons
07:09
are different there yeah yeah fair
07:11
enough obviously quite a good excuse
07:13
it's a good excuse i've been there for
07:15
16 years it's a terrible excuse
07:18
i think it's because it gets a bit
07:20
warmer there and when it gets warmer in
07:22
alaska then the people who live there go
07:25
and do things like fishing they're in
07:26
communities go fishing and hunting so
07:28
when you go around to take look on my
07:30
notes
07:31
when you go when they go around to take
07:32
the centers no one's home i think that's
07:34
partly to do with it right yeah i'm not
07:36
so sure
07:37
[Laughter]
07:39
people used to prank the census this was
07:41
really exciting in 1911 in the uk was
07:43
the first time that people got to
07:45
actually hand write their own responses
07:47
um so that's quite cool for a number of
07:48
reasons because it means you find very
07:49
famous people in there winston churchill
07:51
is in there just listing what he does
07:54
but there's also for example a man who
07:56
it was only the head of the household
07:58
who wrote the responses so one man
08:00
listed one of the occupants of his house
08:02
as peter tabby
08:04
whose occupation is mauser and his
08:06
nationality is persian
08:10
and the census representative has
08:11
crossed out this line you can see the
08:13
cross outline and written beneath it
08:14
this is a cat
08:18
now
08:21
and we're gonna have to move on in a
08:22
second guys oh can i just uh say some
08:25
things that other things that have been
08:26
written on censuses so the people who
08:28
are taking them write interesting stuff
08:29
in the 19th century in america oh in the
08:32
19th century in the uk this was the
08:34
sensor taker would go around and often
08:35
they'd ask the questions and then write
08:37
down the answers themselves and it was
08:38
about taking a sentence of everyone in
08:40
the household but sometimes you had a
08:42
homeless person who was camping out in a
08:44
barn or
08:45
things like that so for instance in one
08:47
senses someone was recorded on the
08:49
census but he just wrote next to him
08:51
drinking slept in shed uh
08:54
unclear whether he was a member of the
08:55
household another one was recorded as at
08:58
home but dead
08:59
[Laughter]
09:03
would you want someone to clarify if you
09:04
go oh is james in you want someone to
09:06
clarify i was like yes but he is dead
09:10
there was one really snooty one in
09:12
hampshire in the hampshire parish record
09:14
actually that someone found online and
09:16
it was
09:17
recording the existence of the baptized
09:19
bastard child of mary brown gotten of
09:22
john smith brackets so she saith close
09:25
brackets
09:26
[Music]
09:30
well because it was often vickers who
09:31
recorded it and they were very
09:32
judgmental so
09:34
the the very reverend dr peter
09:36
scrimshire wood got to go around doing
09:38
all of his parish's responses and so he
09:40
found an unmarried mother and he just
09:41
described her occupation as man trap
09:50
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:53
that is my fact my fact this week is
09:56
heavy metal musician tony iomi began
10:00
playing heavy metal guitar with two
10:02
metal fingers because he lost his real
10:04
ones while working at a metal factory
10:08
this is this is tony iomie from the band
10:11
black sabbath um i got this fact i just
10:14
have to say it's one of the best books
10:15
i've read in a long time it's called the
10:16
history of heavy metal by a friend of
10:18
ours andrew o'neil who's a comedian but
10:20
he's written a proper history of heavy
10:22
metal as he's just brilliant packed with
10:24
facts lots of funny jokes it's the
10:25
opening line is one of my favorite
10:26
opening lines to a book he says this is
10:29
the opening line there are two types of
10:30
people in the world people who like
10:32
heavy metal and dicks
10:35
so uh tony aiomi he was uh working in a
10:38
metal factory and he was asked to do a
10:40
job that he had never done before and he
10:41
was meant to quit that very day and he
10:44
in fact stayed at home and his mum made
10:45
him go in to do the job and he was
10:48
working uh and suddenly uh when
10:50
operating machine his the two tips of
10:52
his second and third finger um were
10:55
chopped off
10:56
the bone was still there he went to the
10:58
hospital and um they said we're gonna
10:59
have to sort the bones off and he was
11:01
very depressed and a friend of his
11:03
brought in a record of a guy called
11:05
django reinhardt very famous guitarist
11:07
who could only play with two fingers on
11:09
his guitar because the rest were
11:10
paralyzed and he thought okay i can do
11:12
this so he started experimenting with
11:15
ways that he could make tips for his
11:16
fingers so that he could start playing
11:18
again and the first iteration of that
11:20
was metal he used metal to make that
11:22
then he moved on to soldering a
11:25
cap from a soap bottle down attaching
11:28
some leather around it and using that
11:30
and it's what's extraordinary about this
11:32
is worth saying is that tony iaomi is
11:34
credited with inventing heavy metal
11:36
black sabbath is said to be the first
11:38
heavy metal album and it was because of
11:40
this situation that he couldn't play
11:42
with regular strings so he had to buy
11:44
banjo strings for his guitar he lowered
11:47
them down and by lowering down the notes
11:49
he started playing the first metal riffs
11:51
and that's why we have heavy metal
11:52
because he lost two fingers in a metal
11:54
factory that is unbelievable
11:56
[Music]
11:58
it's almost like he set it up
12:01
it's too perfect
12:03
yeah i think he did it just to get his
12:04
mum back before him to go to work
12:07
the only thing i know about tony iomi is
12:09
that he was pretty nuts i think like
12:11
black sabbath did behave in a
12:13
gratifyingly crazy way back in the day
12:15
like you think they did but he once
12:17
exploded richard branson's prize cop
12:21
which is quite yeah they went to stay at
12:23
richard branson's house black sabbath
12:25
and he decided to launch some fireworks
12:27
into his into brampton's lake where
12:29
there were his prized carp which do cost
12:32
so many thousands of pounds and he
12:34
exploded them all
12:36
oh
12:37
occupation carp detonator
12:39
[Laughter]
12:42
do you know a heavy metal has a birthday
12:44
oh stop it no it does i mean what is it
12:46
because black sabbath's first album was
12:49
seen as the very first heavy metal album
12:51
and it was released on friday the 13th
12:53
in february 1917. that's the birthday of
12:56
heavy metal really yeah again surely
12:58
deliberate so um metal probably has more
13:01
sub-genres than any other kind of music
13:04
i reckon um i there's a big list on
13:06
wikipedia they have national socialist
13:08
black metal on the far right
13:11
and red and anarchist black metal on the
13:13
far left
13:15
they have viking metal war metal unblack
13:18
metal sludge metal pirate metal space
13:20
metal grind core death core gore grind
13:23
death grind porno grind math core
13:27
math core math core no
13:29
math core math core
13:31
just magic
13:36
speaking of school subjects they have
13:38
latin metal
13:40
but unfortunately it's about latin
13:41
american music not not all in latin do
13:44
they have geography metal
13:45
[Laughter]
13:47
wow but i wonder if it's like the
13:48
people's front of judea and the judea's
13:50
people's front where do you think they
13:51
all hate each other
13:53
because they sound pissed off about
13:54
something
13:56
from the book the i read the suggestion
13:59
that yeah the split groups are they
14:01
don't think they're as you know hardcore
14:02
as each other yeah that's it like glam
14:04
metal motley crew and all that sort of
14:07
famously wearing lycra and stuff like
14:08
that oh glam yes sorry it's a gland
14:11
metal
14:13
that's another genre
14:15
well they had in the simpsons once uh
14:18
there was a simpsons episode where they
14:19
quoted a judas priest song and they
14:21
referred to it as death metal and they
14:23
got so many furious letters from metal
14:25
fans saying judas priest is not death
14:27
metal that in the next episode of the
14:29
simpsons the message that bart wrote up
14:31
on the board what you know he writes on
14:32
the blackboard the message was judas
14:34
priest is not death metal wow
14:37
[Music]
14:39
some people who are some things that do
14:41
like death metal is sharks
14:44
the typical let's face it
14:47
there was a team from the discovery
14:49
channel in 2015 who wanted to attract um
14:52
a large female great white called joan
14:54
of shark
14:56
doo
14:57
[Laughter]
15:00
and they um put this speaker in the
15:02
water and played a load of death metal
15:03
and it didn't attract joan but it
15:05
attracts a load of other sharks so it
15:07
does seem like they like the vibrations
15:09
of death metal in
15:10
particular very cool oh i have a wit i
15:13
have a fact about it's related and
15:15
you'll see why but it's about mozart
15:17
it's not about metal um but it's about i
15:19
was i was looking up musicians who've
15:20
overcome impairments basically okay so
15:22
mozart started going deaf at the age of
15:24
26
15:25
which is a huge problem obviously but um
15:28
it's
15:29
sorry beethoven uh
15:31
yes it is yeah great
15:36
shall we begin again
15:39
so
15:40
beethoven started going definite no stop
15:42
it no come on
15:44
how's that gonna sound weren't making
15:46
any sense beethoven started going deaf
15:47
at the age of 26. and it started with
15:50
tinnitus and there are lots of theories
15:51
as to why he had the tinnitus uh so the
15:54
theories as to why include that he may
15:55
have had lead poisoning or syphilis or
15:57
typhus or that it was due to his habit
16:00
of immersing his head in cold water to
16:02
keep himself awake
16:06
wait and that's so the relationship to
16:08
the previous fact is the sharks are also
16:11
immersed in cold water correct got it
16:15
but i couldn't tell you that at the
16:16
beginning because it was the end of this
16:18
phase spoiler yeah yeah i didn't want to
16:21
spoil that brilliant fact about mozart
16:22
or beyond or whoever it was
16:25
um we need to move on too oh i've got
16:27
some stuff about finger people who've
16:28
lost fingers okay yeah so um one group
16:31
of people who've lost a lot of fingers
16:32
is cave men
16:34
and women so
16:36
cave persons
16:38
so
16:39
do you mean
16:40
historical ones i do i don't mean people
16:42
in caves today i mean
16:44
how on earth do we know this
16:46
the main physical impression that we
16:48
have of people who live particularly in
16:49
caves uh is handprints that were left in
16:52
lots of caves uh in france and in a few
16:54
other countries so there's the gagas
16:55
cave in france which has 231 handprints
16:58
left by the people who live there
17:00
of those 114 are missing at least one
17:03
finger
17:04
and there are other caves where it's
17:05
also 50 50. that handprints that are
17:07
there are missing at least and we think
17:08
they were all working in metal factories
17:10
too yeah
17:12
it was the bronze age there was a lot of
17:13
it going on
17:15
lots of theories so one is that it was a
17:17
punishment or one is that it was a kind
17:18
of ritual thing uh some people think it
17:21
was frostbite and some people think they
17:22
were just folding down their fingers
17:25
they were doing the medal sign
17:29
well the ancient greeks used to cut off
17:31
dead people's fingers so this was they
17:33
were paranoid that people weren't
17:34
actually dead and they cremate them or
17:36
bury them when they were still alive and
17:38
so to check they cut off a finger the
17:40
reasoning being that if you weren't dead
17:42
then you'd say something well
17:44
we know he's at home but we're not sure
17:46
if he's dead or not
17:48
you know if you do the peace sign with
17:50
your two fingers if you do that uh and
17:53
you're photographed uh from within nine
17:55
feet on a smartphone your fingerprints
17:57
can be stolen reconstructed printed out
17:59
and used to access your stuff no yeah
18:02
wow
18:03
i know we should say that um
18:05
i don't know if they gave us permission
18:07
to say this but i'm sure they did when
18:08
we were at cern earlier we were talking
18:10
about the idea that um you get your
18:12
eyeballs scanned and checked to give you
18:14
entry to places i think it came up in
18:16
angels and demons in terms of brown did
18:17
it um and so apparently they tested it
18:20
out some scientists tested that out to
18:22
see if that does work and it turns out
18:23
it doesn't so if anyone was going to
18:25
murder somebody to get their eyeball to
18:28
let them into a building doesn't work no
18:29
point
18:30
yeah
18:31
don't use any of dan brown's works as
18:34
a way to live your life
18:37
okay it is time for fact number three
18:40
and that is james okay my fact this week
18:43
is that in 19th century romania there
18:46
were people who sold shadows and they
18:49
would sell your shadow without your
18:50
permission
18:53
and then you would die
18:55
less than one year later
18:57
according to superstition
18:59
um so in southeast europe there used to
19:02
have this tradition where you could use
19:03
your shadow as a sacrifice when making a
19:06
new building
19:07
okay so
19:08
basically you would stand there in the
19:10
sun and then they would put where your
19:12
shadow is and they would put the first
19:14
block there and then they would build
19:15
the rest of the house and supposedly it
19:17
would stop the house from falling down
19:19
but like i say unfortunately it would
19:20
mean that the person whose shadow it was
19:22
would die within a year probably
19:24
according to superstition
19:26
so people didn't really want to do that
19:28
and so what they would do is they would
19:30
sneakily entice people to stand over
19:32
next to a building site
19:36
and say oh just stand over there and
19:38
you're like you're not going to stop
19:39
building the house here are you no no no
19:41
no
19:42
and then they would do it and then they
19:44
would die within a year
19:46
according to superstition
19:48
and then people kind of got wise to that
19:50
and you had shadow traders who would
19:53
kind of stand next to you in the street
19:54
and they'd see your shadow and then
19:56
they'd sneakily measure it and then
19:58
they'd give the measurements to a
19:59
builder and that supposedly counted that
20:02
if they put the measurements in their
20:04
foundations and that would work as well
20:06
and so did these people go home and then
20:08
suddenly look down at the floor and say
20:10
oh my god i've got no shadow
20:14
no unfortunately the laws of physics
20:15
stayed the same
20:18
they always they mostly do apologies to
20:20
the cern guys who are in
20:21
[Laughter]
20:23
do you know what the precursor to this
20:25
was though this tradition uh this was
20:27
actually a more humane version of what
20:29
came before it apparently which was that
20:31
the idea was that you had to ward ghosts
20:33
and terrible spirits away from this new
20:35
house so what they used to do was either
20:37
crush someone under the foundation stone
20:39
of a house or put a living person in to
20:43
like in between the walls of the house
20:45
so that they would die there and their
20:46
spirit could haunt it and scare away
20:48
other spirits now i can see where the
20:50
dying within a year bit comes now yeah
20:52
not according to superstition at all
20:54
that's just you wouldn't you wouldn't
20:56
want to buy a new build house in 19th
20:57
century romania would you was that
20:59
someone at the door no that's just the
21:00
guy in the wall he's still dying
21:04
you know whenever whenever any man goes
21:06
to look at a new house all they do is
21:08
kind of knock on the walls don't they
21:10
and no one has any idea why they're
21:11
doing it it's a ritual as old as so
21:13
you're just finding the guy yeah
21:16
um so i was looking a bit at shadows oh
21:18
yeah and i was looking at shadow puppets
21:20
okay
21:21
so
21:22
most shadow puppet shapes were invented
21:24
by the same man
21:26
really this is amazing so he was called
21:27
feliciano truey and the art was called
21:30
chinese shadows or ombre sheen was and
21:34
he popularized it basically and he wrote
21:35
a book saying i can do everything i can
21:37
do the elephant the bird the cat
21:39
and there were a lot of people as well
21:40
there was the volunteer uh the fishermen
21:43
the preacher the jockey the rope dancer
21:45
he did an entire play which was just him
21:47
doing hand shadows wow yeah and this was
21:49
it was really really popular in the 19th
21:51
century and he had one other trick as
21:53
well his other art was shapography
21:57
uh can you guess what that is
21:59
writing it's hats you he would get a
22:02
single piece of felt okay a single
22:04
normal piece of felt he would fold it
22:06
into different shapes repeatedly to make
22:08
different kinds of hat
22:11
okay and this was really huge
22:14
this was the most exciting thing sorry
22:16
this was before the internet was it
22:20
there is actually there's footage of
22:21
very late like uh
22:23
19th century shipography happening
22:26
you know he takes it off or it's a later
22:29
practitioner takes it off he could do 35
22:31
differently shaped hats with a single
22:32
piece of felt and then when he puts on
22:34
everyone he does a little face to say
22:36
look this is the nun or this is the
22:38
fisherman or this is the
22:40
other person
22:43
but it was not again it's just the
22:44
precursor to the balloon contorter isn't
22:46
it yeah children's birthday parties have
22:48
always been the same yeah
22:50
shadow puppetry there's a reason they
22:52
called it chinese shadow puppetry uh and
22:54
that is because china did it for 2000
22:56
years before
22:57
this guy started um but
23:00
they didn't but they
23:02
but they used um actual they didn't use
23:04
their hands because they made wooden
23:07
puppets and cast that [ __ ] that is the
23:08
plagiarist
23:09
[Laughter]
23:13
oh here comes the lawyer
23:18
chinese in china there's evidence of it
23:20
happening since the second century bc
23:22
and the legend always went in china that
23:24
the reason it was invented was because
23:25
there was an emperor the emperor wudi
23:28
and he his favorite concubine died and
23:31
he was really devastated and so one of
23:33
his mystic assistants started shadow
23:36
puppetry in order to convince him that
23:38
his concubine had come back from the
23:39
dead so he just made the figure of his
23:41
concubine and cast her shadow on the
23:43
wall and was like look she's just over
23:44
there and she's in the room and
23:46
apparently that mate cheered him up no
23:48
end and it caught on
23:50
i don't know if he fully believed that
23:52
she'd come back no he could never quite
23:55
have a conversation with her again but
23:57
it caught on and then it was brought to
23:58
europe by genghis khan or by genghis
24:01
khan and the mongols sort of marauding
24:03
that wasn't their main aim though was it
24:07
spread the shadow puppetry
24:09
that's why they did it he's always
24:11
painted in a bad light he was just
24:13
trying to spread the arts and culture
24:16
his is the invading horde it will burn
24:18
your village
24:20
the invading mongol armies traveled with
24:22
a horde of shadow puppeteers to keep
24:24
them entertaining they did not they did
24:27
they had shallow puppeteers in their
24:28
troop wow even the mongols had an off
24:31
day
24:33
wait do you mean do you mean a day off
24:35
when they'd enjoy the shadow puppetry i
24:36
mean a day off not not a bad day do you
24:38
know um they've invented building
24:41
skyscrapers that don't have shadows
24:43
no wow this is really cool so um using
24:46
computers they've done this and you need
24:49
two of them
24:50
okay so you have these two um big
24:52
buildings and then the light comes on
24:53
and they kind of reflect off like a
24:55
mirror but then one reflects onto the
24:56
other and the other reflects onto that
24:58
one and basically the light just very
25:00
slowly goes to the floor and there's no
25:01
shadow at all it only works if they're
25:04
exactly on the greenwich meridian in
25:06
london
25:08
so you have to build them exactly there
25:10
in the center where there already is a
25:12
museum yeah
25:14
but in theory it works
25:18
does it have a use that's the question
25:20
the shadowless building
25:22
um
25:23
so the idea is like if you were to build
25:25
it you could put it anywhere and
25:26
slightly change the metrics and you
25:28
could build it in a different place you
25:29
know these won't only work in greenwich
25:31
but other ones could work anywhere and
25:33
let's say you want to build a massive
25:35
building near central park for instance
25:36
in new york but you don't want to have a
25:38
massive shadow over the park because
25:40
people want to sunbathe you can put
25:42
these things there and then they won't
25:43
be getting in people's way and the other
25:45
thing is um there's a lot of buildings
25:48
that are now being built that are
25:49
solar-powered and so if you've got a
25:51
solar-powered building or a house or a
25:53
farm and suddenly a big building is just
25:55
knocking out the sun you can't operate
25:57
so that there's new laws that are being
25:59
put in place to say that you can't have
26:01
a shadow come over you if you're wow
26:03
yeah because they do they have attacks
26:04
on shadows in italy in some places
26:06
already which i thought was absurd but
26:08
it's sounding more sensible but this is
26:10
small business owners in mainly in a
26:12
place called cornegliano in italy have
26:15
to pay local tax on the shadows that
26:17
their buildings cast and it's like 100
26:20
euros per annum and they didn't really
26:21
know they were paying until recently and
26:22
then they went what the [ __ ] i'm paying
26:23
for my shadow
26:25
and
26:26
the idea is that if your building casts
26:29
a shadow on someone else's land then you
26:31
are occupying that person's land
26:33
and so you have to pay attacks on that
26:35
so that's really interesting yeah you
26:37
can get a shadow boyfriend in japan
26:39
that's good
26:41
this is kind of like the chinese emperor
26:42
thing actually so it's a device that was
26:45
uh allegedly at the prototype stage last
26:47
year although i don't think it's made it
26:49
very much further than that but it
26:51
projects the shadow of a man onto your
26:52
curtains it's basically what um
26:55
it's basically what kevin does in home
26:57
alone
26:58
if you remember that he pretends he's
26:59
hosting a party yeah so is that a
27:02
boyfriend or a burglar yeah no it's it's
27:04
the burglar sees it and he sees oh well
27:07
there's a big strong man there so i
27:09
won't try and burgle that home so and
27:11
you can choose the activities there is a
27:12
range of activities you can get them to
27:14
do so weightlifting playing guitar
27:16
boxing just swinging a baseball bat
27:19
around
27:21
feels like overkill
27:23
and there are more realistic ones where
27:24
they're just sitting at a computer for
27:26
ages
27:28
but if he's on the other side of the
27:30
curtain which is right against the
27:32
window right no no so so you're looking
27:34
at the building from outside yeah and
27:36
your project and the as the homeowner
27:38
you project the shadow onto the closed
27:39
blinds or the closed curtain yeah so
27:41
someone looking from the outside thinks
27:43
they see a bodybuilder yeah yeah what's
27:45
your what's your um what's your beef
27:47
well who who hangs out in front of a
27:49
curtain by their window in a rubber band
27:52
exactly so you'd probably think the
27:53
house was being burgled and report it oh
27:55
wait lots of people hang out in front of
27:57
their windows burglars don't break in
27:58
and just start doing some weight
28:01
not the weightlifting one but it would
28:03
be great if you could get a shadow thing
28:06
to project the image of someone robbing
28:08
your home
28:09
because then the burglar will see it and
28:10
think oh someone's already got there yes
28:16
we need to move on to our final fact of
28:18
the show and that is andy my fact is
28:21
that some aphids fix their homes by
28:23
exploding themselves and plastering
28:25
their own bodies over the holes in the
28:27
walls
28:29
um so this is a species called
28:31
nippanophis manzani and um
28:34
there's a this is a scientific study by
28:36
someone called takema fukatsu and they
28:39
they live in uh very big lumps on trees
28:41
these aphids called ghouls and sometimes
28:44
these are invaded by caterpillars and
28:47
these young aphids are called nymphs
28:49
technically they're dispatched to
28:51
assassinate it to stab it to death and
28:54
as those guys get fighting
28:56
other little aphid soldiers rush there
28:58
and their job is to explode um
29:01
they're just full of fluid and they get
29:03
there and then there are these two holes
29:04
near their bottom and they just explode
29:06
these globules of goo all over the place
29:09
and some of them get stuck in the glue
29:12
as it hardens around them so they're
29:13
trying to mend the hole in the wall
29:14
fix the breech and others release so
29:16
much fluid they shrink to a third of
29:18
their original size
29:20
and then they're just these little
29:21
shrunken balloon aphids who can't do
29:23
anything and they die
29:25
really is that's a sad ending to that
29:27
story actually
29:28
it's a sort of heroic sacrifice i guess
29:30
yeah yeah look at it like that it's
29:32
really amazing though isn't it and they
29:33
think that the way it might have evolved
29:36
is that originally these fluids would be
29:38
helped if you just they just had like a
29:40
cut on their elbow or something like
29:41
that it was almost like a scabbing thing
29:44
like a human would but then it's kind of
29:46
got more and more and more and more so
29:48
that now it's learned to scab over a
29:50
plant rather than just the aphid itself
29:52
which is amazing isn't it some of them
29:54
seem to go outside the home and um so
29:58
some of them do the exploding and then
29:59
some of them just secrete the gluey
30:01
stuff and paste it on but a lot of them
30:04
do it from outside so then they pace
30:06
themselves outside their own home that's
30:08
tragic and then they can never get back
30:10
in can't get back in they're buggered
30:11
yeah wow that's the real idiot kind of
30:14
construction worker isn't it
30:17
what have i done
30:19
they also do this exploding against
30:21
predators
30:22
some of them so cabbage aphids they get
30:25
um chemicals from cabbages and they can
30:27
mix certain chemicals and if a ladybird
30:30
or something tries to eat them they can
30:32
explode and it's like almost like a
30:34
mustard gas that goes into the
30:35
ladybird's eyes and then it runs away
30:37
and they can well they are dead but
30:40
oh they they die in the yeah but they've
30:42
saved their mates so that's the
30:44
important thing that's so cool so they
30:46
it's they've got these two chemicals in
30:48
different bits of their body and when
30:50
they're attacked they combine them yeah
30:52
like and that's like in um die hard
30:54
three that's the bomb in die hard 3.
30:56
that's the structure of the bomb in die
30:57
hard 3. so yeah that's amazing they're
31:00
incredible um aphids i've never really
31:02
talked about die hard through sorry
31:04
sorry yeah yeah yeah
31:06
no but they are extraordinary aren't
31:07
they i was reading this uh thing about
31:08
them which is so they'll all exist on a
31:11
plant a colony of them will exist on a
31:12
planet but they don't have wings um so
31:14
they all hang out there and a lot of
31:16
them do have wings yeah but this is yeah
31:18
so um let's say with the species uh that
31:21
don't have it they'll be on this plant
31:23
and they'll suck it dry or get too
31:25
overcrowded and they need to move on so
31:27
when that happens they produce a
31:29
generation of the same species with
31:31
wings to fly away and then they land on
31:34
another plant and then they lose the
31:35
wings again and just hang out there they
31:37
can just they can just suddenly have a
31:39
generation of winged aphids of their
31:41
species
31:42
they have weird reproduction because
31:44
they sort of alternate between sexually
31:46
reproducing and then the women going we
31:47
can't be bothered to use men and then
31:49
asexually reproducing which mostly they
31:51
they do the latter um don't they but
31:53
when they're on plants sometimes
31:54
there'll be a whole bunch of aphids on a
31:56
plant feeding on it and then they see a
31:57
deer or something coming towards the
31:59
plant it's going to eat it so they all
32:00
need to throw themselves off like a mass
32:02
leap and then they get to the floor and
32:04
the little ones piggyback on the bigger
32:06
ones to escape so you see the little
32:08
aphids climbing onto the older aphids
32:10
backs and this is when it becomes more
32:11
individualistic because the scientists
32:12
have watched this say the old ones are
32:14
there trying to scrape them off as
32:16
they're trying to escape
32:18
off me
32:20
but they do do it that's amazing and you
32:22
were saying how they can kind of
32:24
reproduce without males the females they
32:26
could do that up to 41 generations
32:28
without having any sexual acts with a
32:31
male
32:32
but it does mean that if you had one
32:34
aphid one female aphid in a room and no
32:37
aphids died then there would be more
32:39
than 1.5 billion billion billion aphids
32:43
at the end of the season
32:44
which means that the earth could be
32:46
covered in a layer of aphids 149
32:48
kilometers deep within a year
32:51
wow
32:52
so they're just all most of them are
32:54
dying well that's what that's why
32:55
ladybirds are so great
32:58
god that's amazing is it true that they
33:00
sorry andy is it true that they are
33:02
basically born pregnant i kept reading
33:04
their things yeah some of them are yes
33:05
that's extraordinary and then yeah they
33:07
give birth to offspring which already
33:08
have which are like russian dolls
33:10
they're just like there's a tinier aphid
33:12
yeah
33:13
three times over yeah and they just lift
33:15
their upper torso off and out comes yeah
33:18
the smaller version so the thing they
33:20
really like is sap they love sap um they
33:23
also get called sap suckers that's how
33:24
much they like sap and
33:26
they excrete this thing as they feed
33:29
which is called honeydew and they have
33:31
to eat so much plants app because
33:33
they need various nutrients and they can
33:35
only get those nutrients in the
33:36
quantities they need by ingesting a huge
33:38
amount of sap right so the giant willow
33:41
aphid produces four times its own body
33:43
weight in sugar every day that it's
33:45
excreting so that's the equivalent of a
33:48
human
33:49
leaving behind a couple of bathtubs of
33:50
water every day with 300 bags of sugar
33:53
inside that's what they're doing each
33:55
day wow and also other animals love this
33:58
honeydew which is their aphid excrement
34:01
so sometimes if bees can't get nectar
34:04
they will just lick up aphid poo instead
34:07
because it's very high in sugar it's
34:08
fine it is fine it's just it's fine but
34:10
it's not quite as good as nectar is it
34:12
it's not quite as good but it does still
34:14
i mean if honey honey can be made of
34:16
plants up but it if that's been filtered
34:18
through an aphid's bum and then vomited
34:21
up by a bee but the reason that the
34:23
sugary excretions are most important is
34:24
because of this amazing relationship
34:26
they have with ants right that you can't
34:28
talk about aphids without talking about
34:29
ants because the ants love their
34:31
honeydew um which is such a
34:34
weird euphemism for poo um but so they
34:37
they have this really symbiotic
34:39
relationship with ants and it's hard to
34:40
know who's winning and who's losing in
34:41
that relationship and so sometimes ants
34:43
will bite off aphids wings so they can't
34:45
fly away but they can't kill them
34:47
because they need to keep on licking
34:49
their this honey stuff and so that means
34:51
they defend them so when other attackers
34:53
come and they want to eat their aphids
34:55
then the ants will fight them off
34:56
because they'll stop anyone killing them
34:59
there's this really cool ant actually
35:00
which is we think is the first meat
35:03
farmer aside from humans um so it's an
35:06
ant that farms aphids but for their meat
35:07
because these are aphids that don't
35:09
actually produce this sweet stuff and so
35:11
it's called the melissa tarsus and it's
35:14
about three millimeters long and
35:16
basically they keep all these aphids
35:17
together inside the bark of trees and
35:19
they sort of farm them and they
35:20
gradually eat them but what's quite
35:22
quite cool about these ants is they've
35:23
obviously got six legs but one of their
35:25
pairs of legs their middle pair points
35:27
up not down
35:29
because they what use is that i guess if
35:31
you fall on your back you can turn
35:32
yourself over again
35:34
no it's because they're always burrowing
35:36
through tunnels in trees and so it helps
35:37
them get their two feet on the roof
35:39
while they've got four feet on the
35:40
ground that's amazing that's cool right
35:42
and also so we don't we're not totally
35:44
sure they eat the aphids because they
35:47
really hate being spied on they're very
35:48
private like a lot of us and so we've
35:51
seen that they keep the aphids sort of
35:53
farmed inside the tree but whenever
35:55
scientists drill holes in the tree the
35:56
ants immediately block them up again so
35:58
we haven't been able to watch yet
36:01
that's amazing we have to wrap up in a
36:02
second some aphids defend themselves by
36:06
having sex with other aphids and getting
36:08
stds
36:09
and they actively seek out stds because
36:12
they give them superpowers what's what
36:14
the powers do they get well it's a very
36:16
specific superpower wasps like to lay
36:18
eggs inside aphids and this is a big
36:20
problem um obviously because no one
36:22
likes to have an egg laid inside them by
36:24
a wasp so but the good news is that
36:27
there are particular sti bacteria which
36:29
destroy developing wasp grubs in your
36:32
body so the only way for a female to
36:34
protect herself is to seek out a male
36:37
with a sexually transmitted infection
36:38
well how does she know it's on his
36:40
tinder profile or something
36:42
uh i don't i don't know how the female
36:44
knows that the male has it wait so she's
36:46
been parasitically
36:47
implanted she's i think i think it's
36:49
before that yeah she's right she's like
36:51
prophylactic kind of mess it's like a
36:53
condom rather than the morning after
36:54
pill yes
36:56
yeah it's uh except the condom is
36:58
getting an std
36:59
[Laughter]
37:01
um do you know that um due to aphids or
37:05
aphids had a real um thing with wine in
37:07
the 1900s early 1900s and they really
37:10
started attacking all the wine in the
37:12
world
37:13
they were eating all of the roots and it
37:15
meant that the french wine industry
37:17
almost went out of business and actually
37:18
all of europe did
37:20
and what they found is that the aphids
37:23
loved the roots of french vines and
37:24
other european vines but they really
37:26
hated american vines and so
37:29
these days almost all french wine even
37:32
though it's french grapes they're
37:34
grafted onto american roots oh
37:37
and so actually most french wine is
37:39
actually half american
37:41
wow we're gonna get letters
37:46
glad we didn't do this fact on our paris
37:48
bit of the tour
37:51
okay that is it that is all of our facts
37:53
thank you so much for listening if you
37:55

00:10
[Applause]
00:13
hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:18
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:20
live from paris
00:29
[Music]
00:34
and once again we have gathered around
00:36
the microphone to our four
00:37
favorite banks from the last seven days
00:39
and in no particular order
00:41
here we go starting with you james
00:44
okay my fat this week is that north
00:46
american porcupines
00:48
sometimes fall out of trees and impale
00:51
themselves on their own spikes
00:56
so it gets pushed into them like so it's
00:58
they're ready
00:59
that's what impaled means
01:04
do they die um we all die
01:08
we're in paris i should have realized
01:09
the philosophy would come earlier
01:12
um they can well actually not usually
01:15
and the reason that we know about this
01:17
uh for a few reasons but it's
01:18
it's kind of a report that came out by a
01:20
guy called aldis rose
01:22
and his colleagues and they noticed that
01:25
quilts have antibiotics on them
01:28
and they worked out that the reason that
01:30
they have antibiotics on them
01:31
is because they do inhale themselves
01:33
quite often and it means that it won't
01:35
kind of get infected and it won't kill
01:36
them it is weird that they spend so much
01:38
time on trees and this is north american
01:40
pokemon
01:40
yeah they absolutely love climbing trees
01:42
yeah actually a female porcupine is only
01:45
interested in sex once a year
01:47
and she signals that by climbing the
01:48
tree urinating and screaming
01:57
but the males have urination as well in
01:59
their mating so the males
02:01
they they can sometimes make the females
02:03
receptive to mating and the way they do
02:05
that is urinating on them
02:06
and they have special high velocity
02:09
urine
02:10
which can go six feet wow so even if the
02:13
female is on a completely different
02:15
branch
02:16
the male can spray her and then she will
02:18
sort of become fertile
02:20
that's incredible i mean is it true i
02:22
might have this wrong but is it is it
02:23
true that
02:24
so there's a fight that happens between
02:26
two males who are courting
02:28
the one um so the urination thing as
02:30
well as uh being an exciting
02:32
thing for the mating ritual is also in
02:34
the same way that a dog might pee on a
02:36
fire hydrant to market as its territory
02:38
it's a territory marking thing i think
02:40
as well that feels
02:41
likely possible yeah they're not really
02:43
sure they think yeah it could be
02:44
pheromones
02:45
uh to attract them but they do have this
02:47
massive fight so
02:48
lots of males can get involved because
02:51
they're very solitary porcupines and
02:52
they have this very narrow window of
02:54
fertility the females
02:55
and so they're on their own middle of
02:57
nowhere they're suddenly like
02:58
[ __ ] fertile so they have to do this
03:00
whole screaming
03:01
thing to
03:05
smell it so then a bunch of males flock
03:07
to them and then they do have this huge
03:09
fight and so it's very normal
03:11
if you see a male porcupine mating he'll
03:13
usually be doing it with a bunch of
03:14
someone else's
03:15
some other porcupine quills sticking out
03:17
a bit wow
03:18
covered in other men's quills wow
03:22
yeah not comfortable no um they the
03:26
female porcupines are pregnant or
03:28
lactating for 11 months of the year and
03:30
they can be
03:30
pregnant for all of their lives and they
03:32
live for 20 to 30 years
03:34
so they basically spend their entire
03:36
life pregnant or breastfeeding
03:38
why wonder they're screaming so much
03:41
why are there not more porcupines then
03:43
they're just good at hiding from you
03:46
i think there are quite a lot if you're
03:47
in america i think you hear it quite a
03:48
lot um
03:49
so what they have lots of quills
03:52
actually they have
03:52
spines all over their penis as well the
03:54
males it's covered in what they call
03:56
horny material
03:57
it's very clever um but uh they
04:01
the norm you know the problem for humans
04:03
is that they can they can stab us with
04:04
their quills
04:05
and um there was a paper from 1955
04:08
which is all about being quilled by
04:11
porcupines
04:12
and this is our friends at improbable
04:14
research so the guys who do the ignoble
04:16
awards uh which we've mentioned before
04:18
um there was a paper in 1955 written by
04:20
albert r shable
04:21
and in it he wrote many hundreds of
04:24
quills have penetrated various parts of
04:26
the author's own body
04:27
in numbers of one or two to as many as
04:30
40 at one time
04:32
on one occasion 40 were driven into the
04:34
forehead and the bridge of the nose
04:36
by one stroke of a porcupine's tail they
04:39
added the penetration of porcupine
04:41
quills into the human body
04:42
is never a pleasant sensation
04:47
this last science speak just in case you
04:49
were thinking of trying it out
04:51
um they have really interesting sex
04:53
organs don't they find the males have to
04:55
be interesting sex organs so
04:57
they keep their testes in inside them
04:59
they don't let their testies into their
05:01
scrotal sac but most of the year they're
05:02
just sitting in their stomach somewhere
05:04
not their stomach their abdomen and then
05:05
they just plop them down into the
05:06
scrotal sac
05:08
once they're gonna mate and they suck
05:09
them back up again when they're not
05:10
mating
05:11
but then they've got as you say their
05:12
penis is spined but also
05:14
it's usually pointing backwards so it's
05:17
in sort of a sheath
05:18
that points backwards towards them so
05:20
when they mate with the female
05:21
it flips out like a pen knife oh wow
05:25
yeah no why don't they keep their
05:27
testies inside
05:28
they probably be stabbing themselves
05:30
otherwise the whole year around
05:31
that's probably just yeah protection
05:33
there was a um a
05:35
politician from florida called bobby
05:37
bean and
05:38
he wanted to become a senator and he ran
05:41
with
05:41
the promise that he would make sex with
05:44
porcupines
05:45
legal and
05:48
how did he's now president
05:55
did he win no no he didn't win um
05:57
actually it wasn't quite as stupid
05:59
as you might think his idea was to he
06:01
wanted to erase kind of
06:02
useless laws that exist so it currently
06:06
is illegal explicitly to have sex with
06:08
porcupines in florida
06:10
and he's like you know they have a pen
06:12
knife spiky penis
06:14
we're probably not going to do that i
06:16
mean spikey on the outside we probably
06:17
don't need this law
06:19
and there was like other things like
06:20
there was a rule against men wearing
06:22
strapless gowns that he wanted to get
06:24
rid of as well
06:25
so that was gowns yeah yeah well how is
06:28
he going to seduce the porcupine
06:33
um they eat people's toilets sometimes
06:35
porcupines
06:37
they do they genuinely do
06:40
well okay let's let's have some
06:42
qualification here
06:43
um so what they do they love uh sodium
06:46
so basically and they need a lot of it
06:48
they crave salt all the time
06:50
and uh some people in the territory
06:53
still have
06:53
outdoor wooden toilets and a lot of the
06:56
wood
06:56
um you know if your aim is poor has
07:00
urine soaked into it okay so urine
07:02
contains salt
07:03
um and you know people there are toilets
07:06
which have been eaten away at by
07:08
porcupines so they don't eat the
07:09
porcelain but they do eat the
07:10
surrounding wood
07:11
so they they eat the hut
07:15
yeah yeah boy scouts i think on boy
07:17
scout camps they often say you'll go to
07:18
the loo and you're surrounded by
07:20
porcupines chewing through the hut to
07:21
death
07:23
sounds like a really frightening
07:24
experience
07:26
but the salt love gets them into all
07:29
sorts of trouble so
07:30
they chew through cars a lot so cars are
07:32
quite silly
07:33
so they they genuinely do you know
07:36
they're
07:36
coming from old toilet boy over here
07:40
you'll draw the line at cars very weird
07:43
um they actually choose because mostly
07:44
in winter
07:45
uh can you guess why salt on the roads
07:48
itself on the roads did you read that as
07:50
well
07:51
oh great stuff and if you drive it must
07:53
be on the tires when you're driving
07:54
again some of the tires flicks up onto
07:55
the engine
07:56
and then they climb they'll eat your
07:58
engine out from the inside
07:59
wow um another thing that that dan you
08:03
might be interested in
08:04
is um uh yeti bones
08:07
what am i in some kind of weird fever
08:10
treatment
08:13
so they eat toilets they need couples
08:16
and they eat yetis
08:17
yeah we're just thinking how far we can
08:18
push it there's a
08:20
theory that's prevalent among people who
08:22
believe in the sasquatch which is the
08:24
same as a yeti right now
08:28
absolutely not it's like filming a
08:30
hedgehog in a porcupine the same thing
08:32
that's insulting i'm sorry to the
08:34
sasquatch and yeti communities
08:35
so people who believe in sasquatch
08:37
people often say to them
08:38
why aren't there any bones why do we
08:40
never find any bones yeah and they say
08:41
well it's obviously because they're very
08:42
salty and porcupines are beating them
08:44
yes yes there's something you believe
08:46
that yeah it's a true that's a true
08:48
fact that they believe in um it's true
08:51
and also they say that in canada they
08:52
don't actually put salt on the roads
08:54
anymore speaking of salt because uh
08:55
bigfoot keeps eating it all so
08:57
we gotta stop we're losing too much salt
08:59
really yeah we should probably move on
09:03
anything before we do it should we just
09:04
have all the tree climbers oh
09:06
shall i just do one more thing on touch
09:08
just really quickly because it's that
09:10
french person
09:12
and there was there was a 19th century
09:15
french explorer called jules gerard
09:17
who reported on a group of people called
09:19
the hachichaya
09:21
they were from algeria and all they ever
09:23
did
09:24
was smoke hashish and kill porcupines
09:29
i came here to smoke a sheet and kill
09:30
porcupines and i've just finished my
09:34
hashish
09:36
but now i'm quite sleepy
09:42
and we do need to move on to our next
09:43
fact just quit just really quickly did
09:45
you know that fish can climb trees
09:47
what yeah fish climb trees and loads of
09:51
different types of fish so one of them
09:52
is the mangrove killifish
09:54
in mangrove forest and that exists in
09:56
like lots of america florida and brazil
09:58
lives in puddles and then the puddles
10:00
dry up at which point they actually
10:01
climb up the nearest tree so it looks
10:03
like a normal fish
10:04
climbs its way up a tree and then it
10:06
climbs into a hole in the tree then
10:08
insects made or a natural hole in a tree
10:10
and it just weights it out in the hole
10:11
until it rains again and it can wait in
10:13
a tree for months
10:14
so sometimes you'll just because of fish
10:16
halfway
10:19
hanging out with a urinating porcupine
10:24
it's very weird in the upper canopy
10:27
[Music]
10:30
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:32
that
10:33
is andy my fact is that scientists are
10:35
developing a t-shirt which
10:37
tells you when you smell
10:39
[Music]
10:40
this is really cool so there is a
10:43
there is a british microchip maker and
10:45
the firm is called arm and they are
10:47
working on putting ai devices in clothes
10:49
basically
10:50
so the idea is that you will have a
10:52
microchip in your armpit effectively in
10:54
your shirt
10:55
and it will inform you on a scale of one
10:57
to five how bad your body owner is
10:59
and whether maybe it's time to have a
11:01
shower or change your clothes
11:03
but if you change your clothes and
11:04
you've lost a shirt that tells you
11:07
i guess you have to change for another
11:08
microchip t-shirt yeah it's going to be
11:10
quite an expensive
11:11
endeavor will the washing the clothes
11:14
not make the microchip
11:15
obsolete this is the key problem that
11:18
they are
11:19
trying to overcome it's making a
11:22
microchip which will withstand repeated
11:24
washing you know washing machines so you
11:26
have no choice but to wear that one sure
11:28
over and over and be permanently on
11:31
number five
11:35
i'm not saying it's free of problems all
11:36
right i do think it's a good idea there
11:38
is a way actually to make
11:40
clothes clean themselves you can put
11:42
certain nanoparticles in clothes and
11:44
then they'll kind of clean themselves
11:45
and um scientists are using this to make
11:47
robotic trousers for old people
11:50
okay so all people have trouble walking
11:53
and they think if they can make these
11:54
robotic trousers it will kind of help
11:56
them to walk
11:57
okay that's a nice thing yeah okay
11:59
sounds dangerous to me i've seen the
12:01
wrong trousers but go on
12:04
well the thing is they've put these
12:05
other platforms in which means they
12:07
don't have to be washed so that's good
12:08
for the electronics but the problem is
12:10
all the old people they've given them to
12:12
said they would just wash them anyway
12:18
that's the hard thing to get around
12:19
isn't it
12:21
yeah there will be just while we're on
12:24
the smart clothes thing
12:25
um there will perhaps one day soon be
12:28
uh underpants that you can use to
12:30
control your home
12:32
so this is really cool so
12:36
this is not too far away actually like
12:38
turning lights up and stuff because
12:41
i was once lying in bed and i rolled up
12:43
one of my socks and threw a
12:45
light switch and turned the lights off
12:46
so
12:47
[Applause]
12:50
my wife is not nearly as impressed as
12:52
you guys
12:54
james has been trying to get the story
12:56
into the podcast for five years
13:00
it is very impressive a rolled up song
13:02
and you're on the other side of the room
13:04
it wasn't like it was here no your
13:06
search must be rock hard
13:09
if only you had microchips in your socks
13:11
to tell you please wash me
13:14
um so you will be able to get underpants
13:17
that control your home okay i'm
13:18
determined to tell you about this
13:20
so it's it's basically just it's more
13:22
putting centers in clothes so you will
13:24
have sensors which measure your heart
13:25
rate
13:26
your temperature your body temperature
13:28
or the temperature of your body
13:29
inside your pants um the pressure the
13:32
hydration what do you say
13:34
well okay well here we go so you could
13:36
you could
13:37
connect your thermostat in your house
13:40
you could link it up with your body
13:41
temperature
13:42
and when you're at home it could notice
13:44
oh dad's feeling
13:46
the pants are a bit hot and
13:49
turn the heating down a little bit and
13:52
then
13:52
i don't think it's fair that we all have
13:54
to live in a permanently cold house
13:55
because dad's got a hot clutch
14:01
[Applause]
14:04
you know you can buy a machine that um
14:06
folds your pose for you
14:08
well there's it's was a kickstarter i
14:10
think it's called the foldy mate
14:12
and i was watching videos so it's a
14:14
massive machine it's about as big as a
14:15
person it's not the size of a fridge
14:17
and so i don't know where you're going
14:18
to put it but next to your fridge
14:22
to the fridge no one can use them though
14:24
no trick with your help no it's folded
14:26
the
14:29
and pasta eased my pants
14:32
and that's how fuzzily was invented
14:36
um no so you i was watching a video of
14:39
them doing it and then trying to
14:41
advertise it like it's an unbelievably
14:42
convenient thing
14:43
but you have to put your clothes in one
14:44
by one and you have to attach them to
14:46
these clips and you have to lay them
14:47
down quite flat like perfectly flat
14:49
and then exactly the right arrangement
14:51
for it to suck it in and then spend
14:52
about 10 seconds folding it up and spit
14:54
it out
14:55
and then do the next one so it probably
14:57
quadrupled the time it takes for
14:58
yourself away
15:00
i heard about this is actually quite an
15:02
old invention i think it's from 2006 and
15:04
i don't think it's taken off but it's a
15:06
cool idea
15:07
um it's a shirt that was designed by
15:09
australia's commonwealth scientific and
15:10
industrial research organization
15:12
the idea is that the shirt has um
15:16
fiber sensors inside it that means that
15:18
it goes to our wireless transmitter when
15:20
they're activated
15:21
and what it's designed for is people who
15:22
love to play air guitar
15:24
so as soon as an air guitar player goes
15:27
and strums
15:28
there can be a brown noise surely
15:31
that'll happen every time they make this
15:33
movement
15:34
yes and i'm not saying there's any
15:38
particular times you might know that
15:41
but there might be somewhere you don't
15:42
want to hear a big thrall
15:47
dad's been in his room a long time
15:48
playing the guitar why's it so cold in
15:52
there
15:54
[Applause]
16:01
so that exists that's good um
16:04
well um this is slightly different but
16:06
ford
16:07
i don't think we've mentioned this
16:08
before ford the car phone has a robot
16:11
bottom um called the robot and it's to
16:14
test
16:15
is to test um seats in cars and it
16:18
it mimics the action of a person getting
16:21
into a car
16:22
um and they've just had a recent
16:24
innovation in which is now the robot
16:26
sweats so because car seats you have to
16:29
you know they have to last years and
16:30
years and years
16:31
so it can it can um get in and out of a
16:34
car the robot
16:35
25 000 times uh in a few weeks
16:38
and it bounces around and it sweats and
16:41
this is really good because it simulates
16:42
a decades use
16:43
of the car presumably by a naked
16:46
sweating person
16:48
so it's really to test it to destruction
16:50
that's the thing that's a very specific
16:51
niche of driver that they're appealing
16:53
to
16:54
my underpants and trousers are designed
16:56
to stop any sweat
16:57
from leaving them to get to a seat
16:59
they're the barriers right yeah
17:00
well not all of us have such high tech
17:02
clothes
17:04
some of my dresses have holes in the
17:06
buttocks
17:08
it's stress sweat that comes out of your
17:10
buttocks isn't it isn't it
17:13
well we only like two different types of
17:15
sweat and one of them's oh no it's not
17:17
stress weight sorry after crying sweat
17:18
is stress wet and that comes up your
17:20
armpits
17:21
yeah the bottom sweat is fine well i'm
17:24
glad we cleared that one out
17:28
um so this is on sweat and body odor
17:30
these facts and we do have these two
17:32
different kinds of sweat
17:34
so equine or equine is the one you get
17:36
on
17:37
basically the one that's not your
17:38
armpits and your crotch
17:40
and that actually comes from your blood
17:43
so when your hands start sweating for
17:44
instance they're actually bleeding
17:47
in a way it comes from blood plasma and
17:50
that's why it tastes quite salty is
17:51
because
17:52
um it's the electrolytes all the
17:53
minerals and stuff in your blood that's
17:54
why
17:55
porcupines are coming over and licking
17:56
me the whole time
18:01
we need to move on to our next fact very
18:03
soon yeah i know
18:04
i know oh that flew by um cats and dogs
18:08
have sweat on their paws
18:09
so they can get that attraction on the
18:11
floor is that why holding on to it
18:14
uh it increases the friction if it's
18:16
just a sticky level you don't want kind
18:18
of gushing
18:19
i don't think it's sticky
18:23
[Music]
18:24
there's something really wrong with my
18:25
cat
18:27
water out of all four pores
18:31
um i also find it so weird that the
18:33
smelly sweat right the bits that you
18:35
excrete it from are yeah your armpits
18:37
and your groin which kind of we know
18:38
and then the other two bits are your
18:39
eyelids and your ear canal so
18:42
if you've got really stinking eyelids
18:44
then apply some
18:46
dove will be fine
18:49
i'm just on smells um i i read that
18:52
since fact was about the smell um there
18:56
was an anthropologist who was called
18:57
lewis
18:58
leakey he was a very famous
18:59
anthropologist um he was responsible for
19:02
bringing people like jane goodall into
19:05
research and making her name diane fosse
19:07
as well he has a theory
19:08
or had a theory which claimed that we
19:11
survived as humans
19:13
largely because of our body odor we were
19:15
too smelly to eat
19:19
really yeah he thinks that people you
19:20
know people or other animals would want
19:22
to kill us at the time in a neanderthals
19:24
but they don't
19:25
oh jeez mate and then just not go near
19:27
us
19:28
that's why we're here where's
19:29
neanderthals they had that amazing um
19:32
those amazing clothes didn't they those
19:34
neanderthals that would tell you when
19:36
you were sweating
19:38
[Music]
19:39
to get rid of the smell thing then
19:40
surely we're losing one of our weapons
19:42
against
19:43
being killed yes yeah suddenly the whole
19:46
animal kingdom will be around
19:49
the only slight flaw is that quite a lot
19:50
of deadly animals live in
19:52
asia and a lot of people in asia don't
19:55
smell at all
19:56
so most koreans for instance don't have
19:57
their gene that makes their sweat smell
19:59
at all do they yeah so how have they
20:00
avoided all the lions over the ages
20:03
[Music]
20:04
um
20:08
um okay we need to move on to our next
20:10
fact time for fact number three and that
20:12
is
20:12
anna my fact this week is that the best
20:15
astrophysicist
20:16
in the world just failed to save new
20:19
york from a fake asteroid
20:22
it's pretty scary stuff this is
20:25
a genuine simulation that a whole bunch
20:28
of astrophysicists from all over the
20:29
world do
20:30
and it happened a few weeks ago it
20:32
happens at a conference so it's a
20:33
conference called the international
20:34
academy of astronautics planetary
20:37
defense conference
20:38
and every year they have this gathering
20:40
where they're set
20:41
a task where an asteroid is coming for
20:44
the earth and they have to work out how
20:45
to deflect it
20:46
and they buggered it up and you was
20:48
destroyed it's so exciting though so it
20:50
lasts for five days
20:51
but in the simulation that's years and
20:54
years so this year a few weeks ago
20:56
they got this alert there was um a fake
20:59
press release was sent out saying that a
21:00
100 to 300
21:02
meter wide asteroid had been detected at
21:04
a one percent chance of striking the
21:06
planet in 2027
21:07
and then you know as the days went by
21:09
they keep on getting updates saying okay
21:10
it's now 100
21:11
chance we're all gonna die sorted out
21:13
and what they eventually managed to do
21:14
was nudge it off course so i think it
21:16
was going to hit denver
21:17
and they nudged it off course and it
21:19
struck new york
21:24
do you know one way that this is better
21:25
than nuking an asteroid this is one
21:27
theory that if there's an asteroid on
21:29
its way we could do um
21:31
sorry what's better than that the well
21:33
this this idea that i'm about to send
21:35
you okay
21:40
basically if an asteroid's on its way
21:42
one plan is to nudge it out of the way
21:44
one plan is to blow it up
21:45
but the best plan maybe is to just paint
21:48
it on one side
21:50
okay okay so that would change the
21:52
thermal properties of the asteroid
21:54
and it would mean that it moved in a
21:55
different trajectory and how do you
21:57
suggest that we paint this asteroid
21:59
well the un's space advisory council ran
22:02
a competition at move and asteroid
22:04
competition
22:05
and it awarded the first prize to an
22:07
idea to make a giant paintball gun
22:12
the fire is not the asteroid that's
22:15
amazing
22:16
i think you know the movie armageddon
22:18
yeah um
22:19
so there's there's been some research
22:21
recently done by some scientists where
22:23
they did a simulation to see how well
22:25
that would have worked if bruce willis
22:26
had actually
22:27
muted like he does in the movie and it
22:29
splits apart and what they discovered in
22:31
simulation
22:31
was that it would break apart like it
22:33
does in the movie unfortunately
22:35
the gravity is so great that it would
22:37
just be pulled back together
22:38
as one solid asteroid and just wipe us
22:41
out
22:42
that's how the movie should have ended
22:43
and this is a new discovery isn't it
22:44
yeah because last year when they ran the
22:46
simulation and this really is the top
22:48
people that nasa and all these other
22:52
from the asteroid organizations doing a
22:54
nuclear explosion which blew it apart
22:56
but since then yeah they just go well
22:57
they'll just suck themselves back
22:58
together and keep coming at us
23:00
so there are all sorts of other weird
23:02
ways of diverting asteroids so i really
23:04
like the mass driver way
23:06
which basically is the idea that you
23:08
would it's quite slow
23:09
working so you need to know that the
23:10
asteroid was going to hit you in about
23:12
100 years time that's great
23:13
yeah you've got to pass the knowledge
23:16
onto your grandchildren
23:17
but the idea basically is that you get
23:18
onto the surface of the asteroid you get
23:20
some
23:20
like landing objects onto it and they
23:22
pick up rocks from the asteroid and they
23:24
just throw them at the earth
23:26
and the motion of that pushes the
23:28
asteroid away from the earth so it's
23:29
kind of like imagine if you're sitting
23:30
on a swing i guess
23:31
and you've got a tennis ball and then if
23:33
you throw the tennis ball away you'll
23:35
kind of go backwards on the swing right
23:36
it's the opposite of eating the opposite
23:38
reaction force
23:39
so if enough bits of rock are thrown at
23:41
the earth in the asteroid it'll sort of
23:43
slow it down but then if too many are
23:44
thrown at us then we die away from the
23:46
things you've thrown at us
23:48
yeah you have to make sure they're not
23:49
too big those bits of rock yeah yeah
23:51
wow and you need a hundred years you
23:53
need you need 100 years yes
23:55
i think previously dan said that the
23:57
warning we would have is about one
23:58
second
24:00
yeah but it's not true
24:05
we know about loads this is a really
24:06
cool thing so nasa currently knows about
24:08
seven hundred and ninety five thousand
24:09
asteroids so can i just say like for
24:11
instance the cheltenham
24:12
uh meteor we didn't know about that at
24:14
all until it landed so
24:15
it might be that we have no seconds yeah
24:18
so i was wrong by one second
24:22
but this is the amazing thing and the
24:24
the problem is it's really hard to keep
24:26
track of them once you've spotted them
24:27
so scientists have lost more than 900
24:30
near-earth asteroids as in they were
24:32
spotted once we thought oh that's a bit
24:34
worrying
24:34
and then we don't know where they've
24:35
gone wow really yeah so
24:37
we saw them once and because sometimes
24:39
it takes 20 hours to confirm that
24:41
what you're seeing is right sometimes
24:43
the weather is bad so you can't see it
24:44
again from a ground-based observatory
24:46
so you just sort of say oh well there
24:49
you go
24:51
fingers crossed yeah don't come back and
24:53
we're gonna have to move on to our
24:55
final texture um some things killed by
24:57
asteroids might have been the dinosaurs
24:59
okay again i didn't really say that
25:01
sentence very well but i think all the
25:02
points were there yeah
25:03
um but there is one guy who doesn't
25:05
think that there's a guy called
25:06
professor brian j
25:07
ford and he thinks that the dinosaurs
25:09
actually died out because of a lack of
25:11
sex likes
25:13
like sex legs sex legs
25:17
damn how's here how's your crotch
25:19
feeling getting any hotter
25:21
what is sex like it's exactly what it
25:24
sounds like cool
25:25
so um his theory is that because
25:27
dinosaurs were so big
25:29
they wouldn't be able to have sex
25:30
because they would just crush each other
25:32
and so the only way they could do it is
25:33
by using the legs to be buoyant
25:35
in it you know what i mean and he says
25:39
that as the consonants drifted there
25:41
were loads of shallow there used to be
25:43
loads of shallow lakes and there weren't
25:44
shallow lakes anymore which is true
25:46
and so he thinks because of those lack
25:47
of shallow lakes all the dinosaurs died
25:49
out
25:50
but surely this would mean that all the
25:51
fossils we find would be crushed
25:53
dinosaurs underneath
25:55
their crushing mate yeah you're right
26:02
it's just superior it's a great
26:03
literally i love it um
26:05
and i just one thing about asteroid
26:06
names oh yeah so asteroids it used to be
26:09
the near-earth objects and most of which
26:11
are asteroids
26:12
had to be named after mythical creatures
26:15
but
26:16
there have been loads and loads found
26:17
since that was decided i think about 50
26:19
years ago
26:20
so it also used to be they have to be
26:21
named after things from mythology but
26:23
they
26:24
couldn't have creation or underworld
26:25
themes because there was a for other
26:27
bits of space
26:27
so you have to really do your research
26:29
into your mythological creature anyway
26:31
so
26:31
these rules were kind of loosened
26:32
because there are like tens of thousands
26:34
of them that have names now
26:36
so if you i was looking at the name of
26:37
the massive list of asteroid names
26:39
and you have these really grand ones
26:41
like palace and juno
26:43
and achilles and then you have bill
26:45
smith and sarah jenkins
26:48
donna anderson brandy peterson and i was
26:50
looking for our names in them
26:52
so there are a lot of anna's
26:55
uh so there's an anna just anna on her
26:57
own and then like you know
26:59
that's it that's the one that's gonna
27:00
get us isn't it
27:04
fingers crossed i'm waiting for her then
27:06
also
27:07
there's also a james on his own and a
27:09
daniel on his own
27:10
but there is no andrew or andy great
27:12
thanks a lot so
27:14
i think the next asteroid name you
27:16
should claim it or we could name a sex
27:18
like cathy
27:19
yes that's how i'd like to be remembered
27:27
time for our final fact of the show and
27:28
that is my fact my fact this week is
27:31
that
27:31
until the 1840s there was no maximum
27:34
size
27:34
for a rugby team so matches were
27:37
sometimes played with up to
27:39
300 players at the same time
27:44
so was that an 150 against 150
27:48
or 299 against one yeah
27:51
he's very good there was we do have an
27:55
example of it so
27:56
um there was the game of rugby was said
27:58
to have been invented
27:59
in a school called rugby hence where it
28:01
gets staying from in 1823
28:03
there was a match played in 1839 where
28:06
rugby school house had 75 players so
28:09
that was their team
28:10
and they played a team that was called
28:12
the rest
28:13
and it was 225 people
28:17
wow yeah that's amazing do we know who
28:19
won i don't actually know who won i
28:21
couldn't find out
28:22
i'm sure it's out there somewhere but
28:23
yeah and it was obviously it was a very
28:24
chaotic game as you can imagine
28:26
um they hadn't really got any rules to
28:29
begin with rules slowly kind of it just
28:31
seems to be like
28:32
basically a load of guys in the field
28:34
just trying to get the ball from one end
28:35
to the other
28:36
but with no rules right yeah it's just
28:38
basically one big scrub
28:40
um strangling and throttling were
28:42
outlawed in 1862
28:45
that's when i went right off again
28:48
that's just health and safety gone mad
28:50
in the internet
28:51
but this is this is yeah because these
28:53
go back hundreds of years don't they
28:55
it all comes from games which were
28:56
called folk football so um
28:58
there's one that still played in uh in
29:00
england in derbyshire uh in ashland
29:03
where you keep playing until you score a
29:05
goal or until 10 pm
29:07
whichever comes sooner you just knock
29:09
off because the
29:10
people would die quite often and there
29:12
are lots of records of people dying
29:14
playing rugby
29:15
partly because people used to carry
29:16
knives in sheets on their belts
29:18
and so you might just run into someone
29:20
else's knife by mistake
29:22
that happened that's a foul
29:26
but this is the other thing is the game
29:27
of rugby is problematic because it lets
29:29
people take revenge on each other
29:31
uh because there are no rules so if
29:32
you've got a village of people basically
29:34
having a big fight you could just say oh
29:35
yeah he ran onto my knife
29:37
right where is in the sort of
29:40
14th 15th centuries so this is before
29:43
proper rugby
29:44
yeah yeah because there is one called i
29:46
wonder if this is what you're talking
29:47
about calcium that's a
29:49
well that's a very similar game yeah
29:51
yeah i mean that like like what andy's
29:53
saying it's it's a rugby game but the
29:54
idea is to play rugby but also just kick
29:57
each other's ass
29:58
really badly like you you're allowed to
30:01
punch kick headbutt elbow
30:02
choking is permitted uh there's no
30:04
gloves allowed you know to soften the
30:06
punch
30:07
and um and the amazing thing and there
30:09
would be deaths and they would just
30:10
carry on and so on
30:12
um but the main thing was if the game
30:13
was going a bit too slow and they wanted
30:15
the fans to sort of have a bit more of a
30:16
fast experience and get the game done
30:18
they just let some balls come in
30:22
suddenly just random balls running
30:24
around attacking humans i mean it sounds
30:27
incredible yeah that's
30:28
italy isn't it yes calcium yeah yeah
30:30
this presumably wasn't recently
30:32
now yeah you're about to do everything
30:34
except kick people in the head
30:35
[Music]
30:37
yeah and who's telling the bulls not to
30:38
do that
30:41
well even in rugby kicking used to be um
30:43
shin kicking specifically
30:45
used to be massively part of the game so
30:47
this is one of the biggest controversies
30:49
rugby ever saw
30:50
was when they were drawing out the rules
30:51
it was like in the 1870s
30:53
and hacking was really part of rugby
30:56
which is basically
30:57
really really vigorously kicking someone
30:59
else's shins
31:00
and some people wanted to outlaw it and
31:02
some people said that's going to ruin
31:03
the game it's part of it
31:04
but it was the case that like after a
31:06
scrum had broken up everyone else had
31:07
left the balls at the other end of the
31:09
pitch
31:09
you'd still have apparently just you'd
31:11
have two players left over kicking each
31:12
other in the shin really hard
31:14
at the other end of the pitch so people
31:16
used to wear sharpened boots with spikes
31:18
on them to really
31:19
get that shin kick as good as it can be
31:21
yeah and then they would wear
31:22
white trousers to show off the blood
31:25
this was a mark of the
31:26
this is the english uh school system and
31:29
it's best
31:30
basically although actually so and then
31:33
rugby moved to france and to other
31:35
countries and in the late 19th century
31:37
in france once we did have rules
31:40
rugby wasn't seen not so much as a team
31:42
game but more of an
31:43
individual game there was still a team
31:45
but you were trying to
31:46
see how well you could do yourself and
31:48
so it was like one athlete against the
31:50
group
31:51
and you were trying to get around them
31:53
so um basically players
31:54
were reluctant to get dirty uh reluctant
31:57
to find themselves on the ground
31:59
and they thought it was less glamorous
32:01
to get involved in scrums and this only
32:03
was challenged when france played
32:04
england in 1906
32:06
and found out that the english were not
32:07
playing by those rules
32:11
actually one of the objections to
32:12
getting rid of the shin kicking
32:14
was i read and i look i don't know what
32:16
this means and and just don't shoot the
32:18
messenger
32:19
but so this is hacking when it was going
32:21
to be banned and the secretary of black
32:23
heath
32:24
fc said we can't ban the practice of
32:27
kicking each other in the shins
32:28
because it will do away with all the
32:29
courage and pluck of the game and bring
32:31
over a lot of frenchmen
32:39
you really really know your audience
32:43
so when it took off they they eventually
32:45
in it i think it was
32:46
the 1870s give or take whole football
32:48
club said you okay fine we'll stop
32:50
each other kicking in the shins with
32:53
sharpened boots but you're still allowed
32:54
to trip up the man who's
32:56
running that was just a nice little
32:57
innovation they've got to throw in
32:59
nice yeah oh if you know that rugby
33:01
balls could could kill you
33:03
as well could they yeah but not the way
33:05
you would think
33:06
oh i didn't have a thought in my head
33:10
okay so like they hit you in the head so
33:13
hard that you die
33:14
brilliant that's not the way that you
33:15
would think good okay it's not that way
33:17
so rugby balls uh the first person to
33:19
make a uniform oval rugby ball
33:22
was a guy called richard linden and his
33:24
wife actually was involved in the
33:26
manufacturing too
33:27
so what it was was you would have a
33:28
pig's bladder and you had to blow that
33:31
up
33:31
and then surround it in leather that's
33:33
just how you made the ball
33:34
but lyndon's wife rebecca was the one
33:36
who did the actual blowing
33:38
up and she contracted a lung disease and
33:40
she died from it
33:41
because there was an unexpectedly you
33:43
know there was an infected bladder
33:44
and she had had 17 children for him as
33:47
well
33:48
by him you know this is a very sad story
33:50
and so
33:51
that determined him to make a rubber
33:53
bladder it basically
33:55
prompted the innovation of um and he
33:57
also invented the modern pub
33:59
yes syringe and he thought well i could
34:01
take that from an ear and put it into a
34:03
football and then yeah
34:06
but who was looking after all those kids
34:07
well he was inventing these silly
34:09
people-based things that's my question
34:12
the book i've read about rugby does not
34:13
relate
34:15
to um just a tiny little nugget of how
34:19
how influential this little rugby school
34:21
in england has been on
34:22
on global sporting outside of inventing
34:25
rugby itself
34:26
um there was a student there who was
34:28
from australia called thomas wills
34:30
he went back to australia and he
34:31
invented aussie rules which back in
34:33
australia is
34:34
is a huge sport it's not gone global um
34:37
in fact they have
34:38
australia have an all-star aussie rules
34:41
team
34:41
that they announce every year but
34:43
because no one is good enough to play
34:45
them
34:45
they've never played a match so we've
34:47
got this like super group who just get
34:49
announced and they
34:50
they meet up but that's it they should
34:53
play
34:54
the rest
34:59
that's such a good point so rugby is
35:01
known for having
35:02
really hardcore players playing it i
35:04
guess and i think so my favorite story
35:06
is wayne shelford she was quite famous
35:08
winning particularly harcourt he was
35:09
capturing the all blacks in the 80s
35:11
and he in one of his fan in or maybe
35:14
that's him i don't know
35:16
sounded like him based on what i'm about
35:17
to tell you
35:25
so he's come to the all blacks very
35:26
huggle in one of his very first games he
35:28
was super young
35:29
a french he was playing france and a
35:32
french
35:32
boot ripped open his scrotum and left
35:36
a testicle hanging free
35:39
hanging free he also had four teeth
35:41
knocked out in the same incident
35:43
and that he didn't want to leave the
35:44
pitch anyone else has just been sucked
35:46
up like a porcupine
35:49
also that's a hell of a kick that gets
35:52
your testicles out of your teeth
35:53
yes unless unless they're kicked up with
35:57
such force as they come into your mind
36:00
they're telling us tentacles are that
36:02
long
36:04
but yeah he just says in the video quick
36:05
sewing up sewing up he sewed it up right
36:07
there and then and he kept on playing
36:08
what went on again
36:23
back into the scrotum of the microphone
36:27
box
36:35
uh anything else before we wrap up i
36:37
just have my favorite rugby
36:38
story aside from the testicle ripping of
36:41
baby
36:42
is the story of the dorchester
36:44
gladiators
36:45
i don't know if you know this one so the
36:46
dorchester gladiators were
36:48
a team in the year 2000 and they were an
36:50
amateur over 40s
36:52
very unfit rugby team who just played
36:54
sort of amateur games for fun
36:56
and then they thought they would mate so
36:57
they thought they'd go to romania for
36:59
kind of a big boosa
37:00
and play some rugby over there and they
37:02
went and they were giving some toys to
37:03
an orphanage actually ash
37:05
to be fair and anyway they were in
37:07
romania and the romanians got win that
37:09
there was a rugby team there
37:10
and they were invited to play a game and
37:12
so they were like we're playing a game
37:13
with the local romanians in the local
37:15
park
37:15
and there's been some sort of
37:16
mistranslation and so romania saw that
37:19
they were basically a national level
37:20
team and so when they turned up they
37:23
realized it was in their national
37:24
stadium
37:25
it was being broadcast on television
37:30
there were thousands of spectators there
37:32
and they were playing against the
37:34
romanians
37:38
they did say we did get a bit suspicious
37:40
when they offered us a training session
37:42
the night before and we refused to do
37:44
that as we do our pre-match warm-up in
37:45
the bar
37:51
but i think before the match apparently
37:52
the romanians were all training and the
37:54
brits were there looking at them and
37:55
smoking on the sidelines
37:57
the romanians took pretty and only beat
37:59
them 60 17 out of sympathy in the end
38:04
okay that is it that is all of our facts
38:06
thank you so much
38:20
[Applause]
38:31
up there from all of our previous
38:32
episodes to upcoming tour dates to bits
38:34
and merchandise
38:35

02:01
[Music]
02:04
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:07
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
02:09
coming to you from the qi offices in
02:11
covent garden
02:12
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
02:15
here with anna chazinski
02:16
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
02:19
and once again we have gathered round
02:21
the microphones with our four favorite
02:22
facts from the last seven days
02:24
and in no particular order here we go
02:27
starting with you andy my fact is that
02:30
major league baseball has an official
02:32
mud
02:34
which is quite cool what do they do with
02:36
this mud they rub it on their balls
02:39
okay and this is from a great article in
02:41
sports illustrated
02:43
uh which i you read for the articles i
02:45
read for the answer
02:46
i genuinely do um so it's all it's a
02:50
profile of this man called jim bintliff
02:52
and he spends his life basically
02:54
harvesting mud he's one of the world's
02:56
only
02:57
paid professional mud farmers
03:00
do you think there are a lot of amateurs
03:03
yes
03:04
no you're right he's wrong no i think no
03:05
because you're not allowed to enter the
03:06
mud olympics
03:07
if you are professional so a lot of
03:09
people remain amateur
03:12
he's issued his chance at that it's true
03:14
but he's doing very well isn't he
03:15
well kind of yeah so majorly baseball
03:19
they need 240 000 baseballs per season
03:21
and every single one has to have the
03:23
shine taken off it
03:25
so that uh the pitcher can grip it
03:27
better
03:28
um and he has this secret location where
03:31
he harvests buckets of mud
03:33
and he won't tell anyone he won't tell
03:35
anyone at all
03:36
so for example he didn't even tell his
03:38
wife until he'd been married for five
03:40
years and they'd had
03:41
two children together not even after the
03:44
first child did he think
03:45
it's probably okay not wonder why he
03:48
kept coming back with muddy shoes and
03:50
and stuff she's covered and covered in
03:51
filth yeah um well she knows that he
03:53
does it presumably but
03:54
she doesn't know the location that's
03:56
that right yeah there's a particular bit
03:58
of the delaware river
03:59
and he's the third generation of his
04:00
family doing this job yeah it's been
04:02
going since the 30s
04:04
yes it's mad and he has these um so he
04:06
goes and collects it all at once
04:08
right so he'll go to the source the
04:10
secret sauce and then he'll come back
04:11
with a thousand pounds uh in weight
04:14
of mud and store it over the winter and
04:16
then sell it to
04:17
yeah he cleans it as well
04:20
you don't want dirty mud no way um so he
04:23
lets it sit
04:24
and then he dilutes it and he strains it
04:25
for six weeks and he drains it and it
04:27
has to be nice and smooth
04:29
and he used to just sell it in sort of
04:30
buckets but now he sells it in little
04:32
plastic containers but it is
04:33
hand made mud as it were and he has
04:36
alibis for if people actually
04:38
catch him in the act of doing it so he
04:40
just makes stuff up like he needs it for
04:42
his rose bushes or
04:43
for bee stings uh poison ivy and so on
04:47
but how is no one following him to find
04:49
out where this location is
04:50
well i think probably no one really
04:52
cares it's probably
04:54
because surely what it is is basically
04:57
he has the monopoly over this mud
04:59
and he could probably get it from
05:00
somewhere else and no one's ever going
05:01
to say anything that's true or someone
05:03
else could put the same mud
05:04
in a pot without the brand and they
05:06
probably won't be able to sell it for as
05:07
much
05:07
well it's not a market that people are
05:09
dying to get into
05:10
yeah that's what i'm saying i guess he
05:13
doesn't earn a lot from it it's very
05:14
tragic
05:15
considering he's called at the market
05:16
basically um he makes about twenty
05:18
thousand dollars a year in total from it
05:20
oh my god like actually baseball must be
05:23
in the billions and billions of
05:25
dollars they make every year every team
05:27
basically orders about four cans
05:29
i'm sorry do we know why the team need
05:31
this specific
05:32
mud why aren't they it's going elsewhere
05:35
it's
05:36
it's really good stuff the main reason
05:40
this isn't going to answer your question
05:41
but just to say the reason why you need
05:43
it is because
05:44
it's really hard to throw a brand new
05:47
leather ball because it will just slip
05:49
out of your hands and actually
05:50
um what happened was um back at the
05:52
start of the last century
05:54
someone actually died because a pitcher
05:56
threw it and without the roughness you
05:58
can't control it
05:59
and he threw it and it just hit someone
06:00
in the head and they died and so from
06:02
then on they decided they needed
06:03
something to rough it up
06:04
oh my god so jim bindlef is saving lives
06:07
every baseball season yeah
06:08
yeah let's say that amazing and as you
06:11
say the generations that this has gone
06:12
through it's amazing so it was started
06:14
by lena blackburn
06:15
um and lena died in 1968 so he handed it
06:19
to his friend then john hass and this is
06:20
where
06:21
the family comes into it uh the three
06:23
generations john hass then gave it to
06:25
his son-in-law
06:26
who's got a fantastic name burns
06:28
bintliff
06:29
and then burns bintlift gave it to one
06:32
of his nine children who is now jim one
06:33
of his nine children and also he said i
06:35
was the only one of the nine children
06:36
who expressed any interest in the family
06:38
mud business everyone else left the
06:40
state for some reason they all moved
06:42
they had eight children they kept on
06:44
saying come on surely we don't need to
06:46
have another
06:47
can you just take on the family business
06:48
i think he's got one of his daughters
06:50
interested in the trade now so it might
06:52
hit generation four
06:53
oh no she hit adolescence yet because i
06:56
do
06:56
i can imagine sort of a ten-year-old
06:58
finding that really cool and by the time
06:59
you're 18 you think actually dad i'm
07:01
going to be an actress yeah
07:03
there's another trick for helping um
07:06
your grip
07:07
uh so um this is for holding baseball
07:09
bats as well there's many tricks to help
07:11
you have a firmer grip
07:12
one of them is and this is done by quite
07:15
a few players is to
07:16
uh piss on your own hands no yeah this
07:18
is an actual thing so there was a news
07:20
report recently from a pittsburgh
07:22
pirates pitcher
07:23
called jameson tylon and um he had to
07:26
he had to go off i think during a match
07:28
because of a cut in his middle finger it
07:30
was really bad it was an open cut
07:31
right so he was he was told why not pee
07:34
on your hands because
07:36
it will sting but it might get you back
07:37
on the pitch um more like the pittsburgh
07:39
pirates
07:42
more like that yeah
07:45
now there's no definitive truth wait a
07:47
minute so can i just ask you're saying
07:49
not to help you pitch you're doing it to
07:51
stop the cut from
07:53
is that right in this case they thought
07:54
that the p might heal the finger but
07:56
generally
07:57
um if you want to toughen your hands you
07:59
should put a magic
08:00
piss that just heals wounds instantly
08:03
according to baseball players we all do
08:06
yeah right just we into an empty nivea
08:09
pot and it's basically the same
08:10
i think a few have done that because who
08:12
because um george posada who was a
08:14
catcher
08:16
george pisada george posada oh sorry
08:21
and it's not normative determinism it's
08:23
perfectly normal uh so he's a catcher
08:25
and
08:26
moises aloo as a hitter and they both
08:28
avoided calluses because you get
08:29
calluses if you play baseball a lot
08:31
right
08:31
by urinating on their hands sorry i'm
08:33
still a bit perplexed about the
08:34
function of urinating owners is it to
08:36
help you hold the bat it's a moisturize
08:38
basically
08:38
right wow and so they haven't heard of
08:41
any moisturizers
08:43
that are commercially available but if
08:44
you did get commercial moisturizer and
08:46
you held onto the bat it might slip out
08:48
of your hand
08:49
so i suppose maybe it moisturizes
08:51
without making it slippy
08:53
yeah possibly we can only speculate i
08:55
notice you're always dropping your
08:57
microphone whenever we're doing stage
08:58
shows so maybe this is something you
09:00
could do
09:01
sure sure sure i'll just need a modesty
09:03
screen at the side of the stage
09:04
um you are allowed to put pine tar on
09:07
your bat as well
09:08
so uh it's tar from a pine tree
09:12
so you're allowed to put it on the
09:13
handle bit of your bat so the bat
09:14
doesn't fly out of your hands
09:16
and that's another safety thing because
09:18
you don't want to just have people
09:19
throwing their
09:20
bats all over the yes
09:23
in american football you're not allowed
09:25
to put sticky things on your gloves but
09:27
people often do or often haven't been
09:29
caught
09:30
so that you can kind of someone throws
09:32
the ball at you
09:33
or to you sorry and then you jump up to
09:35
catch it and then it almost just touches
09:37
one of your fingers and somehow you
09:39
managed to catch it yeah and that's
09:40
explicitly against the rules but people
09:42
have done it over the years
09:43
but what happens when you go to kick it
09:45
and you're trying to drop the ball
09:47
it's just attached to your hand are you
09:49
going to shake hands for the opposition
09:50
after the game
09:54
just something about baseball in the
09:56
olden days yeah so
09:58
in until 1887 so baseball started like
10:00
start of the 19th century but until 1897
10:03
when you came up to bat or whatever the
10:06
baseball term is
10:07
as the hitter uh to bat then you could
10:09
request
10:10
a high or a low ball you could basically
10:12
ask the pitcher to put it where you
10:13
wanted it really you say can you put it
10:14
sort of between my
10:16
upper thigh and my lower thigh please or
10:17
whatever and they had to do that
10:19
wow yeah it makes it easier doesn't it
10:21
yeah it does actually quite a lot harder
10:23
for the pitcher to aim it there
10:25
that's amazing i mean they do still have
10:26
to hit it in that little zone
10:28
in your hitting zone don't they yes it's
10:31
i always think that's a bit weird
10:32
yeah well you can't just throw it in the
10:35
opposite direction
10:38
or a hundred meters in the air above
10:40
their head
10:41
that's why my game's never caught on uh
10:44
some stuff on mud oh yeah yeah
10:46
um so in the 19th century mud in
10:50
the uk was a really big problem
10:52
especially in the cities like london
10:54
and it was always said that you could
10:55
tell an englishman abroad
10:57
um because he would be the one wearing
10:59
turned up trousers
11:01
not really and it wasn't a fashion it
11:03
was because if you didn't turn up your
11:04
trousers you get mud on them
11:06
i see god when people see hipsters now
11:09
when foreigners do they think it's just
11:10
because we live
11:11
knee deep in mud they think oh yes i was
11:14
thinking you might be a time traveler
11:15
from 19th century london but you're
11:17
probably right
11:18
maybe the hipsters all are that a lot of
11:20
their features do speak to that
11:23
oh i've got one really cool mud thing do
11:25
you guys know about the mud pot
11:26
of california nope so this is this
11:29
amazing thing it's a
11:31
giza basically but it's a bubbling mud
11:33
geezer
11:34
and it's called the nyland geezer and
11:37
it's just at the southern end of the san
11:38
andreas fault and it remained totally
11:40
still as you'd expect from a giza
11:42
until about 11 years ago when it started
11:46
suddenly moving
11:47
and then it got faster and faster and by
11:49
2015
11:50
this kind of giza this mud volcano
11:52
called the mudpot
11:53
was moving at 10 meters a year and
11:56
increasing in speed
11:57
at one point it moved 18 meters in a
11:59
single day
12:00
so this mud volcano is just encroaching
12:03
across america
12:04
it's getting closer and closer to the
12:05
union pacific railway tracks
12:07
and so they've had to build this massive
12:09
wall they built a wall that was
12:11
23 meters high by 37 long to try and
12:14
stop it
12:14
and it didn't stop it at all it's just
12:16
gone underneath the
12:18
wall and it's got out the other side and
12:20
it's still encroaching on the railway
12:21
track
12:21
no one knows how to stop it they've
12:22
tried everything i have heard of that
12:24
and they call it the slowest moving
12:26
emergency in
12:27
in america don't they yes i think it's
12:29
technically a national emergency it is
12:31
technically a national emergency
12:32
yeah it sounds like it'd be a great b
12:34
movie well it's like the blob
12:36
yeah yes yeah it's dying for a hollywood
12:40
film producer to pick it up
12:41
i like the way you said it's kind of
12:42
encroaching across america when actually
12:44
it's gone about 20 meters towards some
12:46
train tracks
12:49
it's gradual but it will happen yeah you
12:52
have to look out for those gradual
12:53
things
12:54
exactly you know keep your eyes peeled
12:56
for the encroaching mud
12:57
i have a fact about mud and sport
12:58
actually but a different sport
13:00
completely
13:00
so mud has changed the shape of football
13:04
players
13:04
and so so it's soccer players we're
13:07
talking yeah yes
13:08
so soccer players uh these days have
13:12
much less mud to contend with
13:14
right true because there used to be lots
13:16
of pictures which were called mud baths
13:17
you know it just gets churned up and
13:19
it's just a nightmare yeah so
13:20
since they've had fewer pictures like
13:23
that which are just basically swamps
13:25
the shape of footballers has been
13:26
changing and so you used to have to be
13:28
just
13:29
very muscular to deal with those
13:30
conditions you know just to run in that
13:33
but now they're getting
13:34
taller and leaner because they're just
13:36
having to run a lot on this pristine
13:38
grass that they've now got all the
13:39
pictures
13:40
so that has literally changed their
13:41
shapes interesting
13:43
so wayne rooney is one of the last of
13:45
his kind in many ways he is yes he would
13:47
have done well in those
13:48
in those uh swamps yeah i mean i'm not
13:52
saying that he looks like shrek
13:53
i'm just saying that he's a very strong
13:56
man exactly yeah
13:57
yeah oh yeah i mean he does look like
13:59
shrek yeah
14:02
[Applause]
14:05
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:08
that is
14:08
chozinski my fact this week is that in
14:11
brazil
14:12
women throw c-section parties where
14:14
guests are served champagne and canapes
14:16
while watching the host have a caesarean
14:18
section through a viewing window
14:21
and wow that's a party it's insane
14:24
from the home of parties as well brazil
14:27
i know they have the greatest parties in
14:29
brazil
14:30
well but i think if you're the
14:31
originator of parties then you always
14:32
have to think outside of the box and do
14:34
things that seem insane to the rest of
14:35
us
14:36
but these will be normal in 50 years
14:38
exactly they're just experimenting with
14:39
the next great
14:40
party craze do you get the canapes but
14:43
with a thick
14:44
lid over them that you have to cut
14:45
through and gradually extract
14:47
like a sausage roll at a time from
14:50
that's what i would do i would theme it
14:51
like that good cool
14:52
yeah you should be involved in cesarean
14:55
party planning yeah i think you'd be a
14:56
welcome addition so
14:58
this is the thing that happens it's
14:59
quite a big deal cesareans in brazil
15:01
it's a bit of a status symbol it's
15:03
slightly about
15:04
wealth and they're also very common so
15:06
56 of all births now
15:08
are caesareans and 33 percent are
15:11
elective caesarians so people have just
15:13
chosen to do that and that's compared to
15:15
in the uk i think only 10 are elective
15:18
and even so that's like the highest in
15:19
europe
15:20
and so it's a big deal because you
15:23
are welcoming a new human to the world
15:25
so friends and family go to the hospital
15:27
with the person who's going to give
15:28
birth
15:29
and there's a gallery that's specially
15:31
built for the purpose very often
15:32
so in sao paulo i think there are a few
15:34
of these and they even have frosted
15:36
windows
15:37
and then the windows turn transparent at
15:39
the moment of birth
15:40
that's so cool you don't have to watch
15:43
all the boring stuff like they're being
15:44
injected and
15:45
having a panic attack but you do get to
15:47
see the baby emerging
15:49
i would think you would turn them
15:50
translucent or opaque for the
15:52
moment of birth itself
15:56
you don't see that so i've i've um i've
15:59
been in the room for a cesarean section
16:01
my wife had one
16:02
uh with our son and that wasn't the one
16:04
you were there for no
16:08
but what they do is so obviously you
16:10
don't see everything that's going on
16:11
they they have a big sheet
16:13
that hangs above the tummy and you're on
16:16
the other side of it with
16:17
the top half of your wife it's a bit
16:19
it's a bit like a magic trick
16:20
says do you pick the half of your wife
16:22
that you are there with yeah yeah you
16:24
can you can i pick the top half
16:25
that's good good on you yeah should have
16:27
picked the left half
16:30
and then they the baby comes up and you
16:32
see the baby
16:33
once it's been removed come up through
16:35
the top and i imagine that's the same
16:36
with uh with these viewing windows i
16:39
think you can see the whole thing happen
16:40
but it's not i mean i was reading a very
16:42
funny entry in the harvard guide to
16:44
women's health
16:45
which is just a very detailed
16:47
description of all the ways you can give
16:49
birth and one of them says a screen is
16:52
usually placed between
16:53
the woman's upper and lower body so she
16:55
does not have to view her internal
16:57
organs
16:59
i think i feel like we're missing the
17:01
most amazing bit of this story
17:02
i didn't realize we had windows that
17:04
could go from frosted to translucent
17:06
that is the most amazing bit of the
17:07
story
17:08
that's extraordinary it's just it's just
17:10
a beautiful wonderful thing isn't it
17:12
you never really know until you see a
17:14
window go from opaque to translucent
17:17
really what a wonderful wonderful thing
17:19
it is in the very sadly in the poor
17:21
hospitals in brazil they just have lots
17:23
of nurses who breathe incessantly on the
17:25
women
17:26
and then they wipe them clear
17:29
you know the really rich hospitals you
17:31
can change the furniture in the hospital
17:33
suite if it clashes with the decorations
17:34
that you've got planned
17:36
and some quite opulent ones wow fair
17:38
enough they're actually designing a new
17:40
one i think in sao paulo which is going
17:42
to be a 22-story high maternity ward
17:45
and it's going to happen very tall women
17:46
giving birth
17:48
or who intend to sort of project their
17:50
baby
17:52
no this is going to have a wine cellar
17:53
and a ballroom very cool there's one
17:56
woman on the planet and i think only one
17:58
woman who has given herself a caesarean
18:00
okay wow i know she she's a lady called
18:03
ines ramirez perez
18:04
she's mexican and this was in the year
18:06
2000 she had six children already so she
18:08
had given birth before
18:10
um and her husband was at a restaurant
18:12
which didn't have a phone unfortunately
18:14
so she decided right i'm just gonna go
18:16
for it and she
18:17
literally cut into her abdomen to give
18:20
birth to the baby
18:21
wow she had experience butchering
18:23
animals apparently so she sort of
18:25
she knew what she was doing but pure
18:28
alcohol didn't she to numb the pain
18:29
yeah surgical spirit what was wrong with
18:31
the old
18:33
through the vagina normal exit yeah well
18:34
sometimes that doesn't work out
18:36
okay for serious reasons yeah okay so
18:38
why she i think it i don't know if this
18:40
was her first choice
18:41
yes it sounds it probably wasn't her
18:43
first choice to
18:44
give herself a sarah home she probably
18:46
tried the vagina thing first
18:52
you're right i should have considered
18:54
that maybe
19:05
oh i'm such a mug
19:08
you were saying someone was saying that
19:11
she
19:11
had um a history in agriculture
19:15
butchering yes sorry um well actually
19:17
the first known woman to survive a
19:19
c-section was the wife of a pig
19:21
castrator
19:22
jacob nuther and that was in the 1500s
19:25
this is the first documented account we
19:27
have and apparently his um
19:29
his job of castrating pigs helps him to
19:32
know a lot about anatomy and he managed
19:33
to
19:34
um to take the baby out and then sew her
19:36
up and she was fine
19:37
so he did it yeah and she had five more
19:39
children including a set of twins
19:41
afterwards
19:42
wow although the source i saw it and did
19:45
say some sources questioned the
19:47
reliability of this story
19:49
because it was first written about
19:50
nearly a century after it happened but
19:52
um it's
19:53
usually accepted as the first um
19:55
c-section
19:56
where the woman survived um this whole
19:58
this whole sort of craze
20:00
of having relatives and friends watch
20:01
you giving birth
20:03
so that isn't a new thing at all it was
20:05
done uh we know it was done in france uh
20:08
in 1778
20:09
murray antoinette she had a whole crowd
20:12
come bursting through the door as soon
20:14
as it was announced that she was giving
20:15
birth and was almost crushed to death
20:17
they were
20:18
holding up bits of wall yeah um
20:21
so when she was giving birth 200 people
20:24
ended up being in the bed chamber
20:25
to witness the event yeah so there was
20:27
there was an obstetrician yelled out the
20:29
queen is gonna give birth and that's
20:31
when the hordes of people started coming
20:33
in
20:33
but this this happened all the time so
20:35
um queen mary in
20:36
england the wife of james ii she was
20:38
giving birth in 1688 and that was what a
20:40
century before
20:41
and there were 67 people in the room
20:43
which she thought was far too many
20:44
and she actually oh that's right she was
20:46
so embarrassed that she asked the king
20:48
to put his wig over her face
20:50
so is that the book she wanted to hide
20:53
well
20:53
i guess it meant she didn't have to look
20:55
at the 67 people in the room
20:57
yeah and if you put it on the other part
20:59
then the baby's going to come out with a
21:01
hilarious
21:02
wig on its head that would be amazing
21:06
there was an interesting theory about
21:08
the conspiracy theory was born off the
21:10
back of this which
21:11
is the and this was put out by the
21:12
protestants um
21:14
they thought that the baby was stillborn
21:17
and that another baby had been snuck in
21:20
yeah because and that's why you would
21:22
have people who saw the birth right
21:24
because then you knew that it wasn't
21:25
going to be
21:26
you knew that it was a proper birth yeah
21:28
despite the 67 people in the room
21:30
there were theories put around that um
21:32
the baby had died and then been replaced
21:34
by the baby of a nursing mate
21:35
so all of that kerfuffle and all of that
21:36
having a wig over your face while you're
21:38
giving birth
21:38
still didn't kill off the conspiracy
21:40
theory there was a theory of being
21:41
smuggled in in a warming pan
21:43
yeah like a a hot hot water bottle yeah
21:46
equivalent
21:46
and as a result there was a tradition
21:48
where you would have to have someone
21:50
sort of witness that the actual royal
21:52
baby was the royal baby so when
21:54
queen elizabeth ii was born our current
21:56
queen that was part of the thing there
21:57
was someone standing outside it's not
21:59
like the whole section
22:00
is there so it would now be david um
22:04
just sort of lingering in the room
22:08
i thought that was for all royal babies
22:09
or is it not is it i think it's for
22:11
quite a lot so i thought that stopped
22:12
though i thought it stopped with
22:14
well it did stop but he was the the home
22:16
secretary was there
22:17
not such a javit the then home secretary
22:19
was there when queen elizabeth was born
22:20
and then in
22:21
1948 she herself was pregnant um
22:24
and they were debating should we invite
22:26
the home secretary
22:28
we've got a long guest list already do
22:31
we have the seating space
22:32
so she wasn't involved she was then
22:34
princess elizabeth and
22:36
she was not involved in the discussion
22:37
it was the king george vi talking to his
22:39
personal secretary saying shall we have
22:41
the home secretary along
22:42
and elizabeth said i think we should
22:44
have him along eventually she was
22:45
piped up and said no it's important so
22:47
they invited him
22:48
but then awkwardness of organisms though
22:51
they
22:52
the king's secretary his private
22:53
secretary bumped into the canadian high
22:56
commissioner
22:56
and the canadian high commissioner said
22:58
oh hey there's going to be a baby i
22:59
assume you're inviting
23:00
representatives of all the dominions
23:02
what and then
23:04
so that meant there would then have to
23:05
be seven ministers
23:07
um who would probably be sitting in the
23:08
corridor outside they wouldn't actually
23:10
be in the room
23:10
but they decided no we can't have
23:12
everybody so it just was a party that
23:13
got out of hand basically
23:15
so that's when they said no no more home
23:17
secretary
23:18
so you didn't get to go do you know that
23:19
um there's no good reason why we would
23:21
give birth lying down and i know a lot a
23:23
lot of people don't know various
23:24
different positions
23:25
but the established the established
23:28
position for thousands of years
23:29
was in a chair so a birthing chair and
23:32
you see birthing chairs
23:33
since 1450 bc so they've been around for
23:37
like 3500
23:38
years and they look it doesn't make
23:41
sense
23:41
gravity helping yeah precisely and it's
23:43
actually kind of more comfortable
23:45
is there a cut is there a hole in the
23:47
chair yeah
23:48
that's yeah they look like a toilet seat
23:52
but
23:52
quite an ornate nice toilet seat because
23:54
you don't want to sit on an actual
23:55
toilet seat while you're giving birth
23:57
and apparently it replaced the tradition
23:59
of sitting on your partner's lap or your
24:01
birthing partner's lap while you were
24:02
giving birth which i think sometimes
24:04
people find useful
24:06
and lying down there's no particular
24:08
reason that's any better at all the only
24:10
reason lying down was introduced was in
24:12
the late 19th century
24:13
which was this big change in childbirth
24:16
practice
24:17
when it went from being a female thing
24:18
to a male thing so traditionally men
24:20
just
24:20
weren't in the room at all oh sorry
24:22
right okay i thought it was still the
24:24
people thinking okay oh you've got a
24:25
real shot come in
24:26
[Laughter]
24:29
right through that urethra mate just uh
24:32
to add a sort of modern birthing i don't
24:34
want to make a sweeping statement about
24:36
this but
24:36
from what we were told and from people i
24:38
know who give birth um it's not really
24:40
it's kind of a hollywood thing that you
24:41
think people give birth on their back
24:43
these days
24:43
most are sitting up most of these uh
24:46
beds are put into a sit-up position
24:48
and that's how birth is happening yeah
24:50
yeah so you tend to see that propped up
24:52
um i think in films even but it wasn't
24:55
thought that you would do it without
24:56
your legs on the ground sitting on your
24:57
wooden chair and the only reason then
24:59
you were put on a bed and leaning back a
25:00
bit is because
25:02
birthing changed from being a female
25:03
thing to a male thing where a male
25:04
doctor was let in because females
25:06
weren't doctors
25:07
and then they had to see inside the
25:09
vagina to see what was going on so it's
25:10
just to make it easier for
25:12
the doctor that they can see it right up
25:14
inside you
25:15
it's actually quite fun when you go into
25:16
rooms these days because it looks a bit
25:17
like an escape room they have like um
25:20
you love escape i mean you were the
25:21
james and there is an ultimate escape
25:24
happening for the little guys like
25:25
escape the womb yeah escape rooms
25:28
exactly
25:29
and it's um they have um so they have
25:32
bits on the wall that if imagine you
25:33
were climbing a wall
25:34
a rock climbing ball they have that so
25:36
that women can hold on to it they just
25:38
need to move around and
25:40
do they have bouncy balls everywhere
25:42
there's was that the
25:43
an nhs they had a climbing wall they
25:46
don't have a
25:47
yeah she she gave birth 20 feet up
25:51
wow and you had actually a um baseball
25:54
backstop to catch the baby didn't you
25:57
have you heard of subfumigating uh no
26:00
but let's guess what it is
26:01
okay fumigation is something to do with
26:04
um
26:04
smoke yep and sub means below yeah
26:08
do you blow smoke below yourself pretty
26:11
close
26:11
is it blowing smoke up a woman's bottom
26:13
to get the baby to come out the vagina
26:15
i mean it's i think that's surely that's
26:19
not how biology works
26:21
it's not how biology works you're
26:22
absolutely right but it's
26:24
kind of it's not so far off weirdly so
26:27
this is an anglo-saxon thing where you
26:29
have a pregnant lady
26:30
and she you want her to give birth so
26:32
you get a load of disgusting stuff
26:34
like cat poo and shavings of horses
26:36
hooves and fish eyes
26:38
and you burn all of these on a big fire
26:40
and then you bring in the mother to be
26:41
and the idea is that her womb is so
26:43
disgusted by the smell
26:45
that it contracts and it pushes the baby
26:47
out wow do we think it maybe works
26:49
in some way don't know i imagine at the
26:52
time they did i imagine at the end of it
26:54
they went and that my friends is how
26:55
biology works
26:58
wow yeah i don't i don't know if it
26:59
worked i can't think of how it might but
27:02
um i guess a strong physical reaction
27:04
yeah but for a while
27:05
like you would wretch yeah your muscles
27:08
yeah
27:08
you might make your muscles contract
27:10
let's not try to justify sort of two
27:12
thousand year old barbaric practices
27:15
you never know who's gonna start
27:16
bringing them back in
27:18
feminism
27:20
[Laughter]
27:25
[Applause]
27:25
[Music]
27:28
okay it is time for fact number three
27:30
and that is
27:31
james okay my fact this week is that
27:34
when samuel johnson
27:36
visited paris he worried that his french
27:38
wasn't good enough
27:39
so he spent the whole time speaking in
27:41
latin
27:42
[Laughter]
27:45
so this is uh samuel johnson of
27:47
dictionary fame
27:48
uh and this is from an article in oxford
27:52
university press
27:53
which is more about why elitist
27:55
politicians such as boris johnson and
27:57
jacob rees-mogg
27:58
often drop latin into their
28:00
conversations and it's by a guy called
28:02
gordon campbell who is a fellow in
28:04
renaissance studies at the university of
28:06
leicester
28:07
so we'll get onto samuel johnson later
28:09
but basically what he's saying
28:11
is that during the renaissance this
28:13
became a really really common thing
28:15
all over europe and it's what kind of
28:17
brought rich europeans together
28:20
and quite ironically now it's the
28:22
british politicians who aren't
28:24
particularly keen on europe who are
28:25
often dropping
28:26
latin into conversation and it all comes
28:29
from the fact that the
28:30
old british universities had this kind
28:33
of pro-european stance
28:36
well the renaissance was all about a
28:38
revival of classical
28:40
um everything a classical everything
28:42
that's why renaissance it was the
28:44
rebirth
28:44
isn't it of that era it was kind of
28:46
throwing out the middle ages and saying
28:48
we want to call back to the classical
28:49
times
28:50
yeah and so he actually spoke latin all
28:52
by his account or was this by boswell's
28:53
account
28:54
um it was by boswell's account um
28:57
yeah of course we can't trust everything
28:59
that he said but it's like his official
29:01
biography so it's where we get most of
29:03
our uh
29:03
information about johnson uh and he said
29:06
that while he did
29:07
go into um france and spoke latin with
29:10
what he called wonderful fluency and
29:11
elegance
29:12
uh his english pronunciation meant that
29:14
no one understood the word he was saying
29:16
[Laughter]
29:18
i read a blog called latin language blog
29:21
it's someone who just loves
29:23
writing about modern day usage as well
29:25
as old and he did a list of people
29:27
who are alive today who can speak latin
29:30
sort of a list of people you wouldn't
29:31
expect
29:32
who could you know penn and teller the
29:33
magicians yeah there was a there's the
29:35
silent one and there's the the one who
29:36
the silent world could speak every
29:38
language on earth
29:39
yeah but he just never says anything
29:40
exactly it is actually him who can
29:42
do laughs he's not silent that's the
29:44
thing he's just trying on his head to
29:45
work out the right verb ending
29:48
tom hiddleston who is loki in the thor
29:50
series in the avengers series and
29:52
um okay loki's a latin word exactly yeah
29:56

29:58
the place
29:59
like uh yeah sorry yeah come on you
30:02

30:04
just didn't realize that you were
30:05
speaking about him in the um
30:08
accusative uh and then two more
30:12
robocop the person who played robocop
30:14
yep peter weller um he teaches roman and
30:16
renaissance art um and he supposedly
30:18
can write or he studied latin and lastly
30:22
50 000 people in finland
30:23
um oh do you bury the lead there hey
30:26
what do you mean
30:27
well finland um there's a lot of people
30:29
who do in fact the thing that we're
30:30
writing in our upcoming book is about
30:31
how a radio show there used to do
30:34
news bulletins in latin it's because
30:36
there are 50 000 people there who can
30:38
understand what's being said
30:39
um samuel johnson yeah yeah yeah so
30:41
samuel johnson
30:42
was a great character really and quite a
30:45
lovable guy
30:46
um he had all sorts of habits that i
30:48
didn't know about so most famous
30:50
obviously for his dictionary
30:52
the maybe the most influential
30:53
dictionary ever
30:55
in the english language but as a person
30:57
he had these strange
30:59
tics so he had really ritualized
31:01
movement so for instance
31:03
when he was walking through a door
31:04
before he did so he had to do this weird
31:06
whirling and twisting motion
31:08
and then perform multiple ritualized
31:11
gesticulations
31:12
and then apparently according to someone
31:14
who knew him as soon as he'd finished he
31:16
would give a sudden
31:16
spring and make such an extensive stride
31:19
over the threshold as if he were trying
31:20
to wager how far he could stride
31:23
and what he would do repeatedly he was
31:26
very
31:26
very sort of superstitious or some
31:28
people speculate now he had ocd or
31:30
something some people think he might
31:31
have had tourette's
31:32
some people think he had tourette's he
31:33
talked to himself a lot he used to
31:35
collect
31:36
orange peels did he yeah no one fully
31:38
knew why they think probably medicinal
31:40
purposes
31:41
there might have been a craze or an idea
31:43
that it could have
31:44
helped you in some sort but yeah we
31:46
don't really know but we do know he
31:47
collected orange appeals
31:48
it could just be this slightly obsessive
31:51
tendencies he had yeah
31:52
touching every lamppost as he walked on
31:54
fleet street lots of things like that
31:56
did he
31:57
yeah yeah i mean it's hard to know if he
31:59
just did that
32:00
once or twice and then you know or if he
32:02
collected an orange appeal once
32:04
or if he was europe's foremost orange
32:06
peel collector i mean
32:08
we just don't know i was reading his
32:10
dictionary
32:11
great i wasn't i was reading someone
32:13
who's read his dictionary it was an
32:14
article by them but
32:15
um the there's quite a few fun
32:18
definitions in there
32:19
that i i never appreciated um so
32:23
for example sock uh was something put
32:26
between the shoe and the foot very sort
32:27
of basic description but then he would
32:29
say stuff like for lizard
32:30
he would describe it the definition
32:32
would be an animal resembling a serpent
32:34
with legs attached to it like just a
32:36
sort of that does that tells me what
32:38
elizabeth
32:39
exactly and my favorite one urinator
32:41
what do you think he
32:42
defined a urinator is a baseball player
32:47
very good grip yes
32:50
no it's um it was a diver someone who
32:53
searches underwater an
32:54
a diver was a urinator exactly
32:57
yeah so in this context uh this article
33:00
says urinator derives from
33:02
urinai a latin word to mean to dive
33:05
there are lots of words that didn't get
33:06
into the dictionary
33:07
in the history yeah so you know there's
33:08
a whole black adder episode about him
33:10
leaving out the word sausage
33:11
yes um so he only he
33:14
has 42 000 words in his dictionary which
33:17
is obviously massive and a huge labor of
33:18
love
33:19
but at the time the english language had
33:21
between 250 and 300 000 words
33:23
so he messed up he missed out loads of
33:25
biggies which were in big use like um
33:27
nemesis banknote zinc
33:30
euphemism yeah i can see the look on
33:33
your face as you go down this list and
33:35
you're thinking what's big use the right
33:37
phrase
33:38
where's the biggie here anus anus didn't
33:41
get it anus that's a big
33:43
biggie um zinc you would think he would
33:46
do because you'd think he'd be
33:47
struggling possessed
33:50
well there were x words in his
33:51
dictionary were there he just completely
33:53
missed the letter x
33:54
yeah and that was actually uh something
33:57
of an improvement because previous
33:58
english dictionaries missed w x and y
34:01
all together
34:02
yeah so he actually that he was
34:04
improving by w
34:06
yeah that is quite a big letter yeah
34:09
that's an enormous letter
34:10
yeah well um i and j were combined in
34:12
johnson's dictionary yeah they're all
34:13
muddled up but that's true in the old
34:15
english isn't it it was
34:16
more recent that jay became a letter so
34:19
maybe they spelt the w words with the u
34:21
or with the v yes yeah you mentioned
34:23
black outer as well
34:24
um so in the in the episode of black
34:27
adder there's a big joke so samuel
34:29
johnson's in the episode he's just
34:31
finished his dictionary and black adder
34:32
tries to pick out words that aren't in
34:34
there and the thing he picks out
34:35
famously in the episode is aardvark
34:37
um aardvark's not in there and it wasn't
34:39
in johnson's dictionary um but it's not
34:41
a word he missed out because it didn't
34:42
enter the language until the year after
34:44
he died
34:45
[Music]
34:46
just a few more words that are in that
34:48
book uh in the dictionary
34:50
um anatiferus
34:53
which means producing ducks nice okay
34:56
don't know what that means what that's
34:58
about he had a thing about ducks he
34:59
wrote a poem about
35:00
ducks or a short i think he did a very
35:03
easy word to rhyme with isn't it
35:05
it is and he had a filthy mind
35:08
um he also was one of the reasons one of
35:11
the reasons the dictionary was so
35:12
famous and such a trendsetter in the
35:14
dictionary world
35:16
was because he was the first person to
35:17
use citations to use quotations
35:19
as examples of where words could be used
35:22
and he used these
35:23
really imaginatively so for fart the
35:26
word fart
35:27
it was written as fart noun wind from
35:30
behind
35:30
and then with the poem by a guy called
35:32
john suckling who i hadn't heard of
35:35
which goes love is the fart of every
35:38
heart
35:38
it pains a man when tis kept close and
35:41
others dot offend when tis let loose
35:44
it's a great it's a lovely poem it's a
35:46
lovely poem that's good
35:47
cycling was great let's see i think he
35:49
was one of a group called the cavalier
35:50
poets who were
35:52
active around the time of the civil war
35:53
and the royalists obviously
35:55
but they all had great names like
35:56
suckling and lovelace and carey and they
35:58
had all these
35:59
very romantic names just one more thing
36:02
on samuel johnson yeah he was such
36:05
a nice guy so i had no idea that he
36:08
lived in this kind of commune that he
36:10
built up of people who were destitute
36:13
and suffering in life so he had all
36:15
these friends from various walks of
36:17
life he had he lived with a blind woman
36:20
called mrs williams who actually he
36:22
would take to various places
36:24
and who he looked after and he funded
36:26
her life he lived with someone called
36:27
robert
36:28
levette who was basically his best
36:30
friend in life
36:31
who was a guy who was a sort of a
36:35
claim to be a doctor but worked as a
36:36
waiter in paris and eavesdropped on
36:38
doctors conversations
36:40
and become kind of an apothecary and
36:41
didn't know what he was doing
36:43
he had francis barber who was sort of
36:46
like a son to him
36:47
really but he was a black boy and this
36:50
was in the mid 1700s
36:52
and johnson left all of his money and
36:53
his property to him and that was quite
36:55
controversial and the other people who
36:57
lived with him
36:57
thought you know how come you're
36:59
treating him like one of us like we're
37:01
on an equal level and johnson would say
37:03
if he ever needed anything johnson would
37:04
insist that he johnson would go out and
37:06
guess it
37:07
and would never let anyone tell barbara
37:09
to go out and get it
37:10
and yeah he sort of collected these
37:12
people who were treated badly by society
37:14
lived with them all funded all of their
37:16
lives apparently very rude to people
37:18
of his own social standing but anyone
37:20
who had suffered in life
37:22
he took them in very cool that's nice he
37:24
had a patron who
37:25
did not patronize him very well his
37:26
veteran gave him 10 pounds once and that
37:28
was it
37:29
wow i know i would say that is quite
37:31
patronizing it is
37:38
okay it is time for our final fact of
37:40
the show and that is my fact
37:42
my fact this week is that youtube was
37:44
created because one of its founders
37:46
couldn't find an online video of janet
37:49
jackson's breast
37:50
being exposed at the super bowl halftime
37:52
show
37:54
that's amazing so um what's i find
37:56
really interesting about youtube
37:58
is it's not that old no right
38:01
it's not maybe that's just me being old
38:03
but it's like there was quite a lot of
38:04
internet before youtube came along and
38:06
it's
38:06
amazing because it just seems like it
38:08
was ubiquitous your whole life yeah
38:10
2005 that's when we got youtube and
38:13
so the super bowl was in 2004 there was
38:15
this big moment
38:16
i don't know if you guys remember it but
38:18
yeah it was a it was a big moment it was
38:20
it lasted
38:21
a very quick uh the timing of it is so
38:24
tiny of how much uh time nipple spent on
38:27
screen but
38:27
it's 9 16 of a second i know that
38:30
through looking it up not through
38:32
creepily looking it up not on your vhs
38:34
pausing it
38:36
yeah but yeah so um uh it was one of the
38:39
co-founders who was called jawed
38:41
karim who was looking for this video
38:44
couldn't find it and thought there needs
38:45
to be a better way of it
38:46
now there was a second reason youtube
38:47
was created there are three creators in
38:49
total the other two were chad hurley and
38:51
steve
38:51
chen and they both were trying to upload
38:54
a video
38:54
when they were at a dinner party and
38:56
found that impossible to do as well
38:58
so the three of them got together and
38:59
said there has to be a better way about
39:00
this and that is how youtube came about
39:03
it's not the only effect that super bowl
39:04
moment had so
39:06
i think lots of people were surprised by
39:09
what they'd seen
39:10
and they wanted to find a way of
39:11
watching it again so uh tivo
39:14
subscriptions where you could pause and
39:15
rewind tv they jumped exponentially
39:18
and um you know the dvr where you can
39:21
record where you could record things
39:22
from tv on a hard drive into your home
39:24
that became a thing as well
39:25
so yeah there were other consequences
39:27
but youtube is probably the biggest by a
39:29
long way you know yeah yeah
39:30
the first video ever on youtube was um
39:33
by this guy
39:34
uh javik kareem and it was called me at
39:36
the zoo
39:37
it lasted 18 seconds and it's just him
39:40
in front of some elephants
39:42
saying the cool thing about these guys
39:45
is they have really
39:46
really really long
39:50
trunks does he see it like that pretty
39:53
much and then he goes
39:54
that's he doesn't do it in a bolton
39:55
accent in his american accent and then
39:57
he goes
39:58
that's pretty much all there is to say
40:00
and if you think about the historical
40:02
things like
40:03
um the first things like come here
40:06
watson i need you or whatever
40:07
you know the first things that have ever
40:08
been said in various media and that was
40:10
the first thing that was ever said on
40:11
youtube
40:12
yeah and all it makes me think is he's
40:14
not a man after our hearts because that
40:15
is absolutely not all there is to say
40:17
about elephants
40:18
no no no
40:20
[Laughter]
40:22
um he's he has no social media though
40:25
like a lot of them so java karim has
40:26
no social media at all i don't think
40:28
except for his youtube
40:30
um sort of site where would you call it
40:32
when you have a youtube profile page his
40:34
channel
40:34
channel thank you youtube channel where
40:36
i think he's only ever posted that one
40:38
video
40:39
and i think he dangled the prospect of
40:41
another video in the last year or so and
40:43
people are very excited about that
40:45
giraffes they have really
40:48
really really long
40:52
tongues ah you didn't think i was gonna
40:54
say that did you
40:56
but yeah um actually he did return to
40:59
the
41:00
comments page of that video a while ago
41:02
to make a big point as well because
41:04
he he's one of the three owners that
41:06
kind of stepped back from it no one
41:07
really knew that he was part of the
41:09
ownership of it until it was sold
41:11
and then it suddenly emerged that this
41:12
guy was getting a huge cut of it um
41:14
people obviously knew it but they
41:16
weren't the zuckerberg names that were
41:18
associated with it i
41:19
chen and hurley i don't actually know
41:21
that well either but
41:22
people did recognize them as the
41:24
creators and it was the fact that they
41:26
tried to change the comments on youtube
41:28
to the uh to be that you had to have a
41:31
google account in order to do it a
41:33
google cloud
41:33
a google plus account you could only
41:35
comment then and he didn't have one
41:37
so he left a comment under his first
41:39
video the first ever video
41:40
published on youtube to say what the
41:42
is this i don't have
41:44
use the f word i mean considering they
41:47
bought you
41:48
google bought youtube off them for 1.65
41:50
billion dollars
41:51
and he made something like 67 million
41:53
off yeah it feels like it's the least he
41:55
can do
41:55
let them do that it's amazing that was
41:57
about it was about
41:59
20 months from the first video being
42:01
uploaded to being sold for
42:03
one and a half billion dollars it was
42:04
huge and initially there was so little
42:06
on there
42:07
that you couldn't pick what videos you
42:09
wanted to watch it just played them
42:11
automatically to you
42:13
so like because let's say there's a
42:15
hundred videos you just had to cycle
42:17
through the hunt yeah basically
42:18
and there were so few on there that he
42:20
kareem put up lots of videos which he'd
42:21
taken of 747s taking off and landing
42:24
because there was just nothing on the
42:26
site there were so few videos there they
42:27
posted adverts on craigslist in la and
42:30
las vegas
42:31
offering women 20 to put videos of
42:33
themselves on the website
42:35
partly because they thought it would be
42:36
a dating website they did so it was
42:37
meant to be
42:38
a sort of follow-on from hot or not.com
42:41
which i can't believe is that old this
42:43
is the following from that but do you
42:44
remember that site
42:45
i don't remember that no oh wow not is
42:48
the answer
42:50
so hot or not.com was basically where
42:51
you could upload photos of people and
42:53
then other people could rate how hot or
42:55
not they were
42:56
it was not very woke and neither was the
42:58
idea that conceived youtube so that was
43:00
when they first came up with the idea of
43:01
youtube was when they thought
43:03
well let's make a video version of this
43:05
because hot or not was
43:06
revolutionary in a way we had no idea
43:08
about at the time but i think it was
43:10
basically the first instance that anyone
43:12
could upload their own content and share
43:14
and write each other's content isn't it
43:15
amazing that we had
43:16
facebook initially started with
43:18
zuckerberg doing the thing where it
43:19
compared
43:20
um female university students face mash
43:23
it started out as i think that was
43:25
partly inspired by hot or not as well
43:27
right so hot or not sport helped to
43:29
spawn these two
43:30
huge things yeah but then do you
43:32
remember ages ago in the podcast we
43:33
did the fact that imdb was set up
43:35
originally to log
43:37
actresses with beautiful eyes so all of
43:39
these big things that we have are
43:40
actually these
43:44
when they put up the advert on
43:45
craigslist asking women to put up videos
43:46
of themselves for twenty dollars each
43:48
not a single woman replied
43:50
and it was it was not hugely successful
43:52
at first just because
43:54
there was so little on there and it only
43:55
got big they went to a silicon valley
43:57
party and they met a former paypal
43:59
executive
44:00
because the other two founders used to
44:01
work for paypal and
44:03
he said this sounds interesting tell me
44:04
more about it so they went to the
44:06
bedroom of the host of this party
44:08
they turned on his pc and they watched
44:11
every single video on youtube which at
44:12
the time took half an hour
44:16
how long do you think that would take
44:17
now it would probably be
44:19
like the end of the solar system right i
44:21
think it's something like they upload
44:23
a hundred hours of footage people upload
44:25
100 hours footage every minute
44:28
yeah so i'm really so actually it would
44:29
go on for forever forever yeah
44:32
it's definitely yeah oh wow that would
44:34
have been a very different part
44:37
i was reading um they did a list of
44:38
which countries watch
44:40
youtube most per day okay um and i'm so
44:43
annoyed myself i didn't
44:44
get a time stamp on this so i can't tell
44:46
you what year this was um but i assume
44:48
it must be recent at least since 2005.
44:50
sure um what country do you think came
44:52
at the top of the list
44:54
uh is it absolute hours or is it per
44:56
person 90 million daily views is what
44:58
the
44:59
okay so i would say like india or
45:03
yes i china say it maybe big country
45:06
lots of people
45:07
saudi arabia whoa yeah came at the top
45:11
of the list
45:11
wow because uh it's said there are so
45:14
many restrictions on
45:15
other websites there they don't get
45:16
facebook twitter right
45:18
this is their place for entertainment
45:20
this is where they go
45:21
wow well it is the third biggest channel
45:23
in the uk
45:24
as in you've got bbc one itv and then
45:27
the next biggest one is youtube and the
45:28
next biggest one is netflix
45:30
and then you've got channel 4 and
45:32
channel 5 and bbc2 and all that kind of
45:34
thing
45:34
really yeah so um the average
45:38
the british the average british adult
45:40
watches 34 minutes of youtube a day
45:42
compared to
45:43
37 minutes of itv and 48 minutes of bbc
45:46
one
45:47
and i reckon if you went to under 30s
45:50
then it might be number one or number
45:52
two yeah number three
45:53
yeah have you guys heard of petite tube
45:56
no
45:57
no can you guess what it is okay is it
45:59
not a creepy thing
46:00
it's um a small version of youtube
46:02
because it's petty testing yeah it's
46:04
kind of
46:05
is it a youtube just for philip pettit
46:07
the guy who climbs
46:09
across go backwards with you so it's
46:12
is it only really really so it's videos
46:15
of really small things like thimbles
46:16
that's really it's like thimbles nibbles
46:19
are small that's the first smell they go
46:20
one of those giant symbols there these
46:21
days no it's okay over a third of
46:23
youtube videos have fewer than 10 views
46:25
in total right so there is a website
46:27
called petitcube which only links onto
46:29
videos which have had
46:30
no views at all and i i and you can
46:33
click and refresh and there are quite a
46:34
few
46:35
really nice ideas most of them are just
46:38
clips of
46:39
like family birthday parties or somebody
46:40
filming their kid for 10 seconds but
46:42
though you know how to pronounce
46:44
indelicate
46:45
um i clicked on there's a clip of a pony
46:48
eating grass for 10 seconds
46:49
these things will no longer be on that
46:51
site right now because you've watched it
46:52
i think they get taken off although a
46:54
couple of them had two or three views so
46:56
i
46:56
i thought i might have been played but
46:59
they
46:59
are i mean it's quite it's quite sweet
47:01
and quite weird but
47:03
also they are very very boring yeah
47:05
unsurprisingly
47:06
you know how youtube has a lot of um
47:08
meme stars
47:10
you know internet meme stars yeah so
47:12
let's say one that died this year grumpy
47:14
cat yeah for example
47:15
um keyboard cat was a big youtube star
47:18
we all know keyboard cat it's quite a
47:20
big thing the paws are going up and down
47:22
on a keyboard as if they're playing it
47:24
yeah there's music in the background it
47:25
looks like it's the one with the stiff
47:27
limbs yeah yeah
47:27
this is playing a piano but it's not
47:29
really playing the piano yeah but
47:31
keyboard cat
47:32
yes is dead what yes he died or she died
47:36
in 1987 no 18 years before
47:40
youtube was invented what no plot twist
47:43
even i'm amazed by this and i only just
47:45
heard of keyboard this is like this is
47:47
like the sixth sense
47:48
of cat videos that you mean amazing yeah
47:51
so how has this cat appeared on youtube
47:54
the video was taken in 1984
47:55
the year i was born and it was uploaded
47:58
into in 2007.
48:00
so it's like basically in 10 years time
48:02
if they invent a new kind of medium
48:04
where there's holograms that appear on
48:07
tables and entertain you
48:08
and then dan is the most famous hologram
48:11
entertainer because they use
48:12
some of the videos that you've done and
48:14
you become massively famous but you're
48:16
well actually when is dan dyer
48:21
[Laughter]
48:30
i think you'll admit that similarly got
48:32
out of control james from the start it
48:33

00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden
00:21
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:23
here with andrew hunter murray anna
00:25
chazinski and
00:26
james harkin and once again we have
00:28
gathered around the microphones with our
00:29
four
00:30
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:32
and in no particular order
00:33
here we go starting with you andy
00:36
my fact is that the first ever ball pit
00:39
was inspired by a jar of pickled onions
00:43
yeah amazing there's a guy who had a
00:45
massive jar of pickled onions and his
00:46
son fell into it one day and while they
00:48
were fishing him out they noticed oh
00:49
he's having a great time
00:51
so um no it's not that it's a guy called
00:54
eric mcmillan
00:55
who invented it it was called a ball
00:57
crawl back in the good old days
00:59
and he he was the subject of a
01:02
guardian long read recently you know
01:04
they did these great long essays and
01:05
it's all about playgrounds and how
01:07
playgrounds were developed and you know
01:09
the original playgrounds and
01:10
who first thought of doing all this
01:12
weird stuff for children to play in
01:13
because
01:14
that you know had to be invented and he
01:16
was this kind of visionary who
01:18
invented all these different methods of
01:20
playing and one of the things he was
01:21
working on was
01:22
a place called sea world's captain kids
01:25
in san diego in 1976
01:27
and he and his colleague were looking at
01:29
a jar of pickled ideas and they thought
01:30
i think that could work but he so he's
01:32
seen as the father of soft play
01:35
because this wasn't the only thing that
01:36
he created soft play
01:38
i go to a lot these days with my son and
01:40
they're amazing gymnasiums of
01:42
of balls and and uh
01:46
we all go to those gymnasiums
01:49
in soho i don't know
01:54
he yeah he invented so many things so
01:55
you know if you go into if you see
01:57
kids playing in a sort of big soft play
01:59
but there's the hanging boxing bags
02:01
wait sorry are they the things that you
02:02
punch like
02:04
exactly are you taking your son to a gym
02:06
sounds
02:20
yeah so you spend a lot of time in soft
02:22
clay do soft players have
02:23
punching bags for children no they're
02:25
hanging and you've got to go through
02:26
them
02:26
you navigate through like a forest of
02:28
public exactly a forest of punching bags
02:30
yeah they recreate the natural world
02:32
don't you
02:33
onions on the floor and punching bags in
02:36
the air
02:36
apparently the balls were originally
02:39
used for trapping pollutants inside
02:40
smokestacks
02:42
which i can't quite picture but i guess
02:43
if you had a layer of balls in a in a
02:45
chimney
02:46
then they would you know the smoke would
02:48
kind of filter through and cling to the
02:50
balls on its way upwards and so it would
02:51
take some of the pollutants out
02:52
what the balls that they use in kids
02:54
ball pits now
02:56
originally they originally sourced yeah
02:59
those were the people making those
03:00
plastic balls at the time i don't think
03:01
they
03:01
invented the plastic ball that's amazing
03:03
i got it interesting yeah
03:04
and this guy he um he came up with the
03:07
idea of having soft play because
03:09
he grew up without the soft play right
03:11
uh he grew up in north manchester
03:13
in the shadow of strangeway's prison and
03:16
used to play
03:17
in bombed out buildings and over like
03:19
burnt out cars and stuff like that
03:21
right wow although bombed out buildings
03:24
were the inspiration for the best
03:26
playgrounds in the world so the
03:27
adventure playground
03:29
the origin was the bombed out buildings
03:31
of world war ii in london
03:33
and kids used to play on them a lot and
03:35
people they were hanging about all over
03:36
the place and people were well we should
03:38
turn these into something a bit less
03:39
depressing
03:40
and so then they turn them into
03:41
adventure playgrounds and then adventure
03:43
playgrounds today are more like
03:45
places where they're like scrap yards
03:47
right is that right well you can
03:48
kind of build things there's running
03:50
machines
03:52
so there's a difference between like the
03:54
soft play version and a more hard play
03:56
version
03:57
especially in america and you get these
03:58
adventure playgrounds that have got like
04:00
loose tires blocks of wood ropes hammers
04:04
nails right i read one place that they
04:06
can even set fire to things the kids
04:09
wow i've never seen one of these i've
04:10
never seen them either but apparently
04:12
they're more safe than the soft play
04:14
things
04:15
yeah and the reason being that as soon
04:17
as you enter a soft play thing you go
04:18
straight for the highest tallest thing
04:20
and climb up it
04:21
um because like obviously you think
04:23
everything's safe but in these more
04:25
dodgy ones with lots of like rusty nails
04:27
and stuff like that
04:28
the children kind of build their own
04:30
play area and they start small and they
04:32
kill
04:32
kind of build up to it or they're just
04:34
quivering in fear in the corner
04:36
yeah i think i think that's a bit of a
04:38
innovative thing they're doing in
04:39
america specifically it's in new york
04:40
isn't it and it's called the yard
04:42
and it's the idea that they want to
04:44
encourage kids to play with what's
04:45
around them
04:46
um can we just briefly go back to ball
04:49
pits yes please
04:50
i mostly research ball pits so
04:53
um there have been studies done about
04:55
the hygiene
04:56
in ball pits because some people are
04:58
worried and there was a spate of stories
05:00
quite recently
05:02
one guy who worked for a firm called
05:04
stem protect which is a stem cell bank
05:06
so i don't know why he's
05:07
sticking his oar into this field of
05:09
human endeavor anyone's gonna have a
05:11
hobby mate
05:11
yeah so he was saying that 99.9 of ball
05:14
fit pits contain
05:16
uh levels of vomit and feces was how it
05:18
was reported
05:19
because obviously yeah it's absolutely
05:21
believable yeah
05:23
but i mean he the way he put it it
05:25
sounded really distressing he said
05:27
he's a parent and he said i've watched
05:28
some of these places with my
05:29
professional hat on and what i've
05:31
learned has truly disturbed me
05:33
you take your kids to these ball pit
05:35
play warehouses to have fun
05:36
but i've seen kids emerge with their
05:38
legs covered in poo and the worst thing
05:40
was
05:41
it wasn't even their own poo
05:44
how could he tell
05:47
he had his professional hat on everyone
05:50
knows as soon as you put your
05:51
professional hat on
05:53
it's poo spotting yeah swabbing the
05:55
feces there haven't actually been many
05:57
studies done
05:58
of this but there has been a study in
06:00
georgia where they swabbed balls
06:02
from six different ball pits and they
06:05
found out what was in there
06:06
and obviously they found loads of
06:08
bacteria because there are bacteria
06:09
everywhere you know that's the whole
06:10
point
06:11
so there are various ones like
06:12
meningitis and pneumonia and septicemia
06:14
and various skin infections yeah so some
06:16
of the bad ones were there oh some of
06:17
the bad ones sure
06:18
some of the ones that you might find in
06:19
feces for instance yeah
06:22
but fecal bacteria as we we've said
06:23
haven't we that they're not necessarily
06:25
bad
06:26
bacteria generally you know probably
06:28
lots of good guy bacteria in there as
06:30
well but even fecal bacteria
06:31
are not automatically if you can't
06:33
afford you can't afford some yakult just
06:35
lick a ball
06:38
there was one of the one of the dirtiest
06:40
ball pits that these guys found had an
06:41
average of 170
06:43
818 different bacteria on each ball
06:47
no idea if that's a lot i know because
06:49
it sounds like a lot it sounds like a
06:50
lot doesn't it
06:51
but then you if you would have to lick
06:52
the whole ball to get it
06:54
in like i don't know about you but i
06:56
never licked any of the balls when i was
06:58
in my ball pit years oh
07:05
that's true but i've never i've never
07:06
gone to one there's one in london the
07:08
ball pit bar in london
07:09
it started off as a one month only
07:11
pop-up in dulstan in 2016 but it was so
07:14
popular that they opened it full time
07:16
it's called bali ballerson and every
07:19
single ball in this place
07:20
is cleaned by a mechanical ball cleaner
07:22
that can clean 18 000 balls per hour
07:25
wow that machine is called the gobble
07:28
muffin
07:29
nice okay so they've made it
07:32
they've made the branding very mature
07:34
and added
07:36
it isn't have you seen how the machines
07:37
work no no i watched a video of a
07:39
professional ball cleaning machine
07:41
and was it the double muffin oh it
07:43
wasn't this was a slower one
07:45
um i believe so it but it's basically a
07:47
great big vacuum tube and you suck up
07:49
all the balls
07:50
and then they get pushed into this
07:51
sanitizing bath and then they get shoved
07:53
into a drying machine
07:54
and then they get blasted back out when
07:56
they're all dry and nice again it's as
07:57
you would expect
07:58
it but it feels like it would be fun to
08:02
get sucked into that machine doesn't it
08:04
right it does
08:05
it feels like quite a fun ride if there
08:06
was a giant ball pit
08:08
somewhere where you have to go in one of
08:09
the balls like a hamster
08:11
exactly cool yeah that's right why
08:12
didn't they just why don't they just put
08:14
a sign up saying don't in the
08:15
ballpark
08:17
well not everyone can read will they
08:19
read if this is the adult ball pit
08:22
i understand the cleaning for kids but
08:24
once you're a grown up i don't think
08:26
that the adults who go to
08:27
volleyballerson
08:28
are in the bullets well you
08:30
don't need to clean the balls
08:32
what's up with this new fangled ball
08:33
machine
08:36
don't try and put the gobble muffin out
08:37
of a job sorry
08:40
um so i was looking at the history of
08:42
playgrounds generally oh yeah and
08:43
actually there was this really cool
08:44
story a few years ago
08:46
where the oldest swing in the world was
08:48
found
08:49
cool and it was just in the bottom of
08:50
someone's garden so
08:52
this was a wick steed swing so the guy
08:55
who invented the swing was a guy called
08:56
charles wicksteed
08:58
it was in kettering in northamptonshire
09:00
and he made
09:01
this playground and came up with the
09:03
swing and then
09:04
they were looking for wicksteed's old
09:06
playground equipment and i found a
09:08
random family who lived nearby said oh
09:10
we've got this kind of old looking swing
09:11
at the bottom of our garden come and
09:12
take a look
09:13
and it was his prototype for all of that
09:15
and the kids were still using it
09:16
well this is not the original kids
09:20
they were very old
09:28
how cool is that that the creator of the
09:30
swing and of the ball pit
09:32
grew up when were born i guess two hours
09:34
drive from each other kettering and
09:36
sheffield um yeah it's just quite
09:38
amazing that that bit of the world
09:39
is what it's about maybe less than two
09:42
hours well i looked i looked at it on
09:43
google oh did it
09:44
yeah it's an hour 40 train ride straight
09:47
okay
09:48
i mean i find that astonishing we know
09:50
who invented the swing i don't think we
09:52
do
09:52
because i would have thought cavemen
09:53
were on swings and probably dinosaurs
09:55
i think he definitely invented them hang
09:58
on
09:59
i'm not even going to get into that he
10:01
invented the modern swing
10:02
he did like the modern olympics you know
10:05
yeah
10:06
and also i'm always you know to put on
10:08
my professional hat
10:09
um no my wok hat um it's when we say
10:13
it's a surprising they're two hours
10:14
apart from each other
10:15
it's not because i always think these
10:16
things are so west and biased and so
10:18
english-speaking country bias they
10:19
probably had swings in the netherlands
10:20
or swift they definitely had swings in
10:22
china probably seven
10:23
thousand years ago yes darwin made a
10:25
swing for instance
10:26
did he did like a ball pitch he didn't
10:28
make the ball pit but he's another
10:29
englishman of course another englishman
10:31
he did it
10:32
to swing for his kids and it sounds like
10:34
the coolest house ever so he was a super
10:36
fun dad
10:37
and he built himself with the help of a
10:39
local carpenter he recruited for the
10:40
purpose a slide instead of stairs
10:43
so in darwin's house he went down a
10:44
slide instead of the stairs and then he
10:45
had to
10:46
get up yeah you never could so you
10:49
started upstairs
10:50
and then you never saw the upstairs
10:52
again okay which was a shame because the
10:54
swing he erected was actually upstairs
10:55
on the upstairs corridor was it
10:57
yes just to go back to uh wick's deed
10:59
but there is a celebrity link to wake
11:00
steed
11:01
as a modern um quite famous person oh
11:04
you mean a descendant
11:05
no no no i mean a modern famous person
11:07
got their break at kettering
11:09
uh is it james a customer it's james
11:11
yeah he was the only person from
11:13
catherine i could think of he makes a
11:14
big thing out of being from kettering
11:15
and his very first job was at wicksteed
11:17
park
11:17
was it and they he's mentioned it
11:19
because i think he did a tv show a sort
11:21
of
11:21
like spoof mockumentary about his early
11:22
life and the manager of the park said
11:24
we are proud that he worked it and what
11:26
he has gone on to achieve but if he ever
11:28
wants to come back and help out serving
11:29
at one of our outlets he is more than
11:31
welcome
11:31
look showbiz is a difficult industry you
11:34
never know
11:35
don't burn your bridges i was reading
11:38
that
11:38
in germany hitler's bunker
11:42
right next to it where his body was
11:44
cremated now sits
11:46
a slide for children oh there is a
11:47
children's play area
11:49
right over the spot i think they were
11:50
thinking of getting rid of it because
11:51
they thought it was kind of
11:52
inappropriate it feels a bit weird yeah
11:54
i saw the picture of it i mean
11:55
they don't have a sign up or a plaque do
11:57
they no the slide
11:58
i think that's fine dan what's fine i
12:01
think it's fine that there's a
12:02
children's play area
12:03
it just looks a bit eerie when you know
12:04
what happened on that spot i mean don't
12:06
tell the kids
12:08
like what campaigning with a big board
12:11
sandwich board bubbling information this
12:14
is a nazi playground
12:18
[Applause]
12:18
[Music]
12:20
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:22
that is chozinski my fact this week is
12:24
that bananas are considered such bad
12:27
luck on fishing boats that many captains
12:29
ban anyone on board from wearing banana
12:32
boat sunscreen
12:33
or clothes made by the company fruit of
12:35
the loom
12:36
because their logo used to feature a
12:38
banana
12:41
you can't have anything that's been near
12:43
a banana anywhere near a fishing boat
12:45
that is so strange it's so weird and if
12:47
you go on sort of fisherman's
12:49
blogs and chat forums as we all do
12:52
yeah yeah yeah don't they all say they
12:54
all sort of exchange their tips
12:56
and so a lot of them avoid bananas avoid
12:58
bananas a lot of them say you know if
12:59
you see someone with fruit of the loom
13:01
underwear uh or fruit of the loom
13:03
clothes i think it's makeup clothes
13:04
isn't it why are you seeing their
13:05
underwear
13:06
well i reckon you would have to check
13:07
everyone's underwear wouldn't you you do
13:09
and then you cut the labels out at the
13:11
very least but maybe just rip all the
13:12
clothes off
13:13
if it's a sexy boat uh do we know or
13:17
oh anna why do you think they weren't
13:18
allowed bananas on there are
13:20
probably more theories about that than
13:21
anything
13:22
[Laughter]
13:24
strong claim so could be that i think
13:28
for the most likely is that bananas go
13:29
rotten
13:30
so fast so it dates back to like the
13:32
1700s they were considered
13:34
bad luck and that was a time when the
13:35
caribbean was exporting a lot of bananas
13:38
to
13:38
continental america and if you stop to
13:41
go fishing then the banana spoiled and
13:43
we should say the bad luck doesn't mean
13:45
someone will die usually it just means
13:47
that you're not going to catch many fish
13:48
that day
13:49
and so it's like banana spoiled they
13:50
also let off a really horrible smell
13:52
when they rotted and they make other
13:54
fruit rot around them but also there's a
13:56
theory that
13:58
they float when bodies don't so if a
14:01
ship sinks
14:02
they think all the sailors have turned
14:04
into bananas
14:07
it was a mystery for centuries anna can
14:10
i just pick you up bodies do float
14:13
bodies do flip no their bodies sink at
14:15
first don't they
14:16
um i'm picturing titanic
14:19
yeah yeah um right the movie or
14:22
the movie the movie do you remember at
14:24
the end with all the bananas
14:27
the door is covered in bananas like no
14:29
i'm sorry jack there's no room for you
14:30
on the door
14:33
but he does sink sorry to to use that as
14:36
a he does sync yeah but
14:38
it could be that he resurfaces later
14:40
anyway
14:42
the point is it used to be that when
14:43
people when boats sank at sea they were
14:45
carrying lots of bananas because they
14:46
were going to export them
14:47
then people would row out to try and
14:49
save everyone and there'd just be loads
14:51
of floating
14:52
bananas and so they attributed the cause
14:55
of the sinking to them fair enough some
14:56
more theories
14:57
it could be that um you get lots of
14:59
spiders or snakes or something in your
15:01
banana shipment
15:02
or it could be that crew members were
15:04
slipping on the banana peels
15:06
and so obviously that was really bad
15:08
luck yeah oh wow definitely that's
15:12
so do we have any more um unlucky things
15:15
yeah let's see
15:16
um redheads are supposed to be unlucky
15:18
um that is people with ginger hair
15:20
and um they some people say according to
15:23
one maritime museum
15:24
um if you meet one before boarding your
15:27
ship
15:27
the only way to mitigate the bad luck is
15:30
to speak to them before they can speak
15:31
to you
15:33
wow this sounds like a plot by redheads
15:36
to get people talking to them
15:39
i read that whistling is bad luck yeah
15:41
and then in the very same list
15:42
i read that whistling is good luck so
15:44
i'm not sure which one to believe
15:47
i would say perhaps don't believe
15:48
anything in that list
15:51
that's a good thought yeah but the
15:53
reason for it being bad luck supposedly
15:55
is that they use whistles
15:56
as commands to each other if you
15:57
couldn't kind of shout
15:59
you couldn't really tell them what to do
16:00
you might do one whistle for this two
16:01
whistles for no
16:02
and so if you were just whistling a
16:04
jaunty sea shanty
16:06
then it might confuse people who didn't
16:08
know whether to put their sales up or
16:09
sales down
16:10
uh albatrosses famously bad luck for
16:13
sailors
16:13
yes uh although not for captain cook um
16:16
because he was around
16:18
in the mid 18th century and they only
16:21
became bad luck
16:22
in the end of the 18th century when the
16:25
rhyme of the ancient mariner came out so
16:26
they weren't bad luck at
16:28
all before that came out it was all
16:30
because of that
16:31
and actually they could be good luck so
16:33
in 1881
16:34
there was a man who fell overboard from
16:36
his boat and there was an albatross in
16:38
the water
16:39
a dead albatross and he held on to it
16:41
and it kind of floated like a banana
16:43
no if you could imagine that and it kept
16:46
him up right for all that time until
16:47
someone came and collected him so
16:49
albatrosses can be good luck that's
16:50
amazing
16:52
any banana stuff oh yeah um well i've
16:56
been looking at banana shipping
16:58
okay um so i didn't know this but they
17:00
have a kind of
17:01
um policy because obviously they have to
17:03
be shipped when they're green they cut
17:04
off the
17:05
tree when they're green and then when
17:07
they get to the port they're going to
17:09
they're sent into these special
17:10
pressurized isolation rooms
17:12
and isolation rooms suggest there's only
17:15
one in each room but that can't be true
17:17
it's very expensive it's amazing that's
17:18
so cheap when you think about it um
17:20
sorry yeah they get they're going to
17:22
these kind of forced ripening centers
17:24
and their air is pumped into the boxes
17:26
of bananas so they ripen at a consistent
17:28
rate and also ethylene which is that
17:30
chemical they give off they get
17:32
fake ethylene too so they get them way
17:34
more ripe
17:35
but it all happens once they've arrived
17:37
and there are special banana scientists
17:39
who control these rooms
17:41
and i read a great article on packer.com
17:44
it's all about packaging and packing
17:47
and shipping and apparently these
17:49
specialists
17:50
they monitor the fruit like a mother hen
17:52
waiting for it to turn
17:54
and then when it's ready they say right
17:55
it's ready for asda and they basically
17:57
are trying to trick the bananas into
17:58
thinking that they're back in ecuador or
18:00
wherever they've come from that's
18:01
amazing yeah and the rooms are even
18:02
pressurized
18:03
to have the same like i guess air
18:05
pressure as in ecuador and sorry i
18:07
missed the detail is this all happening
18:08
on the boat or is this once at last
18:09
once they've arrived special rooms once
18:11
they've arrived yeah yeah cool
18:12
and how do they test the inside pot when
18:15
i've eaten a banana has it been unpeeled
18:16
and
18:18
they've covered the syringe has gone in
18:20
you sometimes you know sometimes you get
18:22
a hole in your banana
18:23
of course it's just a little bit an air
18:24
pocket yeah that's what it is
18:27
you can squeeze a banana to feel the
18:28
ripeness can't you yeah that's what i do
18:30
i imagine what happens is they take one
18:32
banana
18:32
test the inside of it throw that away
18:34
and sell all the other ones
18:35
that's you should be in charge of banana
18:37
information because that's much cleverer
18:39
i just had my banana scientist have
18:41
[Laughter]
18:43
um yeah that's so cool do you know mask
18:46
the shipping firm
18:47
yeah biggest shipping firm in the world
18:48
sure the biggest firm most people have
18:50
never heard of you know
18:51
but they have 270 000 refrigerated
18:54
shipping containers
18:55
which is the large i think the largest
18:56
fleet in the world perhaps by a long way
18:58
mask
18:59
this is huge vast majority so these are
19:01
the worlds these are refrigerators they
19:02
get called reefers
19:04
and they the bananas in there
19:06
effectively have wi-fi
19:07
because there are there is data being
19:10
taken all the time remote technology in
19:12
each of these refrigerated containers
19:14
and the company is tracking the power
19:16
status in case one of them stops being
19:18
refrigerated
19:19
and their temperature and their humidity
19:20
and it beams it up to a satellite
19:23
so if there is a malfunction in a
19:25
shipping container full of bananas in
19:26
the middle of the ocean
19:28
mess can find out about it and fix it
19:30
before it arrives and they've done that
19:32
hundreds of times
19:33
i mean i wouldn't say that that's a
19:34
banana having wifi
19:38
they're not starting the web are they
19:42
well i'm sorry for trying to make it
19:44
seem a little more interesting
19:48
of course there's a room with a bit of
19:51
basic technology
19:52
that most things have there
19:55
[Applause]
19:55
[Music]
19:56
okay it is time for fact number three
19:59
and that is my fact
20:00
my fact this week is that tim
20:02
berners-lee originally wanted to call
20:04
the world wide web
20:05
the information mine tim for short
20:10
yeah so i learned this fact in fact we
20:12
all learned this fact
20:13
when we were in geneva earlier this year
20:16
being taken on a tour of cern by a
20:18
really great guy called james gillies
20:20
who um who's a scientist who writes a
20:22
lot about cern
20:23
who works out there and that was one of
20:25
the things he told us while we were out
20:26
there looking
20:27
um he said there were a bunch of names
20:29
that tim berners-lee was actually
20:31
thinking he should call it one was mine
20:32
of information the information mine was
20:34
another one
20:35
the mesh was another one my mind of
20:37
information would have been
20:38
wha so that's also about himself yes
20:42
exactly yeah
20:43
and so the reason he didn't go for the
20:44
information mine is because
20:46
he thought it would be immodest or he
20:48
just
20:49
found a better name or yeah most sites
20:51
i've read say that
20:52
it's because it seemed too egotistical i
20:54
can't really see
20:55
any source that says i thought he said
20:57
he did a reddit yeah i didn't see it on
20:59
reddit when i read the answer to that
21:00
oh yeah i sort of i sort of read that as
21:02
someone below commenting on why he said
21:05
he didn't go for it um but maybe maybe i
21:07
missed his proper comment on that so did
21:09
do we know why why um no i i
21:12
personally i couldn't get to the bottom
21:14
of it do we know why he did go with
21:16
world wide web i guess it's close to
21:17
mesh isn't it
21:19
i read that mesh would have been too
21:20
similar to mess yeah they thought it
21:22
sounded a bit messy
21:23
which would be quite fitting not
21:25
necessarily in a derogatory way but it
21:27
is a huge mess isn't it there's a huge
21:28
mess of crap the world wide web
21:31
i think you should just start with that
21:33
but he did do this ama which was
21:35
uh very revealing of a lot of things so
21:36
there's been rumors for years and years
21:38
that era 404
21:40
came as a result of there being a room
21:41
called room 404 in the office that he
21:43
was working at and he said no that's
21:45
absolute nonsense
21:46
not true at all uh he was asked is that
21:48
one thing you never thought the internet
21:50
would be used for but has become one of
21:51
the main reasons that people do use it
21:53
and his one word answer was
21:54
kittens so he yeah he did um give some
21:58
quite fun answers in this thing
22:00
the kittens thing is weird because you
22:01
know the internet uh which is different
22:03
to the world wide web
22:05
was almost called the catternet was it
22:07
really
22:08
again how perfect would that have been
22:10
the catanet was
22:12
this was in 1974 and an internet pioneer
22:15
louis poussin wrote this paper where he
22:17
coined the term caternet
22:18
and he said it's going to be a network
22:20
of networks and he said i bet
22:22
the world will adopt this and he
22:23
essentially described the internet
22:25
said it should be called the catanet and
22:26
people used that for the internet um
22:28
until the 80s
22:29
and then they changed it to the internet
22:31
and we should probably go back to the
22:33
catanic given how it's evolved
22:35
or the pawninet but it's harder to say
22:38
so the web originally was not meant to
22:40
be read-only
22:42
so tim berners-lee when he first built
22:44
it and made it he wanted it to be
22:46
an interactive thing so everyone can
22:48
edit it
22:49
and the only reason it's read-only so
22:50
you know you've got a website you can't
22:51
just make changes to the website he
22:53
wanted it to be
22:54
he wanted it to be wikipedia basically
22:56
is what you mean
22:57
every site yeah yeah but more so than
23:00
that you know might go into a word
23:01
document like everyone's
23:02
wikipedia there's a process to go
23:04
through i guess
23:06
so like a google doc basically yeah a
23:08
shared google doc so you might go on to
23:09
bbc news
23:10
and you could just change boris
23:12
johnson's name to trevor mcdonald if you
23:14
wanted to
23:15
yeah i don't know why that's the first
23:17
thing that came into my head
23:18
so weird so many insults
23:22
you could have come up with you were
23:23
lost to the protest on the streets
23:25
i was thinking what's he going to go
23:26
with i bet it's going to be really rude
23:28
i mean it's really going to get him
23:29
i'm just thinking of what's the most
23:31
confusing thing out there
23:33
i'm not asking
23:39
i wonder what trevor mcdonald's up to i
23:40
haven't heard from him in years well
23:42
he's retired he's pretty elderly now
23:43
yeah but what's he doing where is he
23:45
yeah i appreciate that because he's out
23:46
negotiating with europa
23:50
um so why didn't um why didn't that
23:53
obviously insane idea come to fruition
23:56
it wasn't for any reasons like it being
23:58
obviously insane it was just that
24:00
um logistically practically it was too
24:02
difficult to get it done
24:04
the coding and the organization of it so
24:06
it was like oh sorry it's easier to make
24:07
it a read-only and
24:08
actually you could argue that's why the
24:10
internet's got into all the trouble that
24:11
it has because it means that
24:13
all these big companies have power over
24:16
it whereas we can't all interact
24:17
actively it could have been such a
24:18
different thing
24:19
it could have been the worldwide google
24:21
doc yeah so cool
24:23
and it's so weird that we're calling it
24:24
worldwide google doc
24:26
given that google is obviously one of
24:28
the things that's benefited from this
24:30
huge monopoly that companies have anyway
24:32
i was looking into the earliest
24:34
transaction digital transaction so
24:36
digital money for
24:37
for a product and there's quite a few
24:39
competing theories about
24:40
what it was no one's quite tracked it
24:42
down but one of the leading ones is that
24:44
in 1971 and 1972
24:46
the first transit so between that time
24:48
um a first transaction was made and it
24:50
was between
24:51
students at stanford university and mit
24:54
and they were selling weed
24:55
to each other cool so the first
24:57
transaction potentially was a drug deal
24:59
yeah sorry i just said cool like uh
25:01
wanting to be
25:02
cool groovy cool dude yeah yeah yeah i
25:06
know
25:06
yeah like an eight yeah got one in my
25:09
bag right now okay because there was a
25:11
lady earlier who'd ordered something by
25:12
telephone but that didn't count because
25:14
she paid in cash when it was delivered
25:15
to her door
25:16
um she predates that but this is the
25:18
first digital money transaction
25:20
michael i don't think it is it's not
25:22
cool as a cop i can confirm it's not
25:24
cool
25:25
i'm gonna put my cups hat on
25:30
two of you are wearing hats right now
25:32
dan and jones are wearing their hats
25:33
right now yeah that's a new thing but
25:35
what are different kinds of hats
25:37
we are from different eras
25:41
by judging by the hands we're not gonna
25:43
say we're not even gonna say what the
25:44
hats are we're just gonna
25:45
let you if you send a drawing in of the
25:47
hats you think dan and james are wearing
25:49
at the moment whoever gets closest will
25:51
win a small prize
25:52
[Laughter]
25:54
send them to andrew hunter murray
25:58
where did you even get a tricorn
26:00
[Laughter]
26:04
i don't really think that ku klux klans
26:06
is very appropriate
26:08
oh dear i hope you take that off before
26:10
you go to the soft play area
26:13
i found sort of a precursor to the world
26:16
wide web or in fact wikipedia which was
26:18
the mundanium which i can't believe
26:20
i've never read about but this was a
26:22
thing that was created in 1910
26:25
and it was after this initiative from
26:27
1895
26:28
of two belgian lawyers called paul
26:31
octory lafontaine
26:34
and they wanted to create what they
26:35
would call a world palace basically
26:37
all the world's knowledge and
26:38
information they wanted to catalogue it
26:40
and so they started doing this and it
26:42
was in the pale mondial so the palace of
26:44
the world i think in brussels
26:45
and they got up to 12 million index
26:48
cards so as a sort of side effect of
26:50
this he also invented
26:56
and it was sitting there in brussels for
26:58
decades and then
27:00
it's just in a big room and there's
27:02
loads of filing cabinets with index
27:04
cards which has all the information in
27:05
the world in yeah
27:07
wow it's impressive isn't it just two of
27:08
them probably had a few secretaries but
27:10
that's amazing that's incredible is it
27:12
still around is it still accessible
27:14
irritatingly and i know they always ruin
27:16
everything but in 1940
27:18
the nazis rocked up and the third reich
27:20
replaced it with a bunch of third reich
27:22
art
27:23
and some of it was left over but most of
27:25
it we don't know where it's gone
27:26
oh yeah i know that was bastards
27:31
it's always a response to the nazis
27:32
doing something isn't it
27:36
i'm gonna stop going to that child's
27:38
play area in berlin
27:43
on his birthday
27:57
[Applause]
27:57
[Music]
27:59
okay it is time for our final fact of
28:01
the show and that
28:02
is james okay my fact this week is that
28:04
the first known use of the word bellend
28:07
to refer to a person was for the entire
28:09
1992 west bromwich albion football team
28:14
i mean what a fact yeah what a bunch of
28:17
melons
28:19
so the word bell end um the first or one
28:22
of the first uses was
28:24
the flared end of a trumpet or other
28:26
wind instrument
28:27
uh opposite to the mouthpiece and that's
28:29
from 1826.
28:31
and then in 1819 it meant the enclosed
28:34
extension from the main
28:35
living space of a tent especially one
28:38
with a rounded shape
28:39
that was in 1819 did you say that was in
28:41
1919 sorry if i said 18
28:43
and then 1961 it became referring to the
28:46
penis
28:47
and then in 1992 someone was on a
28:50
usednet
28:51
news group on the 28th of september and
28:54
said
28:54
perhaps you are referring to that
28:56
infamous collection of bellends
28:58
known as wba wind bugger all
29:02
and they were insulting west brom but it
29:05
was a bit harsh because i looked at
29:06
their results
29:07
around this time and there had been nine
29:10
games that season and they'd won seven
29:12
drawn one and lost one and they got
29:13
promoted at the end of the season oh wow
29:15
what a bunch of bella interesting fact
29:18
the man who wrote that comment was tim
29:20
berners-lee
29:21
the whole reason he'd invented you go
29:26
it is a very uh it's a very british
29:29
insult isn't it i don't think it gets
29:30
used in america
29:31
no no no i shouldn't think so no it had
29:34
synonyms so when it became used for
29:37
the end of the penis in 1961 as you said
29:41
in the dictionary of slang and
29:43
unconventional english
29:44
then it was synonymous with the blunt
29:46
end and red end which have
29:47
fallen out of use but we could bring
29:49
back blunt end
29:51
well a bunch of blunt ends but you don't
29:53
have a sharp end at the other end of the
29:55
penis or maybe you should see someone
29:57
about that
29:58
i don't have two ends oh you really
30:01
should see something about that
30:03
there's only one other word in the
30:05
oxford english dictionary
30:07
whose first citation uh references west
30:09
bromwich albion football club
30:11
and that is the word marksman referring
30:13
to someone who scores lots of goals in a
30:15
football team
30:16
um it says west bromwich albion are
30:18
largely relying on james coxen the
30:20
marksman of chesterfield
30:23
there you go that is great who knew
30:25
there was such a hotbed
30:26
of neologisms it's true because i looked
30:29
at birmingham city football club
30:31
and aston villa football club uh who are
30:33
both similar
30:34
local teams and they don't have a single
30:36
one wow the worst problem is shakespeare
30:38
of our time uh one
30:42
one insult uh that is in the oxford
30:45
english dictionary
30:46
that has a fantastic uh reference or
30:49
citation of
30:50
quote is um dickweed and dickweed
30:53
is a word that got popularized in bill
30:56
and ted's excellent adventure oh yeah so
30:58
they use a quote from that movie in the
31:00
oxford english dictionary
31:01
and it's a word that i grew up with
31:02
because i i i love that movie and used
31:04
to be
31:05
used to call people a dickweed but i
31:06
didn't know what dickweed actually meant
31:07
and it's pubic hair
31:08
i just had i'd not put that connection
31:10
together i'd never thought do you think
31:12
it's play on the word duckweed
31:14
which is like a type of plant you get in
31:15
a pond is it okay
31:18
do you think it is i don't think he was
31:19
stating that it was and i doubt that
31:21
they'd thought about it to that extent
31:22
oh
31:23
i reckon it might be though because it's
31:24
a great it's not a common word but it's
31:26
reasonably common
31:27
oh you duckweed you dickweed yeah i
31:29
think that's plausible
31:31
i'm not saying it's totally impossible i
31:32
just think it's one of those unknowables
31:36
there'll never be a smoking gun on this
31:39
bell end is also a village
31:41
and that is coincidentally only 10 miles
31:44
from west bromwich albion's football
31:45
ground
31:46
and i think as far as i can tell that
31:49
west bromwich albion is the closest
31:51
english football team to the village of
31:53
bellend no way
31:55
that is insane it's close but i think it
31:58
is
31:58
ah that's much better than my two-hour
32:00
journey from kettering to
32:02
sheffield i wonder if the person who
32:05
knows
32:06
i wonder the person who wrote that
32:07
comment online in 1992
32:10
knows that they have are the first use
32:12
of a word recorded in a language
32:14
no and of course it's hard to imagine
32:17
that he made it up
32:18
right i think it feels like lots of
32:20
people are saying it but it's just the
32:21
first written down yeah
32:22
you know there weren't many it wasn't
32:24
mentioned in newspapers much
32:26
no but it might have been in private
32:27
correspondence maybe in churchill's
32:28
letters he writes to someone else
32:30
hillary's such a bellend i believe what
32:32
they did to the mundanium
32:34
um michael flatley fits into the bellows
32:38
story as well
32:39
i think we might have mentioned this in
32:40
the book of the the first ever book of
32:41
the year okay can you explain who he is
32:43
foreign
32:44
so sorry michael flatley the father of
32:47
river dance irish dance not the father
32:48
one of his descendants but
32:50
he's an irish dancer and performer and
32:52
you know the big thing where they line
32:53
up and they all dance
32:54
he's very famous for that they call him
32:56
lord of the dance and
32:58
he said in 20 late 2016 that he would
33:01
perform at donald trump's inauguration
33:03
and as a result of that someone
33:05
redirected the website colossalbend.com
33:08
so that when you type that in it went to
33:10
michael flatley's website
33:13
that's very good but it's amazing bell
33:15
was used to mean penis in 1593
33:18
yeah that's the first use of bell to
33:19
mean penis and that's from jonathan
33:21
green's dictionary of slang
33:22
and it refers to a young man wagging his
33:24
bauble and ringing his bell and it's
33:26
clearly a
33:27
knob gag um and yet it took so long
33:30
for us to really embrace it well for
33:32
just for bell to become better end and
33:34
then
33:34
for that to become a person yeah
33:35
personal thing that was in um a
33:38
what sounds like a great book called the
33:39
passionate maurice
33:41
[Laughter]
33:45
that sounds like someone's pen pal
33:48
i love the passion of maurice i'm
33:50
waggling
33:51
[Laughter]
34:02
um but he got pickpocketed in the story
34:04
as he was doing that so let this be a
34:05
lesson to all men
34:06
it was he fancied this woman in the
34:08
story i assumed the character the
34:10
passionate maurice yeah
34:11
and he said he was very pleased by her
34:14
and he showed this with whacking his
34:16
bauble and ringing his bell
34:17
while she picked his pocket and cut his
34:19
purse so if you will get your willy out
34:21
and start
34:22
publicly wanking you will be picked
34:26
is the moral of that story what a bold
34:28
time to pickpocket someone
34:30
it'd be king of the pickpocketers
34:34
i suppose if you've taken your trousers
34:35
off to waggle it then actually it is
34:36
easier to pickpocket someone isn't it
34:38
i don't think you'd fully i don't i
34:40
think it's a weird um
34:42
i think it's a weird fashion who fully
34:43
takes off their trousers folds them up
34:45
and puts them on a nearby seat on the
34:47
train
34:48
flashes are a weird bunch of shoulders
34:50
yeah i'm not saying they're not
34:52
just saying that would require a very
34:53
organized flashing mentality
34:56
um we're gonna have to wrap up shortly
34:58
yep just a couple of older bits of
35:00
insult this is from a classical
35:02
dictionary of the vulgar tongue which
35:04
was published in 1785
35:06
and you can get it online and some
35:08
really good ones i liken that are
35:10
um what to be in the knob
35:14
i don't think you need to tell us what
35:15
happened that could mean anything
35:18
couldn't it just means silly guys it
35:20
just means you're a silly
35:22
dick's in the nose it's a nob meaning
35:24
head yeah yes believe something so dicky
35:26
as in something's gone wrong
35:28
um you could also say that somebody is
35:30
captain queernaps
35:32
and that's if they are an ill-dressed or
35:34
shabby fellow
35:35
okay or if if you're this isn't really
35:37
an insult it's just if you're surprised
35:39
or confounded you are betwattled
35:45

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:21
this week coming to you live from
00:23
antwerp
00:28
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:30
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
00:32
hunter murray and james harkin and once
00:34
again we have gathered around the
00:36
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:38
from the last seven days and in no
00:40
particular order here we go starting
00:43
with you james okay my fact this week is
00:46
that pope leo the 10th had a pet
00:49
elephant
00:50
who was killed when doctors gave it a
00:52
gold enema
00:56
so there's quite a lot to unpack yeah
00:58
yeah
00:59
it's a fact that really has everything
01:01
um it has popes it has elephants it has
01:04
gold and it has bottoms
01:07
um so anyway so this was in 1514 um
01:11
there was a king manuel the first of
01:13
portugal he gave leo the 10th this white
01:16
elephant called hanno
01:17
and the pope like absolutely loved this
01:19
elephant he thought it was the greatest
01:21
thing in the world it almost made him
01:23
understand why people worshipped false
01:25
idols
01:27
as long as they were white elephants
01:29
called hanno
01:30
but unfortunately hanno didn't really
01:32
like it living in rome and he stopped
01:34
eating and it turned out he had very
01:35
severe constipation
01:37
and so leo called in all the best
01:39
doctors in the land and they decided to
01:41
use the normal thing that you would do
01:43
for a normal human who had constipation
01:46
fire some gold up the bum
01:48
and unfortunately that doesn't work well
01:50
with elephants
01:51
gold is it in like in bar form or
01:57
powder was it coins was it were they
01:59
slotting it in like uh
02:02
and then you pull the trunk and
02:03
hopefully you win
02:07
um no it was um so they would dilute it
02:11
with um water and presumably some rusty
02:14
yeah it's quite amazing to have an
02:15
elephant in rome at that time because
02:17
they didn't really have it that was that
02:18
was such a big thing i think the pope
02:20
was told about uh elephants and he
02:22
thought i'd love to get one and it was
02:23
arranged and there's stories about when
02:25
hannah actually arrived in rome um they
02:27
had a sort of procession for when he was
02:29
introduced to the pope and it says that
02:31
he was walking through the streets and
02:33
he had sort of clothing on him that made
02:36
him look very royal um he had a little
02:38
silver tower on his back and when um
02:40
apparently when he got to the pope he
02:42
bent down on one of his knees and bowed
02:45
his head low as if to say
02:48
hello sir you know to the to the pope
02:50
and that's in my head i've seen that
02:53
scene and it's an aladdin when they're
02:54
going down the street or
02:56
you're right well they never they never
02:58
show the tragic sequel to that scene in
03:00
aladdin do they
03:01
you haven't seen the uncut version
03:03
that's great yeah after he did that um
03:05
hanno lifted his head trumpeted three
03:08
times and then sucked some nearby water
03:10
into his trunk and blew it over the
03:12
adoring crowd
03:14
i mean he didn't do any of this stuff
03:15
let's face it there was a bald person
03:17
making up the reports at the time
03:19
but people were madly excited weren't
03:21
they even the the general population
03:24
another report said that people left a
03:26
tote like they trashed the town and they
03:28
left a wreckage in their wake just
03:30
trying to get a glimpse of this elephant
03:32
there was trampling of fields and crops
03:34
there was crashing through roofs and
03:36
there was tearing down walls to see the
03:38
elephant oh tearing down walls yeah i
03:40
don't even know how you'd do that
03:43
you could do it with an elephant if you
03:44
had one
03:45
i'm not sure hannah could do hannah was
03:47
quite a small elephant he was only about
03:48
four feet tall wasn't he quite sweet
03:51
no way yeah
03:53
yeah and then so he was anyway he was a
03:56
massive hit and then obviously it was
03:57
extremely sad that hanno died so king
03:59
manuel had to think of a sequel present
04:01
for the pope so two years later he sent
04:03
a rhino he thought you you think you've
04:06
seen something you ain't seen nothing
04:07
yet he sent a rhino tragically it
04:10
drowned on root oh i know but then no
04:13
don't worry it's got a kind of happy
04:14
ending because it washed ashore and then
04:16
the king had it stuffed and mounted and
04:19
sent to rome as a sort of is that a
04:21
happy ending yeah well i don't i don't
04:24
want you as my doctor when you tell me
04:26
one of my family members have passed
04:28
good news i also run a taxidermy shop
04:30
down the road
04:32
that's great so he presumably sent a
04:33
letter ahead saying i've got you a
04:36
lovely live rhino yeah and then a
04:38
follow-up saying
04:39
correction i've got you a dead stuffed
04:41
rhino
04:43
cool but he got slightly in trouble for
04:45
this the pope from some corners didn't
04:47
he because this 16th century was around
04:48
the time of the protestant protestantism
04:51
and the reformation and the elephant was
04:53
really the pinnacle of the pope's
04:56
profligate kind of extravagant lifestyle
04:58
and people thought the church was
05:00
wasting their money left right and
05:01
center and the following year i think
05:04
after
05:05
hannah died was the year that martin
05:06
luther came and nailed his uh and you
05:09
know his points to a door but he didn't
05:12
mention the elephant though did he he
05:13
didn't explicitly mention but i think
05:15
the elephant ran as a theme through a
05:16
lot of those protestant demands
05:19
and the reason that um that happened
05:21
well the main problem that luther had is
05:23
that they were selling indulgences right
05:26
so basically if you committed a crime
05:28
you could pay for them to let you off
05:31
and the reason that they started doing
05:33
that is because leo the 10th was
05:35
extremely profligate and was just
05:37
spending all of his money so within two
05:39
years of becoming pope he'd spent all of
05:41
the treasure amassed by the previous
05:43
pope
05:44
who was the extremely frugal julius ii
05:47
and he just spent it all he just was
05:49
like i'm the pope now i'm gonna do what
05:50
the i want
05:52
that's an actual quote
05:54
although like before he became a pope he
05:57
was known as giovanni the wise
06:00
yeah he and he had a brother called
06:02
giuliano the good who became his helper
06:05
and then there was one other brother
06:06
called pierro the fatuous
06:09
and he became the ruler of florence
06:12
that's a bit of a burn on florence isn't
06:14
it we'll send you the fatuous one
06:16
um
06:17
one of the things that leo might have
06:19
spent the money on i don't know if it
06:20
was exactly him who spent the money on
06:21
this was the vatican's secret erotic
06:23
bathroom
06:25
what have you heard of this keep talking
06:29
the vatican used to have a secret erotic
06:32
bathroom
06:33
how is it i mean all buttons can be
06:35
erotic i suppose if you want them to be
06:36
but how was this one specifically and
06:38
why how was it secret as well okay was
06:40
it like you would say to the pub can you
06:42
tell me where the bathroom is and he
06:43
went go up the stairs turn left no right
06:45
[Laughter]
06:47
well it's covered in erotic frescoes
06:50
there are extremely explicit uh drawings
06:53
all over the place um and um this was uh
06:56
commissioned by an official and it was
06:58
painted by raphael so this was actually
07:00
almost exactly this was the same time
07:01
because he was contemporary of leo the
07:03
10th and uh and it was rediscovered
07:05
recently a journalist kept writing to
07:07
the vatican saying i know it's there
07:09
somewhere and you know it is too and
07:11
you're going to let me come and see it
07:12
and eventually the vatican cave they
07:13
said yeah all right we'll let you let
07:15
you see it so it's still there it's
07:16
still there wow the frescoes are there
07:18
but it is not open to the public that is
07:20
so weird to think of the pope just going
07:22
in there for some quiet time isn't it
07:24
[Laughter]
07:26
which i'm sure he doesn't but
07:29
it's that's amazing though that there's
07:30
now artwork by rafael that we're not
07:32
going to get to see because they're a
07:34
bit worried like so raphael actually
07:37
with hanno the elephant um we're missing
07:39
a bit of art which is when hanno died
07:41
the pope was so sad that he wrote um a
07:43
big piece uh to commemorate him
07:45
commissioned raphael to do some
07:47
paintings of hanno and we lost that in
07:50
fires and and so you know things that
07:52
have happened over the years but that's
07:54
amazing unseen raphael arts sounds like
07:56
it's doodles rather than art from what
07:58
i've heard so far sounds like a lot of
08:00
doodles
08:01
just and balls all over the wall
08:05
um just on um popes and animals um
08:08
there's a lot of there's a lot of
08:10
stories that you can find about uh you
08:12
know a pope meeting an animal my
08:14
favorite one is pope fabian pope fabian
08:17
i've never read about before but he
08:18
became pope uh and he wasn't a contender
08:21
but while they were all trying to decide
08:23
who the next pope was and they had like
08:25
13 people that were front runners or
08:27
several of them a dove landed on his
08:29
head at a really odd moment and they
08:31
weren't well clearly that's the holy
08:33
spirit telling us that he's
08:35
and that's how he became the pope a bird
08:37
landed on his head do you think we could
08:39
do that for the next leader of the
08:41
united kingdom like
08:43
yes
08:44
i believe it
08:46
i mean how often does a dove land on
08:48
your head
08:49
it depends if you've got bird seeds
08:51
hidden in your hat
08:54
you're right of course popes have very
08:56
mixed relationships with um the
08:59
the issue of animals and religions so a
09:01
few years ago pope francis allegedly he
09:03
was quoted everywhere as being as saying
09:06
that all pets will go to heaven
09:09
all of them and he did not say this he
09:11
did not say it but it was reported
09:12
everywhere the vatican had to clarify no
09:14
your pet will not go to heaven whoa it's
09:17
quite a tricky thing to say is two
09:18
people isn't it yes so he didn't say
09:20
anything like that he didn't even say
09:22
not even some pets no he didn't even say
09:24
only good boys go to heaven
09:26
he was quoting um pope paul vi who had
09:30
died in 1978 and he said pope paul vi
09:33
had said that the idiot but they thought
09:36
that he'd said it himself personally
09:38
yeah we're gonna have to move on to our
09:40
next fact very soon oh okay well just uh
09:42
they are kind of cat lovers historically
09:44
popes aren't they so a lot of popes have
09:46
had cats as pets and i don't think
09:47
you're supposed to have pets in the
09:48
vatican but
09:50
for instance pope benedict so the pope
09:52
for this one wasn't he yes he was um he
09:56
had he actually had a biography of
09:59
himself written by a cat
10:02
stop it
10:03
cool yeah uh his pet cat chico who
10:07
stayed in the house that he'd hoped to
10:08
retire to before becoming pope hassell
10:11
um
10:12
his pet chico stayed in this house with
10:14
the house's caretakers and wrote the
10:15
life of pope benedict as told by a cat
10:19
and it was with some help so there was
10:22
uh
10:23
as a ghostwriter was there oh look a
10:25
ghostwriter's a strong word i think a
10:26
copy editor helped
10:29
leo the 12th um he gave people audiences
10:32
with his cat hidden in his lap
10:35
underneath all his vestments
10:37
and occasionally it would um give the
10:39
game away by just having the swishing
10:41
tail just below his kind of smile oh god
10:43
that would be very unsettling to see if
10:45
you didn't know about the cat yeah
10:48
if you saw that a bulge come up
10:49
underneath the actual someone's just
10:52
been in the sexy bathroom
10:55
the current pope pope francis has um
10:57
cows and those cows are used to paint
11:01
the uh the belvedere palace which houses
11:04
all the precious art from the vatican
11:05
museums what do you mean they're used to
11:07
painting because they're not good
11:08
painters cows usually no they're not
11:10
they're not part of the process they
11:11
just help with the materials so um the
11:13
milk of these cows is used to paint the
11:16
walls of the outside of the museum oh so
11:18
do you just grab an udder and sort of
11:20
angle it to where you need it to be
11:22
no it's a very old recipe that they
11:24
found where if you added cow's milk to
11:25
it it makes it a better thing to paint
11:27
with and so they don't do it out in
11:29
nostalgia they do it out of it's the
11:30
best way to paint their walls in the way
11:32
that they have them so yeah all the
11:34
walls out there no wonder the cats like
11:35
the vatican so much it's full of milk
11:41
[Applause]
11:45
okay we need to move on to fact number
11:48
two it is time for fact number two and
11:50
that is my fact my fact this week is
11:53
that
11:54
johnny cash who released the song walk
11:56
the line had a lesser-known musician
11:59
brother called tommycash
12:02
who released a song called i didn't walk
12:04
the line
12:05
[Laughter]
12:09
this is so tommy cash uh tommy cash is
12:12
still alive he's 79 years old and his
12:14
whole career he's been a country music
12:16
star just like his his brother but not
12:19
quite to the you haven't heard of him um
12:22
but and and he has other great songs
12:24
like uh one is called my brother johnny
12:26
cash um
12:28
and another one called my mother's other
12:30
son
12:31
oh
12:33
so he doesn't really play off the johnny
12:35
cash connection it sounds like at all no
12:37
he's he's a very actually i've listened
12:39
to some of his songs it's they're
12:40
genuinely really good and he has a lot
12:42
of songs which i think those ones are
12:44
done you know johnny cash has a very
12:45
good sense of humor these are done with
12:47
a sense of humor as well i think
12:49
as far as i can tell
12:51
johnny cash was an amazing guy yeah so
12:53
there's there's a story about him that
12:56
he was the first american
12:58
uh person to find out that stalin was
13:01
dead
13:01
yeah
13:02
really and it's a yeah it's a it's
13:04
really repeated everywhere so he worked
13:06
as a radio operator for the american air
13:08
force between uh 1950 and 1954 yeah and
13:12
started out in 53 yeah so um so
13:14
according to him he claimed he located
13:16
the signal because he was uh in west
13:18
germany at the time i think when uh a
13:21
soviet bomber was flying from moscow to
13:22
smallins and the news was being
13:23
transmitted internally in russia but it
13:25
hadn't made it outside yet yeah
13:28
i don't think he did i think he didn't
13:30
because another biography pointed out
13:32
that he didn't speak russian and it it
13:34
would have been in code and he wouldn't
13:36
have been able to decipher the code and
13:37
even if he had been able to decipher it
13:39
he didn't speak russian so
13:41
he was amazing that johnny cash he had
13:43
an incredible life he he was obviously
13:46
famous for singing in lots of prisons
13:47
but he also spent quite a lot of time in
13:49
prisons himself for doing bad stuff and
13:53
so one time there was one time which
13:55
sounded kind of sweet where he was
13:57
jailed and he only ever spent one night
13:59
in jail it was for stuff like once he
14:01
broke into some property to pick some
14:03
flowers
14:04
really hardcore stuff like that so he
14:06
spent one night in a small town jail and
14:09
the warden who was jailing him said my
14:11
wife's a big fan of yours and when i
14:13
went home last night and told her i had
14:14
johnny cash in my jail she cried all
14:16
night
14:18
well he did only spend one night in jail
14:20
but he did get in a lot of trouble
14:22
didn't he like um he smuggled drugs over
14:24
the border that was a big thing that he
14:25
got in trouble for there was one time
14:27
when he was driving into the countryside
14:30
while taking pills drinking whiskey and
14:32
swerving all over the road and then he
14:34
decided to set a fire
14:36
and set his car on fire and then set the
14:39
forest on fire
14:41
and when they caught him and they said
14:43
you know did you start this fire he said
14:45
oh no no my truck did and it's dead so
14:47
you can't question it
14:51
and then they said well what about these
14:53
condors we had 53 endangered condors
14:55
here and 49 of them have gone away he
14:57
said i don't care about your yellow
14:59
buzzards
15:03
he killed half that species yeah
15:06
there were only about uh
15:08
100 left at the time and this is then he
15:11
killed 49. and the species got down to
15:13
27 a few decades later which was
15:16
principally the fault of johnny cash
15:17
it's crazy
15:19
but the numbers have since recovered so
15:22
now johnny cash is dead they have
15:27
he actually had he had a really bad
15:29
relationship with birds so he was
15:31
addicted to painkillers and pills and
15:33
had serious problems with that and then
15:35
he quit them he claimed because he did
15:37
it for uh june his his the love of his
15:39
life
15:40
and then he fell back into his
15:41
painkiller addiction after being
15:42
attacked by an ostrich
15:44
so it was in the early 80s and he wrote
15:48
about this in his autobiography i think
15:49
and he said that he had this animal park
15:52
on his land where he had lots of exotic
15:54
animals and he had an ostrich a pair of
15:56
ostriches that he'd always got along
15:57
very well with and then the female died
16:00
and the male got kind of pissed off and
16:02
so johnny cash was walking through the
16:03
land one day and the male just went for
16:05
him and he johnny tried to swipe him
16:07
with a stick and the ostrich jumped in
16:09
the air and then came down at him with
16:11
his big claw and slit his stomach right
16:13
open
16:14
so he ended up breaking five ribs and he
16:16
said that the only thing that saved him
16:18
was he was wearing a really big belt so
16:20
the huge ostrich claw couldn't get slit
16:22
his stomach down beyond that belt so
16:24
then he went to hospital had to take
16:25
some painkillers and back on the drugs
16:28
there's more to that story than there is
16:29
i think johnny cash killed the female
16:31
ostrich and was going back for the mail
16:33
[Laughter]
16:34
and the male took vengeance
16:37
his drug taking was i mean it was insane
16:39
the amount that he was doing he always
16:41
tried to kick it never fully managed to
16:42
do it at one point when he was really
16:44
into the drugs he released an album
16:46
called bitter tears and bitter tears was
16:49
actually a very serious album it's sort
16:51
of uh sort of the aka of the is ballads
16:53
of the american indian and they were
16:55
protest songs about how native americans
16:57
were being treated at the time so um the
16:59
sleeve notes say that johnny cash sings
17:02
well these tales of the indians woe
17:04
johnny is justified in the stand he
17:06
takes as he is proud of his cherokee
17:08
blood
17:09
um so he's he's um johnny has um
17:12
cherokee and mohawk blood in his veins
17:14
um he sees he said he doesn't he he's in
17:18
no way native american
17:20
the drugs made him think he was native
17:22
american
17:23
he told playboy in an interview he said
17:25
uh the higher i got the more indian
17:26
blood i thought i had in me and so
17:29
the whole thing was just a drug trip wow
17:32
i wasn't really sure about him because
17:34
he's quite you know there are some good
17:35
when you read about it it's really
17:37
complicated isn't it like for instance
17:38
he once shot a crow but then spent the
17:41
next two days looking for a vet who
17:43
could heal it
17:44
okay so it's kind of built on both sides
17:46
but then i read one thing which really
17:47
pushed me over the edge apparently he
17:49
used to drive down golf courses picking
17:52
up the players bowls and throwing them
17:53
into the trees
17:55
and i'm sorry i could not trust a man
17:57
who does that
17:59
speaking of cars i mean this gives you
18:01
another sort of insight into his kind of
18:03
not empathetic side um there was a
18:06
friend of his um who was called farron
18:08
young um he was a he was a friend of
18:10
caches and um he was also a musical
18:12
contemporary but he died in 1996 and his
18:15
son said can i come to your garden and
18:18
spread his ashes because this is a place
18:20
that he loved to come so johnny said yes
18:22
johnny was out i think for the day came
18:24
back and clearly when the ashes were
18:25
being spread
18:27
some of them had caught in the wind so
18:29
johnny came back and over his windshield
18:31
of his car were the ashes of his former
18:34
friend and he just turned the windshield
18:36
wipers on
18:37
he wiped him off he wiped his existence
18:39
off it's what he would have wanted
18:42
that's true who knows what he asked for
18:44
um just on johnny cash and birds because
18:47
we were just talking about all that just
18:48
very quickly what we're talking about
18:51
he um he fell out with his record label
18:54
in the 80s colombia but they kind of
18:57
they had a deal so he had to release
18:59
some records and so he released a
19:01
deliberately awful song
19:03
called chicken in black
19:05
which was all about his brain being
19:07
transplanted into a chicken
19:10
it sounds amazing
19:12
and actually it was quite a success oh
19:15
really yeah yeah it's not terrible if
19:17
you listen to it i think it's nice he's
19:20
not very good at writing deliberately
19:21
bad songs is he not what about this one
19:23
that i've heard that i don't think he
19:24
wrote this but he definitely sung it
19:26
it's called i've been flushed from the
19:28
bathroom of your heart
19:31
[Music]
19:32
is that good
19:33
that's great
19:34
you know his my possibly my favorite
19:36
thing about johnny cash is his
19:38
daughter's name which is roseanne and
19:40
this is his daughter with his first wife
19:42
vivian and her daughter's called
19:44
roseanne because his name for vivian's
19:46
breasts were rose and anne
19:51
[Laughter]
19:52
is that a nice thing to carry around
19:54
with you as a daughter
19:55
who knows
19:57
we're gonna have to move on soon to our
19:59
next fact i can give you a few more
20:00
country song titles
20:03
just for the fun of it um drop kick me
20:06
jesus through the goal posts of life
20:09
that's a good one yeah um here's quite a
20:11
famous one you're the reason our kids
20:14
are ugly
20:16
wow
20:19
he went to sleep and the hogs at him now
20:21
claude's gone forever that was by
20:24
nathaniel nathan and we feed our babies
20:27
onions so we can find them in the dark
20:32
which is more a tip for life i think
20:34
it's a great tip i like it
20:37
um we need to move on to our next fact
20:39
it is time for fact number three and
20:41
that is andy my fact is that de beers
20:44
use a giant vacuum cleaner to get
20:47
diamonds from the bottom of the sea
20:50
wow this is so cool this fact was
20:52
actually sent to us by uh someone on
20:54
twitter at grapec81 thank you very much
20:57
um so this is an amazing thing diamonds
21:00
on land are running out uh most
21:02
diamond mines are going to run out in
21:03
about 2050 we think so now there are
21:06
these floating mines which bob around
21:08
off the coast of namibia a lot of them
21:12
and one of them is run by de beers and
21:14
it dredges up huge amounts of stuff from
21:16
the sea floor sifts it and then returns
21:18
the stuff to the seafloor but keeps the
21:20
diamonds and it's hugely profitable are
21:23
there lots of diamonds there there are
21:25
wow that's why they do it
21:29
yeah it makes sense yeah you think about
21:30
it
21:32
so
21:33
in 2016 mining companies got 600 million
21:35
dollars worth of diamonds from the
21:36
seabed so this is good but it is a bit
21:38
of a worry as well this method of
21:39
getting diamonds because it sucks up a
21:41
lot of the seabed it might disturb the
21:43
life living down there and they do know
21:45
that the vacuum cleaners they use are
21:48
big enough to suck up fish and octopuses
21:50
which go on this massive crazy ride
21:52
through the system
21:54
and then they do end up back in the
21:55
water at the end and these um these
21:57
diamonds are much uh better or it's it's
22:00
much more likely that you're going to
22:01
get a really good diamond right because
22:03
the water is always buffeting these
22:05
diamonds and so the the little rubbish
22:07
ones kind of get ground away and only
22:09
the really high quality ones are left
22:12
[Music]
22:14
that's why they do it that's why they're
22:16
good sound like a spokesperson for de
22:17
beers here
22:19
we are sponsored today
22:22
to be is a pretty extraordinary company
22:24
they
22:25
have controlled our view of diamonds for
22:28
like a hundred years it's mad so they
22:30
until like the late 19th century
22:32
diamonds were incredibly rare you
22:34
basically found them if you pick them up
22:35
on a few river beds in india you could
22:38
scavenge maybe a diamond if you're very
22:39
lucky or the jungle of brazil but then
22:41
in 1870 suddenly we found these well we
22:45
started mining in south africa and it
22:47
was full of diamonds and the market was
22:49
suddenly deluged and de beers who was
22:52
the british company who was running the
22:54
market at that time thought well we
22:56
can't let the market be deluged because
22:57
otherwise we'll devalue the price of
22:59
diamonds and so they've basically been
23:01
controlling the price they're not even
23:03
that rare they're not so lots lots more
23:05
things emeralds rubies sapphires they're
23:07
all much more rare than diamonds gold if
23:09
you so if you took all the gold ever
23:11
mined in the world it would pull it up
23:14
an elephant
23:15
[Laughter]
23:16
it would die
23:17
[Laughter]
23:19
no it would be a cube with size of 20
23:21
meters whereas diamonds are fine but de
23:23
beers has just had this monopoly on them
23:25
forever yeah and they created that idea
23:27
as well of the thing of how much you
23:29
need to spend on an engagement ring
23:31
creating the idea of a diamond being a
23:32
part of an engagement ring so it's
23:34
something like like a month's salary
23:36
month's salary i remember someone told
23:38
me that when i got engaged to my well i
23:40
was about to propose to my wife that
23:42
that was the case terrifying things well
23:44
no what you do is you just resign your
23:45
job
23:46
yeah propose using an extremely small
23:48
ring yeah and then explain the situation
23:51
to your now furious fiancee
23:54
i'm your furious boss obviously when you
23:56
ask for your jump back
23:58
the other thing is if they just decided
23:59
that they could have pitched it as high
24:01
as they wanted really couldn't they yeah
24:03
but if they said you have to spend 20
24:04
years of your salary on a ring
24:06
there's got to pitch it but you can now
24:08
you can now make diamonds obviously
24:10
artificial diamonds are much more of a
24:11
thing and there is a dutch designer who
24:13
makes diamonds out of smog
24:16
this is so cool he's got a tower which
24:18
sucks in 30 000 cubic meters of polluted
24:21
air every hour of the day and it cleans
24:24
it it releases the clean air so it's
24:25
cleaning the air a bit and then it uh it
24:28
collects a lot of carbon and that carbon
24:30
is crushed down into a diamond it's not
24:32
very romantic though is it
24:34
uh
24:35
no it's not
24:37
and these synthetic diamonds is a real
24:40
problem for the beers really because if
24:42
you can start making them in a lab
24:44
which are pretty much almost identical
24:46
to the ones that you get from the ground
24:48
um eventually it's going to be much
24:50
cheaper to do it and whatever so they've
24:52
been really going against this for a
24:54
long time de beers but very recently
24:56
they've started their own brand called
24:57
lightbox which offers synthetic diamonds
25:00
okay but what they're doing is they're
25:03
calling it affordable fashion jewelry
25:05
that may not be forever
25:07
and
25:08
there's a suggestion and i'm not saying
25:10
this because of course we are sponsored
25:12
but no one
25:13
but there's a suggestion that they're
25:14
making deliberately trashy looking
25:16
jewellery with these synthetic things in
25:19
so that there's a big difference between
25:20
those ones and the so-called real ones
25:22
oh really yeah oh that's so sneaky
25:26
but most diamonds are synthetic so i
25:29
think that only 1.4 of today's diamonds
25:32
are naturally mined but synthetic
25:34
diamonds have never been good quality
25:36
enough until very recently to be used as
25:37
jewelry but their diamonds are really
25:39
useful in industry so for sort of
25:41
cutting and polishing because they're so
25:43
hard and so those ones tend to be
25:45
generated in the lab
25:47
so yeah most diamonds don't come out of
25:49
the ground
25:51
swallowing diamonds
25:52
what
25:53
sure let's do it
25:54
in 2013
25:56
uh there was a charity event where
25:59
everyone present got a glass of
26:01
champagne and all the glasses uh i think
26:04
this is what happened um they had a
26:06
cubic zirconia in the glass okay and one
26:09
glass at the whole event had a diamond
26:11
in it in the glass which a local jeweler
26:13
had donated so the idea is at the end of
26:15
the evening everyone checks their fluid
26:16
and someone's got the genuine diamond
26:18
and they get to keep that diamond cool
26:20
unfortunately
26:23
i think you've given away from your
26:24
headline of what happens in the story
26:27
unfortunately the diamond was followed
26:28
by an 80 year old lady who had failed to
26:31
notice the actual diamond at the bottom
26:34
of her float and her doctor then found
26:36
it during a colonoscopy
26:39
but she
26:40
the story has a happy ending
26:42
which is that she got she took it to a
26:44
jeweler's shop um in a biohazard bag and
26:49
and it got cleaned up but now she's got
26:51
the diamonds fair enough obviously
26:52
you've got to keep it if it's been
26:54
dragged out of your wrecks
26:56
i think you deserve that diamond
27:00
i've got a really good diamond story
27:02
that i like is that donald trump once
27:05
gave charlie sheen a diamond this is a
27:07
story read a while back so he actually
27:09
gave him cufflinks that he said were
27:11
made of platinum and diamond and then so
27:13
charlie sheen took these very grateful
27:15
blah blah blah had them valued out of
27:17
curiosity six months later and he said
27:20
that the evaluator literally recoiled
27:22
from the item and was like no this is
27:24
the cheapest thing i've ever seen this
27:26
is made of cheap pewter this is which
27:28
rectum did you get this from
27:31
and then he said this and it turns out
27:33
that like two two or three other people
27:34
i think have had exactly the same thing
27:36
with trump oh my god that's amazing my
27:39
in the course of researching this my
27:40
favorite diamond story that i read was
27:42
an attempt to bribe nestle for 25
27:46
million um
27:48
uh dollars i think it was of um uh worth
27:51
of diamonds so the idea was they were
27:54
gonna this guy was gonna poison um or
27:56
threaten to poison nestle stuff he said
27:58
i won't do it if you give me all these
28:00
diamonds so nestle had to work out how
28:02
do we get out of this and the police
28:04
were brought in and he said the way he
28:05
wanted the diamonds delivered to him was
28:07
he had homing pigeons they were to be
28:09
attached to that and then it was to be
28:11
inserted into the homing fidgets
28:15
who is this guy he was from frankfurt so
28:17
it was um it was dm 25 million not uh
28:20
not dollars um but deutsche yeah
28:22
deutsche marks um but uh yeah so he got
28:24
caught and the reason he got caught
28:26
because obviously the homing pigeons
28:27
were flying to exactly where he was
28:30
so they just followed the birds and
28:32
there he was waiting it's the opposite
28:34
of the perfect crime yeah
28:37
i looked into some vacuum cleaners oh
28:39
yeah okay a little bit of vacuum cleaner
28:41
stuff so i found a vacuum cleaner museum
28:43
in the uk
28:45
and it sounds great i really want to go
28:46
it's run by a guy called james brown but
28:49
i think a different james brown
28:52
and he's amazing he's just really
28:54
passionate about vacuum cleaners so he
28:57
the museum is in nottingham if you're
28:58
ever in the uk and want to go he said
29:00
that age eight he was already a vacuum
29:02
cleaner fanatic and his mom had one and
29:04
he really wanted one and he spotted a
29:07
red goblin 800 lying on a rubbish dump i
29:10
don't know what that is but maybe they
29:11
were famous back then a rubbish dump is
29:13
a kind of place where people leave
29:16
it doesn't matter go on um so he found
29:18
he found this red goblin he took it home
29:20
wiped the muck off plugged it in and he
29:22
says that was one of the most fantastic
29:24
moments of my life
29:26
and his mom apparently was hoping he'd
29:28
get out of the vacuum cleaner phase and
29:30
he didn't and by his teens he had about
29:32
30 vacuum cleaners and he said you could
29:35
say vacuum cleaners took over my life
29:38
one of his and so he set up this museum
29:40
one of his party tricks which i would
29:42
love to try
29:42
[Laughter]
29:44
i don't think we need to hear about this
29:46
it's not that he just puts on a
29:48
blindfold and he waits puts on a
29:50
blindfold
29:52
and you you turn on your vacuum cleaner
29:54
if he's in your house and he can
29:55
identify the exact make and model of the
29:57
vacuum cleaner
29:59
by the sound alone yeah just by the
30:00
sound yeah that's amazing
30:03
i actually read about him in the
30:04
telegraph and this is such a weird
30:05
sentence from the telegraph thing about
30:07
him it just said
30:09
james comma who was not married comma
30:12
sees the real value of his collection as
30:14
and then it's completely unrelated to
30:15
the fact that he's not married
30:16
[Laughter]
30:19
they feel like that needs emphasizing
30:23
[Applause]
30:27
okay it is time for our final fact of
30:29
the show and that is cecinski my fact
30:32
this week is that if you want to buy a
30:34
phone app in north korea you have to go
30:37
to a physical app store
30:40
how on earth does it work well it's
30:43
quite complex actually so basically you
30:45
can get kind of the specific phones that
30:47
you're allowed to get the state allows
30:48
you to get in north korea and they come
30:50
with just like a card game and a photo
30:53
app and that's it and if you want
30:55
anything else you go to these shops or
30:56
these kiosks and they're often like sort
30:59
of appended to a supermarket or
31:00
something and you go in and they're
31:02
covered the walls are covered with
31:04
posters of different apps that you can
31:06
ask for so you browse the posters and
31:08
you see what you like the look of and
31:10
then you go up to the counter and you
31:12
say i want that or if they don't have a
31:14
poster you describe it to the assistant
31:16
and they say oh it sounds like you know
31:18
google maps might work for you
31:21
yeah no they don't allow that certainly
31:23
um but is this ridiculously long process
31:26
so um you put your so you say the app
31:28
you want you put the app name on this
31:30
little slip and then it's sent to the
31:31
cashier and then you have to go to the
31:33
cashier and pay and then it's sent back
31:35
to the app selector who then has to plug
31:38
their computer into a big internet
31:41
system that only they have access to and
31:43
it's via bluetooth connection because
31:44
you know it's not it's not by a proper
31:45
internet connection and then they have
31:47
to download your app it takes about 10
31:49
minutes per app so to buy an app you
31:50
have to walk to the app store spend 10
31:52
minutes in there on this convoluted
31:53
process go away and then you've got
31:55
snake
31:57
but there's even one further
31:58
complication they download it onto your
31:59
phone but then you need to buy an access
32:01
code to set the thing off so then that
32:03
takes a further 10 minutes so to get a
32:05
single app sometimes can take an hour
32:07
because you have to wait for the access
32:08
codes to come through and so on and yes
32:11
it's incredible big system but it was
32:13
quite positive the article i read
32:15
although it was by a guy who works for a
32:17
tourist agency in north korea
32:20
but he was like we've got access to all
32:22
sorts of apps
32:23
they do they've got they've got an
32:25
interesting intimate internet system
32:26
they're intranet is called
32:30
and that means light apparently or that
32:32
sort of a loose transit translation and
32:35
it's actually fewer than 200 websites
32:37
that are all run by the government but
32:39
even so
32:40
it's something um some apps some stuff
32:43
on apps oh yeah i read an article about
32:45
the worst apps in history and i think i
32:47
can probably agree with these so um
32:49
there's one called hang time and it's a
32:51
game and what you do um you throw your
32:54
iphone in the air
32:56
and then you catch it and the longer
32:58
it's in the air the more points you get
33:01
so it's
33:02
encouraging you to throw it higher and
33:04
higher and higher
33:06
um so that's 99 cents for that game
33:15
there's another one called pocket heat
33:17
which is 1.99
33:19
and what this does is it uses up all of
33:22
the iphone's battery it just puts it
33:24
into overdrive just making it do loads
33:26
and loads of work and makes it go red
33:28
hot
33:29
okay oh and what they say it's great is
33:31
if you're stuck in the wilderness and
33:33
it's really cold then you can use it to
33:34
warm yourself up yeah but then of course
33:37
how are you going to get in touch with
33:38
anyone afterwards
33:41
well if you've got no battery there's
33:43
actually a really great app called die
33:44
with me which is you're only allowed to
33:47
enter the app so it's locked out you're
33:50
locked out of it until your battery goes
33:51
to five percent or below and then
33:53
suddenly you're into this chat room
33:55
where everyone's phones are dying and
33:57
you can
33:58
commiserate together
34:00
oh my gosh it's like being a palliative
34:02
care world
34:03
wow
34:04
that's morbid
34:06
speaking of that actually do you
34:07
remember the old nokia 3310s yeah like
34:10
they're very very popular
34:12
there's still a few in this audience
34:14
i've got them um there was a woman in
34:16
nigeria apparently this happened it was
34:18
on social media and they claimed it
34:20
happened she lost her phone in 2006
34:23
and then last year they found it again
34:25
and it still had one bar of battery left
34:29
no that's amazing
34:31
no apparently that's true and there was
34:34
a youtube channel called creoson that
34:36
passed a million volts
34:38
of electricity through a 3310 and it
34:40
continued to work
34:42
and they did it to a more modern phone
34:44
and it just was frazzled immediately do
34:46
you know the best selling phone of all
34:47
time is it that one 33 it's not the 3310
34:50
it's the 1100 which i think is a
34:52
previous version so seven of the 10 best
34:54
selling phones of all time and nokia
34:56
phones and yeah the 11 yeah they're
34:58
great phones and snake in fact was
35:01
obviously the best game of all time but
35:02
i realized something about it that i
35:04
never knew at the time which is that you
35:05
could play two-player snake with your
35:08
friend so they had an infrared phone
35:11
connection thing installed which is it's
35:13
kind of like early bluetooth i suppose
35:15
which no one ever used i don't think but
35:18
basically if you pointed your phone
35:19
really close through the infrared port
35:22
you pointed that infrared port at your
35:23
mates infrared port and they were
35:25
basically touching each other you could
35:26
then if you can talk your body around in
35:28
a
35:29
play snake against that friend yeah i've
35:32
done that i've played that what yeah no
35:34
do you mean against a friend rather than
35:36
just the phone i didn't hear what you
35:38
said just before i was just uh
35:40
i was just singing about a great game of
35:42
snake oh
35:44
have you guys heard of the yo app no
35:47
yo was an app sensation in 2014 was it
35:51
yeah it was it was the only thing you
35:53
could do with it was send the word yo
35:56
yes i did get that to other users of the
35:59
app i used that like for about two hours
36:02
right
36:03
you can't say anything else if you get
36:05
sent to yo all you can reply with is yo
36:08
it raised a million and a half dollars
36:11
in funding it became the number four app
36:13
in the us app store thanks to people
36:15
like james it was pretty cool it was
36:18
pretty cool the man who founded it said
36:19
this is a stupid app
36:22
he's so wrong you just got a message and
36:24
it just went yo
36:27
what could be better than that
36:29
yeah
36:30
yeah he came through and it just went yo
36:34
wow what could be better than that it's
36:36
like you know on facebook how you can
36:38
poke people it's like that kind of thing
36:40
how come i i don't remember getting a yo
36:42
from you well
36:44
2014. i believe that was i think that
36:46
was before you ever had a smartphone
36:48
yeah
36:49
those the early days of the apps it was
36:51
those there was the bubble wrap app
36:52
where you just clicked on bubble wrap
36:54
there was when they launched it was in
36:55
july 2008 uh by december of that year
36:58
there were over 50 different apps purely
37:00
dedicated to making fart noises like
37:03
that's that's how quickly we were
37:05
interested in just having these there
37:06
are now more than 1200
37:08
on the itunes store yeah it's pretty
37:11
depressing isn't it that we've come this
37:13
far technologically look how advanced we
37:15
are we showed newton what we've done
37:17
he's astonished and he asked what so
37:18
what have you done with it
37:20
well we've got 1200 farts out
37:24
wow there are good ones there are
37:26
there's um i like this one there's the
37:28
quirky eggminder wink app enabled smart
37:31
egg tray so this is a an egg tray for
37:33
your fridge but it has an app which goes
37:36
with it which tells you how many eggs
37:37
you have
37:40
cool
37:42
so that's very useful if you're outside
37:44
the fridge but you don't want to open it
37:48
there is a french calorie counting app
37:50
called foodvisor which is is for people
37:52
who are trying to
37:54
calculate how many calories they're
37:55
eating and it you basically show the the
37:58
phone what is on your plate and it tells
38:00
you an estimate of how many calories are
38:02
in it so it's a french app but when it
38:05
was released in england it became
38:06
repeatedly confused by horrible british
38:09
food which had
38:10
had no idea what it was
38:12
so it got got shown a cornish pasty and
38:14
said is this a baguette what is it they
38:18
got fish chips and mushy peas it said oh
38:20
you've got some guacamole i can see
38:22
there
38:23
i don't know
38:24
we're gonna have to wrap up in a second
38:26
uh can i i think one of my favorite apps
38:28
is an app called the last hit
38:30
and this is something that acknowledges
38:34
that as it says there is something worse
38:36
than suddenly dying and that is doing it
38:38
while listening to a really embarrassing
38:40
song and so the last hit is an app that
38:43
your phone detects a sudden movement
38:45
that implies he might have died in an
38:47
awful accident oh my god and then it
38:50
quickly plays the song that you've
38:52
nominated to be your final song
38:56
oh god
38:58
[Music]
39:02
he died listening to johnny cash's
39:04
famous chicken song
39:05
[Laughter]
39:08
okay that's it that is all of our facts
39:10
thank you so much for listening if you
39:12

00:14
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:21
covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:24
here with anna chazinski
00:26
james harkin and andrew hunter murray
00:28
and once again we have gathered around
00:30
the microphones with our four favorite
00:31
facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order here we go
00:36
starting with you
00:37
james okay my pet this week is that
00:40
elephants
00:41
can tell how much of something is it a
00:43
closed bucket
00:44
by smell alone it's so
00:47
cool it's so amazing so
00:51
let's say let me take one of you for
00:52
instance dan cause i'm looking at you
00:54
hello
00:55
um if you have two plates of food yeah
00:57
and one of them has got three steaks on
00:59
and the other one's got one steak you'd
01:00
know which one had the most stakes
01:02
but if you had two boxes of cornflakes
01:05
that were both closed
01:06
you won't be able to tell which one was
01:07
full of conflicts and which one isn't
01:08
full of conflicts and elephants can do
01:10
this
01:11
so that's insane are they am i am i
01:14
allowed to shake the cornflake boxes and
01:16
are they allowed to shake the buckets
01:17
with their noses you're allowed to do
01:19
whatever you want
01:20
no one's going to stop you unless you do
01:21
it too much in sainsbury's
01:23
but the elephants know they didn't do
01:25
any touch at all it was all completely
01:27
by smell
01:28
and it was in their particular case it
01:30
was two buckets
01:31
containing 11 different ratios of
01:33
sunflower seeds
01:34
and they managed to choose the bucket
01:36
with the most sunflower seeds
01:38
59 to 82 of the time which is more than
01:41
you would expect
01:42
by chance and actually even dogs they've
01:44
tried this on dogs and dogs can't do it
01:46
so basically if you've got say um
01:49
two kilograms of cocaine up your bum or
01:52
four kilograms of cocaine up your bum
01:54
the dogs wouldn't know which one it was
01:55
right i think if you had four kilograms
01:59
of cocaine on your bum
02:00
it wouldn't take a sniffer dog to
02:01
identify you
02:05
do you think a remark difference do you
02:07
between the four and the two i think in
02:08
your gate yes
02:09
you think the gates would be different
02:11
no no
02:13
it's like a big pocket up there kilos
02:17
two kilos is still uncomfortable andy
02:19
it's not like you're swaggering and
02:21
uncomfortable
02:22
you have to be one big bag as well you
02:23
could do ten small bags
02:25
great that's going to make a big
02:26
difference well on the entry point i
02:27
think it would
02:29
i want to know how you close a bucket
02:31
i'm glad you said bucket list
02:35
um it's buckets with a with a lid on the
02:38
buckets i wish my buckets came with a
02:40
lid how many buckets do you have
02:42
i have loads yeah like a bucket you
02:44
would put up make a fire and you would
02:46
need a lid for wouldn't you
02:48
why are you making fires and buckets
02:49
well i'm trying to get rid of all this
02:50
cocaine i've got out of my bum
02:53
it's really interesting right it's not
02:54
even like these amounts are
02:56
huge differences i i think i read in the
02:58
study that let's say what were we saying
03:00
seeds sometimes sunflower seeds it would
03:02
be the difference between say 150
03:04
sunflower
03:04
seeds and 130. not all of them could get
03:08
it it's obviously
03:09
easier for them with bigger differences
03:10
but even at that point they could still
03:12
do it so the other cool thing was they
03:13
double blinded it because the
03:15
experimenters thought
03:16
we might accidentally give away if we
03:18
cause we know which buckets have the
03:20
most sunflower seeds and we might get
03:21
really excited when they're going
03:22
towards the big one so they definitely
03:24
made sure that the elephants didn't know
03:26
and the researchers didn't know where
03:28
the
03:28
sunflower seeds were yeah okay yeah
03:30
that's useful so if you're
03:32
getting raisins in a supermarket for
03:34
instance and you need to choose the
03:35
packet that's got the most in them you
03:37
could bring an elephant
03:38
and then you've got your money's worth
03:40
right because they frequently put
03:41
they frequently label on the packet how
03:43
many raisins are in the bag
03:48
[Laughter]
03:57
that must be how many are in a big
03:58
packet of raisins
04:00
i just buy those little sun made boxes
04:02
inside oh you're good
04:03
more than 30 raisins in there imagine
04:05
that you got 10 raisins in your hand
04:07
that's a nice
04:07
handful splash mouthful right your 4 000
04:10
it's 400 handfuls of raisins
04:14
look i took it it took a lot of work
04:15
smuggling these into the country
04:19
i knew you were walking funny um just on
04:22
testing elephants
04:23
so there was another uh test of elephant
04:25
smell
04:26
by the university of kwazulu-natal and
04:28
they did something really cool
04:30
they built an elephant-sized lab mouse
04:33
maze
04:34
so you know the stereotype of scientists
04:36
putting mice in a maze it's almost
04:37
always just a y-shaped maze
04:39
so they put the mice in at the tail of
04:40
the wise it were and they'd see which of
04:42
the two branches it goes into and they
04:43
built an
04:44
elephant-sized one of that and they put
04:46
a bucket of food they liked at one
04:47
branch of the y
04:48
and they put a bucket of food they
04:49
didn't like it the other branch of the y
04:51
and they could identify it they knew
04:53
instantly which branch to go for just
04:54
through smell
04:55
just through smell again yeah amazing so
04:57
do they have they have the best smell
04:58
of any mammal that we know of that's
05:01
extraordinary
05:02
yeah they've got the highest number of
05:03
olfactory receptors definitely haven't
05:05
they and uh
05:06
i feel like other animals can claim in a
05:08
different sense but yeah their ability
05:10
to distinguish between amounts
05:12
seems to be unique and it's so sensitive
05:14
that for instance there was another
05:15
experiment where
05:16
they showed that they can distinguish
05:18
between different people so
05:20
in kenya there are different tribes and
05:22
some of them kill elephants and some of
05:23
them don't
05:24
so the maasai kill elephants as a
05:27
ritual thing whereas the camber people
05:29
don't and
05:30
if you hold up a masai tribe's person's
05:33
clothes
05:33
then the elephant freaks out and starts
05:35
bashing his trunk it's amazing isn't it
05:37
yeah
05:38
absolutely incredible yeah but they can
05:39
do it by sight which you've just
05:41
described and also by smell
05:42
yes they can do it by and smell yeah so
05:45
they identify the color of the clothes
05:46
but also if they're blinded
05:47
in their face yeah they can still smell
05:49
it blindfolded we should say blindfolded
05:51
in the face
05:52
blindfolded yes yeah yeah yeah i mean
05:54
neither of those works
05:55
yeah well it just sounds a lot more
05:57
cruel than my experiment
05:59
100 elephants you're not going to get
06:01
approval
06:02
isn't it great to know that it does have
06:04
the best sense of smell given how big
06:05
its nose is like you just you would hope
06:07
that that big
06:08
nose had some sort of great advantage
06:11
and it does
06:12
well do you know one other thing they
06:13
can smell tnt
06:16
and they're very good at it and in fact
06:17
in one sense at least they're better
06:19
than
06:20
dogs at it what's that sense uh
06:23
sense of smell um i think it's the sort
06:26
of the
06:26
the proportion they can identify or the
06:29
sensitivity score they score 99.7
06:32
and dogs get about 94 so there was an
06:34
article all about this saying so does
06:36
this mean that elephants should take
06:37
over
06:38
tnt sniffing dogs duties no absolutely
06:41
not
06:41
their sheer size and weight makes them
06:42
completely unsuited to being in-field
06:44
tnt detectors
06:45
which i think is fair at airports you
06:48
wouldn't have to go past the sniffer
06:49
elephants
06:50
although you're not you've got something
06:52
for tnt in airports yeah this is in the
06:54
minefields of angola isn't it
06:56
it's not like they're expecting people
06:58
to smuggle huge suitcases of tnt
07:00
oh well okay oh well um another amazing
07:04
thing
07:04
is that so that incredibly elephants are
07:06
incredibly smart
07:08
and they've only really started properly
07:10
experimenting on their intelligence over
07:11
the last 20 years or so
07:13
but we used to think they were idiots
07:14
because for instance there was this
07:16
experiment
07:16
where scientists dangled really really
07:18
nice smelling fruit and food and stuff
07:20
at various heights that were too
07:21
difficult for them to reach
07:23
and then they left sticks all over the
07:24
floor and thinking the elephants will
07:26
pick up the stick hopefully and then
07:27
they'll prod the fruit like a pinata
07:30
like a vineyard exactly and they didn't
07:32
so scientists thought they can't be that
07:34
smart they can't figure it out they
07:35
should have hung an
07:36
actual donkey because that's one an
07:38
elephant really they wouldn't use one of
07:40
the basic rubbish pinatas would they
07:42
they you'd hollow out an actual donkey
07:44
yes you would i don't know if they have
07:46
pinatas in their culture though
07:48
elephants also you've been to some
07:50
traumatic children they've hollowed out
07:52
a donkey
07:53
that's tough to get through you need a
07:55
really big steak for a long time
07:57
mine and james's parties i'm blinding
07:59
elephants in one corner
08:00
james is scooping me in and out of a
08:02
donkey in the other
08:06
anyway the point was that they weren't
08:08
being stupid not being able to get it
08:09
with a stick they'd pick up the sticks
08:11
and then they wouldn't product the fruit
08:12
because people didn't understand the
08:13
elephant sense of smell is so good
08:15
so as soon as they pick up a stick they
08:17
can't smell anymore because they've
08:18
wrapped their trunk around it and so
08:20
they couldn't smell where the fruit was
08:22
and the scientists because we're so
08:23
human we just think oh you just see the
08:24
fruit because we assume that the sight
08:25
is the most important thing
08:27
but for them they have to smell very
08:28
well so it's like putting a clothes peg
08:29
on your nose
08:30
but they wrapped their nose around the
08:32
scenes exactly yeah
08:33
yeah exactly i read a thing saying it's
08:35
basically like having a nose on the palm
08:36
of your hand
08:37
every time you touch something you're
08:38
smelling it much more than you are
08:40
touching it butterflies can smell
08:41
through the feet can't they
08:43
they have no factory stuff on their feet
08:45
so imagine if you had feet like a
08:46
butterfly and hands like
08:48
this is the worst ever
08:53
um i found just on the subject of
08:54
amazing senses of smell
08:56
yeah there is a woman who can smell
08:58
parkinson's disease
09:00
oh this is really weird so there are
09:02
people with incredible sense of smell
09:04
the super smellers they get called
09:05
and this lady was a retired nurse called
09:07
joy milne and obviously she'd worked
09:09
with a lot of patients with parkinson's
09:10
and she'd been to a talk about it by a
09:12
doctor and at the end of it
09:13
there was an any questions uh call and
09:16
she put up a hand and said
09:17
why aren't you doing something about the
09:18
fact that people with parkinson's smell
09:20
and they didn't really they thought oh
09:22
that's a slightly weird question to ask
09:23
um and she and eventually they worked
09:26
out that she meant no i literally can
09:28
smell it
09:29
and they tested it on her and you can
09:32
she can tell before physical symptoms
09:33
appear so incredible they
09:36
presented with a load of t-shirts that
09:37
have been worn either by patients with
09:39
parkinson's or people who did not have
09:40
parkinson's
09:41
and she got them all right apart from
09:43
one false positive where she flagged
09:45
someone up as having parkinson's who
09:46
didn't
09:48
and then later on that person got in
09:49
touch to say oh by the way i've just
09:51
been diagnosed with parkinson's
09:52
wow so she had identified it before yeah
09:55
it's like anyone in here
09:56
yeah that's amazing that is amazing we
09:58
need to move on in a sec
09:59
one more thing about elephant smell um
10:02
they smell each other's urine and get a
10:04
lot of information
10:05
about their pack uh about the herd from
10:07
that
10:08
and if you if they're walking in a line
10:10
let's say
10:11
yeah do the condor or whatever and then
10:13
the one at the front
10:15
smells some urine from the one at the
10:16
back because some scientists have taken
10:18
it and then run to the front of the
10:19
queue and then put some urine there they
10:21
get really confused because they know
10:23
whose urine is whose
10:24
and if it's at a place where they're not
10:27
expecting it they get really confused
10:29
and looking around and they can't work
10:30
out what's going on wow
10:32
let's say you came into the bathroom
10:35
next week when i'm on holiday in japan
10:37
and you smell the urine and you went for
10:39
the hell that's james's urine
10:40
i thought he was in japan yeah it's like
10:43
that cool
10:44
and remembering because that's the other
10:45
thing are the two things we assume
10:47
elephants are good at smelling to the
10:49
trunks and remembering because in the
10:50
jungle but they say an elephant never
10:51
forgets
10:52
and they don't so they remember all the
10:54
smells of urine
10:55
of all the different mates they have and
10:57
also there's this amazing moment in 1999
11:00
at an elephant sanctuary
11:01
where there was this elephant called
11:03
jenny they're still going all about us
11:07
there's this asian elephant called jenny
11:10
and she was suddenly introduced to a new
11:11
elephant
11:12
into the sanctuary and they had this
11:14
amazing reaction to each other they got
11:16
really freaked out and agitated and then
11:18
ran up to each other and it seemed like
11:19
this
11:20
um exhibition of euphoria for both the
11:22
elephants and the carer
11:24
of jenny it was like what on earth is
11:25
going on this is so weird so she looked
11:27
back into their history
11:28
and for a few months 23 years earlier
11:30
they'd worked in the circus together
11:32
whoa just remembered each other
11:35
23 years yeah that's incredible like
11:38
jenny
11:39
it's you i don't remember anyone about
11:40
this 23 years ago
11:43
you look at us blankly every morning i
11:45
was nearly in a congo the other day
11:47
yeah it was at a wedding it was very
11:49
long conquered and everyone was going
11:50
pie
11:51
in the conga and they kept saying hey
11:53
join the conga and i kept saying oh i'm
11:55
gonna join on the
11:56
end um i've got about five people saying
11:59
hey get in here and make room for me i
12:00
said no i'm just trying on the end
12:02
did you generally trick them all no not
12:05
done no one's gonna know
12:06
no one knows no one looks behind them in
12:08
the congo exactly yeah but
12:10
i had already urinated at the very end
12:12
of their route so
12:13
i was there to freak them out
12:16
[Applause]
12:16
[Music]
12:18
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:20
that is chozinski
12:22
my fact this week is that thomas
12:24
jefferson cut his bible to pieces and
12:26
glued it back together
12:27
in the order he thought it should be
12:29
written
12:30
and wow yeah great he had a better idea
12:33
for the bible it was in the wrong order
12:35
and he was right
12:36
really so this was the new testament
12:38
specifically
12:40
and he was a christian obviously
12:42
jefferson and he had a bible and
12:44
he wanted to put it all kind of in
12:46
chronological order so he got all the
12:47
gospels
12:48
he ripped them apart he actually had six
12:50
different volumes so he could do lots of
12:52
experimenting
12:53
he had a greek one a latin one english
12:55
and french ones
12:56
um and he cut up all the gospels page by
12:59
page
12:59
rearranged all the pages in
13:01
chronological order so you know if john
13:03
said
13:03
jesus had a sandwich when he was 17.
13:06
then matthew said and then he went on a
13:08
slide when he was 20.
13:09
he'd sort of put the matthew after the
13:11
john bit yeah even though in the actual
13:12
bible matthew had come before the john
13:14
yeah yeah that's a really good idea yeah
13:16
because matthew mark luke and john
13:18
they're all telling the same story
13:19
they're telling the same story different
13:20
bits of it um is there any
13:22
good bits that he left out do we know he
13:24
i actually
13:25
don't know what the examples are that he
13:26
left out but i know he left out some of
13:27
the dodgier
13:28
miracles so he was a bit skeptical that
13:30
some of the stuff might not have
13:31
happened
13:32
the miracle of the
13:34
[Laughter]
13:38
exactly it was tuna at the top and then
13:40
it was blt at the bottom
13:43
[Laughter]
13:45
stepped down i would say and he glued it
13:48
back together and he liked it so much
13:49
his new upgraded version that he
13:52
glued all the pages together and he sent
13:53
them to be bound properly
13:55
and in fact i believe it still exists
13:57
somewhere in america
13:59
is it the smithsonian yeah of course it
14:01
is they've got a lot of jefferson stuff
14:02
they've got his bible so you can visit
14:04
it i'm not sure you can flick through it
14:06
but i believe you can see it i
14:07
definitely won't be able to flick
14:08
through it yeah but it's very unusual it
14:10
might be uh
14:10
if there's six volumes it might be open
14:13
certain pages um
14:14
his desk that he wrote the declaration
14:15
of independence on they have that
14:17
and a polygraph which i've always
14:20
thought to be a lie detector
14:21
but it's yeah i would have thought that
14:23
too well it is right so but originally
14:25
what it was
14:26
was a way of whenever he wrote letters
14:28
because he wrote
14:29
thousands and thousands of letters and
14:31
he always wanted a copy of each letter
14:33
because if they made it into the papers
14:34
he could show the original so it was a
14:36
machine that was designed
14:37
that would have a double pencil with a
14:39
double ink well
14:40
and yeah and it would mimic his writing
14:42
so he wrote two letters at a time but
14:44
the same letter
14:44
yeah amazing and makes actually more
14:46
sense because polygraph
14:48
it means lots of writing so it's
14:50
actually a better term for that machine
14:51
yeah um his bible he didn't mean it to
14:55
be published because it was just a
14:56
private
14:56
sort of passion project of his he showed
14:58
it to a few friends but then after he
15:00
died it became very popular
15:02
and lots of copies were made of it was
15:03
printed and it was called the life and
15:05
morals of jesus of nazareth that was his
15:07
title that was his name yeah he
15:08
re-titled it as well the bible wasn't
15:10
good enough yeah
15:12
he was a kind of a jesus fan as opposed
15:14
to a
15:15
religion fan in some ways and then 9 000
15:17
copies were printed
15:18
and until the 1950s when they ran out
15:20
each newly elected senator got a version
15:23
of it when they were elected
15:24
of office yeah do you know how it ends
15:27
the book
15:28
uh spoiler alert his book i don't know i
15:30
don't it ends i believe
15:32
now in the place where he was crucified
15:34
there was a garden
15:35
and in the garden a new sepulcher
15:37
wherein was never man
15:39
yet laid there they laid jesus and
15:41
rolled a great stone to the door of the
15:43
sepulchre
15:44
and departed that's it no resurrection
15:47
no resurrection
15:48
oh he just dies poor jesus
15:51
isn't that amazing that's like the main
15:53
bit that's what i was told at school
15:55
yeah that's like the main bit yeah
15:56
that's like the somber art house
15:58
reinterpretation
16:00
realism [ __ ] yeah he was an amazing
16:04
guy though jefferson he's quite a
16:05
confusing person isn't he because
16:07
he has this bizarre legacy where he came
16:10
up with the idea that all manner
16:12
is created equal and then he had 600
16:13
slaves and everything
16:15
and actually even the monticello which
16:17
is the
16:18
place that he built his home very famous
16:20
home even the monster
16:21
website now acknowledges that sally
16:23
hawkins
16:24
mothered about six of his children at
16:26
least who was
16:28
who was an enslaved person wow yeah who
16:31
bizarrely was the daughter
16:33
of a woman who mothered children of his
16:36
father-in-law so they kept it in the
16:37
family
16:38
so his wife's dad uh had lots of affairs
16:42
with sally hawkins
16:43
mum wow sorry it's not sally hawkins
16:45
that's a famous actress
16:48
sally hemmings sally hawkins is of
16:50
course in paddington
16:52
the shape of water she's great she was
16:54
also the mother of a lot of jefferson's
16:56
children
16:56
god she's versatile i know so he
16:59
so he was his third president right
17:01
after washington who was it john adams
17:03
yep yeah
17:04
and he you know he did a lot of he had a
17:07
lot of remarkable achievements in office
17:09
um as we said after the declaration of
17:10
independence he's also responsible for a
17:12
phrase that was a massive hit in the
17:14
19th century in america
17:15
can't wait to hear this yeah so he
17:17
bumped into a man near his home this is
17:19
the story and
17:20
you know no one knows if it's true or
17:21
not but this guy started complaining
17:23
they were riding their horses next to
17:24
each other some neighbor of his
17:25
and the guy was complaining about
17:26
everything in washington and all these
17:28
idiots they had running things
17:29
and they he talked for a couple of hours
17:31
talked jefferson's ear off about all
17:32
this
17:33
and then eventually they got to
17:34
jefferson's house and jefferson said
17:35
well this is me
17:37
and um is that the phrase no that would
17:40
have been a great phrase to come
17:41
up with this is me this is me
17:44
jefferson so the guy eventually asked
17:46
pretty much the first question he'd ask
17:48
this whole time and he said what's your
17:49
name by the way
17:50
and the guys and he said well my name is
17:52
thomas jefferson oh
17:54
massive social clanger this guy's made
17:55
he was deeply embarrassed and so
17:57
he couldn't think of anything to say he
17:58
just said my name is haynes
18:00
and then he galloped away on his horse
18:02
so this became a phrase
18:04
my name is haynes which is whenever you
18:06
had to leave suddenly or whenever you
18:07
were massively embarrassed about
18:08
something
18:09
or it was basically the 19th century boy
18:11
was my face red
18:12
oh is it like i'll get my coat kind of
18:15
thing yes it is like that
18:16
yeah wow and what is it my name is my
18:18
name is haynes my name is hayne i'm the
18:20
same
18:20
start doing it um just very quickly on
18:22
typos in the bible
18:23
oh yeah there are some absolute doozies
18:26
so
18:26
there's one in the 1682. there's a 1682
18:30
edition which gets called the cannibals
18:31
bible
18:32
because there's a typo it should be if
18:35
the latter husband hate her
18:36
and they mistyped it so if the latter
18:38
husband ate her
18:39
talking about his wife and there's a
18:41
great one the 1944 king james
18:43
which has a line which should be submit
18:46
yourselves to your own husbands
18:47
it's advice for wives basically but it
18:49
accidentally reads submit yourselves to
18:51
your owl husbands
18:56
that's good advice
18:59
[Applause]
18:59
[Music]
19:01
okay it is time for fact number three
19:03
and that is andy
19:05
my fact is that in 19th century america
19:07
caviar was a free bar snack hmm
19:10
yeah i hate caviar do you yeah oh
19:14
wow i don't like things that are savory
19:16
that have
19:17
um the kind of texture that i think
19:19
sweet things should have
19:20
that's understandable well i know where
19:22
and when you should not go on holiday
19:24
19th century america because you
19:25
couldn't move for it um
19:27
it was so readily available because
19:30
there was huge sturgeon fish that's the
19:32
where the fish that caviar comes from
19:34
yeah or classic caviar anyway
19:36
and they were just so thick in the
19:37
rivers that uh people put it in bars
19:39
basically like peanuts to make people
19:40
thirsty oh yeah it's a way of getting
19:43
people because it's very salty stuff so
19:44
there was a way of getting people
19:45
thirsty
19:46
because it used to be used like salt as
19:48
well didn't it you'd sprinkle it on a
19:49
meal just to add a little bit of salty
19:51
flavor yeah how did they used to eat it
19:53
because
19:54
from what i've read the best place and
19:55
the sort of most um
19:57
encouraged place to eat it from is the
19:58
little bit of skin between your index
20:00
finger
20:01
and your thumb so you place it on there
20:03
oh that's the um what's that called the
20:06
snuffbox yeah it's called the natural
20:07
snuffbox or something oh okay
20:09
they say it's because they don't taint
20:11
the taste by doing that so if you use a
20:13
metal spoon
20:14
for example that that has a metally
20:16
taste that can affect
20:17
the caviar that sounds just like the
20:19
kind of thing that high
20:21
society makes up the weird ways to eat
20:23
the high society food
20:24
isn't it but i think if it's a bar snack
20:26
because surely should be on a cocktail
20:27
stick
20:28
and you could get one little egg i would
20:31
think it would just be in a bowl like
20:32
peanuts with like 12 different types of
20:34
urine
20:35
i think it's like that yeah exactly
20:38
people don't wash their hands coming
20:39
back from the toilet
20:40
it's very squishy to get on your fingers
20:42
though yeah you just do it straight with
20:43
the fingers
20:45
yeah probably not i mean you need to
20:46
have a finger bowl next to it yeah let's
20:48
say in russia you have it on blini
20:50
so maybe they had little bits of bread
20:52
that's perfect that's like a little
20:54
micro plate for each bit of caviar
20:55
that's a very nice way of eating i think
20:57
but this is the thing so us caviar was
20:59
so common but russian caviar was thought
21:01
to be a lot better
21:02
so quite often us caviar was exported to
21:04
europe
21:05
and then it was repackaged and
21:06
re-labeled as russian caviar
21:08
then it was exported back to the states
21:10
and sold as russian caviar as better
21:11
stuff even though it was exactly the
21:12
same
21:13
amazing yeah and basically what happened
21:15
was the caviar in america was
21:17
extremely numerous like you say because
21:19
the sturgeon were numerous
21:20
but then they overfished them and then
21:23
that meant there was no caviar left in
21:24
america anymore which meant you had to
21:26
get it from russia which made it
21:27
much more expensive exactly yeah yeah
21:29
exactly yeah
21:31
because in russia before then before the
21:32
western demand
21:34
increased in russia it was of peasant
21:36
food as well wasn't it it was considered
21:38
much more peasant foodie than sauerkraut
21:40
for instance
21:41
which is more of a delicacy and they use
21:43
it just as a flavoring and
21:45
it was only when there was apparently a
21:46
greek guy called johannes
21:48
varvarkas who discovered russian caviar
21:51
on his travels
21:52
so this is delicious i'm going to
21:53
introduce it to high society in europe
21:55
and then that was what shot its prices
21:57
up he made it fashionable kind of just
21:59
shows that food
22:00
how much you value it is just about how
22:02
fashionable someone says
22:04
apparently if you were to take let's say
22:06
a 45 kilogram barrel of caviar
22:08
i'm not putting this up my boston james
22:13
if you would take this massive barrel of
22:14
caviar which is kind of how they
22:16
transport it
22:17
it would take a farm laborer two weeks
22:19
to earn it
22:20
back in the olden days in russia and now
22:22
it would take a decade for wow
22:26
that's amazing big difference i guess so
22:28
much of it is because it's
22:30
sturgeon i mean you get salmon caviar
22:31
and you get lump fish caviar and there
22:33
are all sorts of other much
22:34
much cheaper meals which are just fish
22:36
eggs basically of different kinds but
22:38
sturgeon has this kind of
22:39
you know supposed hallmark of quality
22:41
about it yeah that's pretty similar
22:42
so okay here's the question is caviar
22:44
vegetarian because it is eggs not vegan
22:47
for sure not vegan i'd say no because
22:49
you have to um you have to kill
22:51
the sturgeon in order to get it fair
22:53
play
22:54
however there is some i think vegetarian
22:57
caviar out there
22:58
where they don't kill the sturgeon oh
22:59
yeah they make a tiny incision
23:01
and then they massage the sturgeon to
23:03
get it out of them
23:04
and it's nice it's quite a rough massage
23:08
this is a company in leeds and then you
23:09
just squeeze the sturgeon like a
23:11
toothpaste too basically and all the
23:12
caviar comes out of it
23:14
but and then you put it back in the
23:15
water yeah it survives you keep them
23:18
yeah i was reading about this actually
23:19
yeah they
23:20
they um you can repeat the process every
23:21
15 months yeah um
23:23
yeah this was i i read that there was a
23:25
scientist called angela collar
23:27
um she spent nine years trying to work
23:28
out how you didn't you wouldn't have to
23:30
kill the sturgeon in order to
23:32
extract the eggs and i believe it was
23:33
her who pioneered it could be wrong
23:35
maybe multiple people around the world
23:36
have the same idea
23:37
but the process isn't just doing what
23:39
you said with the incision
23:41
they give the sturgeons an ultrasound to
23:44
see if they're ready and then they have
23:45
a protein
23:46
administered which you're talking about
23:47
which releases the eggs and then they
23:49
massage them out
23:50
like a toothpaste yeah yeah so it's
23:52
really funny an ultrasound for a fish
23:54
yeah you're gonna have a hundred
23:55
thousand babies congratulations
23:58
i think they have to give them
23:59
ultrasounds anyway because there's no
24:01
way of telling if they're male or female
24:03
so you need to make sure that you've got
24:05
a female fish i think so from the
24:06
outside
24:07
so you have to check their innards
24:09
anyway you've got the right gonads
24:10
that's incredible one way that you might
24:13
get some
24:14
eggs without killing the sturgeon
24:17
is sometimes producers will take some of
24:19
the eggs out to check
24:20
if they're ready or not because you
24:22
don't want to kill your sturgeon get all
24:24
the eggs out and it's not at the right
24:26
stage
24:26
and so some fisheries will take a female
24:29
sturgeon
24:30
put a incision in her put a straw in her
24:34
and then suck out some of the eggs to
24:36
taste them to see if they taste right
24:38
and then if they're right then they'll
24:39
kill the sturgeon and get the eggs and
24:40
if they're wrong then they'll
24:41
just let her go for a while that must be
24:44
something someone's doing in a posh
24:45
russian restaurant
24:46
it's just serving up live sturgeon
24:48
jamming
24:49
to it yes but we only have paper straws
24:53
so it's good for the environment and
24:55
then do you what if it's not ready yet
24:56
do you just
24:57
sew it back up yeah yeah and then that
25:00
is insane
25:00
isn't it they have a bit of a rough old
25:02
ride sturgeon because
25:04
it's not just caviar we also use them
25:06
for beer don't we traditionally they
25:08
were the original
25:09
icing glass providers so that's the swim
25:12
bladder
25:12
and that's what they used to kind of
25:14
purify beer it was used in things like
25:16
guinness until a couple of years ago i
25:17
think they got rid of it
25:18
it's to clarify alcoholic drink sorry i
25:21
don't fully understand it
25:22
so you get the swim bladder and it's
25:23
just it's used in the wine making or the
25:26
beer making
25:26
process to get rid of a lot of the
25:28
sediment i think it's kind of used like
25:29
a sieve
25:30
yeah and so that's why a lot of beers
25:31
aren't vegetarian or a lot of vegetarian
25:33
a lot of vegans
25:34
can't have wine come on yeah because of
25:35
that reason yeah um sturgeon are amazing
25:38
amazing amazing fish they can weigh up
25:41
to fifteen hundred kilos
25:44
okay like that's a lot it's i only work
25:46
in stone
25:47
uh that's a lot of stone it is yeah no
25:50
they are massive
25:51
and they grow up to twenty eight feet
25:52
long which i find i mean that's
25:55
yeah 28 feet long right the sturgeon
25:57
thank you thank you
25:58
i mean the very very biggest ever found
26:00
with being 20
26:01
but around there okay i mean the luger
26:03
sturgeon so it's um
26:05
i think beluga sturgeon is the second
26:07
biggest kind of bony fish and yeah it's
26:10
this
26:10
length of four men that is extraordinary
26:13
yeah i
26:14
see and they take a long time to this
26:16
one of the reasons why caviar is so
26:17
valuable is that they take so long to
26:19
reach
26:19
maturity right so the biggest one
26:21
sometimes there is not until about 20
26:23
that they're producing enough caviar wow
26:25
you have to wait forever
26:27
so as well as eating fish eggs you can
26:29
eat fish sperm
26:31
there's something called shirako that's
26:34
probably not how you pronounce it in
26:35
japan
26:36
it translates as white children and it's
26:38
the war
26:39
is the raw or cut sperm of the cod fish
26:42
and in russia they eat the sperm of
26:46
herrings because they like herrings in
26:47
russia and they
26:49
not they preserve it but not only do
26:51
they eat it on their own sometimes they
26:52
will eat it
26:53
with the row of herrings as well so the
26:56
the eggs of the herring
26:58
and the sperm of the heritage in the
27:00
same same meal yeah
27:01
i think that's a little unkind isn't it
27:04
why
27:05
to the sperm and the eggs because they
27:06
should they belong together they should
27:08
be
27:08
well you're marrying them you then you
27:10
eat one of each and then a herring grows
27:12
in your stomach it's like if you eat an
27:15
apple seed then an apple tree will grow
27:16
out of your mouth oh man we've got a lot
27:18
of stuff to fill you
27:19
i do feel like if i at the sperm and the
27:22
eggs of a herring i would genuinely
27:24
worry about that
27:25
right yeah yeah a little bit the sperm
27:28
is called
27:28
malacca which i thought was russian for
27:31
milk oh man your russian blessings
27:35
[Laughter]
27:42
um you get ant caviar too that's the
27:44
thing what's that it is ant pupae
27:46
and larvae you know so it's not eggs
27:49
really
27:50
but it's from a particular mexican ant
27:52
which is known locally as
27:53
la jormiga pedora you say that as if
27:55
there's only one and
27:59
it's incredibly it's incredibly
28:01
expensive
28:04
he cooks it as well as producing it so
28:06
it's a real treat if you're
28:08
in town um is the farty ant because
28:12
their nests smell like farts
28:14
but the eggs are a delicacy or the
28:16
larvae you know you do get snail caviar
28:18
don't you which is quite like fish
28:20
caviar apart from it tastes a bit more
28:22
like snails
28:22
i've never have you tried it yeah well
28:24
how um
28:26
you get cowboy caviar is that made of
28:29
the eggs of cowboys
28:30
no it's slang it's um it's bulls
28:33
testicles that are fried
28:34
um so they're also known as rocky
28:35
mountain oysters
28:37
have you but they also um they would
28:39
have those as bar snacks wouldn't they
28:41
in the olden days yeah you would have
28:42
testicles as bar snacks
28:44
they eat them a lot somewhere i think it
28:46
might be in mexico it's still a
28:48
accommodation yeah it was the montana
28:51
testicle festival that i read about them
28:52
in
28:53
um so maybe montana makes sense you can
28:55
eat them anywhere
28:56
it's gonna be there yeah confusingly
28:58
it's also from what i can tell online
29:00
cowboy caviar is a salad which is just
29:03
a lot of salad bits thrown together so
29:06
there's no sense to it
29:07
yeah so be careful when ordering if
29:09
you're a vegetarian in montana
29:11
yeah what else happens at a testicle
29:13
festival
29:14
are you i think it's a lot of eating of
29:15
testicles um yeah
29:17
competitively testicle festival is a
29:20
very nice phrase to say
29:21
it is it's very nice yeah it's shape of
29:23
waxing of testicles probably yeah i'd
29:25
have there like waxing competitions
29:27
there's the big bowl contest that i've
29:28
got here which is
29:29
uh men in wet underwear it's like no
29:32
that's what it says here i wonder if you
29:34
could call it the festical
29:36
yes you could or the testicle no neither
29:38
is as good as testicle festival
29:40
no anyway they branded it right right
29:43
well done guys
29:45
there's there's another caveat there's a
29:46
caviar sort of uh replacement you can
29:49
have which is very much like the real
29:51
russian thing and this is a replacement
29:52
for russian sevruga caviar
29:55
and this is the kind of caviar that you
29:56
can get from paddlefish
29:58
and basically where most paddlefish are
30:00
is a place called warsaw
30:01
in missouri and so apparently it's so
30:04
good this stuff and all the russians in
30:06
missouri think that this is just like
30:08
their caviar back home
30:09
and so there's this huge black market
30:12
caviar
30:13
fishing problem there and there was a
30:15
really good it was this was on
30:16
longread.com i think a really good
30:18
long read about it and it was about
30:19
police descending on this place and its
30:21
population doubles
30:23
in the paddlefish fishing season which
30:25
is just a couple of weeks long
30:26
because people flock there to try and
30:28
get these fish and get the caviar out of
30:29
it
30:30
and they thought we know there are all
30:31
these russian people who are coming and
30:33
they're illegally poaching these fish
30:35
and then they're going obviously selling
30:36
them they're getting so many
30:38
and gradually as you're reading this
30:39
article you realize the police have this
30:41
massive problem because
30:43
even though they know these fish are
30:44
disappearing they know they're illegally
30:46
taking them
30:46
they can't track down any kind of black
30:48
market they can't trace
30:50
any money and it turns out when actually
30:52
they start arresting people
30:53
and when they go undercover then no
30:56
one's selling it at all it's just all
30:57
these russians are just picking
30:58
they're just eating it they've just got
31:00
these big russian families so they'll
31:02
get like
31:02
tens of thousands of pounds worth of
31:04
caviar or um
31:05
some of them will have you know about
31:07
one thousand pounds worth of just the
31:08
fish themselves
31:10
and they're like no we're not gonna why
31:11
would i sell this i'm not gonna sell
31:12
this they just take it back to their big
31:14
families
31:15
and they eat it all and so there's
31:16
nothing really that they can do and they
31:17
just get taken to the police station
31:19
told
31:19
please don't take that fish again and
31:21
then sent home
31:23
yeah i just like it they like it in
31:26
russia
31:26
i can say that much i think it's
31:28
delicious i was reading about a sniffer
31:30
cat called russic
31:35
sniff a cat just pre-sees this entire
31:37
long read
31:38
it's an amazing industry in america i
31:41
can sniff a cat
31:42
which it looks like a bit of research
31:44
left over from your elephant research
31:46
from an hour ago it was in russia this
31:48
was uh there was
31:49
there was a lot there's a lot of
31:50
smuggling or was a lot of smuggling in
31:52
the caspian sea
31:53
so they would come to a checkpoint and
31:56
people would try and get it through on
31:57
their cars
31:58
and they found that that was a big
32:00
problem but they had this cat that they
32:02
had adopted that was i believe a stray
32:04
who loved eating um chunks of sturgeon
32:07
and caviar and so on that was being
32:09
confiscated from the criminals
32:11
as a result developed in a really strong
32:13
nose for sniffing out whenever there was
32:15
sturgeon
32:16
in the area so what they stopped what
32:18
they started doing was every time a car
32:20
came
32:20
up uh the cat would be sent to go and
32:23
you know maybe they walked on a leash i
32:24
didn't actually get that detail
32:25
and russic would have a smell and smell
32:27
out all of these
32:28
um bits of sturgeon and caviar and uh
32:31
so good was he at doing it that they
32:33
actually retired the sniffer dog
32:36
that they had that has got to hurt yeah
32:38
you're a sniffer dog and you lose your
32:39
job to a cat
32:41
yeah first first i lost my job to the
32:43
elephant in that airport and now
32:44
this but yeah so unfortunately he died
32:47
in 2013
32:48
when a vehicle that he was searching
32:50
suddenly uh jerked forward
32:52
how convenient i can't believe i didn't
32:55
do that sooner i can't believe no
32:57
smuggler thought of doing that straight
32:58
away
33:00
so they've got the cat smelling the cars
33:02
are they stationing it on the pavement
33:04
and cars whiz past and their cats then
33:06
like
33:07
and then you know to stop
33:23
but surely once you've stopped a car and
33:25
you've opened the doors
33:26
isn't it as easy for you we've just
33:28
covered our big sturgeon our
33:30
i would say i could find sturgeon as
33:32
easily and quickly as a cat
33:34
you're right they're massive they were
33:36
sat in this
33:37
sort of passenger seat with a hat and a
33:39
fake mustache
33:42
this is my friend bob what do you say
33:44
kitty
33:45
that's a sturgeon thank god for russet
33:49
or whatever he's called otherwise i
33:52
would have believed in bob
33:53
and it stinks i mean if there's a car
33:55
full of fish i'm gonna smell it
33:58
i'm gonna need a magic cat but maybe his
34:01
gift was in telling people about it
34:03
oh yeah like most cats if they smell
34:05
they're not gonna tell you they're not
34:06
gonna you're
34:07
not gonna grasp someone up i've not
34:08
written down the most interesting bit of
34:10
the story it was a talking cat
34:11
so sorry i missed out the best details
34:20
okay it's time for our final fact of the
34:22
show and that is my fact
34:23
my fact this week is that wrestling star
34:25
andre the giant was so massive
34:28
that once when he drunkenly passed out
34:30
in a hotel lobby
34:31
staff couldn't move him and had to
34:33
corner him off with velvet ropes until
34:35
he woke up
34:37
so amazing this is yeah this is from a
34:39
um
34:40
this is an anecdote that comes from a
34:41
book called as you wish
34:43
inconceivable tales from the making of
34:45
the princess bride by carrie elwes who
34:47
was
34:48
the lead actor in it he was also in
34:49
robin hood men in tights
34:51
um and the whole book is just anecdotes
34:53
about the time that they were making the
34:55
movie and that's what came out
34:56
uh the fact that he just used to have
34:58
all these drunken
34:59
escapades one of which meant he yeah
35:02
passed down and
35:03
the giant was in that movie as well
35:04
right he played fesic the giant yeah
35:07
okay really typecast wasn't he yeah he
35:10
wasn't gonna play um
35:13
and he was a wrestler andre the giant he
35:15
was a wrestler before he was a
35:16
film star i mean that's that's his big
35:18
career thing really well before that he
35:20
was a rugby player and before that he
35:21
was in a furniture removal
35:23
business and before he was a child
35:26
before that he was a tiny egg a
35:28
professional egg
35:30
but he's uh to the wwf now the wwe he is
35:32
one of the great
35:33
wrestling stars of all time he was in
35:35
the period of hulk hogan and macho man
35:37
and ultimate warrior that sort of very
35:39
classic era when they started
35:41
i just don't get wrestling it doesn't
35:44
make
35:45
any sense to me we've covered it before
35:46
on this podcast and i find it impossible
35:48
to research
35:49
because everything you read about it
35:50
you're like is this
35:52
real did this really happen the
35:54
confusion of
35:55
real sport and fake acting is
35:58
bewildering like there's this
36:00
fight between him and hulk hogan which
36:02
was this really famous fight and um
36:04
apparently it was super controversial it
36:06
was in 1988
36:08
and there was there was a referee a
36:10
famous referee called dave hebner
36:12
who was refereed wrestling matches and
36:15
he happened to have an identical twin oh
36:17
yes
36:17
who they tracked down for this match a
36:19
referee and yeah the referee had an
36:21
identical twin he didn't really
36:22
i think nothing he did he did really
36:25
i've seen the actual pictures either he
36:27
did or there's some amazing photo
36:29
shopping going on
36:30
but he had this identical twin and so
36:33
right andre the giants
36:34
agent got dave who was supposed to
36:37
referee the match
36:38
locked him in a cupboard and then bribed
36:41
earl
36:42
his identical twin to referee the game
36:44
instead and he did
36:46
and then he made andre the giant one and
36:47
then dave broke out of his closet
36:49
and then him and his identical twin
36:51
brother had a big fight afterwards in
36:53
front of the queen this is the weirdest
36:55
conversation i really want to hear anna
36:56
doing the coventry of wwe
36:58
yeah i don't understand any of this is
37:01
that real
37:02
oh my god there's storylines there's
37:05
story lines
37:06
you go to the theater all the time are
37:07
you standing up going what the [ __ ] is
37:09
going on here no
37:10
no no because in the write-ups of the
37:12
theater it doesn't say
37:13
and there was an incredibly
37:14
controversial moment when hamlet's
37:16
mother
37:17
remarried hamlet's uncle and the
37:20
audience can
37:21
you're like okay this is a story there
37:23
was in the wikipedia page
37:26
was it controversial or was it all made
37:28
up
37:30
it's not it's all made up it's all made
37:31
up then why is it controversial
37:33
it's controversial in the world of
37:34
wrestling which is a fake world
37:36
yeah yeah okay now you're getting it
37:39
[Laughter]
37:42
no it is it is weird how it's presented
37:44
as true you know normally
37:45
it plays there is a synopsis normally
37:47
when you go out of the play
37:49
the thing doesn't keep happening outside
37:51
but no but
37:52
i just think it's amazing that we found
37:54
the edge of anna's competition
37:55
yeah i never thought we'd get there who
37:58
would know it was pro wrestling
38:00
is fake it just makes me have a panic
38:04
attack when i read about it
38:05
but it's a drama like eastenders it's
38:08
it's goes on and on
38:09
of course the characters don't smash out
38:11
into the news at 10. and suddenly
38:12
they're brawling
38:13
what about um the guy from hollyoaks was
38:16
fighting the guy from emmerdale last
38:17
week
38:18
what i missed yeah one of them got fired
38:20
in real life i think
38:21
yeah although this is all making me
38:23
wonder about everything wait hang on so
38:24
there was a real life fight between
38:26
someone in someone in emmerdale and
38:28
someone in um hollyoaks was it hollyoaks
38:31
yes it was hollyoaks yeah they got a big
38:32
fight wow physical fight
38:34
yeah yeah i thought you meant that
38:35
someone from hollyoaks turned up in
38:37
emmerdale like a character
38:39
sort of made his way through the
38:40
membrane and he ended up because i
38:42
definitely watched that as well
38:44
like a weird portal opens between the
38:47
world
38:47
it's like the truman show or something
38:49
yeah one of the pint glasses from the
38:50
old vic suddenly smashes through into
38:52
coronation street
38:55
look can we get back to andre the
38:56
justice sorry yeah
39:00
it was actually three children in a
39:02
massive overcoat
39:05
so when he was drinking according to
39:06
carrie ellis when he was drinking in new
39:08
york once the nypd
39:10
um had to send an undercover cop to
39:12
follow him around the bars
39:14
because if he got too drunk there was
39:15
once time where he fell over
39:17
and crushed a human underneath and they
39:20
didn't want that to happen again
39:21
um yeah not to death no no just yeah but
39:24
i think he was stuck
39:25
you know that's seven foot two of
39:27
massive massive body on you
39:29
he got so tall uh because he had
39:31
acromegaly you know um
39:32
that was the cause of his giant size um
39:34
he that his parents did not recognize
39:36
him
39:36
so he left him at 14. he came back at 19
39:39
and they said who are you
39:41
and they'd even seen him wrestling on tv
39:43
without recognizing who he was
39:45
but yeah they didn't realize until quite
39:46
late right so he wasn't sort of
39:48
amazingly huge he was normal until he
39:50
was 15 normal-sized until he was 15.
39:52
yeah
39:52
and we keep saying he gets drunk but to
39:55
give him credit i don't think he really
39:56
did get drunk very often
39:57
he basically held his drink incredibly
39:59
well and he drunk extraordinary amounts
40:01
like he'd drink 100 over 100 beers in a
40:03
night
40:04
and be fine or i think someone was once
40:06
asked how much can he drink before he's
40:08
drunk and someone said he starts
40:10
uh he starts to feel it after the first
40:12
bottle of vodka
40:13
or something so he used to order a drink
40:16
which was a concoction that consisted of
40:18
40 ounces of just
40:20
random liquids which he called the
40:21
american he just he just had it poured
40:24
into a pitcher
40:24
i'm so glad he didn't have a cocktail
40:26
bar because that is the most disgusting
40:28
sounding
40:30
random liquids on the menu well that's
40:31
carrie elwes again this is from him and
40:33
he says it
40:34
i've never tasted airplane fuel but i
40:35
imagine it's very good it's like
40:37
you would have like let's say it was
40:39
your 21st birthday and your friends what
40:41
did you get drunk they buy you a top
40:42
shelf which is basically one of every
40:44
shot in a glass
40:45
oh your friends would have done the same
40:47
thing i'm sure well yeah we would have
40:48
done but we didn't finish our crocodile
40:50
in time so we all had to go home
40:53
um when andre the giant was in paris one
40:56
day he realized that the cars there were
40:57
quite small and he could just move them
40:59
around if he wanted to because he was so
41:01
strong
41:02
and so he would get his friends because
41:04
in america they're much bigger right so
41:05
he would get his friends cars and then
41:07
move them into tiny little spaces where
41:09
they couldn't go
41:11
gotta make parking easier if you could
41:13
just get out of the car and lift it into
41:14
the space
41:15
that's such a good idea he could hardly
41:17
get into cars he was so huge yeah this
41:19
is amazing there's
41:20
photos of him getting in and out of a
41:22
car and he basically went had to go in
41:24
on all fours and be
41:25
the entire back seat was him yeah you
41:27
know yeah he once got into a taxi and
41:29
they couldn't close the door
41:30
whoa what who was it that i think we've
41:33
done on the podcast before but when he
41:34
was a kid
41:35
because he couldn't get the bus the
41:36
normal bus he used to be driven to
41:38
school
41:38
samuel beckham but that's not true is
41:41
that not true that was actually another
41:42
thing that elwas
41:43
claimed um but wasn't quite true so he
41:46
grew up in the same french town weirdly
41:48
as samuel beckett moved to in moliere
41:50
and apparently beckett was kind of a
41:53
friendly guy and used to drive the kids
41:54
to school
41:55
and in a way that was okay back then and
41:58
he
41:58
sometimes he would hit to ride with him
42:00
but he could fit on the bus because how
42:01
small would a bus
42:02
have to be if you know no he had a
42:04
pickup truck and the kid would sit on
42:05
the back of the truck so it was true
42:07
that he you still lift
42:08
yes he did it wasn't because he couldn't
42:10
fit on the bus right okay yeah yeah got
42:11
it
42:12
he was a really nice guy though wasn't
42:14
he everyone said he was very much a
42:16
gentle
42:16
giant everyone called him and didn't
42:18
someone said he didn't like hurting
42:20
people
42:20
which now i understand that wrestling
42:22
isn't really about really hurting people
42:23
does make sense
42:24
but he was friends with arnold
42:26
schwarzenegger and arnold schwarzenegger
42:28
in this pbs documentary
42:30
that you should watch if you're really
42:31
interested in andre the giant but arnold
42:32
schwarzenegger said
42:34
that he was at a restaurant with him
42:35
once and andre used to always insist on
42:37
paying
42:38
for anyone's dinner or anyone's drinks
42:39
when he went out with them and so arnold
42:41
knew this and he tried to sort of
42:42
sneakily pay
42:43
and andre lifted him up off his chair
42:45
and put him on top of a cupboard
42:49
that's brilliant bizarrely and it's
42:52
weird saying arnold schwarzenegger say
42:53
this word it's an armoire
42:55
so he says an andre just lifted me up
42:57
and he put me onto the armoire
43:01
i never thought i'd see him use the word
43:04
he was meant to play physic
43:05
he was meant to play the role in
43:07
princess france yeah
43:08
he was the original casting choice it
43:10
was
43:11
yeah yeah and he didn't because it took
43:14
so long to make didn't it took about a
43:15
decade to make and by then arnie was
43:17
too famous it took a decade to get into
43:20
productivity
43:21
yeah and by then i was like i had a real
43:22
career gosh
43:24
well i've got some facts about alcohol
43:26
tolerance but i don't know if you've got
43:27
more on andre the giant
43:28
oh just that he kept a small farm and he
43:30
would walk around and play with the
43:31
animals because they didn't stare at him
43:32
for his size
43:32
i think that's [ __ ] as well but
43:34
worth saying no i think he definitely
43:36
likes not being stared at
43:37
he's it's kind of a tragic life he had
43:40
because he was obviously lovely and knew
43:42
that his career depended on being huge
43:43
but at the same time he said the
43:44
princess bride was the happiest he'd
43:46
ever been filming that
43:47
because for the first time ever people
43:49
didn't stare at him because i guess he
43:50
was just an actor on set and then knew
43:52
what to expect
43:53
he loved it and in fact he there's a
43:55
really nice interview with one of his
43:57
friends called lanny who said that after
44:00
he'd filmed the princess bride
44:01
um andre invited him out to his house
44:04
and gave him a bunch of alcohol and said
44:06
hey jonah come to my drawing room and
44:07
i'll show you something and made him
44:08
watch the film
44:09
and then he kept inviting him around and
44:11
kept making him watch it and he did it
44:13
with all his friends because he loved he
44:14
was so proud of it
44:15
and he said you know did you think i was
44:16
good in it do you think it was all right
44:18
and they'd all be like yeah you were
44:19
really great in that don't worry have
44:21
you guys all seen this movie because
44:22
yeah i actually don't even know what
44:24
it's about
44:24
oh okay like is it a is it a fantasy
44:28
yeah but a very funny one yeah it is an
44:30
amazing film if anyone listening hasn't
44:32
yeah it's a classic yeah yeah it's very
44:35
good
44:36
um i also did a bit of uh reading about
44:38
just other people who drank a lot
44:39
okay so oliver reed oh yeah the great
44:42
hell raises of the 20th century i didn't
44:43
know this he would frequently expose his
44:45
penis when drunk
44:46
standard practice i guess but he got a
44:49
tattoo of an
44:49
eagle's claw on his penis oh i know
44:53
painful well it was just a tattoo of one
44:55
it wasn't an actual claw yeah but do you
44:57
think people got confused and thought
44:58
illegal
45:01
well he then later got an eagle's head
45:02
tattooed on his shoulder
45:04
and he would show fellow drinkers his
45:06
shoulder tattoo and then he'd say would
45:07
you like to see where it's perched
45:09
and then get this
45:10
[Laughter]
45:13
wow i know that's quite a
45:15
labor-intensive practical joke is
45:17
[Laughter]
45:19
so he died on the set of gladiator you
45:21
know they had to sort of reconstitute
45:22
his role for the final film but when he
45:24
died he had 12 double rums lots of
45:26
whiskey and an arm wrestle
45:28
which of those killed him i think it was
45:31
the previous
45:32
60 odd years that killed him yeah yeah
45:34
well yeah just another
45:36
film giant is richard keel and he's the
45:39
guy who played
45:39
jaws um and jaws and
45:44
he was amazing i really believe he's
45:46
actually a sturgeon
45:51
so famous fish richard killed no he he
45:53
played jaws in the bond films
45:55
but he had lots of jobs before he became
45:57
an actor so he was
45:58
first of all he was a cemetery plot
46:00
salesman i just like the idea so he was
46:01
seven foot
46:02
two whatever three imagine someone
46:04
selling you a cemetery plot who's a
46:05
giant
46:06
and then he was a door-to-door vacuum
46:08
cleaner salesman you know how um
46:10
if you're if you bury someone they're
46:12
six feet under
46:13
he could stand at the bottom of that
46:15
plot and still talk to you
46:16
you'll be able to see his face wow
46:20
and what else was he a vacuum cleaner
46:22
vacuum cleaner salesman
46:23
and then he married a woman called diane
46:24
who was five foot one and she did an
46:27
interview
46:28
and they said yeah also sorry she's got
46:30
lovely knees
46:32
interestingly the opposite they said why
46:34
did you marry him and she said we just
46:36
see eye to eye on most things
46:37
oh sweet that's right anymore for any
46:40
more
46:41
i'm not done i'm out i'm i mean i'll
46:43
just tell you come on tell us well it's
46:44
just another hell raiser factor it's not
46:46
really relevant but
46:47
peter o'toole yeah big old drinker um
46:50
when he was filming lawrence of arabia
46:52
he
46:52
uh found and bought a precious pair of
46:54
greek earrings but he had to get
46:56
them through customs so he smuggled them
46:57
through in his foreskin
46:59
wow no i didn't expect that
47:02
i told you it wasn't brotherhood
47:06
are you sure jumbo are you sure better
47:10
get the cat as well
47:12

[Music]
00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:18
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:20
qi offices in covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:24
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:26
murray and james harkin
00:27
and once again we have gathered around
00:29
the microphones with our four favorite
00:31
facts from the last seven days
00:32
and in no particular order here we go
00:35
starting with you
00:36
james okay my fact this week is that
00:39
using too much red lipstick can make
00:40
your urine turn red that's weird so it
00:44
gets into your
00:45
um your kidneys somehow yeah
00:48
how do you wear lipstick i must have
00:49
worn it wrong times i've worn it not
00:51
wearing it on the outside are you
00:54
i screwed it up you put it on your
00:55
tongue don't you
00:57
um so i found this on the website of
01:00
improbable research our friends
01:02
at the who also make the ignoble prizes
01:05
and this was a case for 28 year old
01:07
woman
01:08
who turned up at a nephrology clinic
01:09
with a five-day history of passing red
01:12
colored urine
01:13
but she didn't have any other symptoms
01:15
she had no pain she didn't have chills
01:17
like she didn't have anything else that
01:18
could have caused
01:20
this like blood in your urine for
01:21
instance and the doctor said that the
01:24
only noticeable feature was her bright
01:26
red lipstick
01:27
which i think sounds a bit harsh
01:28
actually yeah i'm sure she had lots of
01:31
other great features
01:32
but anyway they tested all the other
01:34
things like her liver function and her
01:36
blood count and everything like that
01:38
and they found out that she would apply
01:40
her lipstick 20 to 25
01:42
times a day and they worked out that it
01:44
was the lipstick that was causing
01:45
the urine to turn red and it kind of
01:48
makes sense because like lots of things
01:50
can make your urine
01:50
turn colors like lots of food yeah so if
01:53
she's accidentally ingesting this stuff
01:55
then it could happen
01:56
is that and so that's an abnormal number
01:58
of times to reapply lipstick over the
02:00
course of a day it's certainly more than
02:01
i've ever done
02:02
yeah wow it's weird because just the
02:05
idea that
02:06
it's let's say beetroot um not known to
02:09
color your urine i don't think so much
02:10
as
02:11
the the back passage when you go to the
02:13
toilet
02:14
both yeah what what i would say more
02:17
commonly is known to color your urine
02:19
yeah it is well there was so so discreet
02:22
the way you said back pattern it also
02:24
it doesn't it doesn't color your back
02:25
passage although it might no it's more
02:28
it's more clearing the thing that comes
02:29
out of your backpack it's a bit of a
02:31
stain on me how have you
02:32
how have you been eating it
02:36
have you been having the beetroot
02:38
suppositories again yeah exactly i've
02:40
been smuggling
02:42
do you get that then yeah i do yeah i've
02:44
stopped eating beetroot off the back of
02:45
that i found it too scary to look down
02:46
to see
02:47
a blood bath in my toilet but you're all
02:50
quite special
02:50
so it's only like maximum 14 of people
02:53
who get any kind of coloration from
02:55
beetroot so it's quite lucky
02:57
to have it and what percentage through
03:01
the anus
03:02
we should say in case people start to
03:04
panic at home it does also come in the
03:06
poo
03:06
it it comes back both both sides oh okay
03:09
um
03:09
but it's yeah and it's called beturia
03:12
the condition
03:13
and it's harmless but if you suddenly
03:15
start doing it and you've never done it
03:16
before so if suddenly you beat you
03:18
your wee red or you poo red and it
03:19
hasn't happened before then you should
03:21
get it checked out because it might be
03:22
an iron deficiency because
03:24
the reason that most of us don't have
03:26
red wee when we eat beetroot is because
03:28
the iron reacts with the red pigment
03:30
which is called betalain so any iron in
03:32
our stomachs reacts with that
03:33
and so that creates a different compound
03:36
which isn't red
03:37
and so you might be iron deficient if
03:39
you're not so interesting
03:40
because you i know anna and also andy
03:43
don't like beetroot
03:44
hatred i never eat it and i love it so
03:47
if i ever have iron deficiency i'm going
03:49
to be
03:50
one of the first to know about it you
03:52
are one of the first people on earth
03:55
we could be a name you guys might be
03:56
yeah exactly but you would never know
03:58
right
03:58
yeah maybe this is why i faint 15 times
04:00
[Laughter]
04:03
um and it's it's only some lipsticks i
04:06
think that can do it and it just
04:07
happened that this lady was doing it
04:09
because apparently most of them dissolve
04:10
in fats and so once once even if you
04:13
apply
04:14
certain lipsticks lots of times a day
04:15
you might be all right we won't turn red
04:17
but as well
04:18
when we go on tar we ask people to send
04:20
their own facts
04:21
and one of the most common ones that i
04:23
get is that if you want to choose the
04:26
perfect shade of nude lipstick
04:28
as in that looks natural then you should
04:30
get the color that is the same color as
04:32
your nipples
04:33
oh this is an unbelievably common fact
04:36
that i get said it's so weird that it's
04:38
one of the few that i get like
04:39
five or six times every talk it's
04:42
because you keep wearing lipstick that
04:43
really clashes
04:44
with the rest of your face and because i
04:46
do the topless
04:48
why he's got green nipples
04:52
and this apparently is kind of half true
04:55
so um
04:56
it came from most people got it from a
04:58
um
04:59
show called the doctors on nbc they
05:02
famously mentioned this
05:03
and they say that it generally does work
05:05
but then washington university medical
05:08
center when asked about this did point
05:09
out that your nipple
05:10
color does change throughout your life
05:13
so it's kind of an average works but if
05:15
your nipples have changed color recently
05:17
then maybe yeah well they go grey don't
05:20
they as you age
05:23
that's right yeah and you should wear
05:25
gray lipstick yeah
05:27
so wait should you take an average of
05:30
your lifetime nipple color and always
05:31
use that lipstick or should you have
05:32
your lipstick vary in accordance with
05:34
your nipple color
05:35
i think you should go into the lipstick
05:37
shop yeah
05:38
get the color of your nipples and then
05:41
if it doesn't look right
05:42
i've tried that but whenever i expose
05:43
myself in lipstick shops i get removed
05:45
from the building
05:46
what you need is a top that only exposes
05:48
your nipple so you can subtly compare
05:50
the lipstick color to the nipple color i
05:52
don't know how subtle that kind of top
05:54
is going to be
05:55
i've just got a thing just as we were
05:56
talking about beetroot before because
05:58
beetroot was actually
05:59
a substitute for lipstick during the war
06:02
during the second world war yeah so
06:04
there was a big push that the english
06:05
government did
06:06
which they had a slogan for which was
06:08
beauty is duty
06:10
and this was a this was a thing because
06:12
hitler supposedly
06:13
really disapproved of makeup so the
06:15
british government wanted to make it a
06:17
proud thing in the country and they
06:18
released there were certain lipsticks
06:20
that were released during world war ii
06:21
that were called like
06:22
regimental red or lips in uniform but
06:25
this was before
06:26
rationing became you know the materials
06:28
were sort of depleting and so they
06:30
stopped doing it but as a result women
06:31
still
06:32
wanted to sort of keep up the appearance
06:34
of makeup so
06:35
beetroot juice was done in place of
06:37
lipstick um and um
06:39
mascara and so on and boot polish was
06:41
used as well as but yeah it was
06:42
interesting
06:43
you know beetroot juice yeah hitler
06:46
didn't like lipstick
06:47
no because he's vegetarian he said that
06:50
lipstick was evil because it was made
06:52
from
06:52
animal fat rescued from sewage ah
06:55
so wait a minute but it is kind of made
06:57
with animal products a lot of
06:59
makeup right yes it is much less than
07:01
used to be but yes
07:02
but the red in lipstick for centuries
07:06
has come from these bugs
07:09
insects yeah i think now they often make
07:11
plant-based but yeah but in hitler's
07:12
time they didn't use catching the law
07:14
uh i think maybe sometimes they did not
07:16
necessarily rescue from sewage though
07:19
definitely but it's had this weird
07:21
history lipstick where it's just gone in
07:23
and out of
07:24
fashion and popularity and it's been
07:26
condemned and then praised and condemned
07:28
and then praised and so
07:29
just before the elizabethan period it
07:31
was basically evil so catholic priests
07:33
would say that you know a woman wearing
07:35
lipstick was essentially the spawn of
07:36
satan
07:37
you'd have to go to confession and
07:39
confess that you'd worn lipstick
07:41
and it was it was thought as being
07:43
deceitful
07:44
so you were deceiving men into falling
07:47
in love with you and you could it was
07:48
grounds for annulment for instance
07:50
in a lot of places in pennsylvania i
07:52
think and
07:53
in britain for a time it was grounds
07:54
foreign if you married a woman
07:58
who had worn lipstick at some point
08:00
while seducing you
08:02
that's false advertising false
08:04
advertising
08:05
were there under this law i imagine
08:07
there were a few but they were mostly
08:10
loopholes
08:12
yeah it wasn't any man who got home woke
08:15
up next to his wife the next morning
08:16
went oh my god what are they
08:18
yeah wait a minute your nipples and lips
08:20
are completely different colors
08:23
so in egypt prostitutes had to wear
08:27
lipstick
08:28
and the reason being that if they didn't
08:30
they would be punished because it
08:31
implied that they were deceitfully
08:33
posing as ladies god you just can't it's
08:36
a rough beat being a woman wearing
08:38
lipstick or not wearing lipstick isn't
08:39
it
08:40
yeah either you get your marriage
08:41
cancelled or you get mistaken for a
08:42
prostitute or
08:44
but then in in other times then you're
08:45
really popular like queen elizabeth
08:47
loved it and so it became popular then
08:49
so i think it's important if you're a
08:50
woman
08:50
time traveling to know exactly what time
08:53
period you've been
08:54
dropped in as to whether you wear the
08:55
lipstick also important to be a queen
08:58
rather than the prostitute yes
09:00
yeah generally speaking easier life yeah
09:04
um if you did if you wear a prostitute
09:06
wearing lipstick
09:07
in ancient egypt or ancient greece then
09:09
you made it out of quite weird stuff
09:11
but actually one reason why being a
09:13
prostitute might have been better than a
09:14
queen is that you couldn't afford the
09:16
good stuff
09:16
which was actually often the materials
09:19
that really damaged you and poisoning
09:20
like
09:21
exactly but you so you made um
09:24
substitute so they'd make it from sheep
09:25
sweat
09:26
was very popular apparently i don't even
09:27
know how you harvest that and human
09:29
saliva and crocodile excrement
09:31
in ancient greece i have the thing about
09:34
crocodile excrement that i don't think
09:35
it's actually crocodile excrement
09:38
i think it's a metaphor for egyptian
09:40
soil i knew that you thought that for
09:42
um contraceptives but do you think it's
09:44
the same for this
09:46
so yeah i might be wrong though i mean
09:47
it seems like clear doesn't they're
09:49
going around french kissing a crocodile
09:51
pat
09:51
what's what sheeps were a metaphor for
09:54
something
09:55
don't know how do you get sheet sweat do
09:57
you wring them out
09:59
how do you get it yeah i don't know and
10:02
that wouldn't be red though
10:04
i imagine i think the earth would be red
10:06
but the sheep sweat was just gonna make
10:08
your lips taste a bit salty don't hippos
10:11
sweats
10:12
red or purple they do they were very
10:15
popular around there don't want to get
10:16
up and harvest hippo's sweat do you just
10:18
for a bit of lipstick
10:20
no but you could i suppose if you lived
10:21
with a bunch of sisters maybe you'd have
10:22
a room where you kept the hippo
10:24
and you just ran and snogged it quickly
10:26
and then around why are you smoking the
10:27
headphones the quickest way to get the
10:28
lipstick on
10:29
yeah no it's hippo sweat yeah no you're
10:32
not kissing it in the mouth
10:33
you're just wearing sweatshirts oh
10:34
you're just kissing the hippo's side
10:35
yeah
10:36
right um queen elizabeth was wearing an
10:38
inch of lipstick when she died
10:39
apparently
10:40
though she come on do you know how big
10:43
an inch is
10:45
i'm just reporting what people reported
10:47
at the time it's like those trout pouts
10:49
that you get these days when you put
10:50
botox in your lips and that kind of
10:52
makes them stick out about half an inch
10:54
she looked like one of those botox gone
10:56
wrong she was lipstick gone wrong
10:57
it can't be true anna it can't be true i
11:00
think an inch is probably an
11:01
exaggeration from the time you know
11:02
people are seeing a bit blurry when
11:04
someone's died
11:05
you would say the only way is the earl
11:06
of essex
11:08
because he was one of her favorites and
11:09
of course that's a big lip look that's
11:11
popular on that tv show
11:12
of course of course
11:15
[Music]
11:17
okay it's time for fact number two and
11:19
that is andy
11:21
my fact is that some maggots can jump 40
11:23
times their own length
11:24
but only in august
11:29
i know it's true so we've just missed it
11:32
if you want to see it you've got to wait
11:33
another year i'm sorry so this is
11:35
this is a specific species of maggot uh
11:38
or
11:38
fly because maggots of the larvae of fly
11:41
is called asvandilia
11:42
and they're only a third of a centimeter
11:44
long but they've been observed jumping
11:46
up to 12 centimeters which is really
11:48
impressive
11:49
yeah it's the equivalent of a human
11:50
jumping 200 feet
11:52
yeah yeah although we always say this
11:55
it's not
11:55
exact equivalent because it's much
11:57
easier for small things to jump
11:59
these distances than big things it's the
12:00
equivalence of a miniaturized human
12:03
jumping 12 centimeters yeah and what say
12:05
with the size of a maggot it's very
12:06
impressive
12:07
and are they practicing for when they
12:09
fly is that
12:11
the idea yes they are yeah yeah um
12:15
no it's it's actually an escape plan so
12:18
they
12:18
they're hatched out onto these plants
12:20
and then they need to make a swift exit
12:21
because they're very
12:22
uh easy prey when they're just sitting
12:24
around on these plants
12:26
so they need to jump quite far they're
12:28
born in galls
12:29
you know the larvae are laid in plants
12:32
the mothers lay the eggs in plants
12:34
and these create swellings called ghouls
12:35
and they hatch out of them so then they
12:37
need to escape
12:38
and the cool thing is um they have no
12:41
legs and yet they jump yeah how are they
12:44
doing that
12:44
what like a slinky is it sort of like
12:46
the suppressed spring
12:48
yeah yeah basically yeah cool sort of
12:51
improvise a leg
12:52
uh i've seen you're improvising
12:57
very good as it is you don't suddenly
12:58
sprout a leg no you're right we don't do
13:00
whole
13:00
limb work um well that's why he's
13:02
recently been replaced with a maggot
13:06
they sort of fold themselves up so you
13:09
know how octopuses sometimes make
13:10
artificial elbows
13:11
right you know they just fold their limb
13:14
at a certain point so they do that and
13:15
they
13:16
they build up a load of pressure leaning
13:18
against that slightly folded leg and
13:20
then they
13:20
flick they release and they flick
13:22
themselves into the air but they also
13:23
have on either end
13:24
these kind of little hairs that when
13:26
they touch each other so when they bend
13:28
forward it's like touching your toes
13:29
they kind of it's like an adhesive so it
13:31
holds on really strong
13:32
and as they push all this liquid down
13:34
into their bottom the tension gets
13:36
greater and greater but they're still
13:37
hanging on and when that snaps they just
13:39
falling into the air yeah
13:40
nice do you have a very relatable
13:42
octopus-based analogy to help me
13:44
understand that better
13:46
no it's just who knows the octopus elbow
13:49
thing i'm not
13:50
sure if we've talked about that we
13:51
probably have but it's pretty arcane
13:53
isn't it
13:53
people aren't going to remember all
13:54
those things yeah you're right
13:57
so related factors that octopuses
13:58
sometimes improvise elbows which is
14:00
pretty cool
14:01
like if you're chatting to me in the pub
14:03
you could say that because you know that
14:05
i'm yeah
14:07
do not improvise your own limbs at home
14:10
uh yeah that's incredible
14:11
we've we've missed the big one here
14:12
though why just august what's going on
14:14
that it's oh yeah
14:15
one month of the year is it because the
14:17
football season's just started and they
14:18
get really excited yeah
14:20
um do you know i don't think we do know
14:23
exactly what it is
14:24
it may be because they hatch in august
14:26
yes and then after august they've turned
14:28
into flies
14:29
yeah and they don't need to do this
14:30
jumping trick anymore
14:32
okay i think that's a bit i'm genuinely
14:35
not sure i did have a look at the paper
14:36
and it wasn't actually very clear why
14:38
this happens okay
14:39
okay okay and apparently this study came
14:42
after um the group was had a load of
14:44
these goal
14:45
um maggots in a in a petri dish and then
14:48
they came to look at them and there were
14:49
only two left because they were jumping
14:51
all around the office
14:52
and they thought oh i'm gonna have to
14:53
properly study this
14:55
that's so funny um yeah maggots are
14:57
really cool
14:58
no actually they can get really hot go
15:01
on
15:02
uh because when they eat they um
15:05
increase their temperature because of
15:06
all the digestive juices and they're
15:08
kind of wriggling around and stuff like
15:10
that
15:10
and there's usually a load of them in
15:12
one little place and they're all
15:13
wriggling and they're all getting hotter
15:14
and hotter and hotter
15:15
and sometimes it can get so hot that
15:17
they start to die oh
15:19
that doesn't have a funny jokey factory
15:21
ending at all
15:24
but they do they i think they can
15:25
sometimes recognize that this is
15:27
starting to happen
15:28
like you know the guy next to him has
15:30
just died so this is getting too hot so
15:32
what they'll do is
15:32
they'll as a group just retreat to a
15:34
cooler place well actually it's like
15:37
the ones that are in it's a bit like you
15:38
know um groups of penguins
15:40
again this is the kind of thing that me
15:42
and i are gonna know in our conversation
15:44
but most people want
15:45
so like the ones on the outsides move to
15:46
the inside the ones to the inside move
15:48
to the outside
15:48
to kind of keep the temperature do they
15:50
do that yeah imagine being in a
15:52
restaurant and people are just going so
15:53
crazy about the food they start dying
15:56
that is an exciting but also stressful
15:57
restaurant opening isn't it
15:59
i think it's like being in a mosh pit
16:00
and getting so hot people die which
16:02
maybe they would yeah
16:03
but the thing that's like the penguins
16:05
is also how they manage to eat so fast
16:07
so
16:08
maggots are useful for things like
16:10
clearing up garbage you can use
16:12
maggots for clearing up our trash and
16:13
stuff because they can consume stuff at
16:15
an amazing rate for their size they
16:16
can't carry it away quite as quickly as
16:18
the bin man
16:22
they're working up to it and your
16:23
neighbors really hate you by the way
16:24
anna
16:25
you're just pouring bags and bags of
16:27
maggots over your bins every week
16:29
it's gotta stop they're very efficient
16:32
we've gotta give them work
16:33
[Laughter]
16:35
um so they do this and they are less
16:37
efficient than the bin men but
16:39
they the reason they are still efficient
16:40
is that for instance if you've got a
16:41
lump of food
16:42
then there'll be let's say 100 maggots
16:44
and they'll form a little mountain that
16:46
climbs up the mound
16:47
and the maggots can eat solidly for
16:50
about five minutes and then they get a
16:51
bit tired and they need a break
16:53
and so there'll be maggots pushing them
16:55
further and further up the mound of food
16:56
because there are maggots cueing behind
16:58
them
16:58
and then once they get to the top of the
17:00
mound then they've had enough food
17:01
and they tumble off the top and back to
17:03
the back of the queue and the next
17:05
maggot is up there they're eating it
17:07
so it's like a cycle it's like going up
17:09
the escalator on the tube
17:10
yeah and eats you have to eat one uh
17:13
donut every time you go
17:14
three feet up yeah but then you get to
17:16
the top and you're full of donuts
17:18
and then you go down there
17:20
[Laughter]
17:22
look this analogy did start to fall away
17:25
so the other thing they can so this
17:28
thing of mounding themselves up
17:30
um i read an article saying that they
17:32
can be mischievous sometimes maggots
17:34
and that's a bit of a stretch but if you
17:36
keep them in
17:38
a glass enclosure without food and
17:40
without a lid
17:41
they will organize themselves into a
17:43
prison break because they will all get
17:45
together
17:46
in a corner and they will push up and up
17:48
and up they'll pile up until the ones at
17:49
the top can escape
17:50
cool so if you keep maggots if you're a
17:53
scientist
17:54
you sometimes have to have a moat around
17:55
them to stop them escaping wow
17:57
isn't that crazy yeah that's awesome
17:58
wait how do they decide who the poor
18:00
kind of bruce willis and armageddon guy
18:02
is who stays behind
18:04
everyone i don't know but i think most
18:06
of them stay behind don't they yeah yeah
18:07
really it's only a few of a few brave
18:09
souls make it out
18:10
yeah yeah i guess i guess the most
18:13
intelligent ones get to go out
18:14
now it will be the strongest ones but
18:17
they've got to get
18:18
they've got to find a way of busting the
18:19
rest out so who do you free
18:21
of course probably a group of maybe five
18:23
or six you'd have one quite strong one
18:25
one really smart one one sexy one yeah
18:29
well just to keep the others entertained
18:31
[Laughter]
18:33
um speaking of sexy they could breathe
18:35
through their bottoms
18:38
breathe breathe yeah not breed oh yeah
18:41
they breathe through their buttons and
18:43
that's how another way that they eat
18:45
really quickly because they can just
18:46
continuously eat like you say until they
18:48
get tired because they're breathing out
18:50
their bum yeah so they don't need to
18:51
breathe out their mouths
18:52
that's great that's amazing that's so
18:54
cool but it means they can't poo
18:56
as quickly as we can because they need
18:58
to break constantly during pooing you
19:00
want to breathe
19:00
idiots then they switch back to mouth
19:04
breathing while they're having a poo
19:05
yeah
19:06
what they can't do is eat a hot dog and
19:08
have a poo at the same time we can do
19:10
that yeah
19:11
so that's why we are a higher being than
19:13
maggots
19:14
yeah i mean again i'm not coming to any
19:16
of your restaurant openings
19:18
that's the big pitch
19:22
you'll notice your seats are also
19:24
toilets and go
19:27
so they do they do love rotting meat and
19:29
that was the cause of this
19:30
massive misinformation campaign about
19:32
maggots that went on until about 200
19:34
years ago which is the spontaneous
19:35
generation thing
19:37
which i don't think we've talked about
19:38
before but so
19:40
everyone used to think that maggots were
19:41
spontaneously generated out of dead
19:43
flesh because you'd have a rotting
19:45
carcass and then
19:46
maggots would suddenly appear and flies
19:48
would come out of that
19:49
and that's just how people thought life
19:51
happened kind of makes sense when you
19:52
think of it
19:53
if you didn't know you know there's
19:55
absolutely no reason you wouldn't think
19:56
it if you didn't know what we know now
19:58
and it was finally proven in 1668 by
20:01
this guy called francesco reddy
20:03
that flies come from maggots and flies
20:05
aren't just spontaneously
20:07
produced from carcasses and he did that
20:09
by putting sort of rotting meat in jars
20:11
and some of the jars he'd cover up and
20:13
some he wouldn't and he'd be like look
20:14
life isn't in the jars that i covered up
20:17
but he had to because he was around
20:19
about the time of galileo and lots of
20:20
other scientists who were getting
20:22
in trouble with the church so every time
20:24
he found something out like this he
20:25
had to go through the bible and find a
20:27
bit of bible passage that supported it
20:29
so he'd find the bible passage that said
20:31
all life comes from life
20:32
so it's okay god's on my side don't
20:34
worry about it
20:35
wow i mean he it sounds like he would
20:38
have been quite low on the church's
20:39
inquisition list
20:40
after galileo galileo's saying some
20:42
pretty punchy things about the
20:44
relationship between the earth and the
20:45
sun
20:45
this is just a guy with meat jars i
20:47
don't know
20:48
it was a huge deal it really is like
20:50
suggesting that life couldn't come out
20:52
of nothing
20:52
questioning where life came from was a
20:54
massive deal because where did jesus
20:56
not jesus where did god go jesus wasn't
20:59
a maggot
21:00
but how did god make life if we're
21:03
saying life always comes from life and
21:05
you need the original thing how did you
21:06
make it in one day okay okay let's get
21:09
him in for some inquisition
21:11
he's a big man yeah but his his ideas
21:14
his ideas are debunked the debunked
21:16
ideas dated back to
21:18
uh anaximander of miletus and he thought
21:21
something really cool so he was 7th
21:22
century bc he was the first person who
21:24
posited this idea of spontaneous
21:26
generation
21:27
of life and he thought how it happened
21:28
was he looked at fetuses
21:30
of children and he thought they looked
21:31
kind of fishy and so what he thought was
21:34
that um
21:34
he thought that if water warmed up with
21:36
the sun then it sort of created
21:39
a fish okay so there'd be this reaction
21:41
which created a living fish
21:42
and then some fish gestated and gave
21:44
birth to other fish and then others that
21:46
decided to just state for longer
21:48
would eventually create a human and so
21:50
he said
21:51
fish would crawl up onto the bank when
21:53
they were really far into their
21:54
pregnancy
21:55
give birth to an adult human and then
21:57
that adult human would go away and have
21:58
people
21:59
he's kind of right in a way he's just
22:01
missing out millions and millions of
22:02
years of evolution
22:04
like he's kind of right that you end up
22:06
with a human and you start with a fish
22:08
yeah you're
22:08
right yeah he just sped it up a lot it
22:10
was fast forward it was darwin in fast
22:12
forward
22:13
amazing
22:14
[Music]
22:17
okay it is time for fact number three
22:20
and that
22:20
is anna my fact this week is that humans
22:24
may have developed
22:25
motion sickness to stop us falling out
22:27
of trees
22:28
and read the rest of it i've got just a
22:31
theory but an interesting one
22:33
from what you said around yeah whenever
22:34
i pitch that
22:36
it gets a flat out no and here we are
22:39
just a crazy idea
22:40
well this is an idea from scientists not
22:43
from some crazy
22:44
yeti fanatic in arkansas
22:48
i'm sorry she doesn't mean that mike
22:52
the theory is about uh how we and other
22:55
great apes
22:56
lived up trees as many others
23:00
we're the greatest of all the years all
23:02
right donald trump let's calm down
23:04
and basically if we ever lived up trees
23:06
millions of years ago
23:08
hundreds of thousands of years ago then
23:09
it was quite bad for us to want to climb
23:11
really really high up
23:12
onto the really wobbly branches because
23:13
that made it more likely that it would
23:15
snap
23:15
and you'd fall off and die and that's
23:18
why we developed motion sickness
23:20
and the fact is that chimps and things
23:22
that still do live in trees do avoid
23:24
going on those wobbly branches
23:25
and lots of other animals do have motion
23:27
sickness so it does seem to be like a
23:29
risk aversion thing
23:30
because if you don't the thing about
23:32
falling out of a tree i guess is
23:34
it's quite hard to learn from your
23:36
mistakes gradually
23:37
and involve that gradually because once
23:39
you've fallen out you're either really
23:40
severely injured or you're dead
23:42
um and they've looked at they looked
23:43
into this i was reading a book about
23:46
this and it talks about the actual
23:47
frequency that elicits motion sickness
23:49
the amount of wobble
23:51
the pace of the wobble and it is about
23:53
the same frequency
23:54
as the trees that people would have been
23:56
in would have swayed at
23:58
wow i've also read that it's about the
24:00
same frequency as
24:02
is generated by wind-generated waves so
24:05
there's another theory that it's from
24:07
under the water because fish also get
24:08
motion sickness
24:09
yeah and if you get wind blowing waves
24:12
it makes you feel a bit woozy you get to
24:14
a certain
24:14
point where actually it's quite
24:16
dangerous and so you have to get away
24:18
from those areas
24:19
same thing fish have the aversion
24:21
because then you get disoriented if
24:22
you're being swept around by the waves
24:24
fish get seasick yeah fish get sick
24:27
humans get landsick yes if you go on a
24:30
boat for too long and then you walk off
24:32
the boat for a while
24:33
you feel really woozy it's a french
24:35
thing called malda de bachma
24:37
which is like malda mayor it's
24:39
seasickness and mother de buckman is
24:40
illness from
24:42
disembarking yeah i mean you also can
24:44
call it just call it lansing
24:46
yeah i mean that's what the french do
24:48
color i suppose but
24:49
yeah no there's a french podcast right
24:51
now saying it is called land secrets
24:53
um it's so weird to think of all the
24:55
ancestors of ours
24:57
as in the you know um ape-like ancestors
25:00
of us who didn't have motion sickness
25:03
who then died as a result because they
25:04
were climbing they didn't know not to
25:06
climb a wobbly tree
25:07
yeah and as a result they died out
25:10
because they're in many ways the
25:11
superior beings
25:12
because they could climb so much higher
25:13
they don't get seasick yeah yeah
25:16
right
25:20
and just on their c thing as well um
25:22
just because it's a fact
25:23
the word nausea comes from the same word
25:26
as nautical
25:27
or something like that because it's to
25:28
do with the sea this is to do with
25:30
seasickness originally okay
25:32
ancient greek well just on seasickness
25:34
as well i was reading that nelson
25:36
suffered severe seasickness his entire
25:39
life
25:39
from age 12 onwards to his death the guy
25:42
was constantly vomiting
25:43
on both why do you not become a tree so
25:45
exactly
25:48
well he said he did he wrote letters
25:50
about it didn't he sign off
25:51
in his letters to his lovers he'd sign
25:54
off your affectionate seasick nelson
25:56
and he said i am ill every time it blows
25:58
hard and
25:59
maybe this means something else yeah he
26:01
was writing to his lovers
26:03
[Laughter]
26:04
we're unclear he said nothing but my
26:06
love of the profession keeps me at sea
26:07
for more than an hour so wow
26:09
you really love what you do it doesn't
26:11
matter if you vomit throughout do you
26:12
know another great nautical
26:14
hero who had seasickness um
26:17
jacques cousteau well captain ahab
26:19
entirely possible but
26:21
it's the last captain bird's eye
26:24
yeah he was really seasick his finger
26:26
guy the fish finger guy
26:28
did he was he an actual captain that one
26:30
was he like just an actor he was an
26:32
actor
26:32
for tv adverts but that well this was
26:36
the big pitch where they unveiled him to
26:37
the public
26:38
he's called mitch commons he was a south
26:40
african and he really looked apart you
26:42
know great big bushy beard
26:44
and probably looked like captain bird's
26:45
eye but then he got very recently
26:47
replaced by a man called ricardo asserby
26:50
an italian
26:51
who is basically a model he's really
26:53
really like he's too good looking to be
26:55
captain bird's eye seriously yeah
26:57
how bizarre and he's quite young as well
26:59
and
27:00
the whole thing just stinks does he have
27:01
a big gray does he have a beard
27:03
he's got a bit so is it like a big white
27:05
beard it's more like an iron gray hunky
27:08
modelly beard
27:09
if you want to get off with this guy you
27:10
just give him a call yeah if you want a
27:12
bird's eye view
27:16
it's better than the fish
27:23
the thing is that a lot of people get
27:24
motion sickness now because we driving
27:26
cars
27:27
which we didn't evolve to do and people
27:30
use vr
27:31
stuff like headsets and stuff and that's
27:33
a real problem with um
27:34
people getting motion sickness
27:36
apparently there are some
27:38
vr games where 100 of users get motion
27:42
sickness like literally everyone
27:44
and usually for most games it's between
27:46
40 and 70 percent of people get
27:48
it so it's like a really common thing
27:50
motion sickness
27:51
and yet admirably like ratio lord nelson
27:53
they're so passionate
27:54
about the pursuit that they will make
27:56
this exactly my wife plays them all the
27:58
time it's almost as if being in a
27:59
virtual reality is preferable to be
28:01
married to me
28:03
she's throwing up constantly but does
28:05
she write your list but then she puts
28:07
the vr set up sure
28:09
did she write you letters from inside
28:10
the game saying you're affectionate
28:12
seasick polina
28:14
um have you heard of the ss bessemer
28:17
this is a very cool anti-sea sickness
28:20
innovation from the victorian times it
28:23
was a steamer ship across the english
28:24
channel
28:25
for passengers and it was experimental
28:28
it was a guy called henry bessemer who
28:30
invented it
28:30
and the idea was it had a room inside it
28:33
which would be suspended
28:36
using incredibly elaborate
28:38
counterweights and counterbalances and
28:39
all sorts of mechanics
28:40
to keep it exactly in position while the
28:43
ship moved
28:44
up and down waves and left really cool
28:46
yeah
28:47
um so he built a model of it at his
28:49
house huge model
28:50
which could you know the thing would
28:52
move around and the room would stay the
28:53
same
28:54
and it got a lot of investment and on
28:56
its first trial
28:57
it couldn't quite uh sail properly i
29:00
think partly due to this stuff inside it
29:02
and it smashed into the pier at kelly it
29:04
was slightly
29:05
fixed and then on
29:08
he said oh we haven't had enough time to
29:10
fix it properly so it had only one
29:12
public voyage
29:13
um and it crashed into the calais pier
29:15
again
29:17
i find it just did it have a massive
29:20
magnet in it or something
29:21
[Laughter]
29:22
it was a disaster is i wonder if that's
29:25
the same bessemer as did the bessemer
29:27
process
29:28
for smelting aluminium or whatever i
29:30
don't know
29:32
as well sounds like it doesn't know what
29:36
he's doing
29:37
they designed something that's not a
29:38
boat clearly if it's just constantly
29:40
crashing
29:41
i don't know was there nobody steering
29:43
it it had people steering i can't say
29:45
it's not a boat just because it crashes
29:46
you can't say the titanic is not a boat
29:48
[Laughter]
29:50
just a rock as far as i'm concerned
29:53
um we should talk about what's actually
29:54
going on so it's just the the difference
29:57
is the difference of information between
29:58
what your eyes are seeing when you're on
30:00
a ship this is
30:01
so your eyes are seeing let's say a
30:03
stable room because you're
30:05
in a ship room and you're moving with
30:07
the ship so it's all the same to you
30:08
but your body uh your inner ear uh can
30:11
tell that you're moving around
30:12
and actually that's the case in all
30:14
these things right so if you're in a car
30:16
it's the same you're reading a book
30:17
which is still but actually everything
30:19
else is moving around you yeah
30:20
but there's a third thing as well so
30:23
apart from your eyes and your inner ear
30:24
there's a third bit of your body which
30:26
is also
30:26
sending you conflicting information
30:28
guess what it is yeah okay
30:30
um were you saying your eyes your ear
30:32
and this little
30:34
boxing bag at the back of your mouth
30:37
the uvula yeah yeah yeah you can imagine
30:40
that would work
30:41
if it's tilting over yeah nice okay no
30:44
great guess great guess is it somewhere
30:46
is it sort of in your crotch somewhere
30:48
uh oh it's close you're so close oh is
30:50
it in your bottom
30:51
if you're sitting down it's in your
30:52
bottom and this is oh
30:54
what is outside of my bottom when i'm
30:56
standing up but inside my butt
30:58
your feet if you're standing up you can
30:59
tell this through your feet and if
31:00
you're sitting down through your body
31:02
and it's a sense called proprioception
31:05
and it's where um if you're swaying
31:08
there is sudden there's more pressure on
31:10
one side of your feet
31:12
and then on the other you know what i
31:13
mean yeah your body senses this and that
31:16
is another thing that can give you
31:17
motion sickness
31:18
or if you're sitting down it's on your
31:19
bottom yeah and it's like when you're on
31:20
a tube train you know you can feel the
31:22
acceleration really strongly on one side
31:24
yeah
31:24
it takes off yeah that's really cool um
31:26
other things that get seasickness
31:27
oh yeah uh for i mean loads of stuff
31:30
does really
31:31
so dogs people anyone who's had a dog
31:33
will know that they get motion sick
31:34
because it's bloody irritating in the
31:35
car
31:36
um mice uh amphibians fish we've said
31:39
frogs get it quite badly so they tested
31:42
this but they often test it by putting
31:43
them in parabolic conditions so
31:45
simulating weightlessness by sort of
31:47
spinning or spinning them round to
31:49
simulate this sort of
31:50
um concentric movement and so i was
31:53
reading a study about whether frogs get
31:55
motion sick and they said the way we
31:57
find out is we put them in these
31:58
containers and then we subject them to
32:00
parabolic flight and then we open the
32:02
containers and the presence of vomitus
32:04
in their containers after flight
32:06
will be used to indicate if they get
32:08
motion sick
32:09
my my wife we've brought her up before
32:11
today but she's going on one of these
32:13
parabolic flights next year
32:16
yeah so i wonder if she'll vomit yeah
32:19
well do you know how you can tell is by
32:20
the presence of vomitus
32:22
in the almost i mean is that just vomit
32:25
us
32:25
it's latin for vomit i mean why do they
32:27
need to still say vomiting it's bizarre
32:29
i looked this up because i thought they
32:30
must have made that up yep it's just
32:32
vomiters the definition is the stuff
32:34
that comes out of your mouth when you
32:35
vomit
32:36
it's vomit wow but anyway it turns out
32:39
they are different to us and how they
32:41
seasick themselves are we talking about
32:43
frogs frogs yes
32:44
because they don't throw up at the time
32:46
they throw up afterwards
32:48
which is actually quite considerate so
32:49
they will wait until the cars stopped or
32:51
they won't do it on the roller coaster
32:52
but it usually happens between a few
32:54
minutes and 24 hours afterwards almost
32:56
like a hangover
32:57
vomit right yeah yes i was reading that
33:00
the
33:00
guys who built the golden gate bridge uh
33:02
the builders supposedly were put on a
33:04
special diet by
33:06
the leader of the the construction works
33:08
a guy called strauss i can't find any
33:10
detail though about what that diet was
33:12
but the idea was the diet was
33:14
for motion sickness it was for dizziness
33:16
because people were very scared when
33:17
they were building this bridge you know
33:19
you had to climb very high
33:21
and so supposedly there was a diet to
33:22
stop that but a really cool extra thing
33:24
about that was what they ended up doing
33:26
was they built
33:27
a giant net under the bridge cost 130
33:30
000 and it was like a circus trapeze net
33:33
and the idea was
33:34
the dizziness would have been a huge
33:36
factor in the construction pace
33:38
that was going on yeah and by building
33:39
this little um netting
33:41
it meant that people could go and work
33:44
harder
33:44
with the knowledge that they would
33:45
probably survive if they fell off
33:48
and 19 people did fall off oh my god did
33:51
they all live yeah yeah then they became
33:52
what was known as
33:53
part of the halfway to hell club so yeah
33:55
when was that built did you say it was
33:57
19
33:58
20's 36. okay so they probably wouldn't
34:01
have had any effective
34:03
actual medicines at that time to deal
34:05
with seasickness because they what the
34:06
drugs weren't invented until the 50s
34:08
and the drugs just switch off the
34:09
information coming from the inner ear
34:11
that we've today um so the victorian
34:14
cures involved sucking lemons
34:16
which did absolutely no good no just did
34:18
not help
34:19
um there were loads of cures which
34:21
didn't do any good actually opium
34:22
i think did something good but opium is
34:25
good for everything
34:26
something that removes you mentally from
34:28
any kind of reality
34:29
is probably going to stop you thinking
34:31
wherever you see things but if you're
34:32
the captain of the ship unfortunately
34:35
that's why it crashed um there are some
34:38
special glasses you can buy that have
34:40
been
34:40
made by citroen the car company uh
34:43
they're called
34:44
sea truant very
34:55
but yeah they have this blue liquid
34:56
inside them and it gives you an
34:58
artificial horizon
35:00
because a lot of it is being able to see
35:02
the horizon isn't it
35:03
being able to see that moving at the
35:05
same way as you're feeling it's moving
35:06
wow so whichever way you move it makes
35:08
the horizon look like it's in that
35:09
direction apparently they do work after
35:11
about 10 to 12 minutes your motion
35:13
sickness will just disappear but
35:16
what is the point in them because um the
35:18
only time that you're not looking at the
35:20
horizon the reason you get travel stick
35:21
is when you know you're reading or
35:22
something
35:23
and then that therefore you're not
35:25
looking outside you're not seeing the
35:26
world go by but if you're wearing these
35:27
weird horizon glasses
35:29
can you read a book with them i guess
35:30
that's what i want to know can you read
35:32
can you read the book i think you're
35:33
wearing the scene
35:34
can you i think so the main reason
35:36
they've invented them actually is
35:37
because
35:38
when we have self-driving cars people
35:40
won't be
35:41
driving and looking at the road they'll
35:43
be playing video games or they'll be
35:45
reading books or yeah whatever so you
35:46
need to come up with a new way
35:48
of dealing with that because otherwise
35:51
whenever you open any self-driving car
35:52
it'll be full of vomiters
35:54
[Laughter]
36:02
oh the future is terrible
36:04
[Laughter]
36:06
[Music]
36:08
okay it's time for our final fact of the
36:10
show and that is my fact
36:11
my fact this week is to honor the us
36:14
supreme court judge antonin scalia
36:17
virginia's george mason university
36:18
school of law renamed itself
36:20
antonin scalia school of law then
36:23
immediately renamed itself again
36:25
after it was pointed out that the
36:26
acronym would be
36:29
that's wrong fair enough yeah so ass
36:32
36:33
i said didn't i yeah i went too
36:36
far on that one
36:37
so this was i think the
36:39
way it worked out is they sort of
36:41
announced this let's say on a thursday
36:42
and by tuesday there was so much public
36:44
ridicule
36:45
online uh that the school's dean made an
36:48
announcement that it was going to be
36:49
renamed off the back of it and they
36:52
named it because they'd just gotten
36:54
a massive donation from a few people
36:56
right they've got 30 million dollars
36:58
donation
36:59
10 million of it came from the charles
37:01
foundation
37:03
so they could have called it the charles
37:04
cox school of law
37:06
which would be much better it's now the
37:08
antonin scalia law school
37:10
but that's still asl which looks in an
37:12
uncharitable light like
37:15
or atlas is what i see when i see that
37:18
oh yes
37:19
okay some more stuff on acronyms yeah
37:21
does anyone know
37:22
what the acronym or what the word spam
37:25
stands for you know the uh the food
37:28
stuff yeah
37:29
rather than this i would think it's
37:31
something is it something ham
37:33
okay what would it be
37:39
well um most people would tell you that
37:42
it stands for spiced ham
37:44
that's what everyone thought it used to
37:45
mean but then according to
37:47
spam the company they now tell us that
37:50
it stands for
37:51
sizzle park and
37:54
[Music]
37:55
[Laughter]
37:58
so which i imagine might be a back
38:00
formation
38:02
yeah is it is it are they saying sizzle
38:04
comma pork
38:05
actually they're saying sizzle full stop
38:07
pork full stop
38:09
and full stop mmm full stop
38:12
i also say um to that but in a more
38:14
skeptical way i think that they would
38:16
have wanted
38:16
he always comes with a question mark at
38:18
the end every time
38:20
wow that's a that's a terrible back
38:22
formation
38:23
yeah it's so clunky the so there's a
38:26
difference between an
38:27
acronym and an initialism i think it's
38:29
very important that we nail down yeah
38:31
okay
38:32
so an acronym is well some all of these
38:35
things are
38:36
um acronyms yeah but some people say
38:38
it's not really hard and fast
38:40
that initialisms are things where it's
38:42
just strings of letters so the fbi
38:44
is an initialism ymca ymca yeah i call
38:47
it
38:48
so
38:51
um and that's the difference right if it
38:54
became a word
38:54
exactly so if people started saying i'm
38:57
going to the inca
38:59
or scuba scuba is initials but it's also
39:02
become a word in its own right
39:04
yes yes so that's contained underwater
39:06
breathing equipment
39:08
that would be scoob
39:12
yeah and also you get a very exciting
39:15
marriage of the two don't you this is
39:17
where the two come together
39:19
um it's a bit frowned upon in the
39:20
communities of initialisms with acronyms
39:22
it's like romeo and juliet but you've
39:23
got cd-rom
39:24
of course okay you've got jpeg and
39:28
that's
39:28
it actually the only two romeo and
39:30
juliettes of the initialism
39:33
so okay what's the deal with the jpeg
39:34
then uh so jpeg is j
39:36
is j is just joints joint photographic
39:38
experts group oh so
39:40
part of it you're just saying the letter
39:41
and part of it you're saying a word
39:43
exactly
39:43
wow holy wow god that is more amazement
39:46
than
39:46
that deserves well i just didn't know
39:48
what it was
39:50
though you couldn't say japan you you
39:53
couldn't say could ron
39:54
pedro drum you could but we just don't
39:57
in fact we rarely refer to cd-roms
39:59
speak i got a few things on
40:03
just name changes so um
40:06
one of the things i guess that comes up
40:08
a lot in newspapers is
40:10
that peter and the animal rights group
40:13
um they constantly want places to change
40:16
their name if there's something that's
40:18
associated
40:19
oh yeah for example we did on the
40:21
podcast that they wanted to change great
40:23
fry up to great vegan friars that's
40:25
right yeah exactly so there's
40:27
there's a town um that they wanted to
40:29
have changed it's a village called wool
40:31
it's an english village
40:32
they wanted it to be changed to vegan
40:34
wool that was their
40:35
their big pitch um did they no they
40:37
didn't in fact i can't find
40:39
a single instance where people got a
40:41
letter from peter saying change your
40:42
name and they went absolutely
40:43
i've just i've not found that yet
40:45
there's a there's a place called
40:46
leatherhead which they wanted to be
40:48
changed to pleatherhead
40:49
which play the head is an imitation
40:51
synthetic leather alternative
40:53
so that was quite nice there was the
40:55
chicken dinner road
40:57
which is a road they wanted to call
40:58
chicken road so it happens all the time
41:00
but my favorite one
41:01
is sausage street so sausage street this
41:04
is a town
41:05
which is um in france and sorry there's
41:08
a town in france it's called
41:10
sorry there's a street in a town in
41:12
france it's called
41:13
rue de la susie and which
41:16
is sausage street so they wrote a letter
41:20
to them so happy saying can you change
41:22
it from sausage street
41:23
and they obviously refuse the town mayor
41:25
say absolutely not
41:26
um but someone from the town also
41:28
pointed out that the change would be
41:30
completely out of place
41:31
because it is not named after the
41:33
sausage itself but rather
41:35
the sausage street is off the back of a
41:37
woman who they called the sausage
41:39
called suzanne tessier and she lived in
41:42
the area do we know why they called her
41:44
the sausage yeah
41:46
because when she walked she stooped over
41:48
like a sausage bending
41:50
and that was like maggot about to jump
41:53
exactly
41:55
so the street supposedly is named after
41:57
susan the
42:01
that's sausage that is so funny so if
42:04
you have
42:04
a name of a company and you're not sure
42:06
if it's going to be okay or if it's
42:08
going to be a bit of another
42:09
debacle then
42:12
sorry then you just need to try and
42:14
register it because the government will
42:16
tell you if it's too rude so
42:17
you have the its company's house and
42:19
it's the government body which registers
42:21
company names and every year they
42:22
release their list of names that they
42:24
said no to
42:24
so this year they banned 87 company
42:26
names that they refused
42:28
refused to register and some of them i
42:30
didn't get
42:31
so first of all there was purple helmet
42:32
bikes right which
42:35
so i sort of kind of did as a guest we
42:37
did a podcast the other week about what
42:39
we called
42:40
people from west bromwich albion and
42:42
purple helmet is a synonym for
42:44
that ah yeah okay oh that is
42:47
it's a convoluted way of explaining no
42:49
but that's a great way of getting
42:50
listeners to go to the previous episode
42:53
and in that episode we referenced the
42:55
one before and it's a constant change so
42:58
that's purple helmet bikes there's also
43:00
company names that weren't allowed
43:01
fannie's cabal this wasn't allowed okay
43:03
um sod it systems which i just like i
43:05
like the idea of hiring someone to fix
43:07
your computer when they're called solid
43:08
systems then just walking out going
43:10
ah sod it get a new one uh royal nuts
43:13
anus beauty
43:15
beans beauty anus beauty who thought
43:18
that would get
43:20
it's not exactly a crafty bit of
43:22
wordplay like purple helmet bikes
43:25
it does what it is on the tin puts a bit
43:27
of redness down there
43:31
sit on a beach shoot for three hours is
43:33
their first line of advice
43:35
knickers knackers knockers don't know
43:36
what they do i'd like to know
43:38
because the problem is we don't find out
43:39
what they do because these companies
43:40
don't get registered
43:41
don't they make underwear door knockers
43:44
and they kill horses
43:48
it was three best friends with three
43:49
very different talents
43:54
um in 2015 lots of people called brian
43:57
protested after thames valley police
43:59
announced that they were going to change
44:00
the name of one of their police horses
44:02
from brian to they said a godlike name
44:06
such as hercules
44:08
and people so this was if the horse
44:10
passed its tests to be a good police
44:12
horse basically and to be a qualified
44:13
police horse
44:14
and various people called brian kicked
44:15
up a fuss so brian lewis from ascot said
44:18
i think it's outrageous brian is a good
44:20
name for a horse
44:23
it's not god-like though is it he's very
44:25
famously he's not the son of god he's a
44:27
very naughty mind yes that's such a good
44:29
point
44:29
um there was another guy called brian
44:31
paulson from bracknell who said there is
44:32
no way they should be changing the name
44:34
every horse should be called brian it's
44:38
such an extreme alternative
44:41
what a world horse racing or brian's
44:44
coming up the back we're bringing up the
44:45
front and then
44:50

00:15
such thing as a fish um
00:16
my name is alex bell no a weekly episode
00:19
no what is it a weekly podcast
00:21
coming to you you're doing the qr
00:23
episode shut up shut up i'm hosting a
00:25
weekly
00:25
podcast from the offices of the qi
00:29
offices in covent garden my name is alex
00:31
bell and i'm joined by james harkin
00:33
andrew hunter murray and anna jaczynski
00:36
and
00:36
i forgot what happened next this is once
00:39
again we are gathered around the
00:40
microphone
00:41
um to share our favorite facts in the
00:43
last seven days and in no particular
00:44
order here we go
00:45
starting with you james that was the
00:48
flawless
00:49
that was really good i would say
00:50
flawless it's so nice you've given us
00:52
outtakes for a year
00:55
see we all think dan's a complete idiot
00:58
but now i see how difficult that
00:59
job is it's not easy she found respect
01:02
for the man
01:03
okay well my fact this week is that in
01:06
japan
01:06
you can buy left-handed chopsticks
01:10
amazing isn't that cool it's not amazing
01:12
because chopsticks are just a stick
01:14
how can they be left-handed you would
01:16
think they're just a stick but i went to
01:17
a shop
01:18
in nishiki market which is in kyoto and
01:21
they had a whole shop
01:22
full of chopsticks and if they were just
01:24
sticks i don't think they'd be able to
01:25
do that
01:26
i think you've been had really yeah did
01:29
you spend a lot of extra no
01:30
because i'm not left-handed so they
01:32
weren't really for me but they also had
01:34
right-handed ones which i also didn't
01:36
buy
01:37
so what do they look like so they're
01:40
they're they look like chopsticks but
01:41
they're in a box that says left-handed
01:43
oh i think okay i think you were no
01:46
there is a very very important
01:48
difference and that that is that the not
01:50
just sticks are slightly molded
01:52
and i put them on my social media to see
01:54
if people could explain what was going
01:55
on
01:56
and our good friend carried lloyd asked
01:58
her friend
01:59
who i don't know called at gumi
02:02
underscore the future is me
02:04
and at gumi underscore the future is me
02:06
on instagram
02:07
um said that they are learning
02:09
chopsticks for children
02:11
and the way they're molded is where you
02:12
put your fingers so you always put your
02:14
fingers in the right place
02:15
and obviously with left-handed people
02:16
that would be slightly different than
02:18
right-handed people
02:19
and so these are training chopsticks wow
02:22
can you get you can get training
02:23
chopsticks that are attached to each
02:24
other as well
02:25
like a hinge and a spring absolutely
02:27
don't fall apart so they're more like
02:28
tweezers
02:29
you can get those as well but these are
02:31
ones to not just show you how to pick
02:33
things up but show you how to hold them
02:35
correctly this is a bit like you know
02:36
when you're at primary school and if
02:37
you're not very good at handwriting
02:38
they put a big plastic thing on your
02:40
pencil so that you can hold it better
02:42
i don't know that no one else had that
02:45
oh i have one of those like it was like
02:47
a little rubber thing but i was
02:48
left-handed so
02:49
where are you without disadvantages
02:50
anyway okay i'm left-handed too but um
02:54
didn't get one of those so actually half
02:56
of this podcast are left-handed because
02:58
that is right-handed i know
02:59
i am yes we are not representative of
03:01
the general population and that's a good
03:02
example of where a small
03:04
sample size can be very misleading so
03:07
the left-handed chopsticks are not for
03:09
adults they're just for kids left-handed
03:11
kids when they're learning and they've
03:12
got a little groove in them
03:13
that's as i understand it if you know
03:15
any different then do
03:17
message me on twitter at james harkin or
03:19
on instagram
03:20
no such thing as james harkin and the
03:22
pictures are on there so you can just
03:23
comment on it
03:24
um because the chopsticks were brought
03:26
to japan from china of course weren't
03:29
they
03:29
and have existed in china for thousands
03:31
of years
03:33
but weren't really used we don't think
03:35
for
03:36
um the actual process of eating like we
03:38
use an iphone fork for the first couple
03:40
of thousand years they were just
03:41
basically for
03:42
reaching into boiling pots of water and
03:44
oil and
03:45
retrieving the food that's in them so
03:47
they were used in the cooking process
03:48
like
03:49
like a tong or something and they just
03:50
really have a spoon to eat off or eat
03:52
with their hands
03:53
yeah it must have been an amazing moment
03:54
where someone was just eating
03:56
cooking with their spatula equivalent
03:58
and then just started eating with it
04:00
it stays on the washing out doesn't it
04:02
yeah it does what really happened is
04:04
that around
04:06
kind of 500 a.d there was a massive
04:08
population boom in china
04:09
and food became really scarce and the
04:11
way they cut it was by cutting it in
04:12
really small pieces and that kind of
04:14
makes the
04:15
kind of eating with chopsticks a good
04:17
way of doing it
04:19
i thought it was to do with um people
04:22
dropping out the food smalls so that it
04:23
takes less cooking fuel to prepare oh
04:25
yes
04:26
because of the population boom there was
04:27
much less fuel to go around you know the
04:29
fewer trees to
04:30
chop up as firewood and stuff like that
04:32
yeah it's partly that so it was partly
04:34
that there's a really good book though
04:35
called
04:35
chopsticks by a guy called edward wang
04:38
so he looks into this and actually they
04:39
started eating
04:40
uh with chopsticks using them like as we
04:43
use in ice and forks in about 400 bc
04:45
um but it became very commonplace in 400
04:48
a.d and it's partly because of the
04:49
population boom
04:50
but also because oil became readily
04:51
available and so that's when they
04:53
started stir-frying stuff
04:54
and so that's when i guess chinese
04:56
stir-frying came in as we would know it
04:58
and obviously to stir-fry you need those
04:59
little bits
05:00
of meat and so then you don't need a
05:03
knife anymore
05:04
but the other thing as well is like you
05:05
say you would eat with a knife
05:07
before that you kind of stab things and
05:09
eat it right and that was in europe in
05:10
the middle ages as well
05:12
but the other thing is confucius thought
05:14
that you shouldn't eat with a knife
05:16
because a knife is
05:17
something you would use in war or in
05:18
aggression so he thinks it shouldn't be
05:20
something you should have around the
05:21
table
05:22
so anyone who followed confucianism also
05:24
thought that you shouldn't eat with
05:25
knives
05:25
but did you know you can get japanese
05:27
left-handed knives as well
05:28
yeah because european knives are
05:30
traditionally symmetrical because
05:31
they're obviously just sharp
05:32
but some japanese like kitchen knives
05:34
they're cut asymmetrically so the
05:36
cutting edge is supposed to be closer to
05:37
the body
05:38
so it's like at an angle so you need a
05:40
left-handed knife
05:41
wow that's interesting so it points
05:43
towards you you mean the cutting edge
05:45
the yes yeah exactly you lean the knife
05:47
slightly in towards you and you cook
05:49
when you cut and if you're left-handed
05:51
you can't really do that
05:53
total mess you lose all your fingers so
05:56
many left-handed things are just
05:57
you know not really necessary i say this
06:00
as a left-handed person like left-handed
06:01
scissors and all of this stuff i think
06:03
it's really a big crock of hooey
06:05
really yeah i do i can't cut with
06:07
scissors with my left hand i agree i
06:09
can't do that either i've tried and i
06:10
can't
06:11
you guys are right-handed you're not
06:12
supposed to yeah but how do you cut with
06:14
scissors with your right hand if we
06:16
can't cut with right-handed scissors
06:17
with your left hand
06:18
i just pointed have my fingers into the
06:20
holes that they're not supposed to fit
06:21
into and it's fine yeah we're used to
06:23
overcoming adversity
06:27
it hurts it bleeds every time i do
06:30
it they do make a big old fuss lefties
06:32
um not obviously not you
06:34
andy thank you for representing the
06:35
other side but you know about how
06:36
difficult life is and it basically all
06:38
boils down to a can opener doesn't it
06:42
can i just say i don't think we should
06:44
be annoying the left-handed community
06:46
because science has shown that they are
06:47
better at fighting
06:48
than right-handers oh what because
06:50
always surprising
06:51
yeah well that's pretty basically it
06:53
yeah also we've got the left-handed
06:54
scissors
06:55
so yeah but we've got way more
06:57
right-handed scissors
06:58
we've got way more weapons if you have
07:00
if it's a battle of
07:01
can openers and scissors our armory is
07:03
way better it would be like fighting
07:05
your own clone like it's all com
07:06
expertly matched but in opposite ways as
07:08
soon as we invent a left-handed gun
07:10
you guys will be in there there is a
07:12
left-handed gun you can get left-handed
07:14
guns
07:14
it just they're just guns in opposite so
07:16
because
07:17
you also have a dominant eye as well
07:19
often and so for people who like in the
07:21
army and stuff if you have
07:22
precision shooters precision weapon i
07:24
don't know what the verb is for
07:26
when you shoot a gun gun people like you
07:29
you need i think we're going to be
07:30
winning this war
07:35
but the general won't know the precision
07:37
gun people no
07:39
yeah but it's all it's all a reversal
07:41
that you can put your left eye on the
07:42
sights
07:42
you want to be careful saying things
07:44
like the left-handed gun is just a gun
07:45
in reverse
07:46
i don't encourage lefties to use it that
07:49
way
07:50
and i should just finish off the
07:52
fighting thing um the reason that we
07:54
think no one's really sure
07:55
but basically 90 of people are
07:58
right-handed
07:59
and so in throughout history uh people
08:01
who have been fighting have been
08:02
more likely to come across a
08:04
right-handed person so we basically
08:06
trained ourselves to fight right under
08:07
people so when a left-handed person
08:08
comes along
08:09
it's much more difficult wow and there
08:11
was a study of the careers of
08:13
ten thousand boxes and martial arts
08:15
competitors found that those who were
08:16
left had to do much better
08:17
wow um but then around this table
08:21
you guys are much more lovers than
08:22
fighters aren't you uh yeah i'd say that
08:24
you're just reading my t-shirt you
08:27
haven't been to my left-handed fight
08:28
club
08:29
after work you never talk about it
08:32
we're always very very hungry afterwards
08:34
because no one can open the cans
08:37
so i thought i had invented something in
08:39
the researching of this fact and it
08:40
turns out i haven't but i do think it's
08:42
a very good
08:43
invention so you know how you get a bowl
08:45
of noodles
08:46
and there'll be some soup with the
08:47
noodles yeah so you know normally you
08:50
eat the noodles and then you have the
08:51
soup left over and you have to lift the
08:53
bowl up often if you don't have a spoon
08:54
for example
08:55
i thought what about a chopstick straw
08:58
okay so it's a hollow chopstick and once
09:00
you've finished eating the noodles you
09:01
just
09:02
yeah isn't that just a straw there's two
09:07
okay i'll take you out straws a chinese
09:08
restaurant and you can eat with two
09:09
straws
09:10
and we'll see how well you do yeah
09:12
because i think you're gonna go hungry
09:13
so this
09:13
a guy called julian lechner has invented
09:15
it and he shamefully has not followed it
09:17
up
09:18
so he's invented one pair i think i
09:21
don't know whether he's built a pair or
09:22
whether it's
09:23
uh just at the concept stage but it
09:26
wasn't the runaway massive success that
09:27
you would anticipate
09:29
i just think it's a way of making
09:30
chopsticks lighter they use less
09:32
material
09:33
because they use millions of trees don't
09:35
they every year yeah
09:36
there's some terrifying stat that china
09:38
uses 3.8 million trees
09:40
making 57 billion pairs of chopsticks
09:42
wow that's huge
09:43
um in china they used to eat with silver
09:45
chopsticks and it was because they
09:47
thought that silva would turn black
09:49
if it touched poison food so you could
09:50
tell if your food was poisoned
09:52
but actually silver often turns black
09:55
when it comes into contact with hydrogen
09:56
sulfide
09:57
and that's something that you get a lot
09:59
in foods like garlic
10:00
and onions and eggs so pretty much every
10:02
time they cook with garlic
10:04
it's poisoned it's good for vampires
10:07
though well unless they stab themselves
10:08
with it actually no it's not a good
10:10
vampire what no it is because you'd know
10:12
if there's any garlic yeah but also
10:13
silver bullets kill them and
10:15
a silver chopstick will probably do some
10:17
damage you'd have to be a clumsy clumsy
10:18
vampire
10:19
stab yourself in the heart with a
10:20
chopstick while eating
10:22
i'm a clumsy eater but i've never done
10:24
that yeah but they're always eating in
10:26
the dark so they're at a disadvantage
10:28
actually chopsticks can be used as
10:30
weapons
10:31
and i learned how to do this at ninja
10:33
training a few weeks ago
10:35
for the eye um well yeah i guess
10:39
you would aim for whatever anything's a
10:40
weapon if you stick it in the eye well
10:42
yeah
10:42
i guess so but so ninjas would have um
10:45
like these throwing stars
10:47
but they would more likely have a
10:48
throwing stick and it would be kind of a
10:50
small metal stick but if you didn't have
10:52
a small metal stick you could do it with
10:53
a chopstick
10:54
and they taught us how to throw it so
10:56
that it kind of goes into a target like
10:58
a dagger
10:59
and this was a apparently as we as we've
11:02
spoken about a while ago not all ninja
11:04
things are possibly true
11:05
but there's apparently ways that ninjas
11:07
through chopsticks and did you succeed
11:09
in embedding it and
11:10
well done oh yeah i can tell you the
11:12
trick is to
11:13
keep your wrist cocked the whole time
11:15
put the
11:16
chopstick in between your first and
11:18
second fingers
11:19
um so it's kind of in the gap between
11:21
them have your
11:22
wrist cocked put it up in the air your
11:25
hand and then go in and arc downwards
11:27
and then let go
11:28
at about kind of i guess 40 degrees
11:31
and it just go but you have actually
11:33
what you're doing there anna is you're
11:34
kind of flicking at the end but you
11:35
don't flick you have to keep your
11:37
wrist [ __ ] the whole time i'm so sorry
11:38
risk cocked the whole time got it
11:40
yeah absolutely amazing it's i feel like
11:42
i hit the ground with that one
11:44
it looks like you've just been taught
11:45
how to do air quotes but you're really
11:47
struggling to
11:48
execute it looks like we're all out for
11:50
dinner and we're desperate for the bill
11:53
well that's really useful to know thanks
11:55
james although then you don't have
11:56
anything to eat with afterwards
11:58
quite right shame this is i thought this
12:01
is really interesting
12:02
um disney princesses are a good target
12:05
group for working out the correct ratio
12:06
of left to right-handed people in
12:08
in the real world because there are 12
12:10
official disney princesses and one of
12:12
them is left-handed
12:13
so that mirrors real life wow right so
12:17
sorry how is this useful ever it's very
12:19
useful i just thought that was
12:20
interesting
12:21
like muppets on the other hand are all
12:22
left-handed because their operators are
12:24
right-handed so their right hand is up
12:26
the muppet
12:27
in the head operating the head and then
12:28
the left hand is operating the left hand
12:30
of the marker
12:31
just as a point of order which disney
12:32
princess is left-handed it's tiana
12:34
who's that um the one from the princess
12:37
and the frog
12:38
she's not one of the main ones is she
12:41
they really made a bit of a runner-up
12:42
princess the lefty which i think was the
12:44
right choice
12:45
[Laughter]
12:47
in china less than one percent of people
12:49
are left-handed
12:50
really what according to chinese people
12:53
why
12:53
no it's because they're suppressed it
12:55
must be it's yeah so it's it's not
12:57
biologically speaking but in china
12:59
claims that less than one percent of its
13:00
students are left-handed the global
13:02
average as you say is 10 to 12
13:04
as you can tell by watching 12 disney
13:06
films in a row
13:08
and it's actually because people tend to
13:10
have to switch their dominant hand in
13:12
china a lot of people say because the
13:14
characters can't be written left-handed
13:15
but
13:16
i was reading a blog by a woman who's
13:17
lived in china for decades
13:19
who was saying that she'll go around and
13:21
say i'm left-handed and people will say
13:23
there are no left-handed people in china
13:24
you know
13:25
and she'll say what are you talking
13:26
about of course there are and she'll
13:27
demonstrate that you can write chinese
13:29
characters with your left hand
13:30
but people will look at her and say no
13:32
it's wrong it's done with the left hand
13:34
can't be done wow right that's amazing
13:36
they pretend they can't read what she's
13:38
written
13:39
i don't think they go quite that far
13:40
they just say it looks gross
13:43
wow you know the musical composition
13:47
chopsticks
13:49
that was written in 1877 by a girl
13:52
16 year old girl called euphemia allen
13:55
and her brother was called mozart allen
13:58
no way
14:00
so weird and once again the brother got
14:02
the musical talent jeans
14:04
well i think she got the musical talent
14:06
but they hoped that the brother had
14:07
because he was cold
14:08
like pirates called him mozart obviously
14:10
hoping he would be some great musician
14:12
yeah but actually the daughter managed
14:14
to write this composition which
14:16
is now probably one of the most played
14:18
it's ubiquitous it's not necessarily
14:19
great art it's the baby shark of piano
14:21
really isn't it yeah
14:22
now don't you bring back is it is it
14:25
called chopsticks because
14:26
it's kind of like you could play with
14:28
chopsticks no it it well
14:30
kind of it's the reason is that when you
14:32
play it
14:33
it's like two notes that are next to
14:35
each other and you move outwards don't
14:36
you
14:37
so it's like dude
14:40
like that but you're not supposed to
14:42
play it with your fingers you're
14:43
supposed to turn your hands sideways
14:45
and then play it as if you're chopping
14:47
something and that's how you're supposed
14:49
to play chopsticks and that's why it's
14:51
called chopsticks
14:52
so we've all been playing it wrong yeah
14:54
so you turn your hands
14:55
90 degrees so that your thumbs are
14:57
facing the air and you play it with your
14:59
little fingers
15:00
karate your piano exactly cool
15:03
isn't that cool do you wanna hear some
15:05
stupid chopstick records yes please
15:06
okay so the most um marbles moved with
15:10
chopsticks in one minute is 43
15:12
and that was broken not by someone from
15:14
china or japan but by an italian man
15:16
called silvio saba
15:17
and then a few years after that record
15:20
was made
15:21
a japanese man called mr cherry tried to
15:23
break the record for most marbles moved
15:25
to one minute with chopsticks and he
15:27
didn't he exactly equaled it
15:29
wow but he did get the record for the
15:31
most baked beans eating with chopsticks
15:33
in one minute
15:34
yeah it's amazing roundabouts sorry
15:36
actually what was that what was that
15:38
record that was 71.
15:39
that's more than one per second and
15:40
that's more than i can do
15:42
yeah but i think i guess only if like
15:44
i'm sure there would be a way of
15:45
building up like some kind of sluice
15:47
where you just turn the chopsticks into
15:48
a shoot
15:49
and you pour the baked beans down it i'm
15:51
sure
15:53
like some sort of like propeller where
15:54
it scoops them up when you spin it
15:56
around exactly
15:57
i think you probably the rules say that
15:59
you have to pick them up in traditional
16:01
chopstick fashion
16:02
although there is they would enjoy those
16:05
baked beans more because there's been a
16:06
study that finds that you would
16:08
you enjoy food more if you eat it with
16:10
chopsticks
16:11
this is specifically with popcorn and
16:13
specifically in one study of 68
16:15
participants but
16:16
hear me out basically the idea is
16:18
because you can only eat one at a time
16:20
or one thing at a time
16:21
it's almost like let's say you're eating
16:24
something else like
16:25
um alphabetically spaghetti or something
16:27
when you have the first
16:28
spoonful or fog full yeah it's really
16:31
tasty right it's like that's so good
16:33
but then by the time you're halfway
16:34
through it you've kind of even forgotten
16:36
that you're eating alphabetically
16:37
spaghetti aren't you
16:38
you're just eating it then sure but if
16:40
it's really hard to get that food to
16:41
your mouth every time
16:42
then each time you're kind of building
16:44
up to the mouthful
16:46
yeah i see that i i have that one night
16:47
with chopsticks basically if you're so
16:49
cack-handed
16:50
that you're just enormously relieved
16:52
that you've mastered that one bead into
16:54
your mouth
16:54
it is more enjoyable how did the world
16:56
record attempt going yeah
17:00
wow so it's kind of novel as well yeah
17:02
just an unusual that's exactly
17:04
true because whenever anything seems new
17:06
people pay more attention to it
17:08
and when you're eating it more slowly
17:10
each mouthful appears more new than if
17:12
you're shoveling it in
17:13
if you look astonished every time that
17:14
next fake bean goes in
17:16
oh my god what is this so i think i read
17:20
about this experiment because there was
17:21
another way they tried it
17:22
and this was asking people to drink
17:24
water but to come up with their own fun
17:26
ways of drinking water
17:27
so they some people drank it normally
17:30
and then afterwards they will all rated
17:31
on their enjoyment of the experience so
17:33
some people drank it normally and i
17:34
guess just gave it
17:35
what were the other ways that they did
17:37
it well i only have written a couple
17:38
down one was drinking it from a martini
17:40
glass
17:41
which is fun i think you know anything
17:43
from our team
17:44
another person drank it out of a
17:46
shipping envelope
17:48
they loved it i can imagine you coming
17:51
up to this study with a pair of
17:52
chopsticks and everyone's like
17:53
you can't drink water with chopsticks
17:56
are you like aha
17:58
you went counting on my sluice
18:02
[Applause]
18:04
okay it is time for fact number two and
18:07
that is my fact
18:08
my fact this week is that sorry can i
18:11
just
18:11
dan often does the okay with a little
18:13
bit more vim just give it one more try
18:15
okay it is time for fact number two
18:21
you can't please all the people all the
18:23
time sorry what was your fact
18:25
uh my fact this week is that the fax
18:26
machine is older than the telephone
18:29
okay the fax machine it's a fact about
18:31
facts
18:33
um so the telephone was what early
18:36
20th century it was
18:39
yeah like late 19th century so you're
18:41
saying that the fax machine was from the
18:43
19th century
18:44
well the first patent uh was
18:47
in 1843 for an electric printing
18:50
telegraph and it was by
18:51
actually another scottish inventor
18:52
called alexander bain so quite similar
18:54
to alexander bell one of the inventors
18:56
of the telephone and he was actually a
18:58
clock maker
18:59
and he invented this device um it was
19:02
also called a facsimile machine there
19:03
were various different versions
19:05
um and it involved synchronized pendulum
19:07
so you can see where the clock's going
19:08
to come in
19:09
that would scan a message line by line
19:11
converted it to electrical signals
19:12
sent them down some wires and then
19:14
reproduced it at the other end using
19:16
um electromagnetically sensitive paper
19:18
that had this kind of chemical imbued in
19:20
it um it wasn't the first version wasn't
19:22
very good because they were all sorts of
19:23
like synchronization problems and then
19:24
he improved it
19:25
um between 1843 and 1846 um but then he
19:28
was beaten to
19:29
it when he tried to repatent the
19:30
improved version because a rival had got
19:32
in the way and demonstrated
19:34
a much more accurate version it was just
19:35
the synchronization of the pendulums
19:37
that you can never get
19:38
right because it's really difficult to
19:39
swing because it's swinging left to
19:40
right across the page at the exact time
19:42
so it's getting
19:43
it's almost like an inkjet printer kind
19:45
of doing dots along a line
19:46
wow that's very tricky and very clever
19:48
all the paper that you need to be
19:50
receiving
19:51
the electrical current it needs to turn
19:53
black whenever it receives the current
19:55
so it needs to be soaked in potassium
19:57
ferrocyanide
19:58
was that kind of toxic sounds like it
20:00
was cyanide
20:01
like every time you get a flax you
20:03
basically died i mean
20:04
that was probably why it didn't work
20:06
yeah no i don't think it was i don't
20:07
think it was lethal
20:08
i think you should not eat too much of
20:09
it
20:12
so this but then so he was the you know
20:15
the pioneer but then i think the first
20:17
really usable one was in 1860 which is
20:20
still so long ago
20:21
and it was an italian called caselli and
20:23
you would write your message on a piece
20:25
of tin
20:25
and you would write in non-conductive
20:27
ink and then
20:29
the sheet was scanned by a stylus and
20:31
that was attached to telegraph wires
20:32
going to the other place
20:34
and then whenever the stylus at the
20:36
other end got to a bit of ink the
20:37
conduction would stop
20:39
and then at the receiving end whenever
20:40
the conduction stops
20:42
the stylus there would stop and so you'd
20:43
make a kind of perfect mirror image of
20:45
it
20:45
okay it's actually the same in reverse
20:47
because it's the
20:49
drawing that's non-conductive instead of
20:50
drawing that is conducting i think i've
20:51
explained that right but it was it was
20:52
demonstrated for
20:53
napoleon the third i think that's
20:55
amazing that napoleon the third had a
20:57
fax machine
20:58
it's unbelievable unbelievable and he
21:00
said this is incredible he got sent the
21:02
signature of the composer rossini
21:04
from a hundred miles away by facts
21:07
wow that is amazing and it didn't catch
21:09
on did it
21:10
the idea with the fax machine i think is
21:12
that um they weren't in the information
21:14
age yet so business just worked too
21:16
slowly so i think was that one between
21:18
paris and leon and paris and marseille
21:20
they set those ones up and there just
21:22
wasn't really any interest
21:23
in it it was a gimmick because yeah it's
21:25
a good mix this is not going to capture
21:27
lots of public demonstrations of it and
21:28
stuff and everyone was like wow but no
21:29
practical applications the russian czar
21:31
had one
21:32
nicholas the first wow between his
21:34
palaces and moscow and petersburg there
21:36
was a fax
21:37
connection it's so weird um
21:40
so i'm sure you guys came across this in
21:42
your research who's the biggest buyer of
21:43
fax machines in the world
21:46
is it korea it's cnh north korea it's
21:48
the nhs
21:50
and i uh they have at least 8 000
21:53
machines
21:53
across the nhs just in britain and
21:56
i asked a friend of mine who's a doctor
21:59
just out of interest he works down on
22:00
the south coast
22:01
and um i said do you use factors and he
22:04
said he sends at least one or two every
22:05
day
22:06
oh yeah they use them all the time
22:07
they're banned from doing it now so
22:08
they're no longer the biggest buyer
22:09
they're banned from buying any more they
22:11
haven't been banned from using them
22:12
no but as in they're not the biggest
22:14
buyer anymore because the government's
22:15
finally said you are not allowed to find
22:16
all bloody packages this is ridiculous
22:19
like when i used to work as an
22:21
accountant we used to use faxes
22:22
like like you say not two times a day
22:25
maybe 10 times a day
22:26
and they're a really good way of getting
22:28
kind of invoices across it's useful for
22:30
sending secure information i believe
22:32
yeah
22:32
yeah and there is secure email but it's
22:34
a bit of a pain and
22:35
yeah i feel like you can ring faxes for
22:38
no reason at all and you just get a
22:39
weird noise
22:40
i just think that's a totally
22:41
unnecessary you know
22:43
is that how you spend your evenings i
22:46
know i just i've never used
22:47
actually facts with a fax machine but i
22:49
do routinely access any ring people's
22:50
facts and all of this
22:51
you've never sent a fax no i don't think
22:53
i've ever said effects
22:54
what but i've to be fair i'm not a
22:56
doctor that is insane
22:58
well sorry i had to do it for my work
23:02
why are you just doing it like asking
23:03
your friends if you're going to the
23:05
shops or whatever
23:06
i work a lot when i was younger and also
23:08
me and my friend used to send faxes to
23:10
each other
23:12
that's what i mean like not under social
23:14
i don't think anyone's ever apart from
23:15
you send faxes
23:16
for a social reason wow what did you say
23:20
in your faxes
23:21
uh so i remember she once sent me a fax
23:23
of the newspaper article in her local
23:25
area
23:26
which on the headline was her dog
23:27
getting married to another dog
23:31
this is an incredible insight into your
23:33
early life this is like an analog
23:35
version of buzzfeed that you invented
23:36
there
23:36
yeah it was a pretty huge moment in our
23:39
childhoods actually
23:40
wow yeah of itself are the dogs still
23:42
together
23:43
are they happy they had a lovely long
23:45
life together but i'm afraid
23:46
sadly um they have expired because this
23:48
was 25 years ago
23:51
which in dog years
23:54
this is our 175th wedding anniversary
23:58
oh i had a fact about wedding
23:59
anniversaries which is through this
24:01
facts research
24:02
which is you can this is not really
24:04
facts related but
24:05
you can request anniversary greetings
24:07
from the white house
24:09
what if you are a us citizen and if you
24:11
contact them several months ahead
24:14
trump's not sending them is it i can
24:16
imagine his faxes in massive capital
24:20
he does practices he's saying no
24:21
collusion
24:24
it's kind of weird i think you can
24:26
request presidential greetings and they
24:28
send
24:28
some you know poor drone in the white
24:30
house has to send you presidential
24:32
greetings but they they made it clear
24:34
you can only request a limited number of
24:36
greetings per
24:37
day which i think is a very funny idea
24:40
the idea is that obviously somebody at
24:42
some point received about a hundred
24:44
different reasons
24:45
on the same wedding anniversary i just
24:47
love the idea of keeping trump busy by
24:49
setting him up
24:51
sorry mr president barack obama used to
24:53
get through 20 a day
24:55
work with the queen she's almost no
24:57
political power because she has to write
24:58
cards to every 100
25:00
um something really cool you can do with
25:02
fax paper if you've got any left over
25:04
from the 90s or from your friend's dog
25:09
yeah is so this is if you use a thermal
25:12
fax machine
25:13
and fax paper would be thermal paper you
25:15
use those in the winter don't you
25:16
get colder yeah um no in fact so if
25:20
you're using a thermal fax machine then
25:22
the paper
25:23
turns black when it's exposed to heat so
25:25
it's especially chemically treated
25:27
and basically what a fax machine would
25:28
do how it would work is it would only
25:30
heat up the parts that were meant to be
25:31
written on
25:32
those bits would turn black but what you
25:34
can do is you can just get some facts
25:36
paper or this also
25:37
works on receipt paper because they
25:38
still use that for that and heat it up
25:41
and it'll turn black i was expecting
25:44
another part to that like some useful
25:46
life hack like what yeah
25:49
or if you've only got a white crayon and
25:51
you need to write someone a message
25:52
immediately you need black paper to
25:53
write on that's true so why don't you
25:55
keep your thermal
25:56
facts machines roll of paper oh if
25:58
you're going to a
25:59
fancy dress as a zebra you can heat up
26:02
one roll of
26:02
receipt paper don't heat up the other
26:05
one and just wrap them around you like a
26:07
mummy
26:08
instant zebra costume it's a
26:10
multi-purpose life hack
26:12
so sorry hang on is that how the
26:13
receipts work in old
26:15
till machines is that they've
26:16
selectively heated up the paper not in
26:18
the really old ones i don't think
26:19
okay and some i think quite a lot that
26:21
are still in use
26:22
they're slightly waxier the paper i
26:24
think like and they're a bit more
26:25
transparent
26:26
and you if you do heat them up yeah they
26:27
go so it's quite a way of um redacting
26:29
things as well because if you heat it up
26:31
then obviously it eats all of them
26:33
does it does it when you cool down does
26:35
it not go back to normal
26:36
don't think so because otherwise as soon
26:37
as the receipt came out of the thing
26:39
you'd actually be given a blank receipt
26:42
it was momentarily written on the record
26:44
of what you thought i'm talking to my
26:46
tax man i'm really sorry all these
26:48
receipts said stuff when i got them
26:50
i don't know what's happened to them all
26:52
you'll have to trust me
26:53
[Laughter]
26:55
can i tell you my favorite ever fax
26:56
machine in fact which please i actually
26:58
went to georgia bank to find this out
27:00
so in 1966 the russians landed the luna
27:03
9 craft on the moon which was the first
27:06
craft to successfully achieve a soft
27:07
landing and land without crashing
27:09
and it was designed to take um the first
27:11
photographs on the moon
27:12
and it was basically a contraption that
27:14
had like a camera with a film in it so
27:16
take the photos and then the machine
27:17
would take the film out of the camera
27:19
and
27:19
develop the photographs and then put the
27:21
photographs into
27:22
a little fax machine basically and then
27:25
transmit the photos back to earth this
27:27
is all on the moon this is all the moon
27:28
in little craft yeah
27:30
um so and the russians were broadcasting
27:32
it back to earth and
27:33
um the british were monitoring all of
27:35
the landing and everything and all the
27:36
signals
27:37
from georgetown bank and then they
27:38
noticed that when it landed and all of
27:40
this stuff happened we didn't
27:41
know what was going on because the
27:43
russians didn't tell anyone anything
27:44
that the signal had changed and they
27:45
recognized it as being a standard signal
27:47
from something called
27:48
radio fax which was a standard way of
27:50
transmitting photos by a kind of fax
27:52
machine
27:53
kind of system around the world that was
27:55
used in journalism um
27:57
and so they very quickly realized that
27:58
they could interpret the signal so they
28:00
rang up the um offices of the daily
28:02
express in manchester and said look do
28:03
you have a radio fax receiver machine
28:05
that we can borrow and they said yes so
28:06
they stuck in a car and raced over to
28:08
jodrell bank
28:09
and and managed to get these transmitted
28:11
photos and printed out and they
28:12
got the first photos of the moon from
28:14
the surface of the moon and they then
28:16
published them on the front cover of the
28:17
dead express before the russians had
28:19
even released them
28:20
so we actually hacked the first facts
28:22
from the moon that is amazing but what
28:24
was great is that
28:25
um bernard lovell after whom the level
28:27
telescope is now named
28:28
was kind of annoyed because um the
28:31
russian photographs were calibrated for
28:32
a slightly different size of paper from
28:33
what we had
28:34
so it slightly distorted the photographs
28:36
and he was really annoyed because he
28:37
thought that everyone would think his
28:38
telescope was a bit [ __ ]
28:40
[Music]
28:41
well there are disadvantages to theft of
28:43
property
28:46
[Applause]
28:48
okay it is time for fact number three
28:51
and that is anna
28:52
my fact this week is that a boatload of
28:54
researchers are about to deliberately
28:56
get themselves stuck in the arctic ice
28:57
for a year
28:59
and for fun and for science that's for
29:01
fun i think it's for work
29:03
it's fun and science guys science is fun
29:05
doesn't it yeah the two are not mutually
29:07
exclusive
29:08
and i reckon in this case they are like
29:11
if you're spending a whole
29:12
winter in the arctic you're talking to
29:14
someone who faxed their friends
29:16
for fun in their childhood yeah
29:19
no man these guys are gonna have the
29:20
best time they're gonna need one of
29:21
those thermal fax machines um
29:26
so this is a project called the
29:27
multidisciplinary drifting observatory
29:29
for the study of arctic climate
29:31
shortened to mosaic and hundreds of
29:34
researchers from 19 countries are
29:35
involved it's the largest arctic
29:37
expedition in
29:38
history and it's all about data
29:40
collection in the arctic so just
29:41
gathering as much as they can from the
29:43
ocean from the eyes from the atmosphere
29:45
about the climate that algae all the
29:48
chemistry of it
29:49
to basically work out how climate change
29:50
is affecting the arctic
29:52
and they're doing it by going on this
29:54
big well they've just arrived actually
29:55
so there's this 400 foot long
29:58
icebreaker ship called polar stern which
30:00
left norway a few weeks ago
30:02
and it is now about to freeze itself
30:04
into this
30:05
little bit less than two miles square
30:07
bit of ice
30:08
and then it's just going to let that bit
30:10
of ice carry it through the north pole
30:13
it is amazing i read that on monday the
30:16
sun set
30:17
where the boat is and so it's set and
30:20
it's not going to return for 153 days
30:23
oh wow that's a long night yeah
30:26
okay fine so that but it's not that fun
30:29
but there's and they can't
30:30
because obviously they're going to be
30:32
locked in the eye so they can't really
30:33
control where they go
30:34
can they no so i read that they have to
30:36
be a bit careful because there's a risk
30:39
that the ice will drift them into the
30:41
russian economic zone and if they go in
30:44
there
30:44
against their will they don't have
30:46
permission to do carry out research
30:48
there
30:48
yeah so they've had to select the bit
30:50
they've locked themselves into quite
30:51
carefully where they think they'll stay
30:52
in sort of
30:53
international territory yeah i bet
30:55
they'll end up there and they'll be like
30:57
oh no we can't do any research we just
30:58
have to sit and drink all the time
31:02
it must have been fun selecting the the
31:04
flow where they're going to embed
31:05
themselves
31:06
because they had 15 candidates um and
31:09
they just had to narrow it down and you
31:10
have to work out
31:12
as you say you have to predict where you
31:13
think it's going to go so they've picked
31:15
this one that's the perfect depth
31:17
so it needs to be deep enough that it
31:19
can really lock you in place and it
31:21
needs to be deep enough that
31:22
planes can land on it hopefully in
31:24
winter which is what they're intending
31:25
how they're going to resupply themselves
31:27
at the moment it's 350 miles from the
31:29
north pole and they you know need to
31:31
work out the direction it's sort of
31:32
traveling in
31:33
and they want to drift right past the
31:35
pole because obviously that's the big
31:36
money
31:37
wow and they will be resupplied i was
31:39
reading an article on mashable
31:41
that said they were resupplied with
31:43
provisions and rotating scientists
31:48
i've seen one of those in a kebab shop
31:53
but actually they are they're scientists
31:55
from all around the world and they're
31:56
going to come and stay for
31:57
a little bit of time and then go away
31:58
again i think that's the idea yeah i
32:00
think
32:01
most have signed up for two months and i
32:03
think a couple of people are going to do
32:05
the whole thing although that's pretty
32:07
hardy
32:08
yeah i need some vitamin d pills you
32:10
could say that these guys are going to
32:11
go with the flow
32:13
yeah because i bet they're not saying
32:14
that though
32:17
of course it is the best job there was
32:19
an embargo on saying that right
32:22
it's really cool they're divided into
32:24
these different sections into what they
32:25
call
32:26
cities so if you go to their website
32:28
it's kind of like at a theme park and
32:29
you know you've got the different
32:30
zones so essentially the ship will be
32:32
stuck in the flow but then they're going
32:34
to spread out onto the ice all around it
32:36
to set up their various cities
32:38
like ice city which sounds like it's
32:40
going to be a lot of it
32:42
but ice city is basically the patch of
32:44
ice on which the ice researchers will
32:46
work and that's they'll pick up bits of
32:48
ice and study it
32:48
they've got ocean city and that's where
32:51
the oceanic researchers drill a hole in
32:52
the ocean and then they pick up the
32:54
water
32:58
this drill isn't working every time i
33:00
make a hole it fills back in
33:02
this is why i was fired from the project
33:04
um they drilled a hole in the ice
33:06
and then they retrieved the ocean water
33:08
and what they have to do in ocean city
33:09
is set up a tent over the hole
33:11
um and that's because they need to keep
33:13
that a bit warm because otherwise if you
33:14
pull the ocean water up
33:15
to where you are it immediately freezes
33:17
and then you've just got ice again
33:18
that's how you do winter
33:20
fishing in russia yeah every winter you
33:23
if you go to the moscow river you'll
33:24
just see loads of little tents
33:26
and basically it's just like men in
33:28
their little tent doing fishing with a
33:30
bottle of vodka and that's what they do
33:32
these guys on the arctic as well there
33:34
are loads of problems that they have
33:36
obviously because it's a very very
33:37
challenging environment
33:38
so they're going to have guards who are
33:40
wearing night vision goggles who are
33:41
constantly looking out for polar bears
33:44
and every research station on the ice
33:45
has to have a two mile radius around it
33:47
with the perimeter fence
33:49
which is monitored for polar bear
33:51
activity and they've got guns
33:53
but before that they obviously don't
33:55
want to shoot polar bears it's not what
33:56
they're about
33:57
so before opening fire they will honk
34:00
the horn of the ship
34:01
to try and scare it off and then they
34:03
will use a flare gun just up in the air
34:05
to alarm it you know and then finally
34:07
they've got a pepper spray to try and
34:09
deter it i think
34:11
i think you have to have considerable
34:12
friends in mind
34:18
you have to wait until it gets really
34:19
close to you the next thing is you poke
34:21
it in its nose and if that doesn't
34:22
work you bring out the throwing
34:24
chopsticks
34:26
have you tried reasoning with it
34:30
yeah it's cool they're also setting up
34:32
tripwires for the polar bears themselves
34:34
around so when a polar bear crosses one
34:35
of the tripwires it sends up a big
34:37
loud flare sounds like home alone
34:42
um i found out about another experiment
34:44
that's being done on the arctic at the
34:46
moment
34:46
so scientists need to study how organic
34:49
matter decays in the soil
34:51
and um you know that varies well by the
34:54
soil's temperature and moisture and
34:55
acidity and all of this stuff
34:57
so they have to sow bags of material
35:00
organic matter to decay that's the test
35:02
subject
35:03
so lots of leaves and things like this
35:05
go into the matter and then they bury
35:06
that
35:07
and then a couple of scientists they had
35:09
spent weeks laboriously sowing
35:11
litter bags full of leaves and then
35:13
sealing them up to be buried
35:14
and then one of the scientists was
35:15
having a cup of tea and she realized
35:17
oh my god we have bags full of leaves
35:21
that can be buried underground
35:22
that are made to an almost exact
35:24
uniformity standard
35:26
so that's clever at least one twelve
35:28
hundred groups
35:29
across the world are doing citizen
35:31
science using tea bags now
35:33
and there are five thousand tea bags
35:34
just buried under the arctic
35:36
really yeah wow that's an advantage of
35:38
global warming isn't it
35:39
when it melts you've got a nice cup of
35:40
tea
35:43
it's gonna be very weak that's really
35:46
cool
35:46
um can we talk about making a knife out
35:48
of your own poo
35:50
yeah oh yeah we better we probably
35:53
so um wade davis the famous traveler and
35:56
writer
35:57
he wrote about an inuit man who once
35:59
sculpted his own frozen poo into a knife
36:01
and used it to kill a dog
36:04
and people have kind of taken this as
36:06
truth that it might have happened
36:08
but this year for the first time
36:10
scientists have properly tried it out by
36:11
making knives out of their own excrement
36:14
and they found that it wouldn't have
36:15
worked it wouldn't have been able to cut
36:17
into a piece of pig hide they said like
36:19
a crayon
36:20
it just left brown streaks on the meat
36:22
no slices at all
36:25
if i was working in that lab that's the
36:26
point which i put in a complaint
36:30
in the freezer and this is a proper
36:32
experiment so
36:33
first of all before they even had the
36:35
poos
36:36
they adopted an arctic diet which was
36:38
high in protein
36:40
to ensure that their poo would have the
36:41
same consistency as the inuit people
36:43
that's cool that's so clever because i
36:46
read somewhere that people escaped from
36:47
prison by making ships out of frozen poo
36:48
so it can't be true
36:49
it's not true it's a urban myth it turns
36:51
out yeah most prisoners don't have
36:52
access to freezers though do they
36:54
i don't know they're like in not lower
36:56
security prisons maybe
36:58
i don't know you have to ask the chef
37:00
and they they do ask questions when you
37:02
approach them with a bag of your own
37:04
face you can say would you mind putting
37:05
this in the freezer
37:08
if it was very cold outside you might be
37:09
able to dangle the poo out of a window
37:11
and wait for it to freeze overnight
37:12
yeah like you the way you keep the milk
37:14
fresh if your fridge is all the blue i
37:16
just think there are easier ways to make
37:17
ships there must be right yeah you're in
37:20
a place full of metal there are bars
37:21
everywhere
37:22
yeah you're right um so um i've got
37:25
uh i thought of a question about the poo
37:28
knife experiment
37:29
oh how did they manufacture it into a
37:32
knife
37:32
how did they mold it oh um was it was
37:35
that in the ejection you have to sort of
37:37
clench and release at the right moment
37:40
exactly right what a skill that would be
37:45
what an edinburgh show i will now be
37:48
pouring this
37:50
sculpture of michelangelo's david
37:54
is that the next balloon sculpture
37:55
magician trick
37:56
[Laughter]
37:59
i imagine that they just um cut it into
38:01
shape
38:02
did they make a standard symmetrical
38:03
european knife or a
38:05
left-handed japanese knife wow and it
38:08
doesn't work
38:09
it doesn't work it just leaves the brown
38:11
streaks on the meat another really cool
38:13
arctic experiment
38:14
that's happening is to deal with climate
38:16
change and so that's a problem with the
38:18
arctic which is
38:19
heating up faster than the rest of the
38:21
world so it's really bad
38:22
ice is all melting and there have been
38:24
sort of three main proposals
38:26
people are thinking about for us to
38:27
geo-engineer it so that this problem is
38:29
solved
38:30
one of them is just refreeze it they're
38:32
thinking try and re-freeze the ice
38:34
just refreeze it like a big poo just
38:36
re-freeze it
38:38
so they the plan is to put 10 million
38:41
windmills there
38:42
and they will power these water pumps
38:45
and what the water pumps do is they
38:46
suck up the sea water from underneath
38:48
the ice and then they spray it out
38:50
on top of the ice during the winter and
38:51
then it freezes and so that restocks it
38:54
sounds like a doctor evil plan ten
38:56
million windmills
38:58
bonkers i mean presumably the windmills
39:00
have to use less
39:01
energy than they pump out well they're
39:04
getting free energy from the wind i
39:05
guess
39:06
yeah ah okay sorry okay yeah no that's
39:09
how they work how's that windmills work
39:10
um so you don't plug them
39:15
that's why my windmill has been so
39:16
expensive to run
39:20
another idea that they had is you
39:21
basically get a submarine
39:24
and this is an idea sorry by a 29 year
39:26
old architect called faris
39:30
uh and he says that you you're not
39:32
exactly laughing at her
39:34
no it's not laughing at his name that's
39:36
his name
39:37
uh anyway his name isn't important in
39:39
the story
39:40
he is going to get this uh submersible
39:43
vessel
39:44
and what you would do is you would get a
39:46
load of water from the sea
39:47
in it and then you would somehow suck
39:50
all of the
39:50
salt out of the sea water which then
39:53
makes it freeze
39:54
so you suck out the um the salt it
39:57
freezes
39:58
because it's cold down there and then it
40:00
floats to the surface and you're making
40:02
icebergs that's pretty good isn't that
40:03
clever how are you sucking the salt out
40:05
sorry
40:06
i said i i don't know if you heard
40:11
i don't think i could be more clearer
40:12
than that it's an almost foolproof plan
40:14
how are you going to fix the irish
40:15
border by someone
40:17
i'm so sorry i clearly wasn't listening
40:20
um this ship that's
40:21
getting frozen in is an icebreaker isn't
40:23
it yeah and we should just say how
40:24
amazing icebreakers are
40:26
they're very very powerful things and
40:29
then
40:29
what shape would you guess there would
40:30
be at the front triangular uh
40:33
pointy pointy yeah that's what i meant
40:35
like a poo knife
40:36
right like a puna they're not pointy
40:38
they're shaped like the backs of spoons
40:40
at the front
40:41
really weird so when they hit the ice
40:43
they ride up onto it
40:45
and then the massive weight of the
40:46
vessel just crushes it down
40:48
wow yeah so russia's biggest icebreaker
40:51
is called 50 years of victory
40:53
and it's powered but it was a great name
40:56
always humble we would cause as 40 years
41:00
of hurt
41:03
and it's powered by not one but two
41:05
nuclear reactors so it's extremely
41:07
impressive and it's the reason it's
41:09
nuclear is because otherwise it would
41:11
expend more than 100 tons
41:13
of diesel every day so i mean it would
41:16
just have no range it wouldn't be able
41:17
to get anywhere you know
41:18
doesn't it need to be in cold waters
41:20
then because i was reading about how the
41:22
nuclear engines the cooling system
41:24
depends upon the icing so you couldn't
41:26
sail it into warm water
41:27
because it would over overheat right so
41:29
it like it's literally built it has
41:31
it needs the ice as much as the way the
41:32
ice doesn't need it but yeah yeah yeah
41:34
i like that and it's hopeless in open
41:36
water as well they roll from side to
41:37
side all the time
41:38
because of this spoon-shaped bow
41:41
so some are being built now which are
41:42
reversibly percies they can go forwards
41:44
and backwards that's so clever so
41:45
they've got a pointy back end
41:47
and then a spoon-shaped front end and if
41:49
they're ever sailing in open water they
41:50
just sail backwards
41:51
using their pointy bow because that gets
41:53
through the water very nicely great but
41:55
if you
41:55
do they have two steering wheels
42:03
[Laughter]
42:12
[Applause]
42:14
okay it is time for our final fact and
42:16
that is andy
42:17
my fact is that leo tolstoy one of the
42:19
greatest writers of history
42:20
frequently wore two hats in case his
42:23
head got cold
42:25
oh what a guy this is uh from uh someone
42:28
called marianna hunt who sent me this
42:30
fact so thank you to you marianna and
42:32
it's just that tolstoy was very
42:33
sensitive to head cold so he wore
42:35
multiple hats
42:37
he literally wore multiple heads cold in
42:39
russia we've already established that
42:40
it's cold in russia and the hats were
42:42
nuclear powered that's so amazing
42:44
did he have like a reversing person that
42:46
he could put on when he was working
42:48
backwards
42:49
were they two of the same type of hat or
42:51
was it like a top hat and then a tiny
42:53
bowler
42:53
on top of that or i am not sure the
42:55
history relates tragically i don't know
42:57
if it was like a fez
42:58
followed by a fedora or yeah so i
43:02
don't know because he could have just
43:03
bought a thicker hat in russia
43:05
you know you often get these big bare
43:07
skin things yeah
43:08
with the flaps with the flaps of course
43:12
um but he didn't not that smart turns
43:14
out no
43:15
no thicky tolstoy would call him
43:18
we call him leo tolstoy but his name was
43:21
lev hollyev
43:23
and the reason that we do that is
43:25
because lyev means lion
43:28
in russian and when he brought out his
43:31
book in france
43:32
they translated his name as leon tolstoy
43:37
because that means lion and he
43:40
kind of gave his um blessing to that and
43:43
when he gave his blessing it meant that
43:44
everyone else could kind of go in that
43:46
direction and so when it came into
43:47
england
43:48
it was anglicized to leo which also
43:50
means lion right
43:52
do we know if everyone does that like in
43:54
kenya are they calling him
43:56
simba tolstoy
43:59
that would be amazing i can't remember
44:02
if that's what you leave for lion
44:03
there's one of one of the words
44:05
yeah that's so funny on translation i
44:08
was looking at the
44:09
the the so apparently the russian word
44:12
for peace
44:13
is yeah so but that can also mean
44:16
like world or society i mean like like a
44:20
place where people like a community
44:22
right yeah but
44:23
um there was there's an argument about
44:25
how you could translate
44:27
the title of war and peace to war and
44:28
the world oh yeah which i prefer as a
44:30
kind of
44:30
sex and the city vibe well one of its
44:33
provisional titles
44:34
it went through a couple of titles
44:35
before he settled on war in the world
44:38
um
44:41
um one it was provisioning title at
44:43
first the year 1805
44:45
okay and then briefly all's well that
44:48
ends well
44:50
i think it must have been the russian
44:51
for that but he hated shakespeare as
44:53
well he didn't think he was a very good
44:54
writer
44:54
yeah he and shaw um talked about
44:57
shakespeare didn't they about how they
44:59
hated him
44:59
wow um he thought that shakespeare was
45:02
unfair to servants and poor people
45:04
and they were frequently made the object
45:05
of ridicule in his place
45:07
yeah yeah he was big on the rights of um
45:10
servants and serfs he was kind of
45:12
obsessed with that especially in his
45:13
later life wasn't he
45:14
and he sort of shifted his whole family
45:17
to
45:18
this different kind of barren land to
45:19
try and make his own farming using his
45:21
own
45:21
farming ideas and principles which if
45:24
you've ever read anna karenina are
45:25
basically all written out in the
45:26
character of levin
45:28
who is essentially i think 11 is who
45:29
tolstoy wishes he was
45:31
in anna karenina he's a kind of wheat
45:33
obsessive isn't he
45:34
he he is yeah he's the opposite of
45:37
someone who's gluten intolerant
45:39
yes he's exactly tough yeah enthusiasts
45:42
he doesn't just he doesn't just love
45:44
sandwiches guys there was a whole
45:46
socialist philosophy behind this
45:49
sandwiches for everybody
45:50
he did he loved eggs as well there's an
45:52
app that you can download which is the
45:54
uh his wife's cookbook is now available
45:56
as an ios app
45:58
and we have and so we know all about the
46:00
different things because his wife was
46:01
amazing she
46:02
she's kind of the great woman behind the
46:04
great man kind of thing and he had
46:05
terrible handwriting
46:06
so she copied out seven drafts of war
46:09
and peace the
46:10
four fourteen hundred pages by hand
46:12
often like after he'd gone to bed and
46:13
finished she would stay up and do it by
46:14
hand
46:14
and he had terrible handwriting and
46:16
sometimes she needed to use magnifying
46:17
glass
46:18
but look we have to stay on the eggs for
46:19
a minute because this is
46:21
really relevant so he had this he was
46:23
born in 1828 and he had this uh
46:25
huge mental crisis around his 50th
46:27
birthday which i think was after war and
46:29
peace in that corona yeah
46:30
and he gave up smoking gave up drinking
46:32
gave up meat and became a
46:34
massive vegetarian so he he
46:37
because there was no tofu or corn
46:38
obviously so eggs it was
46:40
and he had a rotating menu of 12 egg
46:43
dishes
46:44
which he ordered uh to be cooked for him
46:46
including
46:47
have been fun to have been around around
46:48
that time coming i think after his
46:50
big life change he was a major boy so
46:53
like eggs with brussels sprouts and
46:54
beans
46:56
sitting next to him for one thing that
46:58
is an amazing meal
47:01
don't argue about the first date is all
47:02
i'm saying
47:04
one of them was just omelette in soup
47:08
gross and he became a serious
47:11
buzzkill like he would cobble his own
47:13
shoes and
47:14
it got so bad that his wife after 25
47:17
years of this kind of [ __ ] from tolstoy
47:18
his wife was given a gift of a joke
47:20
recipe book of all the mad dishes he'd
47:22
received i think that's the thing
47:24
is yeah yeah she had a terrible time
47:27
notwithstanding the constant farting
47:29
based on the disgusting egg-based
47:31
vegetarian diet
47:33
he i've got really mixed feelings about
47:36
tolstoy because he's such a brilliant
47:38
writer but my god he was awful to his
47:40
wife so
47:41
sonia even they met she was
47:44
one of the daughters of a family that he
47:46
was friends with and she was 18 when
47:47
they met
47:48
and he sort of fell in love with her or
47:50
fell in lust with her he was quite a
47:51
lusty man
47:52
um and he proposed very soon afterwards
47:55
and amazingly he proposed
47:57
and the scene of his proposal is
47:58
repeated in anna karenina and it's
48:00
always a scene i've thought
48:01
that's so unrealistic so there's this
48:03
scene where spoilers
48:05
levin proposes to kitty but he proposes
48:08
by
48:08
um just proposing with the first letter
48:10
of every word
48:11
that he means to say but it's not just
48:13
like will you marry me it's incredibly
48:15
long sentences and i remember reading
48:17
the scene and thinking that
48:19
can work it out can she she can work it
48:21
out this is exactly how tolstoy proposed
48:24
to sonia so as in it was more
48:26
complicated but it would be like
48:28
w-y-m-m for will you marry me
48:30
exactly but in his instance they had a
48:32
whole conversation this was tolstoy
48:34
and sonia and he spelled out the letters
48:35
of the pieces of chalk and it was
48:36
sentences like
48:37
in your family there is a false view of
48:39
me and your sister liza you and your
48:41
sister tanya must defend me
48:42
spells out initials i think that could
48:45
work in some cases
48:46
like if i was to go omg and you went
48:50
bs then that works doesn't it is that
48:52
how you proposed
48:54
that was the response
48:55
[Laughter]
48:58
um but yeah sorry after you proposed and
49:01
before they got married
49:02
he said there shouldn't be any secrets
49:03
between us at all i'm a massive diary
49:05
writer he was a huge diary writer
49:08
you must read all my diaries i must read
49:10
all of yours she said okay and he forced
49:12
her to read all of his diaries which
49:13
involved just his constant recounting of
49:15
his affairs with surf ladies
49:16
yeah just lots of shagging around and
49:19
there was one he had fathered a child by
49:20
a woman who still lived on his estate
49:23
yeah and she was still there you know
49:25
and so sonia read this and obviously was
49:27
really felt very threatened by it
49:29
because you know he had a job with her
49:30
and she was constantly worried that they
49:31
were going to
49:32
take up again where he'd left off yeah
49:34
and he made her read this it's very
49:35
weird
49:36
i know in fact he then made her
49:37
transcribe one of the first things he
49:39
made her transcribe was a short story
49:40
based on his relationship with this surf
49:42
woman
49:43
which is one of the few stories he
49:44
didn't finish which we suspect is
49:45
because she drew the line at some point
49:47
[Laughter]
49:50
he's just saying and then my wife turned
49:53
up
49:54
what a ball he sounds like a river dick
49:57
yeah yeah i think what happened
50:00
correct me if i'm wrong here but i think
50:01
his early life where he was doing all
50:03
these naughty things
50:05
then he had this kind of mid-life crisis
50:07
didn't he and then that's when he
50:08
started giving everything away yeah
50:10
and obviously neither of those parts of
50:12
his life were particularly happy times
50:13
for his wife
50:15
he did go from one extreme to the other
50:17
um but it was when he
50:18
in the 1890s he re-translated the new
50:21
testament
50:22
um so he got a copy of the bible in
50:25
presumably in greek or something like
50:26
that
50:27
and then they had the russian orthodox
50:29
version which everyone else read and he
50:31
translated his own version
50:32
and then he realized that actually the
50:34
way i should be living
50:35
is vegetarianism giving everything away
50:37
living as a surf
50:39
all that kind of thing but he was
50:40
tortured um his whole life like if you
50:42
do read bits of his diaries which i kind
50:44
of have over the years it was like an
50:46
adolescent constantly so everyone thinks
50:48
tolstoy had this
50:49
phase where he was shagging around and
50:51
writing all these great novels and then
50:52
this phase of ascetic
50:53
religiousness and actually he was up and
50:56
down all the time his diary is
50:57
full of him messing up letting himself
50:59
down scolding himself saying all right
51:01
tomorrow i will do this this and that
51:03
and um it's like real kind of
51:05
self-loathing but self-involved and it
51:07
would be it would be stupid stuff he'd
51:08
get annoyed with himself about like um
51:11
one entry in his diary said receive my
51:13
gymnastics teacher over familiarly
51:15
you know hate myself for that or made a
51:18
bad exit from the colossians drawing
51:20
room
51:20
and that's very interesting it doesn't
51:22
sound like a lot of stuff that i think
51:23
i've
51:23
angst over all this yeah he's so angsty
51:27
greasing people as a classic though
51:28
isn't it so someone else who did that
51:30
someone else who noted their
51:31
moral failures or what they thought
51:32
their moral failures obsessively was
51:34
isaac newton which we've discussed he
51:36
said you know i got this wrong or i was
51:39
peevish or i
51:40
i think threatened to kill my parents
51:42
parents had burned their house down was
51:44
one thing
51:44
oh i was up to that point like it sounds
51:46
like social anxiety but i think that's
51:47
probably a bit further but
51:48
also the fact that he translated his own
51:50
version of the bible which is like
51:52
thomas jefferson which we talked about a
51:53
few weeks ago
51:54
so these that sort of great people of
51:56
history tend to
51:57
think they can have another crack at the
51:59
bottom yeah
52:02
one of his things that he tried in his
52:04
early teenage diaries was he kept a note
52:06
of his attempts to only go to the
52:07
brothel twice a month
52:10
i know so he really was trying yeah he
52:12
was like
52:13
the gym he's got his membership he never
52:17
uses it
52:18
it's a waste of money got it on
52:21
christmas day
52:22
i want to quit the brothel after a while
52:24
if you haven't been to the brothel you
52:26
can't really go back
52:27
because they've noticed that you haven't
52:30
been
52:32
he when he was 16 he recorded that he
52:34
sort of scourged himself and whipped
52:36
himself because he wanted to toughen up
52:37
the physical pain
52:38
um and then immediately the next day he
52:40
remembered that life is short and so he
52:42
lay in bed for three days enjoying
52:43
reading and eating honey cakes
52:47
honey cakes are nice toy story in some
52:50
way
52:52
he wrote the shawshank redemption or he
52:54
wrote the original
52:56
sorry i am filling him for down here um
52:58
he so
52:59
it's the short shot redemption the film
53:01
is based on stephen king's novella rita
53:04
hayworth in the show
53:04
and suresh reduction but that in turn
53:06
was based on a short story
53:08
by toy story called god sees the truth
53:10
but waits about a man who's sent to
53:11
prison for a murder that he didn't
53:12
commit
53:13
really yeah and it's all about
53:14
redemption and forgiveness but he wanted
53:15
tom hanks for the part didn't you he did
53:17
yeah exactly
53:20
um as a young man tolstoy lost so much
53:22
money gambling that he had to sell off
53:24
his
53:24
family home right and it was this was a
53:27
huge
53:28
you know shame and all of this but the
53:30
buyer dismantled the family home and
53:32
removed it from the site it was
53:34
so there were just two huge wings of the
53:35
house on either side which he had not
53:37
sold off
53:38
[Laughter]
53:39
a gaping hole in between them no
53:42
yes oh yeah oh that's amazing
53:46
well all the useful rooms in the middle
53:47
bit
53:49
20 on sweet bathrooms

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:21
covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:24
here with anna chazinski
00:25
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:28
and once again we have gathered around
00:29
the microphones with our four favorite
00:31
facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order here we go
00:36
starting with you chiczinski my fact
00:38
this week is that one of the women about
00:40
to take part in the first
00:42
all-female space has spent the last
00:44
eight years
00:45
hand-rearing a flock of geese wow
00:48
and not in preparation for this oh so
00:50
that isn't part of the preparation does
00:52
sound like it sounds like she's going to
00:53
take
00:54
the geese with her yeah she's flying up
00:56
on the flock of geese
00:58
which would almost work because they're
00:59
geese which are famous because they can
01:02
fly higher than any other bird
01:03
so they're the bar-headed geese but not
01:05
in space i think space would be pushing
01:07
it even for them
01:08
yeah um so this is jessica mir and she's
01:11
due to do a spacewalk on october 21st
01:13
and she's going to do it with christina
01:15
koch and it's going to be the first
01:16
all-female spacewalk
01:18
and she hasn't always been an astronaut
01:19
she's a physiologist and the reason
01:20
she's going up into space is to look at
01:22
how space
01:23
affects people's bodies and in the past
01:25
she's only ever really looked at this in
01:27
animals and so one of the things she
01:28
looked at is the bar-headed goose
01:30
because it flies so high and so she
01:32
wanted to know how it can survive for
01:34
instance in oxygen which is a third as
01:36
much as
01:37
oxygen here at ground level and so yeah
01:40
she realized that um the only way you
01:41
can look at that and look at how their
01:42
physiology responds to proper
01:43
sort of everest height level conditions
01:46
is by putting them in a wind tunnel and
01:48
blasting them with wind and reducing
01:49
their oxygen levels
01:50
and putting masks on them and stuff and
01:52
all of that really freaks geese out
01:54
and so you can't really do that to a
01:56
bunch of geese that you've just picked
01:57
up and so she realized
01:59
in order to study this she'd have to
02:00
rear geese from
02:02
the egg so that they trusted her and so
02:04
she did cool and the pictures are
02:05
amazing aren't they
02:06
i've seen the picture there was an
02:08
article by ed young right yes
02:10
you read this as well and they have a
02:11
picture of her with all of her little
02:13
geese around her and she just looks
02:15
like mother goose kind of thing and they
02:17
followed her around and everything right
02:19
yeah it looks pretty fun because they
02:21
imprinted on her i think we've probably
02:22
said before that there are a lot of
02:24
birds which if
02:25
you're the first thing they see and if
02:26
you nurture them as a
02:28
youth then they think you're their
02:29
mother yeah and so they love her she
02:31
trained them to fly
02:32
by scootering along on her motorbike
02:34
scooter thing
02:35
and they all flew next to her but well
02:38
i'm sure you read this in the piece too
02:39
it's when they got separated like if a
02:41
car came in the other direction they'd
02:42
freak out and fly off
02:44
and then they would just land somewhere
02:45
and they would search for anyone who
02:46
looked like
02:47
the lady they thought was their mother
02:50
so one one of them just started
02:51
following people in and out of a
02:52
supermarket just on the ground
02:53
how similar do you think you'd have to
02:55
look to this lady i think if you
02:57
had brown hair i think that would do it
03:00
um
03:00
one of them landed in a hockey field and
03:02
started chasing players around the field
03:05
brilliant um and yeah they they had to
03:08
wear a backpack and goggles didn't they
03:10
too
03:10
yeah or no was it a mask it was a little
03:13
mask yeah a tiny mask
03:14
yeah it doesn't look as comical as you
03:15
might be imagining i sort of imagined
03:17
biggles or something but
03:19
tiny little goggles and and yeah and
03:22
they would blow
03:23
nitrogen into their face so that they
03:24
could see what it would be like with low
03:26
oxygen conditions that they would
03:27
otherwise be flying at
03:28
and even then they didn't all cooperate
03:30
so they're quite stubborn and fair
03:32
enough
03:32
someone shoves you in a wind tunnel and
03:33
takes away your air um
03:35
seven of them are cooperated seven out
03:36
of 12. so she did these experiments
03:39
yeah in the wind tunnel yeah and what
03:42
did she find
03:43
she basically found out that they are
03:45
really well adapted
03:47
to these strange conditions so first of
03:50
all they've got
03:50
better hemoglobin than the rest of us so
03:52
the hemoglobin's just better at taking
03:54
in oxygen they've got much more densely
03:56
packed
03:57
blood vessels they've got bigger lungs
03:59
and they take
04:00
deep breaths so if you see a goose
04:02
flying that's sort of panting
04:04
it's likely to be a bar-headed goose
04:07
okay
04:07
so how did nasa find her and then decide
04:10
to train her as an astronaut
04:12
well i read that she was an aquanaut
04:14
before she was an astronaut
04:15
okay wow um she worked for nasa in the
04:17
extreme environment missions operations
04:20
four which is known as nemo and they
04:22
went to the antarctic and they studied
04:24
the emperor penguins and elephant seals
04:26
to see how they deal with
04:27
cold weather and deep diving and things
04:30
like that but she didn't she didn't have
04:31
to raise any
04:32
elephant seals from the egg
04:36
i would love to see the penguins around
04:38
the hockey place
04:40
yeah yeah she did dive with them a lot
04:42
so maybe she was a sort of mother figure
04:44
so are you suggesting james that maybe
04:45
it was a bit of a typo on nasa's part
04:47
they meant to type astronaut they typed
04:50
aquanauts she felt too rude to say no
04:52
and that was it
04:52
i think you're absolutely right so space
04:55
walks
04:55
oh yeah the man who did the first ever
04:58
space walk alexei leonov
04:59
he died very recently he died within the
05:02
last fortnight or so
05:03
and he had a terrible time when he went
05:06
into space
05:07
um and specifically when he walked in
05:09
space so he just had to put a camera on
05:11
the airlock
05:12
and record it with the camera on his
05:13
chest and then not die and that was all
05:15
he had to do
05:16
um you're making it sound like it's not
05:18
difficult no no no
05:19
it's very difficult but he must even mop
05:21
that up the pool
05:24
but his body temperature went up and up
05:26
because obviously you're in a
05:27
spacesuit and i think that sort of
05:29
reflected the heat inwards rather than
05:31
letting it radiate outwards
05:32
and it was so inflated his spacesuit
05:35
that he couldn't even reach the camera
05:36
on his chest
05:37
you know he was just this sort of
05:38
michelin man floating around his face
05:40
and he was so big that he couldn't get
05:42
back in the airlock yeah yeah
05:44
and his hand slipped out of his gloves
05:46
and his feet slipped out of his boots
05:48
so he was just inside this very big
05:49
space suit i know
05:51
it must be like mr blobby it was like mr
05:53
blobby in space basically
05:54
yeah and so he had to deflate himself
05:56
didn't he yeah
05:58
he had to allow some of the pressure out
05:59
but as a result of that he got the bends
06:01
like you would if you were coming back
06:02
from scuba diving
06:03
so that complicated things even more
06:05
yeah yeah he said it was incredibly
06:07
difficult to squeeze in wasn't it and
06:08
you had to go sort of head first which
06:10
you weren't supposed to
06:11
and because the deflations are losing
06:13
the pressure meant that you i'm not sure
06:15
it was exactly the bends but it's like
06:16
it involves sucking the oxygen out of
06:18
his suit
06:18
so he was basically risking suffocating
06:20
himself for the sake of trying to get
06:22
back in otherwise he would have died of
06:24
course otherwise he would have died i
06:25
suppose so yeah
06:26
it's really you've got to do it but also
06:28
he couldn't say anything he couldn't say
06:30
this is going disastrously wrong because
06:31
he knew that other nations on earth were
06:33
listening in
06:34
yeah so are you kidding me yeah so he
06:36
didn't say anything
06:37
everything's great this is awesome i'm
06:40
just going to stay up for a few more
06:42
minutes
06:42
i love it so much and then when he came
06:44
back to earth he landed 2 000 kilometers
06:46
away from where he should have been
06:48
and he had to kind of make his way back
06:50
and the russian government said that he
06:51
was on holiday yeah
06:54
but i actually saw a movie about this
06:56
whole thing called spacewalker is in
06:58
russian but i think you can get it in
06:59
english in with subtitles
07:01
and i watched it i think on the south
07:03
bank and leonov was sat in front of us
07:06
no yeah no so he was in the same
07:08
screening as us and they did a q a
07:10
afterwards
07:11
and they said that when they did the
07:12
premiere in moscow there were two women
07:14
sat next to him
07:15
and one of them was saying you know do
07:17
you think he's gonna make it they were
07:18
whispering to each other do you think
07:19
he's gonna make it do you think he's
07:20
gonna make it alive and the other one
07:21
went well i think so he sat right
07:24
but it's an amazing movie it's so tough
07:26
that's incredible it's brilliant that
07:27
apparently was one of the
07:29
feedback things that were given from an
07:31
audience member who saw
07:32
a premiere of apollo 13. you know how
07:34
they do test screenings
07:36
um one of the things was um classic
07:38
hollywood endings they survived this
07:40
improbable trip at the end as if that
07:41
would really happen in real life
07:43
that's hilarious um did they do the bit
07:45
in the film where they apparently
07:46
dropped a cauldron down to them
07:48
so they were in the deep snow in the
07:50
urals um
07:51
hellish worst place to accidentally land
07:53
and they'd waited three days
07:55
and then when the rescuers arrived
07:56
apparently because they were very cold
07:58
they dropped a huge cauldron of boiling
08:00
water from a helicopter down into the
08:01
snow for them
08:02
so they could climb in and warm up how
08:04
fun would that be
08:05
i guess so i guess it would be fun it
08:07
doesn't sound fun
08:08
climbing into a culture of boiling water
08:18
um but it was also the place they landed
08:21
was a wolf and bear riddled forest
08:23
apparently and it was also bear
08:25
it was mating season so all of the bears
08:27
were particularly aggressive
08:29
so they're little hybrid barely enough
08:31
children out there in there
08:33
we're dropping a load of fur from the
08:35
helicopter just put the fur on you'll be
08:36
fine
08:38
apparently it was because of this that
08:40
uh i read this fact ages ago that
08:42
astronauts used to be given a gun
08:44
because if they landed in enemy
08:46
territory or somewhere dangerous
08:48
i mean it's a short-term solution to a
08:50
problem it creates more problems than it
08:51
calls if you have an astronaut landing
08:52
and then trying to shoot his way out of
08:54
america or whatever
08:55
it's not for people landing in america
08:59
sorry it will stop bears from shagging
09:01
you
09:03
um leonov's uh leonov survived and he
09:05
made it into
09:06
i know he was at the cinema
09:09
but he was in he was in another movie as
09:11
well he was in 2001 a space odyssey
09:14
his breathing the recordings of his
09:16
breathing were used by kubrick
09:18
in that film he was quite a creative
09:22
chap wasn't he he was an artist yeah
09:24
i've seen an exhibition of his work as
09:25
well in
09:26
in moscow really yeah was it good yeah
09:28
really good he does
09:29
predictably mostly do pictures of space
09:32
i guess you would if you'd seen it if
09:33
you've been right out there
09:35
look if it if these things have been
09:36
painted by someone else i might not have
09:38
enjoyed it quite as much
09:39
i feel like in russia he's so famous or
09:41
he was so famous like only gagarin would
09:43
be more famous yeah
09:45
yeah in space terms and he insisted on
09:47
bringing up pencil and paper didn't he
09:49
in
09:49
in his first space trip and so he drew
09:51
the first pictures in space and drew
09:52
kind of portraits of his fellow
09:54
astronauts and drew the first sort of
09:55
sunrise in space and he tied together
09:57
all his pencils to make sure they didn't
09:59
all float around and get lost that's so
10:01
cool
10:01
very clever cool guy did you tie them
10:05
together
10:05
in a bundle or did he turn together end
10:08
to end
10:09
so you had a sort of train of pencils i
10:11
think it was a train
10:12
i thought it was a train yeah because if
10:14
you did them in one bundle you won't be
10:15
able to
10:16
draw anything because you just have all
10:17
the points at the same time you can draw
10:19
ten things at the same time yeah but
10:20
they'd all be the same thing
10:26
um just on on why
10:29
space walking is so exhausting is partly
10:31
because
10:32
so it's frequently just home improvement
10:34
is what they're doing on the iss these
10:36
days they're just
10:36
adjusting things and fitting new things
10:39
but
10:39
every time you turn a spanner for
10:41
example on the outside of the iss
10:43
um your body turns the opposite
10:45
direction because of the lack of gravity
10:47
so it's really knackering just to hold
10:49
your whole self in space
10:50
with one bit of you while you're turning
10:52
this panel with the other bit yeah
10:53
that's the problem we don't have down
10:54
here well
10:55
the other problem is of course is that
10:56
you're going around the planet every 90
10:58
minutes so he did a
11:00
five hour plus space walk and that's one
11:02
of the other things you've got the sun
11:03
directly on you for half the time and
11:05
then you're back into ice cold of the
11:07
universe
11:07
for the other half and so that's where
11:09
the sweat and then you go into absolute
11:11
shivering
11:12
storms as well that's according to scott
11:13
kelly uh the astronaut i read
11:15
once oh gosh i can't even remember who
11:17
it is or hardly anything about it
11:19
but there was a guy i think doing a
11:21
space walk and then like a flap of his
11:23
spacesuit kind of
11:24
came off but it didn't expose his body
11:27
but exposed some part that wasn't
11:28
supposed to be exposed and he got the
11:29
worst sunburn
11:31
like a massive triangle of sunburn on
11:33
his back i think so
11:34
so vague that memory but what an amazing
11:36
tan mark to have
11:40
you try and preserve that uh just back
11:42
to mir
11:43
the astronauts yeah not the space
11:45
station um who is rearing the geese
11:47
who's at the top of this fact she's not
11:48
the only astronaut who's gone to space
11:50
with the help of birds to get her there
11:54
peggy whitson who is uh by all accounts
11:57
the most experienced astronaut today she
12:00
was the
12:00
um she was the head of the iss um she
12:02
spent 665 days in space in total that's
12:05
enough
12:06
to go around mars and back
12:07
hypothetically she made that trip with
12:09
the
12:09
time she was there and she got there
12:11
because she only got a pilot license
12:14
when she sold chickens that she was
12:15
raising for two dollars each
12:17
that eventually built up enough money
12:19
for her to get her pilot's license which
12:20
led her to becoming a nasa
12:22
astronaut is it true that
12:25
what was the reason behind her not being
12:27
able to do the space walk in the first
12:28
place oh yeah
12:29
that was earlier on this year yeah that
12:31
wasn't jessica mir but it was the person
12:33
she's space walking with christina cox
12:35
and this is in our book the uh
12:39
we've probably written a book this year
12:40
yeah is it called the book of the year
12:42
2019.
12:43
that's what it's called yeah available
12:45
in all good bookshops uh from a couple
12:46
of weeks time
12:47
and so this is news from our book from
12:49
this year the first all-female spacewalk
12:51
was supposed to happen quite a few
12:52
months ago
12:53
and it had to be cancelled because they
12:55
didn't have nasa didn't have a spacesuit
12:56
that fitted
12:57
and this was anne mcclain was the other
12:59
astronaut who was supposed to do it with
13:01
christina cook
13:02
and it turned out when it came to the
13:04
day she trained in large and medium
13:05
spacesuits
13:06
but she realized she didn't feel
13:07
comfortable in the large one and old
13:09
christina was hogging the medium one
13:11
so anne said all right we'll let her man
13:12
do it and that
13:14
that killed that for a few months and
13:16
that was happening and is it because
13:17
your body changes
13:19
i think i read this your body kind of
13:20
changes when you're in space and so you
13:22
can never quite tell whether you'll fit
13:24
into something until you
13:25
wow yeah and so she had done a spacewalk
13:28
in a medium one exactly so she knew that
13:30
at least that would work
13:31
but do you get smaller in space oh no
13:33
she just didn't have access to a medium
13:34
suit
13:35
you don't shrink in space you're just
13:36
further away
13:38
you get taller in space yeah because the
13:41
gravity is not pulling
13:42
you spread out down to your feet all the
13:44
time yeah i didn't realize it was only
13:46
two women doing a space walk
13:48
and that's all obviously that is all
13:49
female but when i read all female
13:50
spacewalks you've got
13:51
every woman on earth no i just can't
13:53
imagine imagine like five or so like
13:55
roughly
13:56
the same as girls allowed i've seen that
13:57
seen an endgame when all the girl
14:00
superheroes come yeah in that slightly
14:02
yeah because you wouldn't say if you had
14:04
like
14:05
two singers like um pepsi and shirley
14:08
you wouldn't say they were an all-girl
14:09
group really would you you know
14:11
girls allowed are an old girl group
14:12
definitely so what's the minimum number
14:15
of all for anything what about sugar
14:18
babes would you say they're an old girl
14:19
group
14:20
i i actually would yes i think three i
14:22
think three things we're not calling it
14:23
can i just clarify an all girl's
14:25
facebook
14:27
it's an all female space walk guys i
14:29
think it should be called a both female
14:31
space walk
14:33
the only both females face i don't know
14:40
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:43
that is
14:44
andy my fact is that the netherlands has
14:46
a restaurant where if you move tables
14:47
there is a chance you'll end up
14:49
in belgium
14:50
[Laughter]
14:53
so this is a place called bao
14:57
and i'm sure i'm pronouncing that
14:58
correctly so don't write in and it's
15:00
between the netherlands and bedroom the
15:01
town is basically in the netherlands but
15:04
there are lots of um enclaves which is
15:07
you know a patch of land inside another
15:09
country
15:09
and those are belgian enclaves inside
15:11
the town and
15:13
some of these borders pass through
15:15
living rooms for example or
15:17
restaurants and the the laws are
15:20
observed there so there was a time when
15:22
the um licensing hours meant that you
15:25
had to stop drinking
15:26
in one country but not in another one
15:28
and so everyone would have to get up
15:29
from their tables at some point
15:31
if they wanted to keep drinking and then
15:32
move across to the country where you
15:34
could keep drinking
15:35
it used to be that the legal drinking
15:36
age i don't know if it still is it was
15:38
16 in belgium and 18 in the netherlands
15:41
that's great so would you like can i see
15:43
some id
15:44
they'd say can i show you my id over
15:46
there
15:50
i've actually been to this town yeah
15:52
bell
15:54
i went just because i'd heard i knew you
15:57
would have something i know i don't
15:58
think you do
15:59
basically i went on a holiday with my ex
16:01
around belgium and the netherlands and
16:02
dragged her to this town
16:05
which she was not impressed by but i was
16:06
really impressed because i did read that
16:08
there's not really much there there is
16:09
not
16:10
yeah it really isn't you get off the
16:12
train and you wander around and you look
16:13
at all the borders and stuff and i had a
16:15
wandering round looking for pornography
16:16
shops and fire workshops
16:19
wow that's what i do when i'm on the
16:21
holidays yeah
16:22
yeah are they separate shops or do they
16:24
sell both things no so
16:25
what i read before i went here is that
16:28
um
16:28
pornography is more legal in the
16:30
netherlands and fireworks are more legal
16:32
in belgium
16:33
and so they're in separate parts of this
16:35
town but when i went there i actually
16:36
couldn't find either
16:37
again still more clues to the end of
16:39
this relationship
16:42
did you see there's one house where so a
16:44
lot of the border doesn't affect
16:46
massively
16:46
houses because the border will go
16:48
halfway through the house but there's
16:49
one with a door
16:50
where the border goes right down the
16:51
middle of the door so that it's very
16:52
cool because what they have on it is
16:54
they couldn't work out which side which
16:56
country it belonged to for an address
16:58
um so it actually has two doorbells
17:01
either side of it
17:02
so you ring it if you want to be on the
17:03
belgium side and then
17:06
yeah and it's got two addresses so on
17:07
the ground they have these crosses which
17:09
kind of show you where the border is
17:10
rather than lines they're kind of like
17:12
crosses with a dark cross with a dot
17:13
cross with a dot
17:14
and some of them go directly through the
17:15
door way and then also
17:18
like all the houses have little flags on
17:19
that are either belgium flags or
17:21
netherlands bags so you can tell which
17:23
country you're in and you can walk down
17:24
one street and you can cross through
17:26
five borders in less than a minute wow
17:28
yeah
17:28
although i couldn't tell with the house
17:30
where it goes through the door um
17:32
because the way you normally decide with
17:33
a house which country it's in is by the
17:35
doorway
17:36
and often people or sometimes people on
17:38
the border apparently
17:39
have moved their doorway to be in a more
17:41
tax-friendly
17:43
country i couldn't tell which country
17:46
this house counted as being in for tax
17:47
purposes so i'm kind of here to
17:49
highlight some possible tax evasion
17:51
but it claims that it's in belgium where
17:53
the netherlands guys come and vice versa
17:55
sure you're right such a cop
17:57
[Music]
17:58
so if you are sitting at the table in
18:01
the belgian bit
18:02
you're allowed to build a house within
18:04
300 meters of a pig farm
18:06
which you're not allowed to do if you're
18:08
sitting at a table in the netherlands
18:09
bit of the restaurant
18:11
who builds a house in a restaurant yeah
18:14
i think
18:14
come on you're taking the restaurant bit
18:17
too far
18:18
slightly yeah if you're on the belgian
18:20
side then fine okay
18:22
um yeah and they have two phone systems
18:24
and two police forces and two fire
18:25
services
18:26
the fire service thing is really
18:27
interesting did you read this no
18:29
so the belgian and dutch fire brigades
18:31
have different size hoses
18:34
different thickness and so they had
18:37
problems with the fire hydrants because
18:38
the fire hydrants are different in the
18:40
netherlands than they are in belgium so
18:42
funny
18:42
and so they appealed to the eu for money
18:44
to kind of get all the hoses
18:46
standardized and stuff like that but
18:47
they didn't do that
18:48
and in the end the um fire departments
18:51
had to
18:52
invent these adapters that could take
18:54
you from one
18:55
hose pipe to one fire hydrant and vice
18:58
versa amazing
18:59
that's so cool isn't that cool that's
19:00
really good because necessity is the
19:01
mother of invention yeah i think
19:03
okay they applied to be apparently both
19:07
places applied to be
19:08
to unesco to be a world heritage site
19:11
because of their complex cartography but
19:13
i don't think they have
19:14
won that because as you said james and
19:16
you've been there there is nothing there
19:18
it was
19:18
it was quite a few years ago when i was
19:19
there but yeah it really was quite
19:21
boring
19:22
one fun thing you could do there
19:24
apparently but i couldn't find
19:26
if this is possible but the border goes
19:28
through the middle of a road at one
19:29
point
19:30
so if you're driving on one side and the
19:31
speed limit uh in belgium is different
19:33
to the netherlands you can drive you
19:35
know twice as fast
19:36
but as far as i can tell because at the
19:38
same time yeah that would be a very
19:39
different speed limit which is a
19:41
double that is i mean the truth is that
19:43
these two countries are very similar in
19:45
many many ways
19:47
and they're in the eu which makes them
19:49
even more similar one of them should
19:50
leave the eu and i think that would then
19:52
make it quite exciting
19:54
i don't think we need any more
19:56
excitement about borders and people
19:57
leaving the eu
20:00
we've been talking about this place in
20:02
belgium netherlands where it's not
20:03
really an issue
20:04
this place being there because the
20:05
countries get along well but there was a
20:07
serious problem between india and
20:08
bangladesh
20:09
which had 80 of the world's enclaves in
20:12
it until a couple of years ago
20:13
and so that meant there were 106 indian
20:15
enclaves in bangladesh and 92
20:17
bangladeshi enclaves
20:19
in india and multiple counter enclaves
20:22
within them
20:23
so you'd have india in bangladesh in
20:25
india and also it had the world's
20:27
only counter counter enclave so there
20:29
was a bit of india
20:31
inside a bit of bangladesh inside a bit
20:33
of india inside the whole of bangladesh
20:34
so on this border between india and
20:36
bangladesh there's a town called hilly
20:38
h-i-l-i
20:39
and some houses lie on the border so you
20:41
can enter the front door in india
20:42
and leave the back door in bangladesh
20:45
and policemen anna our police persona
20:48
would be very interested because
20:49
basically it's just a place where people
20:50
do a lot of smuggling
20:51
i would install myself inside that house
20:54
and stop anyone from moving from the
20:55
kitchen
20:57
at all times but i think it has been
20:59
solved now because it was a serious
21:00
problem and for instance if you're in an
21:03
indian enclave in bangladesh then you
21:05
wouldn't be allowed to travel outside of
21:07
your tiny
21:08
sphere into bangladesh without a visa or
21:10
a passport but to get a visa or a
21:11
passport you have to go to
21:13
india proper and you can't get to india
21:15
without crossing through bangladesh so
21:17
people were just
21:17
trapped there and it was a major issue
21:20
and i think in 2015
21:21
they finally swapped all their land back
21:23
so this is getting ridiculous um we
21:24
never explained why
21:26
this place in the netherlands and
21:27
belgium is how it is
21:29
and it's basically due to the lords of
21:32
braider and the dukes of brabant
21:35
brabant brabant i think brabant
21:38
sounds good yeah um and they basically
21:41
just
21:41
swapped land with each other over many
21:43
many hundreds of years these two
21:45
families
21:46
and that's why you've got two places
21:48
one's called baal hertog and one's
21:50
called baal
21:50
nassau and the bel hertog comes from the
21:53
dutch word meaning duke
21:54
and the nacelle comes from the house of
21:56
nassau which was the aristocratic house
21:58
which ruled
21:59
breda in that time and they just
22:02
swapped yeah they kind of just kept
22:05
swapping things people would run out of
22:07
money and
22:08
the other people would buy some of your
22:09
land and you would buy some of their
22:11
land back and stuff
22:12
like that and eventually after the
22:14
second world war
22:15
no one could really work out anything
22:16
but they found some old maps which said
22:19
how it all fits in i think that's right
22:20
but i it just i find it unfathomable
22:22
that when we reach the age
22:24
of visas and passports and technology
22:26
and the eu
22:27
they didn't say shall we now disregard
22:29
the pointless stupid whims
22:31
of these weird renaissance dukes and do
22:33
it like a normal person it was the same
22:35
in india the reason it happened in india
22:36
was because there were maharajas
22:38
who were just playing cards and chess
22:40
and waging bits of land between them
22:42
apparently or it was obviously at the
22:44
whim
22:44
of local lords saying oh look i'll fine
22:47
you can have that bit of land if i can
22:48
shag your wife or whatever
22:49
well you can argue that modern day
22:51
nationhood in a lot of the world is down
22:53
to whims of dukes and
22:55
yeah couldn't you basically but it's
22:57
just the tourism it would
22:58
imagine the harkins of the world not
22:59
visiting places like this they would
23:01
fold in minutes all right i hardly think
23:05
there are millions of
23:06
like people going to these places yeah
23:08
how rammed was it when you were there
23:11
um i was just looking at some weird
23:13
borders very interesting border disputes
23:15
or territorial disputes
23:17
and i didn't know about this place
23:18
called beer towel
23:20
which is it's a really big patch of land
23:23
so it's over 2
23:24
000 kilometers squared it's a patch of
23:25
desert it's between
23:27
egypt and sudan and i believe it's the
23:29
only place in the world
23:30
which is not claimed by any country as
23:32
in
23:33
egypt claims it belongs to sudan sudan
23:36
claims it belongs to egypt
23:39
the unwanted son of geopolitics yeah
23:41
it's a poor little lump of desert
23:43
it's terrible is it just really crap
23:45
really how crap must
23:47
be to not want that territory though
23:49
well it's because
23:50
basically um there were two there were
23:53
two accords which drew up the territory
23:55
and decided who it belonged to
23:56
and one of them decided that this place
23:59
beer tawal
24:00
belonged to egypt and another place
24:01
called the halaib triangle belonged to
24:03
sudan
24:04
and then the other accord said it was
24:06
the other way around and the halab
24:07
triangle
24:08
is great it's on the coast it's a nice
24:10
patch of land
24:11
it's much bigger so they both really
24:13
want that okay
24:14
if either of them claim the other place
24:16
they're sort of implicitly saying
24:18
i don't want the nice triangle so they
24:20
can't
24:21
so if anyone wants it it's going free
24:25
so it's not much there though it's just
24:27
it's even less there than
24:30
it's on james's next holiday destination
24:32
i would go i think you can't i think
24:34
you're not supposed to go there
24:35
i don't think it doesn't sound like
24:37
there are many fireworks or pornography
24:38
shops though
24:39
disappointing just one more thing about
24:42
borders
24:42
in china trains crossing from mongolia
24:45
at the town of erlien
24:46
they have to wait and the passengers all
24:48
have to wait inside the train while the
24:50
wheels are changed
24:51
really different gauges different gauges
24:54
the tracks in china are narrow
24:55
classic used to have that in australia a
24:57
huge issue between the states of
24:58
australia
24:59
because there was massive dispute
25:00
between i think it was uh
25:02
south australia and victoria maybe about
25:04
the gauges no one wants to give up their
25:06
gauges i can understand it
25:07
in two different countries but come on
25:10
australia get your act together
25:12
the same country sort your out
25:15
um my friend i spoke to my friend who
25:16
lives in china yesterday and she's just
25:18
been to visit
25:19
south korea and she went to the dmz and
25:22
she looked
25:22
with a binoculars or a telescope over
25:24
the border and saw i think we've
25:26
discussed before the
25:27
peace village you know the fake village
25:29
of north korea um
25:31
so yeah i think we've mentioned this oh
25:33
well she actually again james she did
25:35
say
25:36
it was really crap but it sounds like
25:38
you would probably enjoy it
25:39
that would not stop me honestly i know
25:41
are we spoken about their negotiation
25:43
room
25:43
the north korea south korean negotiation
25:45
room no this is for where they meet to
25:47
sort of just discuss along the border
25:48
but the room itself
25:50
is along the border so there's a table
25:51
in there which is cut in two
25:54
which is the one half belongs to the
25:55
north and one to the side why did they
25:57
feel the need to cut it into i guess
25:59
it's a symbolic this is our table and
26:01
this is your table does it have legs in
26:02
the middle because otherwise surely the
26:04
table's just falling over
26:06
it's a long table so yeah it must have
26:07
enough legs either side
26:10
what if you drop your pencil and it
26:12
rolls over into north korea that's why
26:14
they always tie their pencil with a load
26:15
of
26:16
strength
26:21
okay it is time for fact number three
26:23
and that is my fact
26:24
my fact this week is that in order to
26:26
stop drought an indian village married
26:28
two frogs
26:29
two months later they had to be divorced
26:31
because it would not stop
26:32
raining uh this is this is a thing that
26:35
was done out there this year
26:37
um this was in a place called bhopal and
26:40
they were
26:41
divorced symbolically because the rain
26:43
was just causing total destruction in
26:45
the area
26:45
they obviously couldn't find the frogs
26:47
that they needed um because i believe
26:49
they must have been left
26:50
back into the wild so it was so they not
26:52
just found the one in the top hat the
26:54
one in the vale
26:56
they were divorced by proxy yeah yes
26:59
yeah
27:00
wow technically they're probably still
27:01
married i would say
27:03
yeah wouldn't you say they don't know it
27:04
though they don't know they've been
27:06
divorced so they don't even know they're
27:07
frogs
27:09
but they'll be out there living in sin
27:11
yeah but this is a thing that's done a
27:12
lot um
27:13
over in india they have marriages of
27:15
frogs for rain a lot and they really go
27:17
to town with the sort of
27:18
the the whole process of setting up a
27:20
wedding so they send out invitation
27:22
cards
27:23
they had custom clothes made wedding
27:25
clothes for the frogs
27:26
you would have to make custom clothes
27:28
because they don't sell them off the
27:32
rack
27:34
such a good place what they actually
27:36
have to go through it's not just they
27:37
just take any old frogs they actually
27:38
have a procedure
27:39
that has them inspected by the zoology
27:42
departments um that are local to them
27:44
and after the selection process they
27:46
bring them together to a hotel
27:48
in this case that were read a story they
27:50
got married on a tricycle
27:52
and um yeah and then they all go out for
27:54
celebrations afterwards
27:55
this is this is what they do what have
27:58
you seen a picture of this
27:59
supposed tricycle no no was that a
28:01
custom-made tricycle
28:02
i think it's a huge i think it's
28:03
human-sized tricycle really i think they
28:06
were taken to the venue on a tricycle i
28:08
don't think the ceremony took place on
28:09
the tri-state
28:10
ridiculous yeah that's not good wedding
28:12
in spo at all
28:14
i think if you're not old enough to ride
28:15
a proper bicycle you're not old enough
28:17
to get married
28:18
personally that's just my old very
28:20
opinion very harsh
28:22
i don't know i think that's
28:23
uncontroversial
28:25
so they they got married to please lord
28:27
indra who is the hindu god of reigns
28:30
and indra was he's kind of a weird god
28:33
so
28:34
there was um a goddess a very beautiful
28:36
goddess called
28:37
ahalya which is also means perfection
28:40
and she was married to another god
28:42
called gautama but indra really fancied
28:45
i really liked ahalya
28:46
and so decided to disguise himself as
28:49
guatama
28:50
to have sex with her and then as always
28:53
happens he got found out
28:54
and so gautama cursed him to be adorned
28:58
his body to be adorned with one thousand
29:00
vaginas
29:02
oh what wow yeah that was his cup i
29:05
didn't see that coming
29:07
i thought he was gonna get turned into a
29:08
frog
29:11
no 1 000 vaginas the very opposite got
29:14
turned into a different animal
29:16
um because gautama thought okay a
29:18
thousand vaginas
29:20
actually that is a bit much you know it
29:21
was bad what he did but i thought i was
29:23
a vagina that's a bit more
29:24
can we get so he swapped the vaginas for
29:26
eyes
29:27
so he was adorned with a thousand eyes
29:29
and he became i would guess a peacock
29:31
correct hey and that's why peacocks have
29:34
so many eyes on their tails they used to
29:36
be vaginas
29:37
right really did they but not
29:39
functioning ones more decorative vaginas
29:42
i suppose so okay even if you had a
29:44
thousand functioning vaginas
29:46
it's hard to get through them yeah it
29:48
would take you a long time to get
29:49
through the roll yeah
29:51
it'll be easy to get through you try you
29:54
definitely set yourself that challenge
29:55
but then keeping track as a nightmare
29:57
you'd have to have some sort of sticker
29:59
system or some sort of
30:01
you're basically a colander at that
30:02
stage
30:04
blimey or riley we should say not
30:06
everyone in india believes this frog
30:08
stuff the top comment on the times of
30:09
india when they reported the story
30:11
top comment was stupidity has no limits
30:14
as has been proved by the people and the
30:15
journalists covering the story
30:17
so i think even in india it is a thing
30:19
where people go oh right yeah
30:21
sure yeah yeah yeah it's pretty rare but
30:24
it's definitely
30:24
is you know it's related to hinduism so
30:26
it's apparently that god vishnu once
30:29
took the form of kind of an amphibian
30:31
some and sometimes a fish but maybe
30:33
that's also kind of sometimes a frog
30:35
and so that's where it comes from so it
30:36
could well be a symbolic thing
30:38
rather than you know it's just like a
30:39
prayer really and they do get
30:41
decorated like you think the frogs
30:42
sometimes get a wedding ring or
30:44
they get cloaks put on them or sometimes
30:47
little
30:48
little veils and there was one person
30:50
who remembered being taken to a muslim
30:53
that's amazing all custom assumed
30:55
custom-made unless otherwise stated
30:57
uh there was one girl who remembered
31:00
when she was younger being taken to a
31:03
was massive frog wedding for a massive
31:04
frog was it a massive wedding for a
31:06
normal sized family could they could use
31:08
a normal shot bought veil for that one
31:10
which was great
31:11
it was one of the few yep um it was i
31:13
didn't get the frog size um it was a
31:15
frog wedding that was attended
31:16
by about 70 people and the frog's head
31:19
is streaked with vermilion powder like
31:21
women's heads are when they get married
31:22
in hinduism
31:23
so that it's called sindoor that red
31:25
powder that you smear over the
31:26
over your parting so the frogs get that
31:29
um and
31:30
yeah wear lipstick quite a lot put
31:32
lipstick on a frog
31:33
which is not a saying that you can't put
31:35
lipstick on your face on a pig yeah
31:36
or a hug sometimes isn't this is the
31:40
saying that you can put lipstick on a
31:41
pig
31:42
no well you i mean well you can but it
31:44
doesn't make it look any better
31:46
as well right what the point is it's
31:47
because there's another one about
31:48
rolling a turd in glitter
31:50
yeah and you can i mean i would say you
31:52
can do all these things
31:53
you can't you can't put lipstick on a
31:55
pig but you can't make it drink
31:57
that's how it goes and you can actually
31:59
buy a thing that makes your poo glittery
32:01
as well
32:02
can you yeah you eat it and it and it
32:04
goes through your system and your poo
32:05
comes out glittery gosh
32:06
yeah what a useful thing i actually was
32:09
going to submit a fact for another
32:11
week's podcast but i'll just say it now
32:12
which is the echidnas
32:14
have glittery poo no what yeah they have
32:17
sparkly poo
32:18
and it's only because of the well can
32:20
you guess why
32:21
well it must be something they eat yep
32:23
they're australian echidnas aren't they
32:25
yep yeah
32:26
um so what is is it like when the new
32:30
year parties happen in sydney massive
32:32
party loads of glitter
32:33
eat it it out very nice it's a very
32:35
good theory it's not there
32:36
okay there's something something
32:38
luminescent or phosphorescent some
32:40
fireflies no it's ants it's ant
32:43
exoskeletons when they crunch them up
32:47
in their bodies they love eating ants so
32:49
they sparkle and they make it have
32:51
glittery poo
32:52
they're crazy beautiful yeah that's
32:55
great um do you guys know that um during
32:57
the 90s
32:58
well in 1990 the prime minister of new
33:00
zealand appointed
33:01
someone the official wizard of new
33:03
zealand so they had an official wizard
33:05
and he's only retired a few years back
33:08
um and the reason he's relevant to this
33:10
is because he
33:11
quite famously in 1988 went and did a
33:14
rain dance for a small town that had a
33:16
drought called
33:16
winemate i had a drought for six months
33:19
and
33:20
uh he went there and he brought with him
33:22
four buckets of water a horn
33:23
an umbrella under which he had a little
33:25
red demon a large bass drum
33:27
his magic staff and a mug of beer and he
33:30
performed
33:31
a rain dance and it started torrential
33:33
raining within two hours
33:35
made international news um and this was
33:37
their official one i mean
33:38
he's definitely checked the weather yes
33:40
before deciding when to do this
33:42
yeah well no so six months and it was
33:44
part of a festival and the festival was
33:46
not going to be held but
33:47
actually it turned because of the
33:48
drought um they weren't going to have it
33:50
in this farm
33:50
but they thought it's an actually a nice
33:52
place for people to meet up let's have a
33:54
fun little rain dance thing going on
33:55
the wizard rocks up does his dance two
33:57
hours later rain
33:59
it's amazing yeah it's incredible
34:02
paintly skeptical
34:03
so for instance this week um the pope
34:06
tweeted
34:07
something about praying to the saints
34:10
but he
34:10
put hashtag saints and when you do that
34:12
on twitter sometimes it thinks you're
34:13
talking about the american football team
34:15
the same sorry
34:16
so it puts a little symbol of the
34:17
american football team so he tweeted
34:20
we should all pray for the saints with
34:22
the american football team and sure
34:23
enough this week they won
34:24
well there you go there you go it must
34:26
be related to this kiwi guy
34:28
the pope is the official wizard of lots
34:30
of people really isn't he yeah yes
34:32
good luck getting excommunicated for
34:34
calling him the official wizard
34:37
yeah because a lot of people are able to
34:38
do that i think in nigeria there's a
34:39
particular problem because people
34:41
charge for the services of being
34:42
rainmaker and the clever trick is you do
34:45
sort of check what the weather's going
34:46
to do and you are
34:47
sort of a bit loose so if it does rain
34:49
two hours later maybe three
34:51
maybe four maybe a couple of days you
34:52
can claim it can't you
34:54
yeah um but i was reading there was a
34:57
in the journal of iranian studies there
34:59
was actually a list of
35:01
stuff that individuals in iran can do in
35:03
different parts of iran to bring on rain
35:05
there are a few things you can do so
35:07
rain making
35:08
individual ceremonies include sticking
35:10
pieces of dough to the back of a sheep
35:13
uh if you've got those two things are
35:15
you talking about dough as in the thing
35:16
you make bread from
35:17
or a female because that is quite
35:20
disgusting
35:22
don't cut a deer into small pieces it's
35:24
the bread it's the bread stuff
35:26
leave the deer alone you can also steal
35:28
the tripod of a widow
35:30
i'd love a tripod yeah i think that
35:33
might be a cooking thing rather than a
35:34
photographic thing
35:35
okay i imagine or you can ride on a tree
35:38
branch as on a horse
35:41
and actually if that tree was a bit wet
35:43
and you jump up and down on a tree
35:44
branch
35:45
it does cause it to sort of rain under
35:47
that tree doesn't it a little
35:49
sure but then if your branches are wet
35:51
why are you doing it away
35:55
should we finish yeah i just got one
35:58
slightly interesting thing
35:59
um there's been a mystery which is to do
36:01
with sea snakes which is how they live
36:03
in this particular species are the
36:05
yellow bellied sea snakes
36:06
it's a reptile that lives in the open
36:08
sea so it needs fresh water but it's
36:11
living in salty sea how does it do it
36:12
and there's a new study that's been done
36:14
and it's still in sort of
36:15
trying to prove this theory entirely but
36:17
what they think is the way they get
36:19
fresh water is that when it's heavy
36:20
raining
36:21
there's a thin lens of the rainwater
36:23
that sits on top of the ocean
36:25
and that's where they go and rehydrate
36:27
themselves so they go to the surface
36:29
yeah and they drink from this little
36:31
sort of like having a top crazy lemonade
36:33
on your beer kind of thing
36:35
um it's like ordering a larger top but
36:38
you don't want any of the beer exactly
36:40
yeah that sounds like me and you're
36:42
inside the beer
36:43
do you think that a lager top you just
36:45
drink the lemonade at the top and then
36:47
the rest of it's just all beer then it's
36:48
just normal because what is it because
36:50
they put a tiny bit
36:51
yeah so you haven't heard of them you
36:52
have a full beer and yeah they don't
36:54
fully fill it up there's like a tiny
36:55
little centimeter at the top that they
36:57
fill
36:58
with lemonade right takes the edge off a
37:00
little bit takes the edge off
37:01
so famously beer is much denser than
37:03
lemonade and so the lemonade just sits
37:05
on top
37:06
how does it how does it sit there taste
37:08
wise the whole time answer me that you
37:09
can't
37:10
okay it is time for fact number three
37:14
wait we've done fact number three we
37:16
have done that we're afraid
37:18
i'm gonna get you out of this damn it
37:19
okay okay
37:23
okay it's time for our final fact of the
37:25
show and that is
37:26
james okay my fact this week is that
37:28
sainsbury's
37:29
sells triple cooked chips which you then
37:32
have to cook
37:34
it's not really a fact this is such a
37:36
stupid fact it's not really
37:38
it's great i was just um it's more
37:42
it's more of a sort of add or spawn than
37:44
a fact
37:47
it's more of the start of my stand-up
37:49
set
37:50
um so what it was was one of the other
37:53
elves we're doing the
37:54
r series of qi at the moment and one of
37:56
the other elves matt coward posted a
37:58
thing about refried beans
37:59
about how refried beans aren't fried
38:02
twice
38:03
and he said why would you fry anything
38:04
twice and i was like well you do fried
38:06
chips twice
38:07
um to cook them and then someone said
38:08
that heston blumenthal
38:10
triple cooks his chips and so i wanted
38:12
to see if anyone quadruple cooked their
38:15
chips
38:15
and my google just found this and this
38:19
fact
38:19
and so triple cup chips are a thing that
38:22
was invented by heston blumenthal in the
38:24
90s
38:25
and you can buy them so you put them in
38:27
the oven and they cook
38:28
so they're quadruple cup chips as far as
38:30
i can see there is no quintuple
38:32
chips i was astonished how you found
38:34
this fact because the link you sent us
38:36
to show that this fact was true was a
38:38
twitter question that someone called sam
38:40
put to sainsbury's
38:42
and this was back in 2016 i think it was
38:44
of 2017
38:46
it had one like and they replied to him
38:49
with
38:49
yes you have to then re-cook it and i
38:51
thought jesus james's research levels
38:53
are insane he's trying to read
38:54
everything on twitter just in case that
38:56
happens
38:57
yeah did you hear his method he typed
38:59
quadruple cooked chips into the internet
39:02
there aren't many results for that
39:03
i've given away all my tricks of
39:05
research
39:07
but no actually the sunday times said
39:09
that heston blumenthal inventing triple
39:11
cooked chips
39:12
was arguably his most influential
39:14
culinary invention
39:16
wow okay and it gave them a whole new
39:18
lease of life
39:19
um they say chips that is and the way
39:21
that he does it is he kind of cooks them
39:23
by simmering them in water
39:25
and then he gets rid of all the water
39:26
inside them i'm using a sous-vide
39:28
technique
39:29
i'm not sure exactly what that means
39:31
well i know what sous vide means but i
39:32
don't know what the technique is or he
39:33
does it by freezing them
39:35
and then he deep fries them and then he
39:37
calls them and then he deep fries them
39:38
again
39:39
at a really high temperature so they get
39:41
really crispy on the outside and really
39:42
fluffy in the middle
39:43
okay and then you shove them in the oven
39:46
forget about them
39:49
and then they're just like charcoal but
39:52
they're all right
39:52
as long as you have a lot of ketchup
39:53
with them so i didn't know how chips
39:57
why chips are nice basically until
39:58
researching the specs what do you mean
40:00
why are they nice so it's exactly
40:02
because of that so it is
40:03
when you deep fry chips what happens is
40:06
you've got obviously you
40:07
just potato chunks you know that's all
40:09
they are originally
40:11
but then thanks to the magic of cooking
40:14
so when they touch the oil all the
40:16
moisture on their surface immediately
40:18
vaporizes
40:19
and that immediately forms this dry hard
40:22
layer on the outside but the moisture
40:24
inside that layer is trapped
40:26
and that's when it steams the flesh of
40:28
the potato and that's what makes it
40:29
fluffy on the inside
40:31
and obviously it's crunchy on the
40:32
outside because of the sort of hard oil
40:34
layer but you need that shell to form
40:36
instantly
40:36
otherwise the moisture will seep out and
40:38
then you'll have you know basically a
40:40
dry all the way through stick
40:42
so that's a disaster and it's only
40:44
batter and potato starch
40:46
which can form that instant hard layer
40:48
when you're making when you're cooking
40:49
yeah so that's why
40:50
you don't need to batter chips and
40:52
that's why you do need to batter lots of
40:53
other stuff is because that's the thing
40:55
it forms that
40:56
sealed layer and makes it cook on the
40:58
inside as well as the outside mind you a
40:59
battered chip would be delicious
41:02
i actually saw someone tweeting about
41:03
battered chips this week
41:05
it was just completely not even part of
41:07
this research i just saw it and i just
41:09
thought that
41:10
is fit yeah yeah that does make me worry
41:13
about your twitter habits
41:15
actually you are going too deep that's
41:18
really interesting
41:19
yeah and on the heston thing the way
41:21
that he kind of
41:22
gets rid of the water by freeze-drying
41:24
them this is a technique that has been
41:26
done by peruvians for over a thousand
41:28
years
41:28
so they invented freeze drying for
41:31
potatoes
41:32
and because basically you live in peru
41:35
if you're a very high altitude or
41:37
you have like droughts quite often
41:39
because of el nino you're not always
41:40
going to have potatoes all the time
41:42
and so they had to find ways of keeping
41:44
them when they had problems
41:46
and the way they did it was take them
41:47
really really high up mountains
41:49
and they would freeze them and the water
41:50
would come out of them and it meant that
41:51
they wouldn't rot
41:52
so quickly yeah that's very interesting
41:54
and it really is amazing because it's
41:55
like almost a millennium before we
41:57
invented the technology
41:58
but the next thing they did once they
42:00
they've frozen them
42:02
um and they've lost a lot of their
42:03
moisture and then they trample them
42:05
underfoot
42:06
and so sometimes they still do this and
42:08
it's really really successful so
42:10
you lay them out lay all of your chips
42:12
on the ground or your potatoes on the
42:13
ground they didn't have chips
42:14
potatoes on the ground and then as a
42:16
family you trample them or as a little
42:17
village you trample them all down and
42:19
you squeeze
42:19
all of the moisture out and once you've
42:21
trampled them all that moisture is so
42:22
squeezed out and they'll last for years
42:24
so as james says
42:25
you know you lose a few potato crops
42:27
you're fine you also don't want to eat
42:28
them because
42:29
your horrible uncle has just walked all
42:31
over them with big sweaty feet
42:32
yeah you only have them in times of real
42:34
real yeah but that's actually how cheesy
42:36
chips are invented
42:38
i wonder then if they have so obviously
42:40
they have farms on the ground level
42:42
but would you then have farm plot as it
42:45
were up on the mountain
42:46
in peru yeah yeah you would actually you
42:48
would have people living at different
42:50
altitudes
42:51
okay and they would um they would come
42:54
up with different varieties of potato
42:56
that would grow in all these different
42:57
altitudes and that's why in peru i think
42:58
they have something like 200 different
43:00
types of potato in the country they have
43:02
more
43:02
types of potatoes than anywhere else and
43:05
they invented the
43:06
husbandry of it not husbandry they're
43:08
growing of it they invented
43:10
how to grow potatoes really yeah yeah
43:11
and it's because when you were in peru
43:13
you would pay your tax
43:14
in potatoes or a few other things but
43:16
there will be crops
43:18
and so you needed a way that everyone
43:19
will be able to grow potatoes because
43:21
everyone needs to be able to pay their
43:22
tax
43:23
and so the government would almost come
43:25
up with ways
43:26
of the people in high altitude growing
43:28
potatoes so that they'd be able to
43:29
collect tax from them
43:31
oh really but then the government just
43:33
has loads of
43:34
potatoes and of course the government
43:38
then gives the potatoes out to people
43:40
and you know people who can't grow
43:41
potatoes get potatoes and they give them
43:43
goods and services and got it it's a
43:45
currency it's a potato currency
43:47
it's amazing how many potatoes there are
43:49
as you say and they're still finding
43:51
them like james and i once met a potato
43:53
hunter um
43:54
who's discovered new species that she
43:55
was on museum of curiosity she works at
43:57
the natural history museum
43:58
um yeah still finding new tomato and
44:01
potato species all over the world yeah
44:03
cool why do we get stuck with the same
44:05
old marist piper or
44:07
tesco value new potatoes well one reason
44:10
is because
44:11
the potatoes are trademarked by
44:13
companies
44:14
so um pepsico is filing has been filing
44:18
lawsuits against farmers in india who
44:20
have been growing
44:20
their special types of potato that they
44:22
use for lay potato crisps
44:24
very controversial i know but i guess if
44:27
you've put a load of research and
44:28
development into
44:29
you know genetically making a better
44:31
potato you know how pro-capitalism you
44:33
are
44:35
hey i read the economist for a reason
44:39
no it is i mean it's a real proper
44:41
argument isn't it like
44:42
we wouldn't have those amazing potatoes
44:44
that they can that can grow and feed so
44:46
many people
44:47
if they didn't know they were going to
44:48
get money back for them yeah shouldn't
44:50
there be a thing where um
44:51
like you have with patients with
44:52
medicine where you can have it for 10
44:54
years and then it's released to the
44:55
world
44:56
as yeah that would be a good idea it's a
44:58
thought unleash the potatoes
45:01
speaking of big capitalist um pmos
45:04
mcdonald's oh yeah it's fries in america
45:08
not vegetarian
45:09
really yeah so chips used to be often
45:12
cooked in beef tallow
45:15
delicious really good ones i guess
45:17
probably often are
45:18
and so mcdonald's fries used to be
45:20
cooked in beef tallow and then there was
45:21
this huge crusade which i think we've
45:23
mentioned before in the
45:24
1980s which was anti-anti-sap fat
45:28
so it was saying beef tallow's really
45:29
bad for you because of the saturated
45:30
fats so mcdonald's started cooking them
45:32
in vegetable oil and they realized they
45:34
tasted
45:35
way worse and so now what they do is
45:37
they coat it in beef flavoring
45:39
before it gets sent off to the
45:40
mcdonald's to be cooked
45:42
yeah and in america in america and it
45:45
was hard to confirm where else
45:47
definitely not in india because
45:48
mcdonald's doesn't really sell meat in
45:49
india
45:50
obviously in the uk on the mcdonald's
45:52
site it does say that their chips are
45:54
vegetarian right okay but in america
45:55
definitely
45:56
you're coated in beef powder but just
45:58
another quick tip of something yummy to
46:00
eat
46:00
um when we're talking about battered
46:02
chips before oh yeah i've had battered
46:04
halloumi chips
46:05
oh yeah oh best thing i've had in here
46:07
is just a little tip there yeah
46:08
they are they are good they're
46:10
relatively common yeah
46:13
really it's pretty standard uh hipster
46:16
lunch
46:16
two north london elitists over here um
46:22
in 2018 last year british chips got
46:25
shorter
46:26
by three centimeters what what i know
46:28
there was a chip
46:29
there was a terrible potato crop and
46:31
they're usually
46:32
potatoes are usually the size of a small
46:34
brick was in the article i read if you
46:36
can imagine such a thing
46:37
um but obviously if they if the bricks
46:40
get smaller
46:41
the chips get smaller and the potatoes
46:43
that harvested were smaller last year
46:45
because of this terrible potato crop
46:47
and they inter the telegraph interviewed
46:49
um cedric porter
46:50
who was the editor of world potato
46:52
markets magazine
46:53
yeah and he said this was the hottest
46:55
british summer since 1976
46:57
which any potato person will tell you
46:59
was an almost mythical year
47:01
[Laughter]
47:03
he said it is still talked about in
47:05
potato circles
47:07
it is what we should have done is sent
47:10
our chips to space
47:13
right yes make them taller yeah
47:16
that's a great idea perfect and actually
47:19
did you read this about how to make
47:20
chips in space
47:22
no um so the european space agency used
47:25
its centrifuge
47:26
and especially made deep fat fryer and
47:29
they made fries
47:30
wow and they found that the sweet spot
47:32
for the best
47:33
chips was about three times the earth's
47:36
gravity
47:37
which is about the same as you would
47:38
find on jupiter
47:40
and if you cook chips there you get the
47:42
absolute perfect crispiness
47:44
and fluffiness but if you go anywhere
47:47
over three times
47:48
the earth's gravity the fry begins to
47:50
lose its structural integrity
47:52
wow i can already see heston looking up
47:55
the next space flight to jupiter it is
47:58
amazing because i read that too
48:00
and they they built a rotating
48:02
industrial fryer to simulate
48:04
up to 9g but they did
48:07
they did feed the students normal chips
48:10
and then
48:10
3g chips and they found that student
48:13
volunteers were unable to tell the
48:15
difference between
48:16
normal sorry 3g chips only they just
48:17
have a very good internet
48:20
can i just say this is going way back
48:22
but you know you were talking about andy
48:24
chips
48:24
shrinking in size yeah did you see who
48:26
wrote that article i think there was a
48:27
telegraph wasn't it
48:28
i didn't see who wrote the article well
48:29
it was a guy called james crisp
48:32
oh wow just thought worth mentioning and
48:34
then in the research for this the next
48:36
thing i researched was about the first
48:37
crisp recipe and this was actually in
48:40
the early 19th century
48:41
um and it was in a book called the
48:43
cook's oracle and it basically told
48:45
readers to like peel potatoes cut them
48:47
into shavings round and round
48:49
and then dry them with a cloth and fry
48:51
them in lard or dripping so
48:52
first chip and that was by dr william
48:55
kitchener
48:57
big day of nominative determinism
49:00
i found out about a man called eric rim
49:04
what was he responsible yeah i don't
49:05
want to know what he was doing where was
49:07
he putting ships
49:08
[Laughter]
49:10
he is a very distinguished nutritionist
49:12
but
49:13
he um i think so the u.s agriculture
49:16
department lists a serving of french
49:18
fries as 12 to 15
49:20
fries which is very small obviously um
49:23
and he prompted this huge controversy
49:25
online because he was responding to this
49:27
and he was just saying yeah portions are
49:29
massively bigger than they were in the
49:30
50s
49:31
and he said i think it would be nice if
49:32
your meal came with a side salad and six
49:34
french fries
49:36
six well a lot of people said i i don't
49:38
want six french fries i want more which
49:40
is fair
49:40
that's not even a handful it's not even
49:42
a no depending on your hands but no
49:45
i mean i have normal human size
49:48
he also advised so he'd prompted that
49:50
controversy which is one you know
49:52
grenade into the conversation he also
49:54
said
49:55
diners should ask how often a restaurant
49:57
changes its oil
49:58
because if you repeatedly heat and then
50:00
cool and then re-heat the oil that can
50:02
create very unhealthy
50:03
fatty acids in it so next time you go to
50:06
mcdonald's
50:10
i'll do i'll ask excuse me how long ago
50:13
did you last change the oil
50:14
[Laughter]
50:18
you can in mcdonald's confirmed by
50:20
mcdonald staff ask
50:22
always for fresh chips by the way
50:23
because apparently there was some rumor
50:25
that the only way to get
50:26
like you know when they've got loads of
50:26
chips lined up and just give them out
50:28
sometimes they're a bit cold
50:30
um and there was a rumor that you had to
50:32
ask for unsalted chips and that was the
50:34
only way to induce them to make a fresh
50:35
batch because they all had salt
50:37
apparently you can just go and say i'd
50:39
like some freshly cooked chips and they
50:40
will
50:40
just do you say i'd like you to change
50:42
the oil
50:47
you can try ketchup
50:50
is banned in french schools on any
50:52
foodstuff apart from chips
50:55
no it's more of a guideline than a pan
50:57
but it's basically
50:58
if you're a french school person a
51:00
school child
51:03
then um you basically can't have cash
51:04
because i know anna you will have
51:05
ketchup on literally anything yeah
51:07
you've got to have a catchment
51:08
but only on french fights they're
51:10
allowed it well
51:11
sorry france no more holidays to you and
51:14
it's to protect
51:15
traditional gaelic cuisine very french
51:19
it is yeah just to clarify i don't
51:21
holiday in french prep schools
51:26
but do you know why ketchup is so
51:28
delicious um i assume because of the
51:29
large number of unhealthy ingredients
51:33
it can deliver sweet sour salty bitter
51:36
and umami so all the tastes all at once
51:40
wow basically lots of sugar lots of sour
51:42
stuff
51:44
nice so you would have thought that
51:45
might be too much but it's you know if
51:47
you know if you put
51:48
five different foods in your mouth all
51:50
at once sometimes they don't go together
51:52
yeah but that it just works and ketchup
51:54
just works that's great
51:55
you need to stop shoving all that food
51:57
in your mouth at the same time
52:00
i had just a very just to me this was
52:02
very interesting it's to do with
52:03
sainsbury's uh which is fact
52:05
started off as can i just say i'm sure
52:08
other supermarkets sell this kind of
52:09
stuff as well
52:10
oh i just happened to see it in
52:12
sainsbury's supermarkets am i right
52:16
but no just quite cool sainsbury's was
52:17
founded uh less than a 10-minute walk
52:19
from where we are right now
52:20
recording this podcast uh drury lane
52:24
yeah that's where the very first shop
52:25
was uh by john james sainsbury um
52:28
it was in 1869 so it's the 150th year
52:30
this year and by the time
52:32
he died in 1928 128 shops
52:35
were opened around the uk and he was a
52:38
total
52:38
obsessive with his work and his last
52:40
words were said to be
52:42
keep the shops well lit he was thinking
52:44
about it right till the last second
52:46
wow yeah his last words were do you have
52:49
a sainsbury's card
52:50

[Applause]
01:12
hello and welcome to an extra special
01:14
edition of no such thing as a fish this
01:17
time we are celebrating the release of
01:18
our new book the book of the year 2019
01:21
the world's weirdest news my name is dan
01:24
schreiber i am sitting here with andrew
01:25
hunter murray anna jaczynski and james
01:27
harkin
01:28
and once again we have gathered round
01:29
the table with our four favorite facts
01:31
from our new book which is out now
01:33
and in no particular order here we go
01:36
starting with you
01:37
james okay my fact from the book of the
01:39
year 2019 the world's weirdest news
01:42
is that greta thundberg's middle name
01:46
is tintin amazing so good isn't that
01:48
great now
01:49
you can argue this isn't technically
01:51
true because
01:54
glad we opened on this one immediately
01:56
well she has five
01:57
names in total and tintin is the second
01:59
one i call it middle name oh
02:01
so she is called greta tintin
02:04
eleanora ehrman thunberg
02:09
that's an incredibly um that's an
02:11
incredibly professional way
02:13
of you to caveat that fact james because
02:15
any other person would have just said
02:16
her middle name is tintin that's fine
02:17
but you said well technically there's
02:18
one
02:19
outside her middle name but it's not a
02:20
first or a surname yeah we kept editing
02:22
that sentence out of the actual book
02:24
though in the end
02:25
i reckon that any name which is not your
02:27
first name or your surname is
02:28
technically a middle name definitely
02:30
yeah absolutely
02:31
agree like if you're in a family of ten
02:33
people and you're the ninth child you
02:35
say you're one of the middle siblings
02:36
don't you
02:36
yeah sure you i think you only get to
02:38
single yourself out for the first name
02:40
all the surnames i would say i was the
02:41
penultimate child
02:45
yeah you do don't you and you're an only
02:46
child which is bizarre
02:49
she's not the only person with a fun uh
02:51
middle name to appear in our book
02:53
okay uh just very quickly uh lucy bronze
02:55
the
02:56
footballer for the england football team
02:59
um
02:59
her middle name is tough yeah very cool
03:02
that's a great
03:03
tough bronze that's good yeah but why is
03:05
greta thunder's middle name
03:06
tintin do we know i don't know actually
03:09
i can only assume her parents were fans
03:11
yeah or she has a white dog she could
03:14
although she wouldn't have had it when
03:15
she was born
03:16
no you're right i have no other tinted
03:18
references so i can't think of any other
03:19
reason she's a sort of
03:20
young adventurer going around the world
03:22
having adventures that's true it's true
03:24
she wasn't when she was born no again no
03:26
you're right
03:26
[Laughter]
03:29
she is still very young to be
03:30
adventuring though isn't she i'm always
03:31
surprised that she's
03:33
16 still i think she's amazing and
03:36
she's currently so she took this trip to
03:38
the us
03:39
and then going on to chile to attend
03:41
these conferences
03:42
and she's still as we speak traveling
03:44
down through the us on her way to chile
03:46
and
03:46
i don't know who she's with does she
03:48
have any parental you know
03:50
guidance i think is it not true that if
03:52
you're traveling under the age of 18
03:54
your parents can drop you off and then
03:56
someone can pick you up at the airport
03:58
and
03:58
actually you're fine i think that's
04:00
probably what she's doing yes
04:02
should we just quickly say she is doing
04:04
that by the way
04:05
she definitely would never go by
04:07
airplane anywhere no no absolutely we
04:09
should i was just going to say we should
04:10
say there might be a few people out
04:12
there who genuinely don't know who greta
04:14
thundberg is
04:15
you know she's one of the biggest names
04:16
of the year but the way we've been
04:17
talking about it sounds like she's an
04:18
adventurer
04:19
um so she's the environmentalist
04:21
campaigner who has been
04:23
causing huge storms uh of the good kind
04:26
into climate change which is causing the
04:28
huge stars
04:28
[Music]
04:30
she's trying to fight storms wherever
04:31
she goes she so she started off
04:34
um sitting outside was it her swedish
04:36
parliament
04:37
building yeah yeah and she she was
04:40
skipping school to do that and that
04:41
turned into the huge
04:42
school strike movement but her initial
04:44
leaflets that she handed out said
04:46
i'm doing this because you adults are
04:47
on my future
04:49
which is a great phrase it is terrible
04:51
misbehavior so she skived school and
04:54
then used foul language to abuse
04:56
strangers okay you have to stop reading
04:58
the telegraph
05:01
no she is great and she led what were
05:02
the biggest climate protests in
05:04
all history so i think in the space of
05:06
one month she led two which were
05:08
attended by four million people which
05:10
is extraordinary amazing do you think
05:12
they'll look
05:13
back like we look back now at joan of
05:15
arc who was what
05:16
14 years old or something and can't
05:18
believe that she managed to
05:19
have the whole of the french army behind
05:21
her but now there's this 16 year old
05:23
who's got
05:24
4 million more than that let's be honest
05:26
people behind her it's just insane but
05:28
greta thunderberg isn't using those
05:29
people to throw the english out of
05:31
france
05:31
we should say that there's been a lot of
05:34
stuff thrown around about her
05:36
there is one conspiracy this is a very
05:37
mad conspiracy theory about her that
05:39
says she's actually an australian
05:40
actress called estela renee
05:42
who was working for the deep state and
05:44
it's not clear why the deep state would
05:46
that would be amazing
05:48
if you looked back at old episodes of
05:50
neighbors and she just pops up
05:53
do you know the foundation for this
05:55
rumor no cool
05:57
incredibly weird people on the internet
05:59
yeah i mean
06:00
it's it's really really loco because we
06:02
know who her parents are we know where
06:04
she was born we the
06:05
records of her all the way through yeah
06:06
look i wasn't suggesting it might be
06:08
true
06:08
i just wondered if there was any logic
06:09
to it like maybe someone thought she had
06:10
a tan that maybe she got from australia
06:13
i believe you andy don't worry well
06:16
there is another one which is
06:18
it's slightly less mad but it's still
06:19
completely mad if you know what i mean
06:20
which is that
06:21
she's got an imdb page and she's listed
06:24
as an actress
06:25
because she once did a voiceover so
06:26
that's some people that's the evidence
06:28
for some people saying that she's
06:29
therefore not real
06:30
okay well her mom was uh in the arts
06:32
wasn't she she was a performer of some
06:34
sort yeah opera singer
06:35
yeah so okay that makes sense you might
06:37
have your child appear in something
06:39
at a young age without their consent i
06:40
think it's a climate thing that she did
06:42
a voiceover for
06:42
actually no it's like i mean donald
06:44
trump is listed as an actor on imdb so
06:47
being on imdb does not mean that you're
06:48
not a person well he is no he is though
06:50
he was in home alone too
06:52
yeah classic scene yeah he's an actor
06:55
he's an actor he was brilliant in that
06:57
and i thought
06:58
no i haven't seen it yeah her mother is
07:01
quite interesting her mother's a woman
07:02
called
07:02
melana earman and she was a famous opera
07:05
singer really famous opera singer
07:07
in sweden and she gave it up because of
07:09
greta so greta convinced her to
07:11
cancel her entire career because all the
07:13
international travel was so bad for the
07:14
environment oh the travel i was thinking
07:17
like because you do so much singing and
07:18
you're kind of breathing a lot
07:20
all the carbon dioxide that comes out
07:22
that's what i was thinking but yeah
07:24
i read this is a bit of a it must be
07:26
very hard trying to get everything right
07:27
when you're trying to
07:29
do your best to stop a carbon footprint
07:31
so her going across to america in a boat
07:34
um i read that unfortunately in order to
07:36
get the boat back they had to fly out
07:38
two of the boat pilots
07:40
to america in order to bring it back
07:42
they could have just sent them off in
07:43
another boat
07:44
exactly well why weren't they in the
07:45
boat what's going
07:47
on where were they they did but they did
07:49
they said in response to that that their
07:51
whole flight was carbon neutral so they
07:53
um
07:53
you know what's it called when you they
07:54
offset the carbon of that it's tricky
07:56
though because offsetting is
07:57
a thing which some people say doesn't
07:59
really work you can't really suck up
08:01
carbon in the same way though i think
08:02
the argument mostly
08:03
is that by doing it people think that
08:05
it's okay to fly
08:06
right and so if you think oh i'm gonna
08:09
offset it then you might be more
08:10
inclined to do more short haul flying
08:12
yeah the protests the environmental
08:15
protests have been pretty interesting
08:16
um there was a really good fact that one
08:18
of you guys found i think which is that
08:20
the levels of pollution on oxford street
08:21
fell by 45
08:23
due to the extinction rebellion protest
08:25
because they stopped all the cars going
08:27
there
08:27
which is really cool very cool um that's
08:30
like immediate action
08:31
and also i found this um this protest in
08:34
australia which is pretty cool it was on
08:36
manly beach
08:37
near sydney and 150 protesters buried
08:40
their heads in the sand
08:42
yeah that's a great protesters are
08:45
amazing though they look great
08:46
they look like they're praying you know
08:48
they're right on their knees with their
08:49
heads down and stuff like that
08:52
did they have guards to stop people just
08:54
running around kicking them all at the
08:56
ass one after the other
08:58
i didn't see it because i support the
09:01
protest so i just want to make it clear
09:02
but
09:03
we we didn't assume you didn't we did
09:06
when he implied that he was going to
09:07
ride along the beach of protesters
09:08
kicking them all in the ass
09:09
i think the implication was you support
09:11
the protest but if you see a big row of
09:12
arses in the air you have to you got it
09:14
yeah that's where i went you could play
09:16
them like bongos you could play them
09:18
like bongos
09:19
it's not quite as violent but it's still
09:21
funny
09:23
um one of the first things extinction
09:25
rebellion did was to occupy the offices
09:27
of guess where uh so was it in sweden
09:31
uh no i think it was here actually
09:33
london okay the offices
09:34
of shell it was greenpeace was it yeah
09:38
they sort of um they handed out flowers
09:40
but they also gave out leaflets saying
09:42
we're going to be much more assertive
09:43
about this than you guys have been
09:45
wow greenpeace do their share of you
09:47
know protests and things
09:49
yeah yeah but extinction rebellion were
09:50
just you know marking their territory
09:52
god i think of greenpeace is quite
09:54
assertive as well
09:56
they also had this thing in july where
09:58
hundreds of environmental
09:59
climate demonstrators picketed the
10:01
headquarters of drax and that's drax is
10:03
a big energy and gas giant and they were
10:05
picketing them
10:06
over a new gas-powered plant that they
10:07
were planning in yorkshire i think
10:10
anyway they hadn't done the research
10:12
drax moved out of that building over a
10:14
year ago
10:15
and they instead chained themselves to
10:16
this block in moorgate which is now
10:18
occupied by europe's leading renewables
10:20
generator
10:22
i can't win them all i love the headline
10:25
that we actually have for the extinction
10:27
rebellion article in our book
10:29
is a woman glued her breasts to the road
10:30
to protest against climate change
10:32
and this was just the most wonderful the
10:34
glue was just fantastic they were gluing
10:36
their bums to the windows and the
10:38
yeah westminster they were gluing
10:40
themselves on streets they were on
10:42
a guy did it on top of a plane the other
10:44
day did you see that what glued himself
10:46
on top of a plane
10:47
part of this new extinction rebellion um
10:49
sort of revival
10:50
um he was getting on a plane from the
10:52
steps on the outside and he climbed on
10:54
top and he glued himself to the top
10:56
and um so yeah disrupted this flight
10:58
that is amazing i know i do there's a
11:00
bit of me that wish that they just
11:01
pranked him just closed the door and
11:03
started
11:06
andy really behind the plane trying to
11:07
kick him in the ass
11:09
she'll say i do support the whole thank
11:11
you there were the people who glued
11:13
themselves to corbyn's house weren't
11:15
there
11:16
it was i think it was four protesters
11:17
grew themselves outside jeremy corbyn's
11:19
home but you know a lot of these people
11:20
are very nice people the climate
11:21
protesters so they admitted they felt
11:23
absolutely terrible about upsetting his
11:25
wife who was indoors
11:26
at the time and they had flowers and
11:28
easter eggs delivered to the house to
11:29
apologize for the inconvenience
11:31
i think sort of while they were still
11:33
glued i think maybe one of them with
11:34
their toes
11:35
dialed the flower delivery service or
11:37
something
11:38
um one protester was arrested while
11:40
dressed as some broccoli
11:44
he looks very very good because they've
11:45
been very creative with the costumes and
11:47
everything and as he was arrested he was
11:48
heard to be shouting either
11:50
give peace a chance or give peas a
11:53
chance
11:54
not clear which he was shouting right
11:56
why was he a broccoli then
11:58
because broccoli is good for you you
11:59
should eat less meat you know this kind
12:00
of stuff
12:01
yeah it's green but dress as a pea if
12:04
that's
12:04
going to be your line what about
12:07
broccoli leave fossil fuels in the
12:09
ground very nice
12:10
he could have done with you but i do
12:12
support what he did
12:12
[Laughter]
12:15
uh just can i just say my favorite group
12:17
of people who are protesting
12:18
climate change is drug users and drug
12:21
dealers with them
12:22
so this was the news issue this is in
12:25
our book that cocaine is now being sold
12:27
in environmentally friendly pods
12:29
this was a interview that was done i
12:31
think in the birmingham mail the
12:32
birmingham post
12:33
and they interviewed a drug user who
12:35
said that he thought this dealer was
12:36
joking when he gave him a reusable
12:38
container with his cocaine in it he was
12:39
like what on earth is that mate
12:41
and the dealer said basically we're not
12:42
using the plastic ziplock bags anymore
12:45
we are using these reusable ones and if
12:46
you want a refill of cocaine you're
12:48
going to have to bring back your
12:49
reusable
12:50
container you know what i'm going to
12:51
take it up again
12:54
that was always a deal breaker for me
12:55
and finally
12:57
they could have just introduced a 5p
12:59
charge for a small
13:01
plastic container of drugs
13:08
[Music]
13:11
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:13
that is andy
13:15
my fact is that you can now be pulled
13:16
over for drink driving by your own car
13:19
where did you read this fact andy did
13:22
you read it in a book
13:23
oh yeah sorry i read it in the book no i
13:25
wrote it in the book of the year
13:27
it's the world's weirdest news you've
13:29
read it since though right of course
13:30
it's my bedside reading
13:32
but sorry just check i just wanted this
13:34
citation in there what an aggressive and
13:36
unhelpful
13:38
sorry i'm so sorry i read it on a
13:41
newspaper website probably and then i
13:43
wrote it down in the book that we've
13:44
all just written between us sorry what's
13:46
that book it's called the book of the
13:47
year 2019 the world's weirdest news
13:49
right title when's it out i don't know
13:52
now andy now
13:54
it's out now you missed the point of
13:56
this podcast
13:58
we're just trying to get you to say the
14:00
name of the book got it it's out now
14:03
okay so anyway as you are volvo
14:06
have uh volvo have developed this car or
14:09
they have announced they are developing
14:10
a car
14:11
which can tell you off for drink driving
14:13
if it detects that you're drunk
14:15
i'm sorry it just tells you off it
14:16
doesn't make you stop or anything it
14:18
just says you
14:18
naughty boy i think it actually can pull
14:21
over to the side of the road
14:23
it's still in development so this is not
14:24
a standard in new volvos that you buy
14:27
but i think it detects from the way
14:28
you're driving if you're driving
14:30
very very very drunkenly if what if
14:33
for instance not saying i'm like this
14:35
but what if you're just a very bad
14:36
driver
14:38
you'll never drive again i'm afraid even
14:40
if i'm sober i'm afraid not no
14:42
um actually a bit better after a few
14:44
drinks
14:46
can i just say that it's not true you
14:48
don't support the drink drivers
14:51
uh that's very clever so there's a car
14:52
that detects if you've driven through
14:53
your own kitchen window or something
14:56
yeah
14:58
it also had some other interesting
15:00
technology that it announced this year
15:02
didn't it and that was that its cars
15:04
will warn each other
15:05
if you're driving on icy roads so cool
15:08
so cool
15:08
so i believe this is certain development
15:10
but yeah it'll be automatic detection if
15:12
you're on an icy road and your car
15:13
detects sort of a lack of friction
15:15
it will tell all the other volvos nearby
15:17
so the people driving them will get
15:18
warnings
15:19
and if you don't drive a volvo then i
15:21
guess you're buggered that's very cool
15:23
well we're doing an advert for volvo
15:26
the great thing about volvo i always
15:28
thought was the fact
15:30
that they invented the seat belt right
15:32
the modern seat belt that we have which
15:33
is kind of a 3.1 it kind of comes across
15:36
your chest
15:36
and your waist right they invented it
15:38
and they never uh patented it so it
15:41
meant that everyone could use it for
15:42
free because they realized that it was
15:43
so good for safety
15:45
um that it would be better to be in
15:46
every car and they didn't want the money
15:47
for it
15:48
um but one thing that they are working
15:50
on at the moment is a self-driving car
15:52
seatbelt
15:54
okay because when you're in your
15:55
self-driving car you're probably not
15:57
going to want to sit there
15:58
at the front looking out at the
15:59
windscreen you might want to be having a
16:01
lie down or you might want to be
16:03
kind of playing you know video games or
16:05
something like that yeah
16:07
and so they have come up with a seat
16:09
belt blanket
16:11
okay so you kind of lie down or kind of
16:14
like lounge a little bit and then the
16:16
strap goes across your whole body about
16:18
cross your legs across your chest and
16:20
everything like that but it's not real
16:21
it's not like you're being strapped down
16:23
because you're in a
16:24
you know hospital or something like that
16:26
because you're making it sound like
16:26
you're sort of mummified into the car
16:28
it's not quite like it's supposed to not
16:30
feel restrictive but it does kind of
16:31
cocoon you
16:32
that's brilliant that's a new thing that
16:34
they're working on wow very cool yeah
16:36
i when you set a self-driving seat belt
16:39
i thought it was if you'd driven off
16:40
without your seatbelt your seatbelt at
16:42
home would remember and it would drive
16:44
up
16:44
to the car and catch up with you and
16:46
then get into the car
16:49
i've got another car development thing
16:50
here it's not volvo oh well i'm not
16:52
interested then i stupidly took a
16:54
sponsorship from ford
16:55
um which are fantastic cars and um
16:58
but this year and this is in our robots
17:00
article um ford have developed a robotic
17:03
bottom which they test on their car
17:06
seats um
17:07
so this is the idea of testing for wear
17:09
and tear in your car they've had that
17:10
for a while haven't they
17:11
yes they have but what they've added to
17:13
it this year this is the 2019 edition
17:16
it now has sweat glands so it can mimic
17:18
the behavior of someone with a very
17:20
uh sweaty bottom uh you know you're
17:22
driving on a hot day
17:24
yeah and you've taken your trousers off
17:25
to drive as i always do
17:27
see but your self-driving trousers are
17:29
on the way
17:30
they'll get there eventually that's i
17:32
think that's the real shame because
17:33
you're putting a lot of
17:34
real life human bottom testers out of
17:37
work aren't you that's very true
17:39
it's a thing that's dealing with a real
17:42
issue why don't they just find people
17:43
with sweaty bottoms
17:44
that's what i'm saying oh gotcha i
17:46
remember when i was at school and they
17:47
were telling me what kind of job i might
17:49
have in the future
17:50
and they did check how sweaty my bottom
17:51
was and they they did think i would be
17:54
able to do this as a job i think that
17:55
guy's been reporting
17:56
authorities actually um just because
17:58
this is about sort of new
18:00
robotics technology new robotics one of
18:03
my favorite stories in the book
18:05
was the extreme advance in shoes
18:08
which is that nike has invented
18:09
self-lacing trainers yes
18:12
so this these trainers are 300 uh they
18:16
fit your foot shape automatically so you
18:18
try them on there for any foot shape
18:19
they're self-lacing so they don't
18:20
actually have laces because the robots
18:22
don't need laces they just tighten and
18:24
loosen automatically
18:25
and the idea is that it would be good in
18:27
something like basketball where
18:29
sometimes you need some looseness for
18:31
flexibility to increase blood flow
18:32
then sometimes you need to tighten up
18:34
when you need more you know more
18:36
um grip and the problem is it's a total
18:39
failure
18:39
uh on android phones so and
18:43
people tried it on androids and it often
18:45
broke after a few days
18:47
there were complaints that it only
18:48
worked on the right shoe
18:50
so for some reason the left shoes just
18:52
constantly weren't responding
18:54
and often the app would also say it's
18:56
already connected to another pair of
18:57
trainers
18:59
so can you just make people fall over as
19:01
they're walking by you
19:03
because you connect your app to their
19:04
shoes that's like the modern equivalent
19:07
of tying someone's shoelaces together
19:08
yes um speaking of as we were
19:12
self-driving things um there is a
19:15
self-driving wheelie bin that has been
19:17
developed this year
19:18
it's called smart can uh and the smart
19:21
can creator who is called andrew murray
19:24
no yes wow he said we want to help
19:27
people
19:28
eliminate unnecessary chores from their
19:30
daily lives and what happens is
19:31
basically when it's bin day
19:33
the bins take themselves out isn't that
19:36
great
19:37
that's really amazing so it's not a
19:39
thing where if you can't afford a
19:40
self-driving car but you can't afford a
19:42
sort of driving bin
19:43
just get into the bed and go to work not
19:46
like
19:47
drill a pair of eye holes in it my other
19:50
car is a smart cap
19:54
there's other car technology um so
19:57
um there's a great company ford who have
19:59
designed
20:00
give it a rest mate the car in front is
20:02
a toyota
20:04
uh they've developed something not for
20:06
cars but for the bedroom and this is in
20:08
our book it's a mattress that nudges you
20:10
away from your partner if you start
20:12
getting too near to them
20:13
in bed um yeah
20:16
it's a mattress like a chaperone
20:17
mattress it's exactly if you've got
20:20
your mother-in-law mattress yeah you
20:22
keep your hands off her
20:24
god i hope your mother-in-law's not
20:25
gonna be saying that to you cause she's
20:27
coming to your bedroom
20:28
every evening you keep her in the
20:30
cupboard don't you
20:34
yeah you guys saw that relationship out
20:35
but back to the fact um
20:37
so it's a mattress and the idea is the
20:39
wet the reason that ford had been
20:41
able to make is they've been using the
20:43
lane keeping technology that they have
20:45
in their cars which is it nudges the car
20:48
away from a lane by taking the steering
20:51
wheel and moving it
20:52
and they've applied it to the bed and uh
20:54
it's only a prototype stage at this
20:55
point
20:56
but yeah as i mean i'm not familiar with
20:58
whenever i'm driving a car and slightly
21:00
go off course then my car gets tipped
21:02
off the road
21:03
but do they do that oh right
21:06
do they have to do this like
21:07
self-driving self-driving cars in the
21:09
future will have
21:10
um things that keep you in the lane got
21:12
it so this isn't technology that they
21:14
have in
21:14
existing ford cars because that's one of
21:16
the two two main struggles when driving
21:18
i found what is the left and right of
21:20
the lane staying on the road
21:22
staying the main one yeah it's the main
21:23
one and then you've got the forward and
21:25
backwards one of how close you are to
21:26
the car in front and you've got the left
21:27
right right one of
21:28
you know very much a two-dimensional
21:30
exactly right isn't it
21:31
you're not going up and down and takes
21:33
care of yourself
21:34
it doesn't help that your
21:35
mother-in-law's in the background andy
21:37
for christ's sake
21:39
um i just have one more bot of the year
21:41
that i quite liked that's trying to help
21:42
humans out in the future this is
21:44
irony man based on iron man
21:47
name wise but in nothing else this is a
21:49
sarcastic robot
21:50
and it has a useful purpose which is
21:53
that apparently people trust
21:54
robots more when and they seem more
21:56
natural and trustworthy when they're
21:57
being a bit sarcastic because humans are
21:59
sarcastic or ironic
22:00
and so when robots are just giving you
22:02
direct answers all the time
22:04
people don't trust them so they've
22:06
invented irony man
22:07
and it does things like it uh we'll pair
22:10
a really deadpan expression with
22:12
uh humorous facial expression uh a
22:14
deadpan
22:15
words with humorous facial expressions
22:16
or it will add sarcastic emphasis
22:19
so it will say something like i'm
22:20
delighted you spilled your pint of beer
22:22
on me
22:24
and then you know in the face with
22:27
exactly violent irony um
22:30
it has a slight problem so it's sort of
22:32
to help vulnerable people or older
22:34
people
22:35
who you know people get robots to care
22:37
for them around the house
22:38
but it can't tell when's the appropriate
22:39
time to deploy irony so in really
22:41
sensitive situations
22:43
it is currently saying things like which
22:45
you might get with all the people
22:46
indeed oh good you've fallen over
22:50
that sort of thing just while we're on
22:52
robots we've got a fact in the book
22:53
about
22:54
the robot hotel in japan where they
22:56
fired all of their robot staff
22:57
and replaced them with humans and james
22:59
you just went there i did i stayed there
23:01
deliberately
23:02
as people would know from our last
23:04
podcast when i deliberately went to this
23:06
town in the netherlands just because i
23:08
read about it i deliberately booked into
23:10
this hotel
23:11
instead of going to a nice hotel i
23:13
dragged my wife along to this place
23:15
and yeah they have um robots at the
23:18
reception um but i didn't see any of the
23:19
robots in the whole
23:21
building really i'm afraid so because
23:23
they're usually
23:24
i believe so but we left quite early
23:26
that day and
23:27
the cleaners were there and they were
23:29
either extremely realistic robots
23:33
or they were um humans oh really yeah
23:36
because there was one
23:37
one problem was that they could only
23:38
reach a quarter of the rooms i think was
23:40
that right in the hotel they couldn't
23:41
get up certain stairs
23:42
and also whenever a robot met another
23:44
robot on the corridor they didn't know
23:45
how to pass each other
23:47
i have that problem a lot as well you go
23:50
left and they go left and
23:51
yeah it's a nightmare um actually the
23:53
only other thing that i did see was they
23:55
had these amazing
23:56
cupboards i don't know if you guys have
23:57
seen these before it's like a cupboard
23:59
and you put your clothes in
24:01
and it's like a washing machine but i
24:02
don't think there's any water and you
24:04
leave it on for 45 minutes and it
24:05
freshens up your clothes wow
24:07
so it doesn't wash them which i learned
24:09
because at this stage
24:11
i'd been on the road for two weeks and
24:13
didn't have many clean clothes and i
24:14
thought maybe i'll wash them
24:15
but it does make them a lot fresher and
24:17
i think like maybe business people use
24:19
them because obviously in japan you work
24:21
long hours and stuff like that and so it
24:23
just freshens up
24:24
do you know how it freshens up i think
24:25
it's through air
24:27
and maybe it's damper
24:30
i think but you basically hang something
24:32
up and then close the door and some
24:34
magic happens and you open it up and it
24:36
smells quite nice
24:37
but it's not clean that's very cool
24:42
i just have one last thing this is a
24:43
technology a bit of news from the book
24:46
and it's that the bass player from blur
24:49
who's also a cheese maker
24:50
alex james has been this year turned
24:52
into cheese
24:54
it's going to affect the reunion tour
24:55
pretty badly isn't it
24:57
this is quite exciting this is done as
24:59
part of the vna museum exhibition in
25:01
london and what they did was they took
25:02
celebrities and they turned them into
25:04
cheese
25:04
so uh they took bits of bacteria off of
25:07
them and made them so
25:08
alex james was turned into a block of
25:10
cheshire uh professor greene the
25:12
musician was turned into a sort of form
25:14
of mozzarella
25:15
uh the madness singer suggs was turned
25:17
into a block of cheddar
25:18
you can go visit all these celebs as
25:20
cheeses it's like a weird madam to
25:21
swords
25:22
do you know where on their body they got
25:24
the bacteria from to make the trees
25:26
because i think it would affect whether
25:28
i was going to beat the cheese or not
25:30
i don't think you should eat the
25:30
exhibits
25:33
oh no so it's they're not
25:37
it's not cheese that's being sold they
25:39
didn't do it on mass
25:40
no no it's just it's part of a museum a
25:43
lot of waste
25:44
yeah let's break in well the thing is
25:46
with cheese as it gets better the longer
25:48
you leave it
25:48
some cheeses anyway um so maybe once the
25:51
exhibition is finished we can all go
25:53
with a few crackers and
25:54
yeah alex james yeah
25:57
[Music]
26:00
okay it is time for fact number three
26:02
and that is chozinski
26:04
my fact this week taken straight from
26:06
the book of the year 2019
26:09
available from all good bookstores and
26:10
online that was really professional
26:13
it's really good thank you very much
26:15
guys my fact is that in a country of 1.3
26:18
billion people
26:20
a polling station was set up in the
26:22
middle of the jungle for one single
26:24
man so that can only be india or china
26:28
and it's one of them take a pun which
26:31
one has elections
26:32
[Laughter]
26:36
and you've narrowed it down yeah this
26:39
this was in india india had an election
26:40
this year of course a mammoth election
26:43
and there was a priest a holy man called
26:45
darshandas
26:46
who he takes care of a temple which is
26:48
in a wildlife sanctuary
26:49
very deep in the jungle it's 70
26:51
kilometers into the jungle in gujarat
26:53
and he wanted to vote and so five
26:56
election officials
26:57
traveled the 70 kilometers into the
26:59
jungle set up a polling station
27:01
specifically for this guy
27:02
and he could vote although weirdly and i
27:05
couldn't find out why this was they set
27:06
it up a kilometer from his house
27:08
so they went all that way and then they
27:09
couldn't quite forgot to do the last
27:10
kilometer to his front door i think
27:12
you're gonna make the effort to vote
27:13
don't you yeah
27:14
yeah like you've got to go he might want
27:16
to think about who he's going to vote
27:17
for
27:18
during that one kilometer walk they
27:19
probably put placards on the trees on
27:21
the way
27:21
so they're trying to convince them to
27:22
sway the vote yeah you're right but this
27:24
wasn't the only polling station for just
27:26
one person
27:27
was it not amazingly so there was
27:29
another one in a place called malagam
27:30
and the team traveled 300 miles with the
27:33
polling booth
27:34
i th that must be cumulatively it must
27:36
be um
27:37
and there was a big interview with them
27:38
and i think the washington post it was
27:40
went along
27:41
um and the as they were setting up the
27:43
voting machines one of them said
27:45
there is both excitement and nervousness
27:47
if the one voter turns up there will be
27:48
100
27:49
voting but if she doesn't it will be
27:51
zero percent and they got there and the
27:53
locals nearby said oh yeah she's left
27:55
she's left the area
27:57
oh wow and they had so they they but
27:59
they thought no we hope you turned it
28:00
they still have to have it there just in
28:01
case i assume right
28:02
right and but it's so demanding so they
28:05
had to at five a.m
28:07
wake up and carry out a mock mock poll
28:10
with 50 mock votes even there's only one
28:12
voter coming to the polling station
28:14
and then thankfully the woman in
28:15
question was called taeyang and she
28:17
turned up she had been 125 miles away
28:19
looking after her ill mother
28:21
she came all the way back to vote here
28:24
she she arrived at 8 30. she still had
28:26
to queue up because there was a problem
28:27
with the machine
28:29
she voted and then they had to stay open
28:31
until 5 pm
28:32
oh my god so if you've ever
28:35
overslept and missed a council election
28:37
or something you should feel incredibly
28:39
guilty
28:41
considering the polls usually close at
28:42
10 o'clock i think if you've overslept
28:45
come on james we've all been students do
28:48
we know if the uh original
28:50
person that we're talking about with
28:51
this fact dojones did vote uh we are not
28:54
sure who he voted
28:55
for uh because it's it's well there's a
28:58
lot of people to vote for because there
29:00
are thousands and thousands of thousands
29:01
of people who take part in this election
29:03
yeah there's 1.3 billion people as we
29:05
said in india and
29:06
anyone who doesn't have a criminal
29:08
conviction can stand in the election
29:10
so you have so many thousands of people
29:12
there's only 543 seats
29:15
and in the last election in 2014 we
29:17
didn't have the um
29:18
the figures for this year yet but um 90
29:21
of the 8 200 people
29:24
who were going for election forfeited
29:26
their deposits
29:27
oh i know so everyone's getting like
29:30
zero percent
29:31
and 0.1 percent and stuff like that
29:33
there's a guy
29:34
um from tamil nadu who has contested and
29:37
lost
29:37
201 elections
29:40
oh wow how old is he he must be pretty
29:44
old
29:44
but maybe like like you say council
29:46
elections locally and stuff like that
29:48
and there's another guy called um baba
29:52
um who is currently on his 17th time
29:55
running
29:55
for the national election and his guru
29:58
has predicted that his victory will come
30:00
on the 20th attempt
30:02
it's really annoying having to go
30:04
through all 20. yeah only to not win on
30:06
the 20th or 10th
30:08
did you say as if you're not convicted
30:10
if you've not been convicted
30:11
of a criminal offense but i know there
30:13
are a lot of people who have been
30:14
charged
30:14
yeah so um we found out something about
30:17
this
30:18
in our research for the book which is
30:20
that of the mps elected
30:22
actually elected 43 are facing criminal
30:25
charges of some kind
30:26
and of those 18 are either charged with
30:29
murder or attempted murder
30:30
so it's about 8 of all elected mps in
30:33
india are charged with either murder or
30:34
attempted murder
30:35
and the reason is of course because in
30:37
india they have an
30:38
unbelievable backlog of cases which i
30:41
think we might have mentioned before
30:43
like there are millions if they did one
30:45
every day
30:46
or you know or 100 every day they won't
30:48
clear it up for
30:49
something like a thousand years or
30:50
something yeah yeah i think we have
30:52
discussed and in fact there is one story
30:54
in the book i think an indian man was
30:56
imprisoned this year
30:58
for he stole something like 20 rupees in
31:01
1979. that's right so it's been 40 years
31:04
waiting to get through and he plead not
31:05
guilty and then he sort of disappeared
31:07
in 2004.
31:08
they finally caught up with him arrested
31:09
and put him in jail and then i think
31:11
they exonerated him he spent three
31:12
months in jail and then they were like
31:14
actually
31:16
how much evidence you can collect for
31:17
this theft they released him and then
31:19
they said don't do it again
31:20
i think they did but they found him not
31:22
guilty
31:24
you're not guilty but also don't do the
31:26
thing you're not guilty of again that's
31:28
very lucky it was only three months
31:29
because presumably the waiting list to
31:30
revisit cases must be equally long right
31:33
yeah yeah yeah that's that's the thing
31:36
in the scottish courts isn't it they
31:37
used to have that i don't know if
31:38
they're still with that verdict
31:39
not pru is guilty not guilty and not
31:41
proven which means not guilty but don't
31:43
do it again
31:44
it's the old line yeah just we should
31:46
say how amazing and undertaking the
31:47
indian election
31:48
is so it's held in seven different
31:50
phases because india's so fast
31:52
as you say it just shows how swollen our
31:54
parliamentary system is because they
31:56
have about 100 fewer seats than us
31:57
in parliament and they managed to rule
31:59
this massive country but it lasts from
32:01
it lasted this year from 11th of april
32:03
to 19th of may
32:04
uh because what voting yeah voting so
32:07
they do it in seven different sections
32:08
and it's across 20 states
32:10
and of course narendra modi one in the
32:13
end
32:13
uh just in sort of uh political news
32:15
that we have in the book uh one of my
32:17
favorite stories was about the
32:19
uh prime minister of bhutan um we found
32:21
out this year that he likes to
32:23
unwind from his very stressful job by
32:25
going to a hospital every friday and
32:26
operating on someone
32:28
that's a huge there's a quote he said
32:29
some people play golf some do archery
32:31
i like to operate which he is qualified
32:33
to do isn't he well no but he doesn't do
32:35
operations he's qualified for that's the
32:37
amazing thing he takes a random patient
32:38
and he picks a random procedure and he
32:40
just does it
32:41
that's very impressive the things you
32:42
can get away with in public office
32:45
for a long time so before he was prime
32:46
minister he was the only urological
32:48
surgeon
32:48
in bhutan and he used to have a tv show
32:50
used to go on on the bbs
32:51
which is bhutan broadcasting service and
32:54
the public would call in
32:55
and he would give advice over the uh oh
32:57
like embarrassing bodies basically
32:59
yeah but live i guess okay embarrassing
33:01
what is live what do you want
33:03
i've actually seen it i don't know what
33:04
that show does
33:07
that's really interesting they didn't
33:08
have tv in bhutan until their 80s or 90s
33:11
as well
33:11
so he must be like one of the biggest um
33:14
tv stars in history yeah actually you
33:15
know
33:16

33:52

33:57
now the neighbors are shouting something
33:59
[Laughter]
34:02
other political news from the year yeah
34:04
um so there was
34:06
there was the election of zelensky
34:08
president of ukraine who's recently
34:10
commented his own by getting involved in
34:12
american politics
34:13
but this he was a film star so much like
34:17
the bhutanese guy he was famous before
34:19
he became president for other reasons
34:21
or greta sunburg um so he starts
34:26
he starred in a series called servant of
34:28
the people and it was an extremely
34:30
popular series where he plays a man the
34:32
lead role where he plays a man who
34:34
accidentally becomes
34:35
leader of the country and so he thought
34:38
i'm going to try that for real and so we
34:39
set up a party called servant of the
34:40
people
34:41
because why waste that name and yeah he
34:44
he smashed it it's insane it's so
34:46
bizarre it's i mean
34:48
i can't think of a i guess it's like the
34:49
stars of the thick of it isn't it
34:51
actually becoming prime minister or you
34:53
know like the star of the apprentice
34:55
becoming president of the united states
34:57
yeah true
34:58
yeah yeah i guess i think of it yeah
35:01
yeah
35:02
exactly leaders yeah um did you see the
35:04
recent news about zelensky which is too
35:05
recent for the book actually aside from
35:07
the fact that
35:08
trump's obviously in a small bit of
35:09
trouble for asking him to look into his
35:12
rival
35:12
but zielinski also just broke the world
35:15
record for the longest ever press
35:16
conference
35:19
a few days ago it was it lasted from 10
35:21
in the morning
35:22
until just after midnight it's a long
35:25
press conference
35:26
oh my goodness and what was that
35:28
questions and answers it was questions
35:29
and answers and apparently he largely
35:31
did it to try and deflect attention
35:32
because he's getting in trouble in
35:33
ukraine for having got involved with
35:35
donald trump in this questionable way
35:37
but at eight hours so i guess at 6 00
35:39
p.m
35:40
someone came up and announced that he'd
35:41
broken the existing record which was set
35:43
by belarus so presumably everyone
35:44
thought oh thank god we can go away now
35:46
he went over another six hours that is
35:49
amazing it's impressive isn't it wow and
35:51
he also said that he had special
35:52
surgery done or a special treatment done
35:54
on his vocal cords to make them stronger
35:56
had injections to strengthen
35:58
his vocal cords oh yeah you can get
35:59
botox in your vocal cords can't you to
36:01
make them stronger
36:02
but wouldn't wouldn't that seize them up
36:04
like it does with your face muscles
36:06
it would seize them up but then you it's
36:08
the amount that you put in
36:09
depends on how much they're seized up
36:11
right and actually looking at it now
36:13
some of the questions were why are your
36:14
vocal cords looking so sexy
36:16
so i think it was the botox thing
36:21
well um there was who i would have liked
36:25
to have won the ukrainian election
36:26
because then they would have been
36:27
speaking to trump on the phone and
36:29
discussing
36:30
joe biden is the person who was called
36:33
darth vader
36:34
who ran for a seat in that election
36:37
darth viktorovich vader
36:39
wow so you just want to hear his heavy
36:41
breathing voice on the phone you're
36:42
saying
36:43
look you take it away
36:49
but no i just like i just love the idea
36:51
of instead of
36:52
trump being in trouble with zoledski
36:54
being in trouble i think that would have
36:55
been hilarious
36:58
trump turns out to be his son after his
37:00
fifth term in office
37:02
uh one of my favorite facts of this book
37:04
um so there was a there was a kid who
37:06
became
37:07
quite famous globally known as egg boy
37:10
um
37:10
egg boy became famous in australia
37:12
because he threw an egg well smashed an
37:14
egg rather
37:15
on a far-right politician called fraser
37:17
anning
37:18
during a live tv interview and anning
37:20
punched him
37:21
and so he he became famous but it's just
37:24
a tiny detail that i think james you
37:25
found out that egg boy who got given the
37:27
nickname egg boy for the
37:29
for the thing that he did in later
37:31
interviews he revealed that
37:32
at school he is already known as egg boy
37:35
because he used to bring hard-boiled
37:37
eggs to school and classmates complain
37:39
that they smell
37:40
so he used to be an egg boy in a bad way
37:43
and now he's egg boy the hero that's
37:45
good though he's taking back control of
37:47
the name egg boy really is what you're
37:48
saying yeah exactly is two things have
37:50
happened in his lifetime taking back
37:51
control
37:52
anna you have to stop reading the
37:53
telegram seriously
37:56
um there was one more aussie politician
37:57
he got caught replying to his own
37:59
facebook post but under another name
38:02
this is angus taylor mp he was a liberal
38:04
mp and he posted a video announcing
38:06
extra parking spaces at train stations
38:08
fine fair enough
38:09
and then he immediately replied to it
38:12
but under his own
38:13
account name saying fantastic great move
38:16
well done angus and everyone spotted
38:18
this and they immediately also started
38:20
replying
38:21
fantastic great move well done angus
38:24
so actually you got what he wanted lots
38:26
of support lots of praise
38:27
that's the egg um egg balls it's the ed
38:30
balls
38:32
egg balls is something you need to see
38:34
that urologist about
38:38
[Music]
38:42
okay it is time for our final fact of
38:44
the show and that is my fact
38:45
my fact this week taken from the book of
38:48
the year 2019
38:49
is that a canadian man who threw his
38:51
speeding ticket
38:52
out of his car window was then given a
38:54
ticket for littering
38:56
so he lost twice that will teach you
39:00
he's the opposite of egg boy
39:01
basically and two wrongs don't make a
39:03
right do they the speeding ticket didn't
39:05
undo
39:06
his um not in la definitely littering no
39:09
two runs in murders
39:12
did an even number of murders yeah so
39:14
many people have been ruined by that
39:16
misconception it's such a shame
39:18
yeah there was a lot of funny weird
39:20
crime stories this year wasn't there a
39:22
lot of kind of fitting ones a bit like
39:24
that
39:24
so one of the stories in the book is
39:26
that five guys were arrested
39:28
at a branch of five guys
39:31
the burger chain uh this is in florida
39:33
and they got into a fist fight
39:35
uh it was an out and out brawl and i
39:37
think we like to think that there were
39:39
only four guys involved and the police
39:40
just asked the fifth guy do you mind if
39:42
we arrest you as well
39:43
we've got to make this work
39:46
there was um there was a british
39:49
fugitive who got arrested
39:50
he fled australia on a jet ski
39:54
i really like this guy where is he going
39:57
he was going to papua new guinea which
40:00
is
40:00
120 miles so i think he's stopped for
40:02
fuel at an island on the way however
40:04
he ran out of fuel three miles short of
40:06
papua new guinea
40:07
he was and he was wanted i think for
40:09
some pretty bad stuff
40:10
he was armed with a crossbow as well and
40:13
um when he arrived at this remote
40:15
peninsula to refuel with his jet ski
40:17
a witness told the brisbane paper the
40:18
courier mail that he stuck out like dogs
40:22
balls
40:24
that just reminds me um the australian
40:26
jet ski guy of a story that we had in i
40:29
think it was the first book of the year
40:30
uh still available still very readable
40:33
um
40:33
remember the guy who was the i think it
40:35
was the musician who had eaten
40:37
way too much at a restaurant a seafood
40:38
restaurant he jumped into the ocean to
40:40
escape the police
40:41
but his tactic for escaping the water
40:43
jet at the water ski riding police was
40:45
to hide underwater yeah
40:47
i can't remember his name he had an
40:48
amazing name oh
40:51
he was a rapper yeah he was going to say
40:53
self-made cash but he's from this
40:54
year's budget he is because he self-made
40:57
cash is the rapper who has
40:58
got done for credit card fraud right
41:00
that's right
41:02
was it i think the judges when they
41:03
condemned him this year said
41:05
self-made cash because he's written
41:06
actually written all these songs where
41:08
the lyrics kind of talk about how you
41:10
can do a good fraud or
41:12
screw over the authorities do a decent
41:15
fraud mate
41:16
and so i think when he was sentenced the
41:17
judge was like self-made cash thinks
41:19
that he is really adept at credit card
41:21
fraud
41:21
he is not yes if a judge is saying that
41:24
to you you probably know that you're not
41:25
very good at credit card fraud already
41:27
don't you
41:27
can i give you a crime story which
41:30
wasn't in the book
41:31
this year yeah this is kind of serious
41:33
but also
41:34
quite amazing so there was a man who was
41:36
arrested on suspicion of stalking a
41:38
female pop idol
41:40
in japan but the way that he stalked her
41:42
this is incredible
41:43
she took photos and selfies and stuff
41:45
and put them on social media
41:47
and he looked at her pupils and looked
41:50
at the reflection
41:51
in her pupils of what she was looking at
41:54
and then he used google street view to
41:56
find out where she lived
41:59
isn't that unbelievable oh my god
42:03
i mean that is terrifying it's
42:05
terrifying it's not a fun story but it's
42:07
an amazing story but it's useful because
42:09
it means that we should all
42:10
start walking around with our eyes
42:11
closed i think just whenever you take a
42:13
selfie have your eyes closed
42:14
yeah but if you really want to be safety
42:16
conscious hannah just go around with
42:18
your eyes closed constantly
42:19
i think so there was a similar story
42:21
though that is in the book which was
42:22
about
42:23
um alexandria ocasio-cortez do you
42:26
remember the thing about the
42:27
fact that she was in a bath and it was a
42:30
nude photo of her in the bath and you
42:31
could see in the
42:32
um the faucet at the end you could see a
42:35
reflection that looked like her
42:36
and she was insisting that this wasn't
42:38
her and they couldn't really prove it
42:40
but someone eventually got to the bottom
42:41
of it
42:41
and it was someone who uses the website
42:43
wiki feet which is where
42:45
feet are posted up of celebrity women
42:48
all over the world
42:48
and you rank them and you look at
42:50
pictures of their feet do you
42:52
um only sometimes
42:56
but this this guy is the person who
42:57
exonerated her for the fact it wasn't
42:59
her because he was able to show that it
43:01
wasn't her feet and he said i've sucked
43:03
enough toes in my life to recognize
43:04
when something doesn't look right yeah
43:08
it's i mean he he becomes a hero for
43:11
doing that and then immediately in the
43:13
same sentence
43:14
[Laughter]
43:17
there was another weirdly another story
43:19
related to that as well which was about
43:21
um taylor swift using facial recognition
43:24
at her gigs so when you arrived
43:27
i think there are lots of booths around
43:29
and if you look into the booth you sort
43:30
of
43:30
you can get snapped or you your photo is
43:32
taken or there are cameras
43:33
all around at her gigs and then those
43:36
are
43:36
those images are uploaded to a sort of
43:39
central command post
43:40
and then they're cross-referenced with
43:42
images of people who are known to have
43:43
um
43:44
been stalkers of taylor swift or have
43:46
you know been
43:47
you know too creepy and um
43:50
and then it's not a crime i think being
43:53
too creepy is a crime yeah oh yeah too
43:54
creepy too creepy
43:56
um and so then the people can be slung
43:58
out of the gigs yeah
43:59
i read just on the facial recognition
44:02
thing um
44:03
that in china they've literally just
44:05
come up with this new technology which
44:07
can
44:07
facially recognize an entire stadium of
44:10
people
44:11
it's that's what it is it's a really
44:13
really high megapixel camera
44:15
so this is one of the most clear cameras
44:17
that exists in the world
44:18
and you can get an image of 10 20 000
44:21
people
44:22
and it can facially recognize all of
44:23
them wait so if those exact
44:26
80 000 people are together again
44:28
somewhere it'll know that they're the
44:29
same ones who all attended the
44:31
show that's not the reason sorry did you
44:33
say 80 000 people at a bolton gate
44:36
that's my takeaway for that story that
44:38
was where that fell down sorry
44:40
no it's like to look for um stalkers or
44:43
criminals
44:44
yeah yeah the purpose is not to have a
44:46
comeback
44:47
gig for an audience i just like the
44:49
phrase it could recognize an entire
44:51
stadium of people like
44:52
it needs to see that one stadium exactly
44:55
composed that way
44:56
it would be an amazing game of spot the
44:58
difference or where's wally for
45:00
an ai machine that would be fantastic if
45:03
you could cajole the twenty thousand
45:04
people to come back again
45:06
one person who can't make it yeah and
45:08
then just replace them with someone in a
45:09
red stripey jumper
45:10
amazing i mean if you want if you want
45:12
really good facial recognition it helps
45:14
to be an authoritarian state like china
45:16
because they
45:17
they are way out in front with it they
45:19
know what they're doing that's good
45:20
advice
45:22
um but on facial recognition um we
45:25
should also talk about bodily
45:26
recognition
45:27
which has a big feature in our book and
45:30
this
45:30
is specifically the story that a swedish
45:33
police officer
45:34
recognized the naked body of a criminal
45:36
when he was sharing a sauna with him
45:39
amazing wait did he i thought he
45:40
recognized the faces we don't see our
45:42
face
45:43
he said we recognized each other we
45:46
don't know which part
45:47
i know that rash
45:51
what a hero though that is amazing
45:53
because obviously sauna's big bigger
45:54
thing in sweden than they are here yeah
45:56
and so he arrested him he made a naked
45:58
arrest they were both naked in the
45:59
summer together
46:00
and i hadn't realized that they did
46:01
recognize each other so it sounds like
46:03
their eyes met
46:03
across the steam room do you think i
46:06
reckon if i was a criminal i'd quickly
46:08
put a
46:09
shitload of water on the coals so it got
46:11
really really steamy and then you could
46:12
make your escape that's brilliant
46:15
that's why i'd be such a great super
46:17
criminal we we had
46:19
uh just a bit of behind the scenes on
46:20
the writing of this book obviously for
46:22
all the articles there was a lot of sort
46:24
of back and forth about what we thought
46:25
was a funnier way to put things or a
46:27
better way to write massive arguments
46:28
just put it as it is
46:30
massive just absolutely life-shattering
46:32
arguments we're
46:33
not yet talking to each other fully
46:34
again um no but uh one of my
46:36
my favorite moment was actually an
46:38
argument that i had with andy about the
46:40
drawing
46:40
for this article which was of a man that
46:43
adam doughty drew for us
46:45
sitting in a sauna with handcuffs around
46:46
adam doughty is our
46:48
cartoonist by the way for all three
46:50
artists all right illustrator yeah
46:52
um and he drew the criminal in the sauna
46:54
with a towel on sitting on a towel and
46:56
handcuffs on
46:57
and he wanted the towel removed because
46:58
he wanted to see the man's bottom
47:01
and yeah but probably because in
47:03
scandinavia they don't use towels thank
47:04
you james i wish you'd been in the room
47:06
for this argument
47:07
yes but we would have still come down
47:10
but he was in handcuffs so obviously
47:12
something had happened whereby handcuffs
47:14
were grabbed
47:15
most likely a towel was grabbed as well
47:17
that was your internal logic of the way
47:18
that
47:20
played out yeah yeah please write in
47:22
with your vote
47:24
who do you want to leave the show
47:25
forever andy or dad
47:27
or both hid an option to see
47:31
um i've got one fact which didn't sadly
47:33
make it into the book because again it
47:34
happened too late but this
47:35
is another arrest and it's a man in a
47:38
place called
47:38
mold in north wales really yeah um so he
47:42
was arrested after he tried on some
47:43
jeans in a shop
47:45
okay but he he then left behind 31 wraps
47:49
of heroin
47:50
in the pockets of the jeans that he
47:51
tried to say really well i just want to
47:53
say
47:55
wow and then absolutely ballsy as he
47:58
went back into the shop to say oh i've
48:00
left my medication behind it was these
48:02
31 little wraps of white powder oh wow
48:04
whatever
48:05
yeah oh my god i think i would do that
48:07
as well because they are probably going
48:09
to track you down at that point anyway
48:11
oh cctv i suppose if you've gone in and
48:15
paid for your
48:16
dry cleaning they're going to have your
48:18
details it's a
48:21
wait a minute he's taking his trousers
48:23
off and left them in the clothes shop
48:24
i've missed this sorry it wasn't
48:26
entirely clear to me i think he
48:28
he's left the clothes he tried the
48:29
trousers on but then he was holding the
48:31
heroine
48:32
and then he put them in the trouser
48:33
pocket so he could admire himself why
48:34
would you put the
48:35
is it i know maybe he was testing the
48:37
trousers to see how they fit with 31
48:39
wraps of heroin and
48:40
to see if they made the pockets look
48:42
bulky yeah i think i have done that
48:44
in clothes shops not specifically with
48:46
that substance but
48:48
with other classes yeah because you do
48:52
well you put things in the pockets you
48:54
have to check the pockets aren't too
48:55
tight i think if you're wearing
48:56
crafty yeah this is there's an example
48:58
actually in the book so we have an
49:00
article which is called unusual suspects
49:02
where this actually happened where a
49:04
drug dealer suspected drug dealer in
49:05
manchester left a rucksack stuffed with
49:07
drugs on a tram
49:08
and they found him because he had his
49:10
full name and address on the back
49:12
so it does happen that you can yeah
49:15
criminals are idiots
49:16
another good um weird idiot criminal
49:18
story was i think this is my top five
49:20
stories in the book
49:21
it's that the owner of the smugglers inn
49:23
hotel was charged with people smuggling
49:26
and this is a place in washington state
49:28
it's near the canadian border and its
49:30
owner robert boulay
49:31
really embraces the smugglers theme so
49:33
you know he's not
49:34
he's not trying to hide he hasn't tried
49:36
to hide the fact before that he's into
49:37
the
49:38
smuggling theme every room is named
49:39
after a famous criminal
49:41
you know all the decor is smuggler thing
49:42
next star is the heroine dealers in
49:45
yeah um and yeah he just went one step
49:49
too far and has been charged with 21
49:50
counts of
49:51
inducing aiding or rebetting seven
49:53
people who are entering canada
49:55
illegally that's amazing but the thing i
49:57
love about this place is i think this is
49:59
the thing that you found down
50:01
but that in a more unbelievable
50:03
coincidence in 2012 the smugglers in was
50:05
the scene of a crime
50:07
when police arrested three people there
50:09
for smuggling drugs in a car
50:11
coincidence one and the license plate
50:13
was smuggler
50:14
yeah well this was a thing we mentioned
50:16
on the podcast years ago yeah um
50:18
just when we were writing this i don't
50:19
think was my fact but i recalled
50:21
that we'd mentioned it i thought can't
50:23
be the same place and it is what's the
50:24
guy doing same place
50:26
smuggling yeah we should wrap up soon
50:30
anyone got anything before we do
50:31
uh just one other nice little crime
50:33
story this is that a man in salisbury
50:35
had to excuse himself from jury duty
50:38
remember this he was excusing himself on
50:39
the grounds that he was scheduled to be
50:41
the judge in the case in question
50:43
that's awesome this was judge keith
50:45
cutler and
50:47
um he said you know i can't really be on
50:48
the jury because i'm judging this case
50:50
he's resident judge of winchester and
50:51
salisbury
50:52
and so he wrote to ask for an exemption
50:56
and he was rejected he was told by the
50:59
authorities that he had to apply to the
51:00
resident judge if he wanted an exemption
51:02
and he wrote back and said i am the
51:03
resident judge
51:05
all he needs to be is also the
51:06
executioner
51:08
he's an idiom in himself
51:10
[Laughter]
51:11
[Music]

00:13
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:16
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden
00:21
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:23
here with andrew hunter murray anna
00:25
chazinski
00:25
and james harkin and once again we have
00:27
gathered around the microphones with our
00:29
four
00:29
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:31
and in no particular order
00:33
here we go starting with you james
00:36
okay my fact this week is that the
00:38
moulin rouge
00:40
had a kankan dancer who would distract
00:42
patrons by kicking off their hats
00:44
before promptly downing their drinks so
00:48
good
00:48
such a good trick it's a it's a
00:51
dangerous trick
00:52
yeah because you might just kick someone
00:53
in the face and then i was thinking the
00:55
alcohol poisoning
00:56
oh yeah but yes these were problems but
01:00
actually the um kicking in the face
01:02
thing that was one thing that the kankan
01:04
dancers would do
01:06
is deliberately pretend that they were
01:07
going to kick someone in the face if
01:08
they were taking too many liberties on
01:10
the front row
01:11
they would kind of do a kick that got
01:12
quite close to their face and so that
01:14
was the thing they did
01:15
and as for the alcohol poisoning
01:17
unfortunately this lady called
01:18
la gulu otherwise known as louise weber
01:22
unfortunately she did in the end succumb
01:25
to the drink
01:26
oh yeah so um this fact came to me
01:30
from text text message when we were on
01:32
tour last week and it came from someone
01:34
called sarah fung who i uh texted this
01:36
morning and she allowed me to use it
01:38
she's just as well because you guys had
01:40
already researched it
01:42
but this lady called lagalu she was
01:44
amazing she was the highest paid
01:46
entertainer of her day and she was
01:48
basically
01:49
the moulin rouge personified yeah she
01:52
was
01:52
la gulu means the glutton and yeah she
01:55
used to down people's drinks or swipe
01:57
their chicken drumsticks from them
01:59
apparently and drumsticks at the moulin
02:01
rouge it's surprising isn't it
02:03
it feels like more of a nando's kind of
02:04
vibe but apparently they're very sexy in
02:07
the olden days um
02:08
so she she had various other methods of
02:10
distraction she
02:11
had a parrot a pet parrot a little pet
02:14
goat
02:15
that she kept on a lead in the mulan
02:17
rouge in the moulin rouge sheet well i
02:18
think often you're sort of wandering
02:20
around
02:20
mingling how does having a
02:24
parrot help you steal food well if
02:27
anyone's distracted
02:28
yeah yeah it's just this whole woman's
02:30
career sounds like an excuse to get more
02:32
food
02:33
yeah she was called the glasses she had
02:36
a lover
02:37
um whose name was lamont fromage the
02:40
cheesy girl
02:41
that was the name of her girlfriend
02:43
that's like a preview of the cheeky
02:44
girls
02:46
very much more frenchy girls
02:50
touch my bum no effect although actually
02:52
um
02:53
lagu lou sorry to interrupt me but la
02:54
gulu um one other thing that she used to
02:56
do to distract people
02:58
is she would bend over show her knickers
03:00
and she would have a big red heart on
03:02
her knickers and that was like one of
03:03
her
03:04
kind of signature move yeah exactly
03:06
we've all got one
03:09
um people had amazing names another of
03:11
the dancers was nicknamed
03:13
glee de goo which means sewer grating
03:16
oh nice so it was i don't know
03:19
do you know why she was called that no i
03:21
don't it wasn't because of her teeth
03:23
yeah she had really gaps in her teeth
03:26
this is great this is like wwf they've
03:28
all got
03:29
a character a signature move it's all
03:31
real as well it's all
03:33
real yeah there was another one called
03:35
uh nene
03:36
le pat on there which means knee knee
03:39
legs aloft
03:40
or legs in the air feels like that
03:42
described all of them
03:43
yes it does apart from the nene bit yeah
03:46
it was in here basically their thing was
03:48
throwing their legs up
03:49
as high in the air as they could wasn't
03:50
it the french can can yeah invented the
03:52
moulin rouge
03:53
so weber or weber i guess it looks like
03:56
a german name but she was french
03:58
she had a dance partner who was called
04:00
jacques renauda
04:01
uh aka valenta le desoce which means the
04:04
boneless
04:05
and he wasn't as successful as her
04:07
apparently
04:08
amazing every time he threw his legs in
04:10
the air they just wobbled
04:11
down like a jelly well look i think he
04:14
was very flexible
04:15
which being boneless does make you and i
04:17
don't think he was literally boneless
04:19
but um he danced at the moulin rouge as
04:21
well but he never accepted a single
04:22
cent for it this is really yeah
04:26
what was he independently wealthy no one
04:29
knows about his background and no he
04:30
wasn't independently wealthy he just
04:32
loved dancing so much he felt guilty
04:37
speaking of boneless people have you
04:39
guys ever heard of captain frodo
04:41
no some lord of the rings well no
04:42
captain frodo's slightly different i
04:44
think he's oh he's from summer in
04:46
scandinavia but this is a modern cabaret
04:47
performer
04:48
he performs in a show called la clique
04:50
which is really amazing
04:52
and his trick is that he can fit his
04:54
entire body through a tennis racket
04:56
oh i haven't seen that in fact he's got
04:58
two tennis rackets one is ten inches
05:00
you know from the base of the head to
05:02
the top of the head and the other one is
05:03
eight inches
05:04
from the base to the top and he gets
05:05
through both of them at the same time is
05:07
he the one does he like dislocate his
05:09
shoulders or something
05:10
very much so he dislocates everything in
05:12
his body it's incredible
05:13
and they do take the strings off don't
05:15
they
05:18
yeah they do i was just thinking of one
05:20
more boneless thing and there was an
05:22
ivan the boneless wasn't there in
05:24
um in the sagas i think yeah my favorite
05:27
cartoon character in all existence is
05:29
boneless chicken from cow and chicken
05:31
i'm so glad we're finally talking about
05:32
boneless things after five and a half
05:34
years
05:34
why is he called boneless he has no
05:36
blood he has no bones and his whole
05:37
character
05:38
is just he turns up in about one in
05:39
every six episodes and he's just like a
05:42
flopped lump of skin usually over a
05:44
chair or a table or on the floor and
05:45
they're like oh hey uncle boneless
05:47
chickens come to stay again
05:48
hey uncle and then he'd just like
05:52
so another performer at the moulin rouge
05:55
is someone who's an old
05:56
uh friend of the podcast we've spoken
05:58
about him a few times what ever
06:00
digby i say an old friend we've
06:03
mentioned him probably twice
06:05
um le patermaine the french fighter he
06:08
was a headline act at the moulin rouge
06:11
what was he doing he would go on stage
06:12
after him do you
06:14
yeah yeah so he'd go up and i don't know
06:16
how it worked if
06:17
we've miked because i picture the moulin
06:19
rouge as you say like people are walking
06:20
around with goats you know how are you
06:22
going to hear
06:23
how are you going to hear he did do
06:24
stage stuff didn't you he did do stage
06:26
stuff
06:26
yeah but i suppose usually he'd be in a
06:28
quiet auditorium i see a point whereas
06:30
you know a lot of
06:32
noise it must have been mic'd up it's
06:34
not that sexy is it given that moulin
06:36
rouge was supposed to be a little bit
06:37
raunchy i don't know if fasting is sexy
06:40
but it might have been back then
06:41
some people in france do you know one
06:44
sexy thing they did have they had a
06:46
massive wooden elephant in their garden
06:48
right so that's in the film that because
06:50
there was a recent film about it
06:52
but do you mean the film in rich yeah
06:56
could it come out last year yeah yeah it
06:58
must have been last year
06:59
it can't be more than last year a couple
07:01
of years i think okay
07:03
relative between the invention of film
07:05
and now
07:06
it's in the most recent fifth i would
07:08
say
07:09
so it is a recent film just it is just
07:12
in the fifth
07:13
this is completely irrelevant the point
07:16
is
07:16
i don't know if they mentioned this in
07:17
the recent film
07:19
but it had a room in its belly for
07:22
intimate dances
07:24
so you would have belly dances for sort
07:25
of an exclusively male clientele in
07:27
there
07:28
belly belly dancers yes exactly so cool
07:31
maybe if things were getting a bit sexy
07:32
in the main club you'd say hey you want
07:34
to take this to the elephant
07:36
should i bring the goat do you know how
07:39
old you have to be to go to the moulin
07:40
rouge well today yeah i would guess
07:43
18 younger wow 14 younger
07:46
no a minus age six years old
07:51
children from the age of six are now
07:53
permitted to attend the
07:54
uncensored evening shows according to
07:56
their website
07:57
but even in the 1950s they had a
07:59
children's matinee every sunday
08:01
what so in the afternoon on a sunday all
08:04
the kids could go there and watch it
08:06
but all their dancers were much more
08:08
covered up
08:10
so they got the you got the idea of
08:12
being at the moulin rouge but without
08:13
the sexiness
08:14
so the elephant was closed off for the
08:16
afternoon
08:18
that's a shame because a massive wooden
08:19
elephant would be the thing i as a
08:21
six-year-old would want to see
08:22
rather than a load of dancing girls at
08:24
the age of six i agree
08:25
something else i had in the garden that
08:26
was very good for children if they'd
08:28
attended was the donkey rides
08:29
so not a thing you usually see in
08:31
nightclubs anymore
08:34
i don't know the last time i went which
08:35
was quite recent got there in a horse
08:40
and cart didn't you
08:42
uh yeah they used to do donkey rides
08:43
around the garden it was a it was a
08:44
pleasure garden which someone described
08:46
at the time as a pleasure garden with
08:48
small enclosures for dalliances and the
08:52
girls used to be allowed on the donkeys
08:53
so they could sort of hitch up their
08:55
skirts and show off their
08:56
legs it was very exciting seeing
08:58
people's legs at this time
09:00
so it started in the 1880s
09:03
sorry andy and i were looking at each
09:04
other still exciting legs okay
09:07
so again we're a very old-fashioned
09:08
group here we've established
09:10
you've never really seen i was meaning
09:11
to say something you were showing your
09:13
ankles this morning
09:15
i've mentioned it to hr
09:19
i thought pedal pushers were acceptable
09:20
these days
09:22
um no it was because you hadn't really
09:23
seen women's legs they used to wear big
09:25
skirts that went down to the ground or
09:26
at least you'd only just see a bit of
09:28
ankle
09:28
and suddenly they're doing the can-can
09:30
which is exposing their upper thighs
09:32
and um yeah it um it became the main
09:35
attraction really and police used to go
09:37
and check they were wearing underwear so
09:38
they come to the moulin rouge to watch
09:40
well i i bet they were gagging for that
09:42
job all of that was gonna say
09:44
that is better than office work isn't it
09:46
as a policeman
09:47
it's a yeah it's a good gig if you can
09:49
get it no they did tend to wear
09:51
underwear they would have said you're
09:52
knickered
09:53
if they had to carry out arrests yeah
09:55
yeah very good
09:56
the mulan rouge has quite a few guinness
09:58
world records okay yeah specifically for
10:00
cancan
10:01
so they have the most circular french
10:04
kanken kicks they did 29
10:06
in 30 seconds so they did this outside
10:08
of the moorland rouge
10:10
so it's um i imagine it's when you go
10:14
you kick your leg out to the left and it
10:16
goes all the way around a bit like a
10:17
roundhouse kick
10:18
yeah exactly okay yeah um and then like
10:21
you're waving but with your leg
10:23
hmm yeah so then another record that
10:26
they have
10:27
there's a kanken soloist he's a greek
10:29
guy um and he's got the record for most
10:31
high kicking behind his head which he
10:33
did 30 times in 30 seconds
10:35
now i don't know if that means the kick
10:37
goes no i would say it goes for
10:39
so damn was just pushing back with his
10:41
arm but i would say that it goes in the
10:43
normal kancan fashion
10:44
but maybe the foot ends up behind behind
10:46
your ear yeah so 30 times in 30 seconds
10:49
he could kick off his own hat
10:54
but the can count was for men and women
10:55
originally it was a men and women's
10:57
dance
10:58
and it was the men did all the high
11:00
kicks the women didn't do any
11:02
and then and the really shocking thing
11:04
about it was that there was lots of
11:05
bodily contact between the partners
11:06
doing it
11:07
and then the women started joining in
11:09
the high kicks and
11:11
people noticed that oh this is really
11:12
sexy uh partly because women wore
11:14
open crotched pantalettes in the 19th
11:17
century not just partly mainly
11:18
i would say that's why it's sexy it's
11:20
mainly yeah absolutely yeah
11:22
so they then thought oh this is much
11:23
better than watching a load of men just
11:25
leaping around
11:26
all the corners of the stage and that's
11:28
how it got its
11:29
salacious reputation did they really
11:30
have so when they did the kang
11:32
at certain points they're until they
11:34
must have had underwear under that right
11:35
they weren't flashing their vaginas in
11:36
the midnight
11:37
i believe they were yeah i think that
11:39
vaginas in the
11:41
like not in the milan rouge but i think
11:42
in the
11:44
realm of march in like other i see
11:46
salacious
11:48
in the sort of the spin-off yeah they
11:49
definitely want to move
11:51
strict about pants actually yeah yeah it
11:53
was um
11:54
they were very strict on that but okay
11:56
there were spin-off cedia places because
11:57
i think if they were never doing that
11:59
there'd be no point having the police
12:00
there
12:01
the police would have been just
12:03
basically checking people's knickers for
12:04
no reason
12:05
i mean yeah yeah you're right there must
12:07
have been a couple of people who maybe
12:08
forgot
12:10
maybe forgot yeah we all forget to wear
12:12
pants some days
12:14
it really makes the police sound like
12:15
creepy gym teachers
12:17
they're checking everyone's wearing the
12:18
regulation underpants
12:20
well you had a rough time at school
12:21
didn't you andy no
12:26
that's a sad cry isn't it
12:29
memories are flooding in there he's lost
12:31
it i don't know what you're talking
12:32
about
12:33
um so i read about one accident in the
12:36
moulin rouge
12:37
that happened this was in 1899 and there
12:39
was a
12:40
british newspaper i was looking this up
12:41
actually in the british newspaper
12:42
archive and the tone
12:44
with which british newspapers report on
12:46
it is so funny
12:47
because they basically they're not
12:48
outraged by it they don't think it's
12:50
salacious and gross they basically go
12:52
oh this isn't nearly as fun as our music
12:54
calls all the articles
12:55
i went there and it was just massively
12:56
overly hyped and it wasn't a big deal at
12:59
all didn't fancy anyone
13:00
prefer to go to an opera but anyway all
13:03
these articles are like that and then
13:04
there was one report that in 1999
13:06
emiliano rouge dancer actually died
13:08
while dancing her quadrille which was
13:10
like the precursor to the cancan
13:11
uh because the dance ends with her
13:13
jumping really really high in the air
13:15
springing in the air
13:16
and then landing flat on the ground in
13:17
the splits with her legs at right angles
13:19
to each other
13:20
oh no but apparently she did it so
13:21
carelessly as to be injured fatally
13:23
wait what does that mean what does it
13:26
mean it sounds like you'd be torn apart
13:27
what did she land on
13:28
yeah yeah doesn't mean she hit a ceiling
13:31
fan in the air
13:32
i don't think they existed like that oh
13:35
ceiling fans have been around for a long
13:36
time haven't they
13:37
well you get those punkers in india
13:40
don't you which are the
13:41
sort of big mats you hang up and then
13:42
you say them to a friend it would be
13:43
hard to kill yourself
13:45
also the only guy goes to the moulin
13:47
rouge looking at the ceiling fans
13:50
it was the first place with electricity
13:52
though in france wasn't it
13:54
so maybe we needed it to operate the
13:55
ceiling fence thank you
13:57
riddled with ceiling fans the main
13:58
attraction actually we've got to invent
14:00
something that can make these ceiling
14:01
fans work
14:04
um just on scandalous dances
14:07
and the british press's reaction so the
14:09
waltz was
14:11
an earlier scandalous precursor to the
14:13
cancun
14:14
so it arrived in london in about 1790
14:16
but even 25 years later it was still
14:18
pretty shocking
14:19
again because you were very close to
14:20
your partner and an article in the times
14:22
wrote
14:23
so long as this obscene display was
14:25
confined to prostitutes and adult
14:26
arrests
14:27
we did not think it deserving of notice
14:29
but now that it has attempted to be
14:31
forced on the respectable classes of
14:33
society
14:34
we feel it a duty to warn every parent
14:36
against exposing his daughter
14:38
to so fatal a contagion that was the
14:40
walt wow
14:41
yeah i still feel that way about novels
14:46
you say nobles novels oh novels
14:50
novels i thought it was some dance
15:03
it does it does not feel like a moulin
15:05
rouge kind of dance
15:10
okay it is time for fact number two and
15:13
that
15:14
is andy my fact is that in 1959 as a
15:17
publicity stunt a three-ton block of ice
15:19
was driven
15:20
from the arctic circle to the equator
15:24
this is the craziest story it's insane
15:26
so
15:27
this was uh i found this in an article
15:29
on amusingplanet.com which has brilliant
15:31
articles about all sorts of stuff on it
15:33
and this was in the 1950s it was a stunt
15:36
by a norwegian firm
15:38
which was trying to show how good their
15:39
insulating glass wool was i didn't know
15:41
about glass wool before either
15:43
um but it was in response to a challenge
15:45
on radio luxembourg in 1958 they
15:48
challenged anyone
15:49
they said if you can take three tons of
15:51
ice from the arctic to the equator
15:53
and it's verified we will give you a
15:55
hundred thousand francs for every single
15:57
kilo
15:57
that remains when you get to the equator
16:00
wow but you but the trick was you
16:01
weren't allowed to use any refrigeration
16:03
but you're allowed to use glass wall
16:05
you're allowed to use glass wall and the
16:07
that prize was big that was the
16:08
equivalent of 17 000
16:10
in modern money per kilo okay this is a
16:13
big opportunity how much did they get to
16:15
the end well by the time it got to the
16:17
end it had lost
16:18
11 only of its weight so do we know how
16:22
much they got how many people
16:24
it must have about 2 700 kilos left yeah
16:27
they it was a 350 kilo block
16:31
uh that this firm did so they must have
16:32
got about the modern day equivalent of
16:35
two
16:35
million dollars or something well radio
16:37
luxembourg
16:39
had retracted the offer when it became
16:41
clear how much money they were going to
16:42
lose
16:43
before they set off though they before
16:45
they set off yeah attracted the offer
16:47
very early but the manager the glassware
16:49
was so excited because they just wrapped
16:51
up the block of ice and they took loads
16:53
of medicines with them so it wasn't a
16:54
completely pointless trip and they just
16:55
put this massive clock of ice on a tree
16:57
i mean taking ice to the sahara is not
16:59
pointless anyway right it's not
17:01
at least useful that's true people
17:03
although did they then distribute it
17:04
around the sahara for cocktails and
17:06
stuff they did
17:06
did they yeah yeah they did they chopped
17:08
it up into all the blocks and they gave
17:09
it to people who in the article says had
17:11
never seen
17:12
ice before really nice blocks you know
17:14
for although
17:15
there was one thing where there was a
17:16
documentary made about it and there were
17:18
pictures of
17:19
camels um drinking this fresh norwegian
17:21
water
17:22
as if it was the greatest thing in the
17:23
world but actually everything that they
17:25
were drinking was full of glass wool and
17:27
tar paper so
17:29
it wasn't really potable at all do you
17:31
know what happened to some of the ice
17:32
some of the ice was flown back to oslo
17:35
really yeah
17:36
it was wrapped in presumably a smaller
17:37
amount of glass wool and it was flown
17:38
back to
17:39
be given to journalists in their drinks
17:43
at a media reception in oslo all about
17:45
this incredible achievement
17:46
really cool isn't it you have a gin and
17:48
tonic where the ice has been all the way
17:49
to africa
17:50
yeah that's incredible i mean i know
17:52
we're not supposed to buy things that
17:53
have flown halfway around the world
17:56
um oh that was an insane thing actually
17:58
so they so they had an alright drive
18:00
down to
18:01
north africa you know and by the time
18:02
they got to north africa they'd only
18:03
lost four liters of water out of
18:05
3000 kilos on this block i mean this
18:08
glass wool stuff is really good
18:10
but algeria was in the middle of a civil
18:12
war so
18:14
bad time for driving through there were
18:15
no roads through the desert
18:17
no uh and they had so they had to keep
18:19
on getting out and digging it out just
18:21
digging the truck out of a sand drift
18:22
that it got into
18:23
and the worst thing was they had a very
18:24
limited water supply
18:26
so they were really thirsty all the time
18:28
they were driving because they didn't
18:29
just lick their blood three tons of ice
18:32
wow so disciplined though that they all
18:34
refrained
18:35
from licking the ice they wouldn't even
18:37
take a milliliter off it oh yeah
18:39
great yeah didn't they have to be
18:41
guarded by the french foreign legion
18:42
at one point i think going through the
18:43
sahara desert they were guarded
18:46
uh because of the guerrilla forces in
18:47
the sahara that they thought might
18:48
attack them yes i think algeria was then
18:50
in the process of
18:51
stopping being french and starting to be
18:53
algerian so i think that's why the
18:55
french foreign legion might have been
18:56
there
18:56
what a what a lovely way of putting that
19:00
very traumatic decolonization of a
19:03
country theory
19:05
we're in this gradual transition phase
19:09
um and they did as you said they did
19:10
take medicines with them so they ended
19:12
up in garbon
19:13
at the end and they brought a shed load
19:15
of
19:16
medicine tons and tons of medicines to
19:17
deliver to the people so not just a pr
19:19
stunt
19:20
right although predominantly mostly yeah
19:24
but actually the idea of bringing ice
19:26
from the north or the south and
19:28
using it in warmer climes is quite a
19:30
common idea through history right
19:32
i guess so um it's one of your favorite
19:34
things andy about lassoing icebergs
19:36
oh yeah like this isn't for drinking it
19:39
but isn't it like
19:40
when there's oil rigs or something yes
19:42
is to stop at hitting oil rigs
19:44
um i actually phoned up one of the
19:46
iceberg lassoing men
19:48
and had a i interviewed him about it or
19:50
he he owns the
19:52
oh he was running a company which does
19:53
the satellite monitoring of icebergs
19:55
because when one's drifting towards an
19:57
oil rig and if it crashes into an oil
19:58
rig that's big big trouble
20:00
and so they just have to go out and they
20:01
put a rope all the way around it and
20:02
they tow it a little bit
20:04
just for an hour or two and then that
20:06
pushes it into a different enough
20:08
direction that it's going to miss the
20:09
rig
20:09
it's so cool it's amazing but they don't
20:11
they don't fully tow it to
20:13
the equator which would be a big job but
20:16
that has been a thing that people have
20:17
tried to do in history and actually
20:18
people have done that they've taken it
20:20
from antarctica up to
20:21
places like peru and yeah where they
20:23
used it for the brewing industry
20:26
and when they have droughts yeah we had
20:28
to get the ice and you know they used
20:30
you mentioned
20:30
oil platforms russia actually uses ice
20:33
as a drilling platform
20:35
so this is this really cool kind of ice
20:38
which is a
20:39
giant ice blocks called naled which are
20:42
basically
20:42
ice blocks that form on rivers so ice
20:44
that forms on rivers is can be much
20:47
thicker than ice that forms on lakes
20:48
because
20:49
if it's cold enough then the fourth of
20:51
the water underneath the layer of ice
20:52
pushes up in the slightly warmer daytime
20:54
through it and runs on top of it and
20:56
then it freezes overnight
20:58
so you've got like a second layer and
20:59
then the next day same thing happens
21:01
again you've got a third layer
21:02
where it's like a russian doll it's like
21:04
a russian doll but
21:05
made of ice so you can get these huge
21:08
like seven meter thick
21:09
blocks of ice and they've been used for
21:11
things like the north korean military
21:13
um i know we don't like to take tips
21:15
from them but the north korean military
21:17
use them to build river crossings for
21:19
their tanks in winter and russia has
21:20
drilling platforms made of these
21:23
giant ice blocks do they sorry do they
21:25
move or can you move them around can you
21:26
throw them into place
21:27
they pick them up yeah so they take them
21:29
out of the cattle thing yeah it's
21:31
amazing because there was a plan to use
21:32
them in mongolia this is where i found
21:34
out about them first
21:35
in 2011 a plan for keeping mongolia cool
21:38
in
21:39
summer so i thought mongolia mainly had
21:41
a problem with being too cold but
21:42
ulambital gets very hot in summer
21:44
and so they said to regulate
21:46
temperatures reduce air con
21:48
and provide drinking water and
21:49
irrigation they would take some of these
21:51
huge
21:52
blocks of ice and dump them in new
21:54
lamberto and gradually let them melt
21:56
through the summer and it was what they
21:57
called an ice
21:58
shield amazing and this would sort them
22:00
out and it was this planet got like
22:01
hundreds of thousands of dollars of
22:02
funding
22:03
and if anyone knows what the hell
22:04
happened to it can you let me know
22:09
that is amazing so do you sorry do you
22:11
know whether it actually happened
22:12
i have no idea it kept on saying they've
22:15
got the funding they're doing this the
22:16
plans underway 2011.
22:18
zilch from here on in wow so on
22:21
uh publicity stunts game of thrones
22:24
announced the premiere of their seventh
22:27
season
22:28
with a block of ice what they did was
22:30
they set up a large block of ice and
22:32
then in front of it they put a camera
22:34
and they set up a facebook live
22:35
broadcast with the block of ice melting
22:38
and if you typed fire i think this is
22:40
how it works
22:41
a little flamethrower near it would
22:42
would blast a small amount of fire
22:45
and as the big block of ice melted it
22:46
was going to reveal the date
22:48
of the launch of the series it's clever
22:50
unfortunately
22:52
it took a long time it took over an hour
22:55
and everyone was typing fire and
22:56
everyone was getting really frustrated
22:57
turns out ice is really hard to melt
22:59
even if you even if you type dracaris
23:02
which is a thing from the show and it
23:03
means that multiple flamethrowers fired
23:05
it still took more than an hour and then
23:07
the live stream broke
23:09
so they were just left with a big block
23:10
of ice and eventually game of thrones
23:12
just tweeted the date that the series
23:13
was coming out
23:15
everyone hated it i can't believe game
23:18
of thrones fans
23:19
above anyone else couldn't be bothered
23:21
to sit around for one hour
23:23
and wait for that well there was no
23:25
nudity in that hour so i don't think
23:27
yeah
23:27
that's the mistake isn't it it should
23:29
have been like one of those mugs that
23:30
when it gets hot shows a naked woman
23:33
two shagging vikings have gradually
23:35
appeared
23:36
well somebody's never seen it that
23:38
you've got a very good grasp of what the
23:40
show is
23:40
thanks very much um i was looking up
23:44
ice stunts as well did you guys ever
23:46
hear about
23:47
the the 2001 sort of ice contest
23:50
launched by a birmingham radio station
23:53
which
23:54
it was on b and he's looking horrified
23:56
enough to suggest he definitely knows
23:57
about this
23:58
it was brmb radio station and basically
24:01
it got this cool idea from a new zealand
24:02
website which had run a similar
24:03
competition
24:04
and this site said that they'd you got a
24:07
block of ice of ordinary ice and they'd
24:09
had a contest to see
24:10
how long contestants could sit on it and
24:13
the winner got
24:14
the prize and so this birmingham radio
24:16
station uh decided to do the same
24:18
thing but due to what was reported as a
24:20
breakdown in communications
24:22
they had people sit on a lump of dry ice
24:25
which is of course minus 78 degrees
24:28
celsius
24:29
so it ended up it was to win tickets to
24:32
go and see jerry halliwell and a1
24:34
oh my god they ended up going didn't
24:36
they that's the worst thing i've ever
24:38
heard
24:39
no it landed three contestants in
24:40
hospital for more than two months with
24:42
severe frostbite
24:43
they've got permanent scarring three of
24:45
them had to have skin grafts and stuff
24:47
um and yeah severe burns the one who
24:50
escaped with less serious burns only
24:52
escaped with less serious burns because
24:54
she was wearing 14 pairs of pants
24:57
wow sort of the opposite of a moulin
24:59
rouge performer
25:02
it's a really bad story it's bad i mean
25:04
the thing is there was a
25:05
john's ambulance team watching and they
25:08
said you know you really shouldn't sit
25:09
there for longer than 10 minutes that
25:11
would be dangerous and they were there
25:12
for nearly an hour still ten minutes is
25:13
too long yeah
25:14
it's minus because i'm saying how did
25:17
one person not read like minus 78
25:20
degrees and say
25:21
this feels weird well eventually there
25:23
was a massive
25:25
legal you know case over it and the
25:27
radio station was fined
25:28
fifteen thousand pounds yeah pathetic
25:31
three people permanent scarring for life
25:33
wow wow insane
25:35
but they got to go to the concert well
25:37
that's good yeah and
25:38
hopefully although apparently it really
25:40
hurt to sit down
25:41
so you'd hope i suppose that they had
25:43
mosh pit well you wouldn't be sitting
25:44
down with a jerry hallowell an a1 gig
25:47
you'd be on your feet the whole time oh
25:48
you'd be being passed over the
25:50
wave thing that people do in the
25:52
audience with their arms in the air okay
25:54
guys
25:56
you know the mosh pit yeah what's it no
25:58
that's not what it's called yeah you'd
25:59
be
26:00
um you'd be cross-surfing yeah yeah
26:02
there you go
26:03
oh wow do you remember david blaine's
26:06
ice
26:07
thing um oh yeah not really
26:10
this is before he went up over the river
26:12
thames yeah
26:13
um he spent 58 hours inside a block of
26:16
ice
26:17
in the year 2000 oh that's right yes
26:19
yeah yeah did he really uh
26:20
yeah he did yeah he was sealed into two
26:22
blocks of ice with a body shaped cocoon
26:24
in the middle
26:25
right and he had a he had a tube to
26:26
breathe through and he could drink water
26:28
i mean he could
26:29
he'd drink water whenever he liked i
26:31
guess um but this was good mostly
26:33
because of all the other magicians
26:35
immediately giving him shadow for it and
26:37
being furious
26:38
so penn half of penn teller said pumping
26:41
hot air into a phone booth and putting
26:43
ice around it and standing around
26:44
without a thought in your head
26:45
isn't a trick um and a spokesman for
26:48
david copperfield said a spokesman for
26:51
david copperfield said
26:52
if you look at the physics of it it's
26:53
warmer than a downfield sleeping bag in
26:55
there
26:56
wow they were just they were really
26:57
limited yeah and they don't know he
26:59
didn't have a thought in his head
27:00
he could have been creating the next
27:02
shakespeare yeah
27:04
or his next trick like i'm going to sit
27:06
in a box next time
27:07
exactly you know come up with that kind
27:10
of genius out of nowhere
27:12
awkward if he did lick the size and then
27:14
your tongue got stuck
27:17
just how long was he there 58 hours 58
27:20
hours just tongue stuck to the wall
27:22
everyone watching
27:29
okay it is time for fact number three
27:31
and that is
27:32
chozinski my fact this week is that
27:34
prehistoric babies
27:35
drank from animal-shaped sippy cups and
27:38
this is a recent discovery they've been
27:40
doing some archaeology or checking out
27:42
some sort of graves that were dug up a
27:44
while back and there are two
27:46
uh some iron age graves in germany and a
27:49
bronze age grave nearby and they both
27:51
turned up in children's graves in like
27:53
little toddlers and babies graves
27:55
um these vessels and they had spouts
27:58
basically
27:59
and they've looked at the proteins that
28:01
are in them and it showed that
28:03
they contained some kind of milk either
28:05
goat's milk or cow's milk or something
28:06
like that
28:07
and it's really interesting because we
28:09
didn't know that women weren't just
28:10
breastfeeding their children
28:12
exclusively at that age and it turns out
28:13
that they were obviously using
28:15
cow's milk and stuff but um they think
28:17
it might be the cause of a big baby boom
28:19
so the first baby boomers were
28:21
prehistoric and they happened basically
28:23
because
28:24
people stopped having to breastfeed
28:26
their children for so long so much
28:28
because they maybe had these sippy cups
28:29
and they shared childcare a bit more
28:31
because they'd settle down into group
28:32
communities
28:33
and so when they weren't breastfeeding
28:36
they then menstruated a lot more
28:37
and got pregnant a lot more had loads
28:39
more kids it's all about the cups
28:42
so it's a good news story it's a great
28:43
news story yeah
28:45
yeah and and just to clarify in the fact
28:47
similar vessels have been found that are
28:49
shaped like animals
28:50
in the same region so we now know that
28:51
these animal shaped cups
28:53
were used for babies yeah which makes
28:55
sense this is
28:56
what would i be writing saying it's not
28:57
just a good news story it's a sort of
28:59
seminal
29:00
human existence story right this is this
29:03
is a big moment in
29:04
how there was a big boom of life that
29:06
came off the back of it where suddenly
29:08
we were farming humans
29:10
basically i think what you mean by that
29:13
is we were
29:14
humans who farmed we were farming humans
29:16
or that we were
29:17
humans who were farming humans farmers
29:19
that were human farming humans
29:21
is what i mean because because suddenly
29:23
you could you could have
29:24
way more humans than you were capable of
29:27
with just one pair of people
29:28
they call it farming humans but oh i
29:30
definitely went too far
29:31
yeah um it was out there not a
29:33
cannibalism implication i think
29:36
what do you do i'm a human farmer um
29:39
but yeah collective parenting was a
29:41
thing realized like you had crashes
29:43
basically
29:44
and i think that it makes sense that you
29:46
would have had questions because they
29:47
were presumably going out into the
29:48
fields to work
29:49
and so you could leave one person to
29:51
babysit the kids while everyone else
29:52
went out to work um which yeah we didn't
29:55
know it's quite cool how they detected
29:56
the milk in the vessels as well
29:58
because it's essentially because they
30:00
had these cups but they weren't glazed
30:02
and so that means they've got like tiny
30:04
tiny little indentations in the surface
30:05
that you couldn't possibly see
30:07
but they happen to be the perfect size
30:09
these little pores
30:10
to fit fat molecules lipid molecules and
30:12
so
30:13
they've just filled in these little
30:14
indentations so we can just get them out
30:16
and go oh i have some milk that's
30:17
amazing
30:18
the the amount of technology you need to
30:20
be able to do that compared to the
30:21
amount of technology you have to have a
30:23
cup
30:23
yeah it's just it's so weird isn't it
30:26
yeah are you glowing
30:27
way better than those people no i don't
30:30
think so really because
30:31
those kind of technologies finding tiny
30:34
bits of lipids
30:36
is not going to cause a massive baby
30:37
boom is it you never know
30:41
maybe everyone will hear this go home
30:42
and shag tonight they might it was a
30:44
sexy fact
30:46
but yeah animal shaped cups have been a
30:48
thing throughout history actually for
30:50
adults and children
30:51
there was a harvard uh museum exhibit
30:53
last year which took them from
30:55
all over the world and it was like rams
30:57
and bulls and lions
30:58
and they came from ancient greece and
31:00
they came from persia
31:02
and yeah they would have like in greece
31:04
they would have a donkey-shaped cup
31:06
which i think had the spout at the back
31:08
end
31:08
so that it was the shape of a donkey's
31:10
head sorry sprout at the back end so
31:12
when you drank from the spout it looked
31:13
like you're wearing a donkey
31:15
mask on your face
31:19
um they used to have human head shaped
31:21
cups
31:22
as in they were actually made from human
31:24
hair
31:26
yeah quite around the world people have
31:29
drunk out of human skulls
31:31
but the oldest ones we have are from
31:32
somerset in england
31:34
oh really yeah we were the origins of
31:36
drinking out of human skulls
31:38
wow something to be proud of yeah that's
31:40
why my human farming
31:42
analogy has gone wrong lord byron had
31:45
one of those
31:46
did he yeah he was very proud of his uh
31:48
skull cup yeah
31:49
i think it was set in gold i think it
31:51
was just the top of her skull
31:53
you know it was the main bit and then he
31:54
had a proper handle on it a base
31:56
yeah because you couldn't get the face
31:57
in because then it's full of holes isn't
31:58
it it's going to come out the eyes yeah
32:00
yeah because i can only think of a skull
32:03
as being more like a saucer than
32:04
anything else i suppose
32:06
yeah but if you think about old cups
32:08
like what they have what do they have in
32:09
greased carrots is or whatever yeah
32:12
they're more like sauces aren't they
32:14
yeah that's true and you do have a very
32:15
flat head
32:16
actually so i can see well it's more of
32:18
a dinner plate yeah
32:20
there were on on greek uh
32:24
cups and receptacles and things like
32:25
that there were mixing bowls called
32:27
craft hairs
32:28
craters and um the greek poet eubulus
32:33
wrote that after three craters of wine
32:35
all the sensible guests
32:37
go home and he was describing what
32:39
happens next this is in a i think in a
32:40
national geographic with our parties
32:42
it's after three crates of wine
32:44
well he said that the fifth crater leads
32:46
to yelling the sixth to prancing about
32:48
and the seventh to black eyes the eighth
32:51
brings the police the ninth vomiting
32:52
the tenth insanity and hurling the
32:54
furniture
32:56
that's really good i reckon that's a
33:00
slightly different order to how we do it
33:02
now
33:02
it's essentially the same we've just
33:04
slightly evolved to tweak it i think
33:05
vomiting actually comes
33:07
before black eyes now and i think police
33:09
comes last yeah exactly
33:10
unless they've got involved because
33:12
there's at least two more sessions there
33:14
yeah because
33:15
you know you wouldn't get the police
33:16
just for yelling or for prancing about
33:19
maybe for black eyes but insanity and
33:20
hurling the furniture is a definite
33:22
public order offense
33:23
yeah yeah yeah you're right and as you
33:25
say once the police have come
33:26
the party's shut down it's with so in
33:28
fact under what circumstances the police
33:30
come
33:30
and then leave and then the furniture
33:32
hurling happens
33:34
terrible police forces in the persian
33:37
empire they
33:38
had like cool fun-shaped cups and if you
33:40
throw a banquet if they came through a
33:42
banquet or something then everyone would
33:43
get a different animal-shaped cup i need
33:45
to get home at the end of the night
33:46
like a party bag that's really awesome
33:48
it's good isn't it yeah but
33:49
quite it's quite an expensive habit did
33:51
you say it was the king of persia doing
33:53
it
33:53
yeah so here you could just
33:58
i've got some stuff on um children
34:00
looking after children and feeding
34:02
children
34:02
yeah yeah i do too yeah um so the first
34:05
infant formula like a powdered food for
34:08
babies was invented by a guy called
34:10
justice von liebig
34:12
in 1865 and he is also the man
34:15
who basically invented oxo cubes and
34:18
marmite
34:19
wow isn't that cool he's amazing feeding
34:22
babies
34:22
oh so these are two separate processes
34:25
that he came up with but he came up with
34:26
loads of processes so
34:28
one of them was getting cow's milk wheat
34:30
malt flour and potassium bicarbonate and
34:32
then mixed them together so it became
34:33
like a
34:34
powder with um milk in it and then the
34:37
other thing was a way of getting beef
34:39
extracts out of beef
34:41
and so you could get you could squeeze
34:43
this beef so much that it was a really
34:44
concentrated bit of beef and then that
34:46
became basically bothering that oxel
34:48
cubes and
34:49
this guy no one's heard of him but he's
34:50
done so many like
34:52
sorry is that so marmite is just sort of
34:54
like someone's taking a steak and
34:55
they've squeezed out like a sponge
34:57
no marmite is more yeast-based but it's
35:00
the same process cool
35:02
so you take some yeast and you squeeze
35:03
it yeah yeah ring it out but was what
35:06
i thought was the baby food that was
35:08
beef related
35:10
i think babies did get given there was
35:13
a thing called was it pap or panada oh
35:16
pap is like
35:17
um bread and milk isn't it i think it's
35:19
just bread and milk mixed or something
35:20
i think it covers a few different things
35:21
so it could be milk and flour or melted
35:24
butter and then sometimes
35:25
children would just fed a kind of meaty
35:27
broth i think no one really knew what
35:28
came after milk for a long time
35:31
people just experimented with different
35:32
stuff yeah like meaty broth
35:34
yeah it's good it's it must be
35:36
nourishing because it's meat
35:37
you know yeah i was reading that in the
35:39
1700s in paris
35:42
not many people actually breastfed their
35:43
own children they it was a big thing of
35:46
outsourcing wetness for wet nurses oh
35:48
yeah so there was a survey that was
35:49
conducted by the police chief of paris
35:51
in 1780
35:53
another creepy policeman he'd been
35:56
promoted at knickers
36:01
the survey revealed that of the 21 000
36:04
children that were born annually in the
36:06
city
36:07
17 000 were sent to the countryside to a
36:10
wet nurse
36:10
wow that's a huge amount and then it was
36:12
a condition that if you were sending
36:14
your kid to a wetness and you had the
36:15
money you would pay them to exclusively
36:18
breastfeed and look after
36:19
your kid but these wet nurses had kids
36:21
so they had to outsource their kids to
36:23
poorer people out in the country yeah
36:25
so there was a there was a lower rung of
36:27
wet nurses who were the sort of more
36:30
yeah for the poverty stricken yeah so
36:32
kids were just being pushed further and
36:34
further into the country of france
36:36
to suck on a boot it was so i had no
36:39
idea it was so
36:40
widespread yeah 90 of people were not
36:43
breastfed by their own
36:44
mother and also you have this image of
36:46
wet nurses as being for a rich family
36:48
and you know you pay for the wetness but
36:49
largely especially when people started
36:51
industrializing
36:52
it was for poor families and it was for
36:54
people going and working in factories
36:56
and then you know nothing you could do
36:57
with your kid
36:59
it's a rough gig though they were very
37:00
looked down on the wet nurses
37:02
were they yeah it seems very unfair
37:04
because women would
37:05
probably pick up they're doing an
37:06
important job it's a really important
37:08
job and if you've insisted that you
37:10
latch your own baby onto another woman's
37:12
tit then teeth teeth well either
37:16
teeth synonyms yeah the least you can do
37:19
is show some gratitude i think you're
37:20
absolutely right thank you
37:23
i was looking at weaning and
37:24
breastfeeding and things like this i
37:25
didn't know that um
37:27
and there was a big study of this in the
37:29
1950s by a scientist called ian wicks
37:31
and he found that renaissance europeans
37:33
had fed their infants with a cow's horn
37:35
with a leather nipple attached to it
37:37
which is a pretty cool way of being fed
37:40
yeah yeah i mean i think also in europe
37:43
around that time they were going
37:44
directly from the cow weren't they
37:45
like you would just attach your child to
37:47
a cow or a goat or something yeah goats
37:50
they used to have goats and orphanages
37:51
got so the moulin rouge might have had
37:53
the goat out during the matinee
37:54
performance for kids
37:57
the goat would just go around the
37:59
audience it's like a shot girl yeah
38:07
okay it is time for our final fact of
38:09
the show and that is my fact
38:11
my fact this week is that the reason
38:13
movies include
38:14
that all persons fictitious disclaimer
38:16
at the front
38:17
is because one of rasputin's assassins
38:19
successfully sued
38:21
mgm for not accurately depicting the
38:23
events
38:24
of rasputin's murder what
38:27
yeah i mean that is what's amazing about
38:29
this fight i think is rasputin feels
38:32
to me or felt to me like about 500 years
38:34
ago
38:35
yeah and movies like moulin rouge was so
38:38
recent yeah
38:38
i think they feel like a modern day
38:40
thing but they're connected they're
38:42
connected it feels
38:43
it feels insane that such a historical
38:45
event is yeah
38:46
has so when was the move so rasputin
38:48
died in what 1916
38:51
believe it was 1916 the movie came out
38:53
in 1933.
38:54
that's a relatively early movie it's an
38:57
oldie
38:58
it's in the first 20 isn't it yeah oh
39:01
yeah yeah yeah yeah
39:02
it wasn't the first 20 no no no it's the
39:05
second 20
39:06
but i think within the first half oh
39:09
certainly the first time
39:10
oh yeah depending on when you're
39:12
listening to this podcast actually
39:17
sorry dad so prince felix isopov he was
39:20
a russian
39:21
aristocrat and he was one of the people
39:23
who helped to kill
39:25
rasputin he didn't get in that much
39:27
trouble other than be
39:28
to be exiled from the country so it was
39:30
while he was exiled and he was living
39:32
with his wife
39:33
that this movie came out which was based
39:35
on a few biographies and so on called
39:37
rasputin and the empress
39:39
so in it they name him differently but
39:41
it's clearly him who they
39:43
are depicting and he wanted to sue them
39:45
because he thought oh you're depicting
39:47
me really badly obviously he couldn't he
39:49
was an assassin he was a guy who killed
39:51
the lead character
39:52
in the movie so what he had to do was
39:54
sue them via his wife because in the
39:56
movie they
39:57
create a scene deliberately falsified
39:59
where joseph's wife
40:01
is raped by rasputin after being
40:03
hypnotized
40:04
and that never happened in real life so
40:06
she ends up suing them
40:07
for a lot of money they lose the case
40:09
and mgm is part of the court case
40:12
and part of losing it generally they
40:14
have to put this on the front of movies
40:15
which
40:16
all other movie houses do as well to
40:18
avoid being sued by real life characters
40:20
in movies
40:21
it's astonishing yeah you know um this
40:23
country the bbc
40:24
documentary it's not a documentary it's
40:26
kind of a pseudo-documentary comedy
40:28
about these
40:29
this brother and sister couple who live
40:31
in this really
40:32
rubbish bit of the country their lives
40:33
are horrible they have a grim time
40:35
anyway they forgot to rename their
40:37
teacher
40:39
so they gave the character in this the
40:42
same name as their teacher and now
40:43
everyone
40:44
shouts at the teacher in school and it's
40:46
apparently ruined his life yeah i'm not
40:47
surprised
40:48
she recently apologized from an award
40:50
ceremony saying yeah sorry but yeah
40:51
ruined his life whoops
40:53
what's up sorry not that sorry check out
40:55
my trophy that basically wasn't what she
40:56
was
40:58
they used to have that thing called the
40:59
small penis defense do you remember that
41:01
and the idea is you put someone in your
41:03
book and you make it so it's obviously
41:05
them
41:06
but you say this character has a small
41:07
penis and then when you go to court you
41:10
could say well it's obviously not this
41:11
person because my character has a very
41:13
small penis
41:16
it doesn't feel like a crowbar in
41:18
certain novels when you know
41:20
when it popped up in pride and prejudice
41:21
midway through i was extremely surprised
41:23
in harry potter a tiny wand
41:28
well one person who didn't have a very
41:29
small penis was rasputin
41:31
very nice well allegedly he didn't have
41:33
a very small penis yeah well some people
41:35
said he did about one doctor's report
41:37
from 1912 or 13 said he had completely
41:39
shriveled testicles
41:40
really that's completely different it's
41:42
literally a different ball game
41:46
i think you just assume if they've said
41:47
triple testicles perhaps you assume that
41:49
the other the other part is shriveled as
41:51
well but you're right it doesn't
41:52
because you would have referenced that
41:54
you're right and perhaps the testicles
41:55
just look shriveled because the remember
41:57
was so enormous
41:58
you're absolutely right he's a
42:00
compliment in disguise his penis is in
42:02
various different museums in russia
42:03
apparently paulina was telling me my
42:05
wife was telling me really
42:06
yeah there's lots of different like
42:07
small towns with their own little
42:09
museums and lots of different ones have
42:11
his penis oh okay so he's basically
42:13
things that aren't his penis yeah
42:16
that they were able to actually chop a
42:18
healthy chunk out for each
42:20
that's what i thought you meant should
42:22
we say who he was that's beautiful yeah
42:24
yeah
42:24
so he's a guy from that song yeah that's
42:26
right sort of
42:28
monk believed to be a mystic who had
42:31
this
42:31
weird relationship with the last tsars
42:34
of russia
42:34
nicholas ii and his wife and their son
42:37
and could allegedly cure their son's
42:39
hemophilia
42:40
yeah and and was eventually opt for have
42:42
you know
42:43
this very dodgy influence he seemed to
42:45
have over the whole court and over the
42:46
tsar yeah also
42:48
he had had a phone call earlier that day
42:49
rescued him with a death threat
42:51
you don't think of rasputin receiving
42:52
phone calls do you he loved
42:54
the phone did he i think of him with
42:55
phone calls because that was famously
42:57
how he used to
42:58
cure um the zara oh yeah yeah but
43:01
he loved phone calls he and his daughter
43:03
used to make nuisance phone calls all
43:05
the time
43:06
where she used to do dirty voices to the
43:09
men who would answer the phone
43:10
and whenever he ever was on the phone he
43:12
would always do squats twirls and stumps
43:14
while he was on the phone he'd always
43:16
dance around while he was on the phone
43:17
whoa oh that's great and just to add as
43:21
you just said earlier
43:22
the circumstances of his death which
43:24
have now been debunked
43:25
and you talked about the cyanide but
43:27
just to give the full story of
43:29
yeah of how he died um the story goes of
43:32
the myth
43:32
uh is that he was fed enough cyanide to
43:35
kill him several times over
43:36
he was beaten severely with clubs he was
43:39
then shot
43:40
he was then stabbed repeatedly he was
43:42
then shot twice
43:43
more but after that when he should have
43:45
been dead he got up to strangle his
43:46
attackers and they eventually threw him
43:48
in a river rolled up in a carpet
43:50
yeah that's how he was not only that
43:52
when his body and i think this was the
43:53
case when his body resurfaced a few days
43:55
later
43:55
his lungs were full of water which
43:58
showed that when he was
43:59
landed in the river he was still alive
44:00
and breathing in the water i think
44:02
it was the carpet that did it and the uh
44:06
sorry
44:06
are we gonna say what actually happened
44:08
like well yeah
44:09
well yeah but just the account of the
44:11
poison name because this is all he used
44:12
to possibly count as well so when he
44:14
arrived they gave him loads of cakes
44:15
which were poisoned with potassium
44:17
cyanide
44:17
it had no effect so they gave him a
44:19
glass of wine laced with potassium
44:21
cyanide
44:22
that had no effect then they gave him a
44:23
second glass of wine laced with
44:24
potassium cyanide and they said
44:26
are you feeling unwell and he said yes
44:28
my head is heavy and i have a burning
44:29
sensation in my stomach so they thought
44:31
great we're well on the way
44:32
so they gave him a third glass of wine
44:33
laced with potassium cyanide at which
44:35
point he perked up and said oh thank you
44:36
i'm feeling much better after that
44:40
then the police were cold then the black
44:42
eyes
44:44
at this point they've run out of
44:45
potassium they're really wondering what
44:47
to do next
44:48
but there are all these theories about
44:49
why the poison didn't work one is that
44:51
they just had old poison
44:53
um one is that he was given sugar like
44:56
it was cakes and wine given to him and
44:58
that binds with
44:59
the active ingredient which makes it
45:00
much less poisonous
45:02
and then there's another theory that
45:03
yusuf made up all of this and actually
45:05
they shot him and threw him in the river
45:06
i think yeah
45:07
that's the one that we kind of think
45:08
about because they um there was a
45:10
confession by one of the conspirators
45:12
later on who said no we didn't poison
45:13
him at all
45:14
yeah just shot him but it it fed the
45:17
myth didn't it of this crazy
45:18
involvement who was sinister and has
45:21
some weird malign influence over the
45:23
tsar
45:23
and sort of really sordid and it's
45:26
really difficult reading about rasputin
45:27
now because we know that he was such a
45:29
victim of propaganda of his time so
45:31
all the first-hand accounts about how
45:33
sex crazed he was this
45:35
weird nymphomaniac guy um we don't
45:38
know i mean i think there's a new
45:40
biography that francis
45:41
welch wrote i think but even then i
45:43
think at the time
45:45
there was such a hardcore propaganda
45:47
drive against rasputin should we not
45:49
just go with the rumors though because
45:50
it's going to be funnier
45:51
yeah like should we not just say that
45:54
the reason the women of saint petersburg
45:56
loved having sex with him so much is he
45:57
had enormous water his penis
45:59
that whenever he had sex with them they
46:01
got an immediate orgasm should we not
46:02
say that kind of thing
46:03
we can say it we can't say it i'm going
46:05
to kill everything you said
46:09
actually james have you actually seen
46:10
this war yourself
46:12
there you can have it like various
46:14
things are not true like he did not get
46:15
out his willy in a restaurant and wave
46:17
it around to prove that he was rasputin
46:22
i've never heard that one actually so
46:23
this was in 1915 this is shortly before
46:26
he died you know he was under
46:27
observation by the police and he goes to
46:28
a restaurant with a group of followers
46:30
and starts bragging about his
46:31
relationship with the tsar's wife and
46:33
implying that he's slept with the tsar's
46:35
wife and someone asks him are you really
46:37
rasputin
46:38
and he replies by getting his penis out
46:40
saying
46:41
this is what rasputin does therefore i
46:43
must be rasputin
46:45
but it's a bad proof because it's him
46:47
saying look if i wasn't rasputin would i
46:49
really be getting my knob out in a
46:50
restaurant yeah who is the president we
46:52
spoke about that did that as well
46:53
lyndon johnson liked to get his penis
46:56
but he did it in response to journalists
46:58
didn't he
46:59
yeah i think so it's not a good way of
47:01
proving it because it's such an easy
47:02
trick to imitate
47:04
it's true but you've got to have the big
47:05
penis to do it i'm the massive what
47:07
it's so hard to tell from the other side
47:09
of the restaurant
47:11
equally hard to enjoy your meal
47:13
afterwards can you imagine lyndon
47:14
johnson on the andrew marsh show
47:16
on a sunday morning well i'll tell you
47:19
this much andrew
47:23
anyway he didn't do that was a myth
47:25
about the restaurant yeah
47:26
but he did there were all these rumors
47:28
about his genitals and people kept on
47:29
wanting to pull them off
47:31
i think maybe the two are related though
47:33
i don't know but
47:34
there was a monk called iliador who
47:36
first of all he claimed that he'd got
47:38
120 bombs
47:40
that he was going to use to kill
47:41
rasputin and then by some course of
47:42
events he apparently lost these bombs
47:44
and ended up chasing after him with an
47:45
axe and telling him he was going to
47:46
castrate him
47:47
i don't know what happened to the 120
47:49
there there was another holy man who was
47:51
called
47:52
blessed mithia who ended up punching
47:54
rasputin in the face and then trying to
47:55
pull off his testicles
47:57
manually yeah there was a bishop called
48:00
hermigon
48:00
who grabbed rasputin's penis screamed
48:03
that he was the antichrist and proceeded
48:04
to beat him with a huge crucifix
48:08
do you know if you almost got the gig
48:10
before rasputin
48:11
uh which what do you mean the gig so the
48:13
gig was basically the countess
48:15
sar she she was a spiritual advisor yeah
48:18
spiritual advisor she was very into
48:20
um so it must be someone we've heard of
48:22
it is definitely someone we've heard of
48:23
george bernard shaw
48:26
no it's a great guest lovely guest yeah
48:29
lovely guest but no
48:30
harry houdini harry houdini
48:33
oh my god what a guess that's an
48:34
incredible guess what yeah
48:36
harry houdini was over doing shows there
48:38
and they met up and
48:39
there's that famous thing of arthur
48:41
conan doyle not believing that harry
48:43
houdini wasn't really magic
48:44
same thing with the tsar and the
48:46
countess they thought he was genuinely
48:48
doing wow magic tricks offered him the
48:50
wrong alternative universe
48:52
yeah harry houdini is rasputin yeah he
48:55
probably could have got out of the river
48:56
that's the terrible
48:57
time yeah what roll me up in a carpet
49:02
no problem
49:05
that's insane yeah and he and he was he
49:08
was i read this in a harry houdini book
49:10
um he was offered the role afterwards as
49:12
well so we've lost our
49:13
advisor i don't know if you saw the
49:14
papers but we're looking for someone new
49:16
and houdini was asked once again if
49:19
you'd said no
49:19
the first time i think that second time
49:22
if you had read the papers it would be a
49:24
pretty hard note
49:26
yeah that's true do you know why they
49:28
think rasputin was so
49:30
efficacious in curing azar's hemophilia
49:32
right yeah
49:33
so hemophilia is a disease where your
49:34
blood is very thin and if
49:36
if you cut yourself accidentally you
49:37
don't stop bleeding for a very long time
49:40
so very very dangerous
49:41
it's possible that rasputin just
49:45
said uh in his kind of holy mystic way
49:48
chuck away all the medicine you've been
49:49
given i'm going to be looking after you
49:51
and it's possible that some of the
49:52
medicine was
49:53
aspirin oh really an aspirin
49:56
yeah so
49:59
it may be that there was a grain of
50:01
truth in rasputin's
50:03
advice but not for the reason obviously
50:06
that he was
50:07
uh mystical just like that that's cool
50:09
also there's a thought that maybe when
50:11
he was hypnotizing over the phone
50:12
handsomeness in person
50:14
it has a relaxing effect which it does
50:15
like meditating and then if that lowers
50:17
your blood pressure
50:18
and lowers your heart rate then you're
50:20
going to bleed less so it helps
50:21
dissipate it
50:22
in that way interesting yeah but you
50:24
know conventional medicine is probably
50:25
advisable these days
50:30
we were talking earlier about maria
50:31
rasputin his daughter in the phone calls
50:33
um
50:34
so after this happened she moved away
50:36
and became a lion tamer
50:38
in the circus yeah she did that was one
50:41
of her jobs
50:41
um she was also a dancer in paris um
50:45
in the beginning of the 1900s
50:49
unfortunately i've not seen if it was
50:51
there um but
50:52
yeah so that's what she that's what she
50:54
did wait a minute rasputin
50:56
everyone said he smelt like a goat yes
50:58
didn't they they did
50:59
like that was one of his things he never
51:01
washed he once didn't change his
51:02
underwear for six months
51:03
yeah everyone who met him said he smelt
51:05
like a goat who was with lagulu so
51:08
you're saying maybe
51:08
she maria aspirin was the goat no i'm
51:11
saying
51:11
rasputin the elder was disguised he was
51:15
disguised as a guy
51:16
they never pulled him out of the river
51:17
at all exactly he and that goat was just
51:20
rasputin in a carpet
51:22
huge it's such a fall from grace isn't
51:24
it
51:25
this actually makes me ending up
51:27
entertaining the children at the sunday
51:28
matinee
51:31
does anyone here have hemophilia put it
51:34

hello and welcome to another episode of
01:06
no such thing as a fish
01:08
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:09
qi offices in covent garden
01:12
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
01:13
here with anna chazinski
01:15
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
01:17
and once again we have gathered round
01:19
the microphones with our four
01:20
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:22
and in no particular order
01:24
here we go starting with you
01:27
james i thought it was one of you guys
01:30
first
01:32
my fact this week is that the us navy's
01:35
doomsday aircraft which was designed to
01:38
survive a nuclear attack
01:40
was recently taken out by a single bird
01:42
[Music]
01:44
okay this was in the news a few people
01:47
might have seen it
01:48
the us navy called it a class a mishap
01:53
that feels like something that would be
01:54
in a pg woodhouse novel
01:56
i'll tell you what jeeves this is a
01:57
class a mishap we've just had
01:59
uh it was the e6b mercury it's a boeing
02:03
707 uh which
02:05
supposedly if there is a nuclear bomb
02:07
that goes off nearby it's supposed to be
02:09
okay
02:10
um but actually a bird got into its
02:12
engine and it had to make an emergency
02:14
stop
02:14
and the engine had to be replaced and it
02:17
cost him about two million dollars
02:19
oh wow that is a class
02:23
and so i was really curious about this
02:24
plane because it's sort of
02:26
it's like the less fancy but tougher
02:28
brother of air force one basically
02:30
yeah although airfs1 is anything that
02:32
the president's on of course yes
02:34
but the particular air force one that we
02:36
know about yeah is this
02:37
it's a suits up version of this one yeah
02:39
there's it's all nuclear command centers
02:41
as opposed to nice
02:43
beds and desks and cool press rooms and
02:45
things like that
02:46
but i wonder because i read this i
02:49
couldn't believe that it could survive a
02:50
nuclear attack
02:51
and they say it can survive nuclear
02:52
attack but i just wonder how close
02:54
it can be to a nuclear attack because if
02:56
you drop a nuclear bomb on it it would
02:58
yeah yeah in many ways you know most of
03:01
the people in the world could survive a
03:03
nuclear attack
03:04
uh depending on where the bomb is
03:06
dropped yeah that's absolutely true if
03:08
the bombs dropped in australia i reckon
03:09
i'll be okay
03:10
if they said it was they said they've
03:12
got all sorts of
03:13
i read they had mesh to prevent
03:14
radiation and other things yeah
03:16
you know and also it's strong enough to
03:18
survive the pulses of electromagnetic
03:21
energy that come from a nuclear bomb
03:23
okay presumably like you say not if it
03:25
lands on the nose yeah
03:27
i do see what you mean by that maybe
03:28
it's because it can only fly bleed for
03:30
about 10 hours 10 hours worth of fuel
03:32
um so maybe it has to make a landing in
03:34
an area that's been recently bombed and
03:36
all this meshing and stuff
03:37
means that you would survive on the
03:39
inside and not be
03:41
turned into radioactive spider
03:44
i lost my thread at the end there no you
03:47
couldn't tell
03:49
they are very cool yeah do we know what
03:51
kind of bird it was
03:52
was it at least a big bird we don't know
03:54
what kind of it wasn't big bird from
03:56
sesame street if that's what you're
03:57
thinking
03:57
thank god famously can't fly um we don't
04:00
know what kind of bird it is although
04:02
they have lots of labs in america who
04:04
can find this kind of thing out they
04:06
they like to scrape bits of bird off
04:08
airplanes don't they and work out
04:10
what's yeah using the dna they'll do it
04:13
and you just send in there's a thing
04:15
called um
04:16
if you have a bird strike on your plane
04:18
it's called snarge so there's yeah
04:20
that's right
04:21
and i wanted to know where this word
04:22
came from did anyone find out no
04:24
okay as far as i can see it comes from
04:25
the smithsonian institutions feather
04:27
identification laboratory
04:29
and i think just the lab scientists have
04:31
just called it snarge and
04:32
it feels like it might be an acronym or
04:34
something but i don't really know
04:36
and when they first came up with it one
04:37
of the other words or phrases they used
04:39
was bird ick
04:40
snorlage is quite onomatopoeic i imagine
04:42
they just sort of thought all this
04:44
sound sort of tells you that it's gooey
04:48
yeah maybe yeah
04:51
and in this lab they will test things
04:54
and work out exactly what will happen
04:55
when any bird hits any aircraft
04:57
and they have invented the bird
04:59
avoidance model
05:00
or bam nice
05:04
very cool um this isn't the only bird
05:06
strike that hit a military plane this
05:08
year
05:09
with scary consequences yeah so earlier
05:10
this year an air force a-10
05:12
was flying through america over florida
05:15
and um
05:16
it got hit by a bird as well hit the
05:18
engine but as a result of being hit by
05:20
the birds something in the plane
05:21
malfunctioned and it ended up dropping
05:23
three dummy rounds basically three
05:25
massive bombs
05:26
but they weren't charged over florida
05:29
and landed
05:30
in florida and i mean it was just so
05:32
lucky that they were fake bombs
05:34
because otherwise america would have
05:35
just bombed its citizens but then i read
05:37
that story and i think if you'd gone up
05:39
to it and started prodding it with a
05:40
stick you could have got injured you
05:41
want people not to go near it
05:43
exactly they're still slightly charged
05:44
yeah they're like this is completely
05:46
harmless it's just a dummy bomb but also
05:48
please do not handle it under any
05:50
circumstances
05:51
so if you and i don't know if they've
05:52
found them so if you are in florida and
05:54
you see i think they're about 25 pounds
05:55
so they are quite they're not
05:56
huge but yeah well they they said where
06:00
it is
06:00
roughly they said they're in the general
06:03
vicinity of two kilometers west of
06:05
highway one two
06:06
nine at a particular location but that's
06:08
quite a big
06:09
margin of error i would say yeah yeah um
06:12
can we just say one more thing about
06:13
these
06:13
weird planes yes so they're called the
06:16
national airborne operations centers
06:18
and these are the ones i don't know if
06:20
you guys remember but we spoke
06:21
i mentioned them a while ago and you
06:23
guys did not believe the fact i said
06:26
but these are the ones which have
06:28
antennas which are five miles long
06:30
oh yeah yeah
06:34
yeah like a long kite string basically
06:36
it's like a tail it's like the plane's
06:38
tail
06:38
except planes already have tails so it's
06:40
like a second tail it's like a second
06:41
tail yeah and it's so it can communicate
06:43
with submarines underwater because they
06:47
need extremely long waves yeah
06:48
exactly so the point of the planes is
06:51
that they tie everything together so
06:52
they tie together
06:54
the bombers which have got nuclear
06:56
weapons on them they tied together the
06:57
submarines which got nuclear warheads
06:59
and the you know the ballistic missiles
07:01
in their silos they can communicate with
07:03
all of those
07:04
and basically coordinate a nuclear
07:06
attack if
07:08
america wants to make one or if it's
07:09
been attacked they want to retaliate
07:11
what's amazing about these planes is
07:12
that
07:13
they have a crew basically on standby
07:15
waiting for doomsday
07:16
they're just they're there maintaining
07:18
the plane while the other three are
07:20
getting prepared for their next round so
07:22
they they sort of swap
07:23
spots as the ready plane so you come on
07:25
your new shift and you go all right jeff
07:27
was it doomsday on your ship
07:28
yeah no it wasn't doomsday on my shift
07:30
all right okay we'll see you after see
07:31
you in eight hours one day
07:34
yeah um bird strikes though kind of a
07:36
big problem or a big
07:37
thing that you know aircraft designers
07:39
have to address and the first bird
07:41
strike is cited as being
07:43
wilbur wright of wright brothers fame
07:45
and no way
07:46
yeah and it was in 1905 and it really
07:50
raises my problem with the term bird
07:52
strike because it always gives too much
07:53
agency to the birds
07:54
and so in this case it was 1905 so it
07:57
was only a couple of years after the
07:58
first ever powered flight and
08:00
wilbur wright was um poodling about in
08:02
his plane and he
08:04
wrote in his diary i twice passed over
08:05
the fences into
08:07
this bloke's cornfield and i chased
08:09
flocks of birds
08:10
on two rounds and i managed to kill one
08:14
in in his engine which then fell on top
08:16
of the surface of the wing
08:17
and fell off when he did a sharp curve
08:19
so basically he'd chase and harass lots
08:20
of birds until he smashed into one
08:22
and then he dumped it off his wing and
08:24
that's not a bird striking
08:26
you know it's a plane strike it's a
08:27
plane strike yeah i think that's what
08:29
they should be called
08:30
do you but then what if anything else
08:32
hits the plane or it should be called
08:34
bird receipt
08:36
well have you heard about the other kind
08:38
of receipts that they have they have
08:40
frog receipts they have turtle receipts
08:42
they have snake crystals how high are
08:43
those frogs jumping it's amazing right
08:45
so um according to these people who work
08:48
at smithsonian
08:49
um they get because things get carried
08:51
up by the jet stream
08:53
often animals other than birds get hit
08:54
by these planes
08:56
and they quite recently got a rabbit
08:58
that got hit by
08:59
a plane no oh yeah so rabbit receipt
09:04
sorry how does the rubber get into the
09:05
air it's pulled up by the by the jet
09:13
it sounds it sounds unlikely doesn't it
09:15
but this was actually in a smithsonian
09:17
you guys believe this and you don't
09:18
believe a plane could have a long
09:19
antenna i'm just trying to explore this
09:21
a bit i think
09:22
so a lot of the animal animal sucks um
09:24
because they are they are not called
09:26
bird strike actually by people in april
09:28
animals they should be they're called
09:32
wildlife strikes because of the variety
09:34
but the other ones who aren't birds seem
09:35
to be mostly on runways so in florida
09:37
they have a bit of a crocodile problem
09:39
where i think one crocodile did actually
09:41
jump up and hit the wing of a plane
09:43
crocodile it flipped itself up to the
09:46
level of the plane apparently
09:48
wow the thing that happens in florida
09:49
occasionally i mean there was one
09:51
i know what you're saying often on there
09:53
but and this person who works at the
09:55
smithsonian
09:55
institution feather identification
09:57
laboratory said that they
09:59
had a cat that was hit um at high
10:02
altitude
10:03
wow so such a shame only eight lives
10:06
left for that
10:07
could have been on the back of a
10:08
broomstick could have been who knows who
10:11
knows how it got there
10:12
on the early airstrikes thing have you
10:15
seen this amazing
10:16
portrait of eugene gilbert who is a
10:19
french pilot
10:20
and in 1911 he was flying from paris to
10:23
madrid
10:23
so very early exciting air race and
10:26
he was flying over the pyrenees
10:28
mountains and he got tangled up with an
10:30
eagle
10:30
there was a mother eagle which flew down
10:32
and attacked him basically because she
10:34
was very protective of her
10:36
uh area and he started firing his pistol
10:39
at it from inside the cockpit of this
10:41
what must have been a biplane i think
10:42
not to wound just to
10:44
scare it to scare it off yeah but
10:46
someone who should have thrown a cat at
10:48
it
10:48
you should but someone has painted a
10:51
portrait of this happening and it's an
10:52
incredibly epic picture
10:54
wow that's amazing yeah um we should say
10:56
it's really really rare as well oh yeah
10:58
so i think the amazing stat is that
11:02
since 1912 there have been 250 deaths
11:04
from bird strikes due to all flights
11:07
ever so it's incredibly unlikely but
11:10
obviously still it's quite important to
11:11
avoid them
11:12
and the testing we have we mentioned the
11:14
checking gun before i don't think we
11:15
have we have
11:16
wow there used to be experiments on
11:19
plane engines in the testing phase where
11:21
you would fire a bird from a gas cannon
11:23
into the engine and see what happened
11:26
basically
11:27
and they've now replaced it boo um with
11:30
a
11:31
with a block of gelatin which is the
11:33
same density
11:34
as for example a chicken chicken's a bad
11:37
example because they're flightless
11:38
they're probably not going to end up in
11:39
the engines but
11:40
yeah yeah but they i think um
11:43
easy to get though easier to pick up
11:45
very true yeah and they used to put
11:47
frozen ones in didn't they because
11:48
and one theory was that well there are a
11:51
few reasons you might do that one might
11:52
be because a frozen one would be
11:54
basically as hard as a bird can be
11:56
you're not gonna get a harder bird than
11:58
a frozen chicken
11:58
you might as well then just do it with a
12:00
rock using a frozen chicken
12:02
well one of the reason is because they
12:04
thought that if a bird was flying in and
12:06
it was about to get hit it might tense
12:08
all of its muscles because it thought it
12:09
was going to get hit
12:10
and that would be similar to chicken
12:12
yeah that seems
12:13
that's exactly what you would do is
12:14
that's what i would do yeah it is a
12:16
stressful
12:17
situation to be in yeah you wouldn't
12:19
relax and go floppy
12:21
even if you knew that was what you're
12:22
supposed to do to increase your chances
12:24
of
12:24
survival apparently these days most of
12:28
the testing is by computer simulation
12:30
that makes more sense it is it does
12:31
makes more sense but for me it's not
12:32
good enough
12:33
no no i want to be flying on a plane
12:35
that's had a chicken fired at it
12:37
um do you know what it is that kills the
12:38
plane um uh i would have thought it hits
12:41
the engine
12:42
and then it snarges all up and then
12:45
it can't spin round it gets really hot
12:47
and it sets on fire
12:48
can i just quickly say excellent use of
12:50
snarge
12:52
i don't think snarj is a verb is it that
12:55
i think it's any kind of word yeah yeah
12:57
right fair enough
12:58
does it accidentally make one blade
13:00
smash into another blade
13:01
and then that causes all the it
13:02
basically it bends one blade in the
13:04
engine so his and so what they're trying
13:06
to do when they throw the chickens at it
13:08
is make sure that the blades can
13:09
withstand the chicken blow without
13:10
bending because as soon as one bends
13:12
then the engine stalls
13:13
but the worst thing that can happen is
13:15
if it hits or if something hits one of
13:17
the fan blades in the engine
13:18
or if there's just a bit of wear and
13:20
tear and they snap which does happen
13:21
every few years
13:22
and that's the main plane sort of hazard
13:25
that they're trying to test against
13:27
because if one fan blade snaps
13:29
then it turns into kind of shrapnel so
13:31
it's spinning around really really fast
13:32
it's inside the engine
13:33
turns into shrapnel then it flies
13:34
through the engine so it breaks the
13:36
whole engine down
13:37
and so they have to do these like most
13:40
of the money goes into doing these crazy
13:41
tests where they have these fans so like
13:44
pictures of a ceiling fan
13:46
um
13:55
you're not a plane spotter you're just a
13:57
plain fan spotter
13:59
each blade costs about the same as like
14:01
a luxury car about 50 grand so each
14:03
fan is worth about nine million dollars
14:05
because they're really
14:06
special shapes and they have to be an
14:08
incredibly special light but strong
14:10
material
14:11
and then they have to throw stuff at
14:13
them or explode them
14:14
to see if they can still function with
14:16
them exploded
14:18
um i've got a couple land-based bird
14:20
strikes okay um
14:21
non-plane related uh so do you know the
14:24
um the le monde car race i do
14:26
uh the town of lemon is twinned with
14:29
bolton is it yeah
14:30
that's cool um so in 1953 the winner was
14:33
a guy called duncan hamilton i believe
14:35
his name was
14:36
um and duncan hamilton won it despite
14:38
being absolutely pissed off his face he
14:40
was so drunk
14:41
he and his buddy had done a practice
14:43
circuit uh before the race
14:45
but and this is a bit confusing but they
14:47
had the same plates as another car that
14:49
was on there which apparently is illegal
14:50
and so they got disqualified from the
14:52
race so they thought well we're on
14:53
holiday
14:54
let's just go to the bar got absolutely
14:55
tanked and then
14:57
the guy who was the manager of the
14:59
jaguar team who they raced for called
15:01
lofty england
15:02
[Laughter]
15:05
he should be the head of the brexit
15:06
party
15:08
he persuaded the organizers to let them
15:10
both race but they were completely
15:11
smashed but they did it anyway and in
15:13
between the pit stops they were
15:14
desperately trying to sober up hamilton
15:16
with coffee so sort of
15:17
change your wheels and give you a drink
15:19
and this is a 24 hour race
15:21
it's one of the most long hard enduring
15:24
races
15:24
um but halfway through the race um or
15:27
not halfway but along the race
15:28
um a bird flew into his face at 130
15:32
miles an hour
15:34
but they think because he was so wasted
15:36
he kind of shrugged off the pain of it
15:38
and managed to continue
15:39
and one they won the race despite being
15:41
smashed in the face
15:42
that would take your face on the boat if
15:45
it was a wreck
15:46
um yeah albatross yeah yeah
15:51
i mean there was a thing fabio
15:54
who is fabio is a male model uh he
15:56
appears on romance books he was in the i
15:58
can't believe it's not butter ads
16:00
it's weird that you expected us to know
16:01
that but if i'd had to guess i would
16:02
have said he was a male monster
16:04
he's on i think something like 200
16:07
romance
16:08
novels yeah he looks like conan the
16:10
barbarian he's got this huge flowing
16:12
blonde huge mane
16:13
muscle you guys calm down we know who
16:16
you're talking about
16:17
yeah he was known as the most beautiful
16:19
man in the world anyway he was opening a
16:21
roller coaster
16:22
and uh so he was on the ride he was
16:24
going 73 miles an hour down the first
16:26
um drop when a um 10-pound goose flew
16:29
into his face
16:30
oh my god i'd love it if the photo went
16:32
off just at that moment
16:42
yeah his entire face is bloodied he was
16:45
he was on the roller coaster ride with a
16:46
load of
16:47
um sort of models and things like this
16:49
because it was a big pr launch of this
16:51
roller coaster yeah and you just see the
16:52
carriage coming back in
16:55
traumatized he's covered in blood he's
16:57
got a broken nose
16:58
yeah do you not think it might have been
16:59
a jealous fellow model who's just taken
17:02
a goose
17:08
[Laughter]
17:14
[Applause]
17:14
[Music]
17:16
okay it's time for fact number two and
17:18
that is my fact
17:19
my fact this week is that when nylon
17:21
stockings became rationed
17:23
during world war ii department stores
17:25
set up leg
17:26
makeup bars where women could have
17:28
stockings drawn onto their legs instead
17:31
very cool
17:32
yeah they would they would just go to
17:34
the shop and they would take hours at a
17:36
time and they would draw the hemline at
17:37
the back
17:38
of their leg and they would put powders
17:40
inside would they would they kind of
17:42
paint the leg to look a slightly
17:44
different color and then draw the line
17:45
yeah do you put it in like an old cup of
17:47
tea for a little while until it stains
17:50
like you like with the legs
17:51
[Laughter]
17:54
that's a nice idea you could put
17:55
everyone in a jacuzzi just sitting
17:57
around the edges
17:58
yeah and then you could everyone could
18:00
have a cup and just take some of the
18:01
t-shirts
18:02
that would be lovely well they did used
18:04
to do it with gravy i think didn't they
18:06
and with coffee yeah because i think we
18:08
so it's sort of like women used to just
18:10
paint the
18:10
lines up themselves i think yes often no
18:13
i didn't realize they had the
18:14
salons specifically to do it for the
18:16
wealthier i suppose you don't get a
18:17
wobbly line
18:18
but yeah if you're doing it at home you
18:19
dip your leg in a sort of vat of gravy
18:22
or cocoa powder that's another
18:24
substitute amazing considering a time of
18:26
extreme rationing and deprivation that
18:28
people just have vats of gravy lying
18:30
around
18:30
solely for their legs well they had
18:33
their priority straight
18:34
i don't know in those days you probably
18:36
would have to reuse the gravy no
18:38
i'm sure you would yeah yeah yeah it's
18:40
such a i mean it's just it's makeup
18:42
for the legs isn't it yeah what's wrong
18:44
with that nothing wrong with it
18:45
makeup is just drawing another face on
18:46
your face so why not draw another leg on
18:49
your leg exactly
18:50
um it's brilliant and it's because
18:52
people were obsessed with nylon
18:54
i mean it was it's so bizarre the nylon
18:56
craze because basically i think it was
18:57
invented in about 35 and it own or 34
19:00
and it only became commercially
19:02
available in 37 or 38
19:04
and by the time the war hit people were
19:06
obsessed with it
19:07
to the extent that as soon as it started
19:08
being rationed because it was needed for
19:10
various wartime instruments
19:11
they went nuts and they were desperate
19:13
to show that they still sort of had
19:14
nylon there was this big black market
19:16
where nylon went for sort of the
19:17
equivalent of about 500
19:19
today you'd get a pair of nylon tights
19:21
for just one yeah
19:22
yeah did they get people like trying to
19:24
steal your tights off you because
19:25
they're so expensive
19:26
like an iphone oh probably it was so
19:28
hard to steal tights because they are
19:30
quite well adhered to the legs aren't
19:31
they
19:32
you could be pulling them pulling it
19:33
turns out it's just gravy
19:34
[Laughter]
19:37
but i think it's quite harsh because
19:38
like you say everyone loved them it was
19:40
like the most amazing thing of its day
19:42
and like you say everyone got it for a
19:44
few years
19:45
and then it was taken away because of
19:47
the war it's like as if we all had
19:48
iphones
19:49
and then they go after three years you
19:51
can't have iphones anymore yeah that's
19:53
that would be harsh it would the world
19:55
might be a better place
19:57
the first day of sales nationally in
19:59
america was the 16th of may 1940
20:02
so the rest of the world was at war
20:03
america hadn't quite decided yet
20:05
and the the statistics vary but some
20:08
people say that four million pairs were
20:09
sold in four days
20:11
and it was true mania but this is a bit
20:14
like uh
20:15
telly i think didn't britain just get tv
20:17
and then the war happened and they said
20:18
well
20:19
we're not going to do tv anymore for the
20:21
next six years and then it started again
20:23
in the late 40s or early 50s yeah it was
20:25
none of those inventions which had been
20:26
existing but was just
20:27
back burner for the war yeah and then
20:29
post-war when they were available again
20:31
there were
20:31
nylon riots it was there was because
20:34
they didn't have enough stock for the
20:35
amount of people who wanted and were
20:37
obsessed with them and been
20:38
been waiting for them to come back so in
20:40
pittsburgh they had 40
20:42
000 people lining up over a mile even
20:44
though there was only 13
20:45
000 pairs available so you can imagine
20:47
the chaos of when those shops opened the
20:49
doors
20:50
yeah they used to be you know police
20:52
would have to be deployed quite a lot i
20:54
think this was sort of 45 and 46
20:56
there was um i think dupont the main
20:58
company that made the tights
21:00
or the the stockings they said they
21:02
would make 360 million pairs as soon as
21:04
the war ended within a year and they
21:05
could not live up to that
21:06
at all people went nuts got really
21:08
excited so uh there was yeah the 16
21:10
block
21:11
queue where people started fighting in
21:12
georgia there were fist fights and
21:14
police had to be called to break
21:16
them up there was a mob in chicago of
21:18
1200 women
21:19
who were outside a dress shop just
21:21
bashing on the windows again police had
21:23
to be called
21:24
they weren't mad they weren't hysterical
21:26
i don't want to you know be
21:27
stereotyping here but they lost their
21:29
21:30
[Laughter]
21:32
people were scared of nylon because
21:34
partly because it had this weird process
21:36
by which it was made it was full of acid
21:38
and stuff and partly because there was
21:40
just this huge ferrari about it so
21:41
there's a backlash
21:42
and all these rumors went around about
21:44
what it could do so people thought it
21:45
would give you cancer of the legs
21:47
um they thought it melted in hot water i
21:50
don't know why you'd go in hot water
21:51
wearing tights but
21:53
it was that um they feel like snakes
21:55
when wet
21:56
the sound reported people thought they
22:00
were made from corpses because there was
22:01
a thing called cadaverine which was
22:03
gathered from
22:04
substance gathered from corpses to make
22:05
stuff but they weren't it was a rumor
22:07
oh wait so could everyone didn't exist i
22:09
think canaveron i think it did exist it
22:11
was a chemical that you could get from
22:13
rotting cadavers that comes from rotting
22:15
that's a word that people used for just
22:17
like you know human snarge basically
22:19
humans dodged but um the thing is with
22:21
this is it was a very smelly process
22:23
like the industrial process was really
22:24
smelly so when journalists went there
22:27
they smelt how bad it was and i think
22:29
actually
22:30
one newspaper did say that this happened
22:32
in a newspaper article and everyone
22:34
believed it when obviously it wasn't
22:35
true
22:35
yeah that's great um and there was that
22:38
i think there was one other report
22:40
in a paper of a woman who was standing
22:42
at a bus stop and
22:44
the ex the bus went past and the exhaust
22:46
fumes of the bus
22:47
stripped the nylon off her legs
22:48
completely and all these rumors that the
22:50
nylon would just
22:51
fall off your legs
22:56
people thought they might burn did you
22:58
say yeah sort of metal melting
23:00
because you've got it's basically a
23:01
plastic is that it's polymer yeah so it
23:03
makes sense that it would just melt onto
23:04
you
23:05
it actually could a bit if it was too
23:06
humid uh the owl to damp then it could
23:09
start melting down your legs
23:10
really um there is a problem with
23:13
nylon and health today which is nylon
23:16
tea bags
23:17
so they started coming in about 12 or 13
23:20
years ago and
23:20
i read article i found articles from the
23:22
time saying hey great new nylon tea bags
23:24
no more of these boring paper tea bags
23:25
um and you know they're silky and they
23:27
feel nice and
23:28
it turns out they're plastic you know
23:31
obviously plastic's bad for you
23:32
plastic's bad so is that the most the
23:34
ones that i would
23:35
get down the shop so they like that not
23:38
really so a normal packet of
23:40
um a normal packet of pg i think those
23:43
are
23:44
all paper except sometimes they're
23:46
sealed with a tiny tiny blob of got it
23:48
but the some coffee shops sell them in
23:50
and they look kind of weird and
23:51
different you mean the flash ones where
23:52
you get something
23:53
that's a portion it feels like a bit
23:54
like silks well really posh ones are
23:56
made of silk
23:57
um well but
24:00
if you don't if you're around to add
24:01
these fatigue if you can't run to a silk
24:04
bag someone will follow you off with a
24:05
nylon one and they've been studied so
24:08
every single
24:09
silky plasticy teabag releases 11.6
24:12
billion microplastics
24:13
these are very very very small jesus and
24:15
three billion three billion
24:16
nano plastics and those are extremely
24:19
tiny
24:20
yeah but they are they are bad so they
24:23
uh scientists tried feeding them to
24:25
water fleas which are little tiny
24:28
lobstery animals
24:29
and they became very stressed and they
24:31
their exoskeletons swelled up
24:34
so it wasn't good for them so um but it
24:36
means that what you're saying is in your
24:38
cup of tea of posh
24:39
but not that posh tea then you're
24:41
getting it into your body
24:43
and basically i mean they're going to
24:45
find this in years to come out
24:46
it's going to be you know when the
24:47
romans had lead in the pipes
24:50
yeah and they all went crazy and
24:52
everyone knew it was because of the lead
24:53
in the pipes that's what it's going to
24:54
be we're just
24:55
eating plastic all the time aren't the
24:57
bristles on toothbrushes
24:59
plastic is i mean they're nylon as well
25:02
do you think this is going to be the
25:03
explanation for sort of brexit and
25:04
donald trump and all of that it's
25:06
actually just
25:06
like you know how we've discovered that
25:08
the salem witch crisis was people say
25:10
it's caused by the ergo from the dodgy
25:12
bread
25:12
it's gonna be that we were just eating
25:14
microplastics
25:17
okay i'm so glad about that because i
25:19
hate those tea bags they make awful tea
25:21
i don't think they're very permeable
25:23
they're not permeable enough that's
25:24
exactly correct yeah
25:25
so pretentious places serve them and you
25:27
don't even taste any tea yeah um i read
25:29
an article that said that there
25:30
when they were trying to come up with
25:31
the name for nylon there were over 400
25:34
options for what they wanted to go for
25:36
yeah and there's a few that we
25:38
know of so one was clis klis
25:41
which is silk backwards um because this
25:43
was yeah it was like
25:44
instead of silk wasn't it that's why it
25:46
was so big exactly yeah this was like
25:48
the cheap replacement uh the affordable
25:50
replacement
25:50
neuron was one which is actually no
25:53
run so because no rhinestone right
25:56
because the tights so run
25:57
and then there was duper and which
26:00
it's a shame it wasn't called that duper
26:02
uh d-u-p-a-r-o-h i think it's more like
26:05
do peru you know oh do peru yeah yeah
26:08
like winnie the pooh do peru okay cool
26:10
yeah sorry pronouncing that right super
26:12
duper super duper yeah okay
26:13
so that was an acronym it stood for
26:15
dupont pulls a rabbit out of a hat
26:18
yes and dupont was the manufacturer yeah
26:20
yeah yeah
26:21
we should say why why they banded
26:24
because the reason the reason it was so
26:28
amazing was that it was
26:30
another material which replaced silk
26:32
basically and before the war america
26:34
imported
26:35
i think it was 80 of all the silk made
26:37
in the world
26:38
uh was important and 90 of that was from
26:40
japan
26:41
so obviously when the usa japan reward
26:43
big problem
26:44
and nylon was this incredible wonder
26:46
substance which
26:48
really contributed to the usa winning
26:49
the war because it made
26:51
better parachutes than silk parachutes
26:53
silk parachutes got moldy they're hard
26:54
to fold
26:55
nylon's way better and it was used for
26:58
ropes and fuel tanks and shoelaces and
27:00
mosquito nets and hammer
27:01
just anything you could think of in the
27:03
field that was fabricy
27:05
nylon was the thing yeah you know yeah
27:07
when we were told to hand in their
27:08
tights weren't they it was sort of a
27:10
patriotic war effort
27:11
can you turn tights back into uh let's
27:14
say a fuel tank yeah i believe they
27:16
could because
27:16
they were asked to do an amnesty uh
27:20
and i think that one of the slogans was
27:21
a boeing super fortress lands on enough
27:23
nylon to make four thousand pairs of
27:25
stockings so that's that
27:26
it made the tires right but they did ask
27:28
people to hand in their stockings so
27:30
i think you could turn it into a rope
27:31
quite easily yeah true
27:33
or if you're in the sas you can pull it
27:35
over your head for the disguise
27:36
yeah that's good cut a pair of eye holes
27:40
or if you're marching into paris saving
27:43
paris you could go in disguise in the
27:45
moulin rouge
27:47
a lot of callbacks to the previous
27:48
episode it's obviously if i literally
27:50
just edited it
27:52
james is trying to turn this into a
27:54
long-running storyline for five years we
27:56
need some
27:57
plot lines emerging we need a narrative
28:00
yeah
28:02
[Applause]
28:02
[Music]
28:06
okay it is time for fact number three
28:09
and that
28:09
is chozinski my fact this week is that
28:12
more than 80
28:13
of japan's temples have suffered from
28:16
raccoon
28:16
damage and it's really sad because
28:20
raccoons are not even native to japan
28:22
obviously but they've swarmed there the
28:23
last few years and they're one of the
28:25
main causes of damage to the temples
28:27
so the advice to anyone out there who's
28:29
thinking about getting a raccoon for a
28:30
pet is
28:31
don't they will eat anything and they
28:34
cause damage to
28:35
anywhere they are so in japan they've
28:37
just climbed all around the temples and
28:39
they want to find a nice little cozy
28:41
nook
28:41
to sleep in and they'll tear and eat and
28:44
scratch through anything that stands
28:46
in their way and is it because people
28:47
have got them as pets and then let them
28:49
go or
28:49
it is indeed so it's um this weird story
28:53
where there was a very very popular show
28:55
in the 70s in 1977 called rascal the
28:59
raccoon
29:00
and it was an animation it was like an
29:02
anime thing
29:03
and people thought i want to get a pet
29:04
raccoon they obviously got the pets
29:06
before they watched
29:07
the end because the moral of the show
29:09
and the book it's based on
29:10
is that raccoons are terrible pets you
29:12
can't take care of them and at the end
29:14
they had to release it back into the
29:15
wild
29:16
anyway people bought all these they were
29:17
i think people were buying like 2 000 a
29:19
year being imported into japan
29:21
and then they started eating people's
29:22
houses and so they released them
29:24
and they banned the imports didn't they
29:26
yeah yeah you couldn't do it yeah i read
29:27
one source that said they were importing
29:29
1 500 a month wow
29:33
amazing there's too many raccoons it's
29:36
too many i mean
29:37
if you're a country which doesn't have
29:38
any raccoons then one is too many
29:40
you're right yeah you're absolutely
29:41
right and this the author of this book
29:43
um sterling north a great name sterling
29:46
north
29:47
it's like lofty england
29:48
[Laughter]
29:50
he um he passed away a few years before
29:52
this animation hit japan so he never got
29:54
to see the true
29:55
sort of success of his he populated a
29:58
country with
29:59
an animal basically it's we're saying
30:01
it's not really a success yeah it's not
30:02
a success story
30:03
it is if you're a raccoon it's a and you
30:06
want to travel huge win for raccoons
30:08
and we know that sterling north was
30:09
interested in raccoon success
30:13
yeah we don't know what you thought
30:14
about japan doing no because america is
30:16
the only place where they're
30:17
and where they're you know native yes um
30:20
but they've sort of invaded
30:21
germany as well now and europe they
30:23
haven't invaded it's not like
30:25
well i don't know because the european
30:27
press called them nazi raccoons
30:29
did they yeah as in if you look at any
30:31
article in the last
30:33
10 15 years from some of the more
30:35
salacious press i must say
30:37
they'll say nazi raccoons coming to the
30:39
netherlands or nazi raccoons coming to
30:41
france or something
30:43
and that's because there was a theory
30:45
that the first ones were let into the
30:47
wild by hermann goering
30:50
this is a massive rumor and apparently
30:53
he didn't do it they were
30:54
they were let into the wild in germany
30:56
in 1934
30:58
to promote diversity of fauna but guring
31:01
had nothing to do with it
31:02
but the rumor has persisted and so we
31:04
get all these articles saying nazi
31:06
well at least at least we stamped that
31:08
rumor out today
31:11
um in america i i don't know if they
31:14
were kept
31:15
as pets because i guess they should be
31:17
in the wild hence the moral of the book
31:19
but one person who did keep a raccoon as
31:20
a pet
31:21
was the president of the united states
31:23
in the white house calvin coolidge
31:26
yeah he had a raccoon called rebecca and
31:28
um
31:29
rebecca was meant to be eaten as part of
31:31
a thanksgiving dinner
31:32
um but he kind of just took to rebecca
31:35
they used to eat that instead of turkey
31:37
apparently did they
31:39
well they they didn't it came from was
31:41
it mississippi i think
31:42
sent him the raccoon and i think calvin
31:44
looked at it and went
31:46
and someone said it is edible mate and
31:48
he said it's not edible to me
31:49
take that away from her because you know
31:51
it's claimed he was doing the decent
31:53
thing
31:53
and yeah then they sort of loved her
31:55
didn't they yeah proper pet like she um
31:56
she had a
31:57
engraved collar that she got for
31:58
christmas yeah she was a she was a good
32:01
person did you read
32:01
that christmas when they gave her the
32:03
engraved collar uh the present that they
32:06
got their son
32:07
was a coat made of raccoon fur
32:11
that's a good warning to rebecca to
32:12
behave it's very good isn't it
32:14
but the color from the raccoon was made
32:16
from the wrist bone of that child
32:21
um they are really clever
32:25
that's the amazing thing and i read i
32:26
read an article saying that they in the
32:28
early 20th century were used in a lot of
32:30
lab experiments
32:31
and that they could have been lab rats
32:33
basically or they they could have been
32:34
the go-to for experimentation
32:36
but basically they're too good they're
32:38
too clever they escape
32:40
they chew through things they start
32:41
performing experiments on us
32:44
they get into the air vents and then and
32:46
just they were a
32:48
nightmare and it turns out the rats are
32:49
a bit easier to um to control
32:51
yeah yeah they love hanging out with
32:53
humans don't they
32:55
they're one of the species that has
32:56
really thrived from human
32:58
you know building up urban environments
33:00
they work very well in cities
33:01
i like the american version of a fox
33:04
like an urban farm i think they are i
33:05
think they're sort of like
33:06
a better version like a grade up from
33:08
foxes
33:09
they've got bloody hands yeah although
33:11
not opposable thumbs the only thing
33:13
we've got over them
33:14
one thing is opposable thumbs and this
33:17
is actually proved quite crucial in the
33:18
us well i'm sure there are lots of
33:20
listeners who have issues with raccoons
33:22
breaking into your bins and
33:24
so they're like constantly trying to
33:25
upgrade bins to make them
33:27
inaccessible to raccoons because they're
33:29
so smart they keep on working out how
33:31
to do it and then they have made one
33:33
apparently which is clocked onto the
33:34
fact they don't have an opposable thumb
33:36
so if you can do that is that in toronto
33:39
uh i think it might be yeah
33:40
because toronto spent 31 million dollars
33:43
uh
33:43
getting a good raccoon proof bin in
33:46
2015.
33:47
they were so frustrated and they were
33:49
really hard and the city's mayor
33:51
wrote we are ready we are armed and we
33:53
are motivated to show that we cannot be
33:55
defeated by these critters
33:57
as they were being rolled out across the
33:59
city he tweeted i love the smell of new
34:01
raccoon resistant green bins in the
34:02
morning
34:03
wow and within a few days raccoons had
34:06
managed to make their way into
34:08
these samples
34:10
[Laughter]
34:13
there's actually an argument i think
34:14
that it's quite bad that we keep on
34:16
trying to upgrade these bins because
34:17
we're just making them cleverer now
34:19
we're in this terrible arms race with
34:21
raccoons where the more we complexify
34:23
the bins
34:24
the better they're getting i know what
34:25
you're saying but then actually we're
34:27
getting better as well so actually by
34:29
them forcing us to get better we're
34:30
getting smarter
34:31
the raccoons are getting smarter it's
34:33
the rest of the animal kingdom that are
34:35
losing out
34:37
eventually it'll just be a massive
34:38
battle between us
34:39
[Laughter]
34:43
you were saying about how lots of towns
34:44
really don't like them there's an online
34:46
factoid that says if you take a raccoon
34:48
head to the town hall
34:50
of a town called hanukkah they'll give
34:52
you ten dollars
34:53
and it says that all over the internet
34:55
yeah but when i read it i emailed them
34:57
and they said no this is absolutely
34:59
rubbish
35:01
so if you do have raccoon head don't
35:03
bother taking it to the town hall
35:05
that's good i think we've done a real
35:06
public service we've prevented people
35:07
from decapitating more raccoons
35:09
although actually with the battle that's
35:10
coming up we need to dig up as many as
35:12
possible right
35:16
[Applause]
35:16
[Music]
35:18
okay it's time for our final fact of the
35:20
show and that
35:21
is andy my fact is that the economist
35:23
john maynard keynes
35:25
once bought a priceless suzanne painting
35:28
and then hid it
35:29
in a hedge very good yeah
35:33
um what did you hide it well
35:36
it was a hedge fund was it brilliant you
35:39
see cause he's an economist you see
35:41
the end the end of that section
35:44
so this is a fact from a podcast that's
35:47
coming out very shortly actually and
35:48
it's by
35:49
friend of the show a few of us know him
35:51
tim harford who is the undercover
35:53
economist
35:54
and it's called his new show is called
35:56
cautionary tales and it's all about
35:58
sort of mishaps basically things that
36:00
haven't gone to plan
36:01
fiascos grade a mishaps you know this
36:04
kind of stuff
36:05
um oil tankers crashing and um and i've
36:08
seen a bit of it and
36:09
it's going to be an extremely good show
36:10
oh it sounds amazing i mean it sounds
36:12
like we're going to be stealing a lot
36:13
from it i mean look at it it hasn't even
36:14
come out we're already stealing from it
36:16
borrowing borrowing sorry legally
36:18
borrowing are we giving this fact
36:20
back at the end yeah yeah
36:24
um so anyway tim sent me this fact and
36:26
it's about
36:27
uh keans or keynes people say keane's
36:30
but i've read kane's online
36:31
i've read cain's but i think we should
36:33
say keynes all right guys no one's gonna
36:34
know who we're talking about
36:36
um and it was in the it was in 1918 the
36:39
first world war was grinding on
36:40
he was a bright young economist and he
36:43
realized that
36:44
france's economy was very weak too and
36:46
britain was going to need to collect a
36:48
massive amount of loan money
36:50
and he wanted to buy up artistic
36:53
masterpieces on behalf of britain
36:55
so then the british government wouldn't
36:57
need to collect quite as much loan money
36:59
britain would have a lot of new artworks
37:00
got it and also
37:02
he felt a bit embarrassed about working
37:03
for the war effort because he was quite
37:05
a bohemian he was quite a pacifist
37:06
and a lot of his friends had kind of
37:08
ditched him over his stance in the war
37:10
oh so he got charles holmes who was the
37:13
director of the national gallery on side
37:16
and he found a huge art auction that was
37:18
happening in paris
37:19
all of degas collection was being sold
37:22
and they went to the auction homes had
37:24
shaved his moustache so he wouldn't be
37:25
recognized as the director of the
37:26
national gallery
37:28
wow just in case uh and the auction was
37:30
really quiet because paris was in the
37:31
middle of being bombed by germany at the
37:33
time of the auction so not many people
37:35
turned up
37:36
and um holmes bought over 20 masterwork
37:39
paintings and they had a
37:40
sort of blank check from the government
37:42
they had 20 000 pounds which huge amount
37:44
and keynes keynes bought himself a
37:46
cezanne
37:47
and they traveled back to england he'd
37:49
been traveling for 24 hours
37:50
and he was visiting his friends in their
37:52
countryside home and he was so knackered
37:54
that he just chucked the suitcase in the
37:55
hedge
37:56
with this priceless painting in it and
37:58
he walked into the house and he said
38:00
there's a suzanne and a hedge outside if
38:01
you want to go and look
38:02
so i've been to this house have you yeah
38:04
it's um it's
38:05
uh called charleston and it's in um uh
38:08
it's in sussex it's very near my in-laws
38:10
i went to it recently it was part of the
38:11
bloomsbury group house
38:12
it's so virginia woolf's sister uh who
38:15
lived there with
38:16
her artistic uh friend slash lover and
38:19
his lover it was a complicated situation
38:21
and
38:21
the house is amazing it's full of
38:23
incredible art like walter sick arts uh
38:25
walter sigrid's original stuff um which
38:28
i studied because if you remember
38:30
um there was a theory that he was jack
38:32
the ripper according to
38:33
patricia cornwall so i was looking close
38:35
for any clues
38:36
no no it's just normal paintings
38:38
probably because it's
38:39
yeah probably because there's no truth
38:41
to it didn't write i did it in any of
38:42
the corners of the pictures
38:45
but no yeah so it's an amazing house so
38:47
i'm probably past the hedge so cool
38:49
i'm still a bit confused about why he
38:51
didn't just bring the suitcase into the
38:53
house and ask if he could leave it in
38:54
the entrance
38:56
whenever you come back from holiday it
38:58
got all the way to your front door i got
39:00
you know what i can't remember bringing
39:01
the bag this last bit i'm just gonna
39:02
throw it in a hedge
39:03
yeah it feels like there's something
39:05
missing from the account because it's
39:06
all from him writing it in from his
39:08
friends
39:08
i think maybe part it might have been
39:10
because he wanted to make an entrance
39:11
oh yeah and say hey it's me and i've got
39:14
a
39:15
priceless bit of art in the hedge it's
39:16
not clever you don't just or everyone in
39:18
the house would go why have you been at
39:19
the hedge mate
39:20
yeah they they all reflect they rushed
39:22
out
39:23
i bet they were like of course somebody
39:24
did because they wanted to see it and
39:26
they gathered around it by moonlight
39:28
and it was it was quite nice the reason
39:30
he had bought it was because the
39:31
national gallery director had refused
39:34
because it was suzanne
39:35
who i think was a post-impressionist and
39:37
it was very avant-garde
39:39
and it was to avant-garde for the
39:41
national gallery to be buying
39:42
and home so i'm not going to waste my
39:44
money on this it's too it's too edgy
39:46
and keynes was a bit more out there and
39:49
he said i'll buy it
39:50
well he was he was out there for normal
39:53
society but then he feels like he was
39:55
the straight lace one of the bloomsbury
39:57
set
39:57
um like he was bridging a gap i think um
40:00
because he
40:00
but i don't you know he had such a
40:02
central role in that set of people who
40:04
were just
40:04
artists and creatives which you don't
40:06
picture keane's being and so he was
40:08
there with
40:09
um yeah wolf and sakva west and ian
40:11
foster
40:12
and one thing that they were all very
40:14
relaxed about and i find this really
40:15
interesting that society was really
40:16
relaxed about was the fact that he was
40:18
bisexual
40:19
and for the first years of his sexual
40:21
life he was
40:22
only had relationships with men and i
40:24
find that so bizarre because he
40:26
came immediately after oscar wilde who
40:28
obviously you know we know what happened
40:29
to him
40:30
and then immediately before alan turing
40:32
but then there was obviously this
40:33
relaxation
40:34
for this 30-year period and so he was
40:36
really promiscuous
40:38
and he had this love triangle with uh
40:40
listen strategy
40:41
uh who was uh then became very jealous
40:43
of him going out with someone else and
40:45
it was listen straight she who said
40:46
things like
40:47
his common sense is enough to freeze a
40:49
volcano which you can really imagine
40:52
and he said he hated how he treats his
40:53
love affairs statistically
40:55
which is kind of true he kept did he
40:57
have a spreadsheet he had an excel
40:59
spreadsheet
41:00
he did he wrote well it may not have
41:02
been full on spreadsheet but he used to
41:03
record the numbers in his diary
41:06
which you know if you were just a number
41:07
in someone's diary well i'd be quite
41:09
proud
41:10
um it depends on the number doesn't it
41:13
if it's a scoreboard then great
41:17
there were high numbers yeah didn't he
41:19
have lots of codes or something
41:20
for everything that they did i never got
41:23
this written down but i think
41:25
he would um he would have sex with
41:27
someone
41:28
and then he would have like a s for anal
41:30
sex or you know different things for
41:32
different things
41:33
and then i think he would give people by
41:36
their initials
41:37
but then if it was just a dalliance it
41:39
would be
41:41
bloke and a hedge or you know whatever
41:43
it was like something
41:44
apologized about throwing my suitcase
41:46
onto him
41:48
but i think it was that it was like
41:50
there would be no names it would just be
41:52
this person in this situation yeah it
41:54
would be like bell boy
41:55
yeah you had the swede of the national
41:57
gallery the soldier of the baths the
41:59
french conscript
42:00
the lift boy at vauxhall really yeah
42:05
wow and still no blue plaque at vauxhall
42:08
outrageous
42:09
um he also revolutionized economics
42:12
well which he does it's incredible
42:16
and he so he had only studied economics
42:19
for eight weeks
42:20
uh during his uh student days he never
42:23
sat and examined it he studied classics
42:25
and maths
42:26
and then he only started properly going
42:28
into it when he was offered a
42:29
lectureship
42:30
in economics age 25 and then he just
42:32
turned up and started
42:34
revolutionizing the art and then he
42:36
almost went bankrupt three times in his
42:37
life
42:39
despite being one of the greatest
42:41
economists of history hey it was the
42:42
great depression that was one of you
42:45
you can't blame him for that but what
42:46
about the other two i didn't know that
42:48
the first one was when uh
42:49
england went to the golden standard as
42:52
in um
42:52
peg the pound with the gold and he
42:54
gambled against that happening and lost
42:56
a ton of money and then
42:58
he speculated against the war uh he
43:01
didn't think the war would happen wow
43:02
and he lost a ton of money on that
43:04
and then the great depression which i
43:05
think we can understand
43:07
actually i mean all of it we can kind of
43:09
understand but gosh
43:12
yeah he's a gambler but he he got one
43:14
thing really right which was about
43:16
the uh treaty of versailles so he was
43:19
present
43:19
in versailles as the representative for
43:22
the treasury
43:23
financial rep and in 1919 he was arguing
43:27
these compensation payments that you're
43:29
suggesting germany makes they are too
43:30
high
43:31
and this is an insane impulse and it
43:34
will lead to disaster in the long run
43:36
and he was ignored he was kind of kept
43:39
out of the room actually
43:40
and so he was left to try and you know
43:42
he and a couple of other reps were
43:43
advising around the edges saying this
43:44
may not work
43:45
um and he failed basically because the
43:47
impulse to punish germany was very
43:48
strong yeah he was proved right
43:50
him and churchill wasn't i feel like
43:52
churchill said the same things they were
43:53
just outside the room bitching about a
43:55
stupid verse eye
43:56
wow but they were laughing in their
43:57
faces
43:59
later one thing that he didn't get right
44:01
was he said oh i don't think he's gonna
44:03
get right
44:03
because he said that by 2030 everyone in
44:06
the western world will be working a
44:08
15-hour work week
44:10
that was his prediction if things go
44:12
really badly wrong we might be
44:15
um he thought that only workaholics
44:17
would be working more than that and
44:19
everyone else
44:20
progression would get so much that you
44:21
could do that amount of work and you'd
44:23
get paid enough that the rest of your
44:24
time you could be
44:25
at leisure because basically technology
44:26
would have been able to do do stuff for
44:28
us
44:28
that was his idea yeah why he didn't
44:30
realize is that as technology goes up
44:32
so does the number of people who have to
44:34
work at that technology bloody robots
44:36
actually just make
44:37
more work they do they do people don't
44:40
realize that
44:40
not supposed to happen but he did think
44:42
that a very sensible thing which was
44:44
that the obsession with money that
44:45
society has is insane
44:47
um he thought it was like this crazy
44:49
social pathology
44:50
because why do you want money what you
44:52
want is leisure what makes humans happy
44:53
is leisure time
44:54
and so we thought what we should all be
44:55
striving towards is that you know
44:57
three hours work a day yeah then sounds
45:00
like a good idea
45:01
does fingers crossed 20 30 still 10
45:03
years away
45:06
he was he had this weird thing just to
45:07
go back to his personal life now we've
45:09
covered the economics
45:10
so he had a really lovely marriage as
45:13
far as i can tell he married a ballerina
45:15
called lydia lopikova or but he was very
45:18
confused by this at first he started
45:20
falling in love with women and became a
45:21
bit confused by that the first woman he
45:22
fell in love with he said
45:24
i seem to have fallen in love with ray a
45:25
little bit but as she isn't male
45:27
i haven't been able to think of any
45:28
suitable steps to take
45:30
i asked a man in hedge for his opinion
45:32
he is also stumped
45:36
but he he married this uh ballerina
45:39
eventually and he took her on honeymoon
45:42
to i think it was sussex but he had this
45:44
honeymoon where he invited some other
45:45
people
45:46
and one of the people he invited was
45:48
wittgenstein the philosopher
45:49
rickenstein who was not that much of a
45:51
laugh to have a honeymoon
45:56
it sounds really unpleasant apparently
45:58
he spent the whole six days making her
45:59
feel like she was a bit below a
46:01
social class maybe it wasn't
46:03
intellectual yeah like making her
46:05
really stupid um and eventually she
46:07
apparently made a remark about how
46:09
beautiful a tree was
46:10
and he said what do you mean by that you
46:12
know challenging her to
46:14
explain herself and she just burst into
46:15
tears what absolutely can't
46:19
when he felt when keynes first saw his
46:21
future wife at the ballet i read
46:24
he described her as a rotten dancer with
46:26
a stiff bottom
46:28
wow it's not very nice is it not very
46:31
nice although actually a stiff bottom i
46:32
don't know that could be a nice thing
46:34
the stiff bottom
46:35
yeah is that so often not when paired
46:36
with rotten dancer
46:41
wow um i have a couple of art things of
46:44
hidden art
46:45
um so a few years back there was a guy
46:49
who um was watching a movie with his
46:51
daughter
46:52
and in it in the movie he was watching
46:54
was stuart little and in the movie
46:56
in the background he noticed this
46:59
painting that looked suspiciously
47:00
similar
47:01
to a lost avant-garde painting uh that
47:04
was from hungary
47:05
so sorry can i just say stuart little
47:07
isn't animated is it
47:08
stuart little himself is animated but
47:10
the rest of it it's got hugh laurie
47:12
and it's yeah um yeah so in the
47:14
background of the house that stuart
47:15
lives in is this painting and he's going
47:17
i swear to god i've seen that painting
47:18
from somewhere before and he had a
47:20
little black and white picture of it
47:22
uh it was 90 years old and had been lost
47:24
for nine decades
47:25
and he got in contact with the
47:26
production and he said do you still have
47:28
this painting it took two years for them
47:30
to get back and then eventually
47:32
the lady who was in charge of the
47:33
dressing for the house said yeah i found
47:35
it at some market i bought it for
47:36
nothing
47:37
and they've now established that this is
47:39
the lost work of a
47:40
um an artist called robert bereni it
47:43
took two
47:44
years to reply to an email it was a very
47:46
successful films too a little and they
47:49
they had a sequel to reply they had a
47:51
sequel to make that makes me feel a lot
47:52
better about my email response time
47:55
that is the main takeaway for me as well
47:58
yeah crazy
47:59
yeah um there was another incident in
48:01
2008
48:02
uh where a norman rockwell painting
48:04
really famous
48:05
rockwell painting was found hidden
48:07
behind a false wall and this was it was
48:09
worth 15.4 million dollars
48:11
and the reason that happened it was this
48:13
weird story so it was really famous
48:15
because it had been on the cover
48:17
of magazine in the 50s and it was bought
48:19
by a cartoonist called don
48:21
don tracht jr and he just bought it for
48:24
900
48:24
in 1960 and he sort of displayed it
48:28
people thought for years afterwards
48:29
people would come around they'd be like
48:30
oh yeah don's got that great picture
48:33
and people were a bit confused because
48:34
when they looked closely at the one he
48:36
had it didn't match up with the
48:37
magazine cover so a bit odd anyway he
48:40
died a few years ago 2008 or 2007
48:43
and his sons went through his home they
48:46
discovered an entire false wall they'd
48:48
had built and behind it was the real
48:50
painting
48:51
and he'd painted a copy of that to show
48:54
to the public
48:55
and his son's theory about why he'd
48:57
hidden the original
48:58
is because he disliked his wife whom he
49:00
then divorced so much that he was
49:02
worried she would take it
49:03
wow wait oh my god that's a that's a lot
49:06
to do isn't it
49:08
that's incredible um in 1505
49:11
leonardo um did a fresco we're just
49:14
first naming leonardo now are we
49:16
oh sorry leonardo dicaprio
49:20
leonardo da vinci made this fresco and
49:23
it was in the grand meeting hall of
49:24
florence's palazzo vecchio
49:27
okay and then the medicis came along and
49:29
they decided i don't really like that i
49:31
want something else in that place
49:33
so they commissioned the architect
49:34
giorgio vasari to renovate the room
49:37
and put something else in its place
49:39
which means that we've lost at fresco
49:41
but we know that vasari was a big fan of
49:43
leonardo
49:44
and so we think that he probably
49:46
wouldn't have destroyed it
49:48
and in that room if you go there now
49:49
there are two words painted
49:51
in the whole room and they are
49:53
certsatrova which means seek and you
49:55
shall find
49:56
and we know that at another time he has
49:59
in another time put a fake wall in place
50:01
to hide something that he didn't want to
50:03
damage
50:04
so we think that somewhere in that room
50:06
there might be
50:07
leonardo's los fresco whoa how hard is
50:10
it to search a room well yeah but i i
50:12
guess if he's got art on the wall
50:14
he's painted his painted right his own
50:16
painting yeah yeah just
50:17
tear it down yeah i guess leonardo
50:20
apparently and i'm quoting this from the
50:22
article i read it it says
50:24
excavation has been tangled for years in
50:26
the famously convoluted italian
50:28
bureaucracy
50:29
it's actually the people who worked on
50:30
stuart little who were in charge of this
50:33
renovation
50:34
how many fake walls are gonna how these
50:35
are gonna be tiny rooms eventually
50:38
you're right i'm sure we used to be able
50:40
to fit the dining room
50:44
um i've got a fact about war war art
50:48
and now being hidden in times of war so
50:49
the second world war i think we may have
50:51
mentioned before that all the art of the
50:52
national gallery was sent to
50:54
a cave in wales yeah and they
50:57
it wasn't by the end of the war it was
50:59
the most high-tech cave in the world
51:00
because they built a railway inside the
51:02
cave to move all the art around it
51:04
really cool and i just i really like how
51:06
it got there so the paintings were sent
51:08
in post office vans and cadbury delivery
51:10
trucks
51:11
to avoid attracting attention to them oh
51:13
wow oh my god i can't think of anything
51:15
i would be attracted to more
51:16
than a cabin driving through my village
51:18
it was true and you're right well
51:20
suddenly hundreds of cadburys delivery
51:22
stuff to driving through
51:22
in the war when chocolate was rationed
51:24
exactly
51:26
um but there's one painting which gave
51:28
them such problems so it's by van dyke
51:30
and it's a portrait of charles the first
51:32
right
51:32
and it's a biggie it's 12 feet by nine
51:36
and a half feet and it's on
51:37
a truck so it's i presume that was
51:40
wrapped up
51:41
but um there was a very very tight bend
51:44
in the road
51:45
just before they get to the thing so
51:46
there's no other way of getting there
51:48
very tight bend in the road and at that
51:50
same point there's a railway bridge
51:52
okay over the road and they calculated
51:55
it would be possible to do it but you'd
51:56
have to
51:57
pivot really pivot preferred
52:00
really carefully and they didn't want to
52:03
take the rest
52:04
so the way they solved it was they took
52:06
up the surface of the road
52:08
they dug they just destroyed the surface
52:10
of the road to get several more inches
52:12
of clearance
52:12
wow i know they just because it was such
52:15
an important piece of art
52:16
and if you go there now you can see at
52:18
the point where the bridge is
52:20
the curb is really high above the road
52:22
because the road is several inches but
52:23
it's still there it's still there i'd
52:25
love to know where that is that's
52:26
amazing
52:27
which uh which van dyke dick who are we
52:29
talking about
52:32
yes dick van dyke and leonardo dicaprio
52:34
the two
52:35

00:12
i know
00:20
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:23
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:25
this week coming to you live
00:27
from boston
00:36
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:38
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
00:40
hunt of murray and james hurricane and
00:42
once again we have gathered around the
00:44
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:46
from the last seven days
00:47
and in no particular order here we go
00:51
starting with fact number one and that
00:53
is my fact then
00:54
just before you start fact number one we
00:57
actually
00:58
we played a little bit of the stars and
00:59
stripes theme tune themed
01:01
stuff
01:05
as i believe you call it
01:10
okay the national anthem all right
01:14
we actually got the scent effect before
01:16
the show on this subject by uh gadget
01:18
gav
01:19
who said that if in boston if you start
01:22
singing or playing the national anthem
01:24
you have to then go on with it all the
01:26
way to the end on pain of a hundred
01:27
dollar fine
01:28
so if you wouldn't mind just
01:33
[Laughter]
01:36
it's as far as i know the lyrics great
01:38
theme tune though guys honestly
01:43
okay it is time for fact number one and
01:46
that is my fact
01:47
my fact this week is that the first
01:49
criminal in boston to be sent to the
01:51
stocks
01:52
was the man who'd actually built the
01:54
stocks
01:56
and he was found guilty of overcharging
01:58
for the building of those stocks
02:02
this is a wonderful fact this was back
02:04
in 1639 and it was a guy called edward
02:06
palmer and
02:07
it's exactly as as the fact is on the
02:09
tin it's it's a guy who did the labor
02:11
and when he went to employees he
02:13
invoiced for one pound
02:14
13 shillings and seven pence and uh they
02:17
thought that was unacceptable
02:18
so immediately once it was opened he was
02:21
the first person
02:22
charged and he got fined five pounds as
02:24
well didn't he so he got
02:26
fined three times more than he charged
02:28
for them yeah and so he had to go
02:30
and be put in the stocks for it was an
02:32
hour um
02:33
so just a quick humiliation and then a
02:36
serious amount of money
02:37
at least he hadn't been charged to build
02:39
you know a guillotine or something
02:41
yes he must have been grateful for that
02:43
um look
02:44
was he did he make actual stocks or a
02:47
pillory because there's been a lot of
02:48
confusion about this for 500 years
02:51
so there were stocks i believe they were
02:53
stocks they were stopped
02:54
okay because uh pillory was uh the one
02:56
where i think you should get taught in
02:58
primary school
02:59
there what stops are uh where you shove
03:02
your arms through two holes and you
03:03
shove your head through a hole
03:04
like when you're taking those comical
03:06
photos with cardboard cutouts
03:08
and that was actually a pillory whereas
03:10
stocks is more like you just had your
03:12
ankles often like strapped to the ground
03:14
or something didn't you yeah it's just
03:16
you put your feet in
03:17
or you just put your feet in yeah and
03:18
the idea is that as well as being and
03:20
the humiliation the public will see what
03:22
you look like so they walk past and go
03:23
that's a bad guy
03:24
but actually small boys would walk past
03:27
and tickle the feet of people in the
03:28
stats oh
03:29
really that's pretty brave because the
03:32
people in there are
03:34
criminals that's in your neighborhood oh
03:37
yeah
03:37
that's true and they're probably out in
03:39
an hour so
03:42
but the thing is is like it was for
03:44
quite minor things usually
03:46
the stock so um in england for instance
03:48
it would be for petty thieves
03:50
uh for unruly servants for hedge terrors
03:54
don't know what a hedge terror is yeah
03:56
uh gamblers drunkards ballad singers
04:00
seems harsh yeah and any kind of
04:02
travelling musicians
04:05
they were way harsh the i mean there
04:07
were there were minor crimes but they
04:08
were police quite
04:09
uh heavily so um there is a great book
04:12
called
04:12
curious punishments of bygone days which
04:15
is published in the late 19th century
04:16
and it's got all kinds of
04:18
now hilarious stories of quite a
04:21
repressive sounding time
04:22
so again in boston there was a man
04:25
called captain campbell
04:26
who was a sailor and he had uh he got
04:30
done for
04:31
publicly kissing his wife on a sunday
04:34
after returning from three years at sea
04:41
no thank you now his punishment i i
04:43
think i've mistyped it i
04:44
i have written punishment was three
04:46
years in the stock i think it was three
04:47
hours
04:48
um imagine if he was in for three years
04:52
and they came out and they kissed his
04:54
wife again they're like sorry
04:58
yeah because sometimes the things people
05:00
threw at you in the stocks were even
05:01
worse than having your feet tickled i'm
05:03
very confused that you think that was a
05:04
bad thing to do is tickle the feet of
05:06
someone passing by because often you got
05:07
dead animals thrown at you yeah um
05:10
dead dead cat was a good one in fact i
05:13
think there was a quote from someone at
05:14
the time who said
05:15
uh like if you're if someone's in the
05:17
stocks you walk past the marketplace
05:19
of an evening and someone's in the
05:20
stocks you think brilliant and a dead
05:22
cat is a treat if you can spot one of
05:23
them
05:24
and a live cat an even greater treat
05:29
but that book that book is incredible
05:30
actually so there are a few other good
05:32
uh tales of bygone punishments in this
05:35
book written in 1886
05:36
and another one is about a it tells of a
05:39
man in moscow actually in the 17th
05:41
century who'd
05:42
published a pamphlet about people's
05:44
liberties that people should be free
05:46
and so he'd gotten a lot of trouble for
05:47
saying that and so
05:49
he was sentenced to three days of being
05:51
tied to a scaffold and forced to
05:53
literally eat his words
05:55
so they got his pamphlet it's actually
05:57
very clever they got his pamphlet and
05:58
they tore it up and they fed it to him
06:01
and there was there was an eyewitness
06:03
account that said they'd serve him one
06:05
page at a time and when it got to a
06:06
stage where it looked like he might
06:07
actually be incredibly ill
06:08
they'd wait until the next day and then
06:10
keep serving it up so they didn't
06:12
they didn't cook it at all or it's
06:15
actually a misconception you can get
06:16
food poisoning from raw pamphlets
06:20
but thank goodness russia is now a
06:21
paragon of liberty
06:23
[Laughter]
06:24
um also in boston we were talking about
06:26
boston um stuff
06:27
and in 1679 there was a frenchman
06:30
who was suspected of setting a fire in
06:33
boston
06:34
and he was ordered to go to the pillory
06:36
and have both his ears cut off
06:39
for suspected arson that's amazing
06:42
but you have quite a there's quite a lot
06:44
of history isn't there in boston um
06:46
especially compared to the rest of
06:47
america because dam and i were walking
06:49
through cambridge
06:50
um yesterday and um
06:53
dan appointed to a quite new looking
06:55
building and he said you know what i
06:57
can't believe that building was built in
07:00
1588
07:02
and i said no dan that that is the
07:04
street number of that house
07:07
[Applause]
07:09
i i really i was suspicious i was like
07:12
this
07:13
this brickwork looked yeah the next one
07:15
was built in 1590 and 1592.
07:19
um whipping whipping was a thing
07:22
just to drag us back to the topic at
07:24
hand um
07:27
there was one this was obviously
07:28
whipping was absolutely huge major
07:30
league punishment
07:31
very big back then um so in one case of
07:34
whipping the man carrying it out was a
07:36
church official called the church
07:37
beedle and he wasn't he wasn't doing a
07:40
very good job of it
07:42
he was so light-handed that the sheriff
07:44
who was watching the whipping the
07:45
punishment take place
07:46
grabbed the whip from him with the
07:48
offenders but not before he had whipped
07:50
the beetle himself
07:52
for being bad at whipping that was an
07:55
offense at the time well i actually read
07:57
about that story as well so
07:59
what happened was the beadle was almost
08:01
pretending to whip him
08:02
and he had like some red ink in his hand
08:04
and he kind of went like that and then
08:06
he would smear the red ink so it looked
08:07
like he'd been
08:08
like whipped on the back when he hadn't
08:10
really i think the guy might have paid
08:11
him some money to do that
08:13
and then like you say the constable then
08:15
started whipping the beetle
08:16
but then a lady came and started beating
08:19
up the constable
08:20
he had four people attacking each other
08:23
awful violent conga
08:27
it's weird isn't it the um i was looking
08:29
into the police force here so this fact
08:31
was
08:31
1639 and it was in 1630 the
08:35
the sort of foundations of the first
08:37
ever american police force
08:38
came about so it was a night watch and
08:40
so on and it was only in the 1800s 1833
08:42
that it sort of became
08:44
officially boston police but am i right
08:46
saying police badges have
08:47
1630 written on them um
08:50
that we have no idea in this audience
08:52
very law-abiding audience very low
08:53
abiding audience
08:54
no one wants to admit to anything um no
08:57
but so yeah so they had that and um
08:59
well i found this really fun fact about
09:00
them in 1903 the boston police force got
09:03
the first ever police car
09:05
of anywhere in america but no one knew
09:07
how to drive it
09:10
so they had to hire a chauffeur
09:14
we would take them to all the crime
09:16
spots
09:16
[Music]
09:18
the whole uh transport system with the
09:20
boston police a couple years ago
09:22
they added to their fleet um a ice cream
09:25
truck
09:26
it's a part of there's an ice cream
09:27
truck what for
09:29
um they think it's sort of if they go
09:31
around you know uh maybe if the criminal
09:33
doesn't want to come out
09:35
because oh sure
09:38
they're not luring criminals out with mr
09:41
whippies
09:41
that doesn't make any sense because you
09:43
just have a queue of
09:45
small child small child small child
09:47
massive criminal
09:51
and then presumably as someone in a
09:53
policeman's hat and bad
09:55
cat candidly trying to scoop some ice
09:57
cream out
09:58
holy ice cream please
10:06
i don't need your pity clap
10:10
we're going to have to move on fairly
10:12
soon to our next fact just to think
10:13
about
10:14
putting people in the stock specifically
10:16
in in boston
10:17
and in new england um they just got way
10:19
more into it
10:20
than the english had been so they
10:22
brought it over from england when they
10:23
came and then
10:24
because they were puritan and everything
10:27
they added a whole bunch of other
10:29
crimes basically so in in britain and in
10:32
england then usually you went in the
10:33
stocks if you stole something but in
10:35
boston it really did tend to be that
10:37
you'd um if you blasphemed then you
10:38
always got it if again if you publicly
10:40
kissed your wife
10:41
then you got it um if you're an adultery
10:44
you got it
10:45
and we used to have that in in britain
10:48
you'd have a big a branded on you so
10:50
sometimes you'd be in the stocks and if
10:52
you've been found guilty of adultery
10:54
then you'd have a big a that was branded
10:55
on you and you'd have to wear on your
10:57
sort of shirt
10:58
and you'd have to wear that a for say a
11:00
year and then everyone knows
11:02
you're an adulterer which i don't know
11:03
if that's a punishment for a certain
11:05
type of
11:05
person but um that's what alvin the
11:09
chipmunk had on his dream
11:11
yeah yeah he was a terrible husband
11:15
he was a terrible terrible husband they
11:17
don't they don't bring that storyline
11:18
into it much but
11:20
we know but um anyway the americans
11:23
added up all the other letters
11:25
so they went through the alphabet so you
11:26
got a b if you're a blasphemous
11:28
uh you've got a d for drunkenness not
11:30
allowed to be drunk ever you've got an
11:32
eye for incest
11:33
uh very bad not into that and they sort
11:35
of did wow
11:37
they they completed the alphabet with
11:39
all the various different crimes
11:40
they must have struggled a bit with x
11:42
and z
11:45
zebra theft
11:50
[Applause]
11:54
it is time for fact number two and that
11:56
is andy
11:57
my fact is that five of the main types
12:00
of french baguette
12:01
are called flute fisell viennese
12:05
samanthine and bastard
12:10
so i like the way you said that half of
12:14
the french act yes
12:17
this was from a great article in the
12:18
financial times about the best baguette
12:20
in paris competition
12:22
which is called la grand prix de la
12:24
baguette
12:25
really it's really called that and
12:29
these are some of the these are just
12:31
some of the types they have and um
12:33
it's an amazing competition it's held at
12:35
the national syndicate de boulenger
12:38
and there's so many entries for the
12:40
competition every year they get hundreds
12:41
of entries
12:42
over a thousand members of the public
12:44
applied to judge because you get a kind
12:46
of
12:46
citizen judge on the panel and the
12:48
winner it's mostly a prestige thing so
12:50
you get four thousand euros you get a
12:52
smallish cash prize
12:53
but you also win the right to provide
12:56
the
12:56
president's baguettes for a year oh wow
12:59
yeah
13:01
it's very prestigious i think that
13:03
that's quite a lot of pressure on
13:04
the president i feel like macron every
13:07
day because it's every day isn't it you
13:08
make your first forget of the morning
13:09
and it gets immediately you know
13:11
a police car sort of takes it to the
13:14
with the chauffeur
13:15
yeah exactly takes it to the palace and
13:18
poor emanuel is probably going another
13:20
[ __ ] baguette oh god but do you think
13:22
everybody has to make a [ __ ]
13:24
oh my goodness your best forget yet
13:27
i'm not sure they're that good either
13:29
because i was reading that as
13:31
i know that's me um i was reading that
13:34
as part of this grand prix
13:36
uh the first of hope you have to jump
13:38
through is it has to be the correct
13:40
um length and i think it's correct
13:43
length and weight
13:44
and there are 200 entrants and a hundred
13:47
of them fail
13:48
at the length and weight section it does
13:51
feel like there's a communication
13:52
problem with the rules
13:55
but they have to be exactly between 55
13:57
centimeters and 70 centimeters
14:00
right yeah which is quite a large margin
14:02
of error
14:04
yeah and the weight has to be between
14:05
250 grams and 300 grams
14:07
what impossible precision is this
14:10
but like traditional french baguettes
14:13
like in the 19th century they were like
14:15
eight meters long were they one eight no
14:17
eight feet long
14:19
yeah wow but you would get them like
14:20
they were bigger than you they're bigger
14:22
than humans are wow
14:23
definitely bigger than french human
14:25
certainly um
14:27
if that is to the french there's not
14:29
many nationalities where everyone's
14:31
taller than ain't [ __ ]
14:36
yeah i didn't know that we got at the
14:37
french for being sure
14:39
i think you're thinking napoleon yeah
14:41
yeah and we've said before that napoleon
14:44
was above average height for a frenchman
14:45
he was taller than nelson yeah
14:47
it didn't work on a number of levels did
14:48
it um well
14:51
speaking of napoleon actually there is a
14:54
theory
14:54
which i should just say at the very top
14:56
is not true but
14:59
he was nine feet tall
15:02
there is a theory that the baguette was
15:04
invented by napoleon's bakers
15:07
and they were invented so that soldiers
15:08
could put them down their legs while
15:10
marching
15:12
and then whenever they got to wherever
15:14
they were marching to then they could
15:15
pull them out and eat them
15:16
all right i have to say you've added an
15:18
unnecessarily sexual dimension to this
15:20
theory
15:22
it was hung like a baguette i've got a
15:25
bit of a yeast infection down there
15:31
hey this is a cool thing in um so in
15:33
france baguette is not just used to
15:35
refer to sticks of bread but
15:36
um for example like chopsticks or
15:39
baguette
15:42
sure um
15:45
no but my favorite one is that a wand is
15:48
baguette magique and so in the harry
15:50
potter books
15:52
he's always pulling out his baguette
15:55
which is which
15:56
it does sound a bit napoleonic doesn't
15:58
it
16:00
there's an expression in french to lead
16:02
by the baguette
16:04
and that is because a baguette is also a
16:06
baton so it's like
16:07
walking with a marching band you lead
16:09
with your baguette
16:11
it can be a ramrod it can be a type of
16:14
diamond cut
16:14
[Music]
16:16
what's funny about ramrod boston
16:20
it's an old it's not war of independence
16:22
a joke so um
16:24
it's they've adapted the word to a huge
16:26
number of meanings given it's only been
16:28
around for a century well
16:30
it is a much smaller language um than
16:32
the english language
16:33
genuinely is small there are fewer words
16:39
and the word precedes the the bread yes
16:42
in fact
16:43
it comes from the latin word baculum
16:45
which meant
16:46
staff and a baculum as some of you know
16:49
is uh
16:50
a penis bone in you know walruses and
16:53
chimpanzees and lots of animals have
16:55
penis bones i love the way that you said
16:56
and the baculum is
16:58
and then a few people in the audience
16:59
wear penis
17:02
like it's your catchphrase or something
17:06
it's like a really weird pantomime
17:10
i understand you don't have phantom
17:11
times here everybody didn't make sense
17:16
yes
17:18
[Music]
17:20
um there's another theory about where it
17:21
came from where the word came from which
17:23
is that it was invented
17:25
just over 100 years ago when the paris
17:26
metro was being dug the paris
17:28
underground system
17:29
because apparently um workers were
17:31
carrying big loaves of bread to work
17:34
and they needed to bring knives with
17:35
them to cut it and they used to keep
17:37
getting into constant knife battles and
17:40
so
17:41
apparently the builders were tasked with
17:43
finding a baker who could
17:44
give them some bread that didn't require
17:46
a knife and i don't know what kind of
17:47
battle you can get into with a little
17:49
button actually a bread knife could be
17:50
quite dodgy couldn't if you get it on
17:52
the serrated edge
17:53
definitely but that's two of the
17:54
frenchman they look enormous those
17:58
knives
18:00
yeah this it is weird they were not
18:02
named in print until 1920.
18:04
so it is there were sort of long breads
18:06
before but um
18:08
there is a load of uh bread legislation
18:11
in
18:11
in france uh at the moment so in 1993
18:15
even as recently as that they passed a
18:17
bread decree because they were worried
18:18
about deterioration of
18:20
quality of bread and so now you can get
18:23
two very different kinds of loaf i say
18:25
very different
18:26
they are both stick french breads but um
18:29
one of them is a baguette tradition
18:31
francaise which is of the very
18:33
you know significant national historical
18:36
one and you have to make that on the
18:37
premises
18:38
you can only use about three ingredients
18:40
you know it's really precise you can't
18:42
put extra
18:43
additives or toppings or anything and
18:44
the alternative is just a baguette
18:47
did you explain why they're called
18:49
bastards i didn't actually so
18:53
they they're they're mostly named after
18:55
the shape so the flute is
18:56
thin uh the fissile is very thin uh the
18:59
the bastard is fat
19:01
so
19:03
[Applause]
19:05
i think the idea is that it's kind of
19:07
halfway between a long
19:08
thick one and a short stubby one and so
19:11
it's like
19:12
it's two things cobbled together so it's
19:13
like a bastard in that way
19:15
and is that where we get that bastard
19:19
i don't i don't think it is
19:22
to be investigated it's a shame that's
19:24
not in the harry potter books
19:27
harry pulled out his past yeah exactly
19:35
and there's some more red legislation in
19:38
france which is
19:38
very weird and it changed recently
19:41
actually so there was this widespread
19:42
panic in 2015
19:43
four years ago because they dropped a
19:45
law that has existed since 1790
19:48
which is basically when the government
19:50
ruled that everyone across
19:52
france had to have access to baguettes
19:54
at all times of the year
19:56
every day day and night and so it
19:58
required
19:59
half of paris bakeries to take holiday
20:01
in august and the other half to take
20:03
holiday in july to ensure
20:04
that suddenly there wasn't a bit of a
20:06
dearth of bakers and people couldn't get
20:08
their bread
20:09
in the morning and that has remained
20:10
until 2015 so bakers are in this
20:12
position where
20:13
you know if 50 are already on holiday on
20:16
the 2nd of july they're not allowed to
20:17
take a holiday for a month
20:19
and they were finally told these these
20:21
laws were relaxed and they were finally
20:23
told
20:23
okay you can go on holiday when you like
20:25
on the condition that you have to put up
20:27
in your window i think you have to put
20:28
up a sign
20:29
saying where the nearest baker is still
20:32
there
20:33
selling baguette and there was panic
20:36
they're like
20:37
did anything happen did they all run out
20:38
of bread all of france starved
20:41
to death can you guys guess just give me
20:44
a guess
20:45
of the longest the length of the longest
20:47
baguette
20:48
ever made i would have said probably
20:50
around 10 feet
20:51
10 feet okay in advance uh 200 meters
20:59
wow this is going to be impressive now
21:01
andy well it's not
21:03
dan's completely ruined it it was an
21:06
amazingly long bread until dan said 200
21:08
meters
21:10
it was it was a pathetic 122 meters long
21:15
which is literally half of what dan said
21:17
no don't clap a bread that long that's
21:19
rubbish
21:22
oh you absolute saboteur
21:27
i had all sorts of extra stuff about
21:28
this weird bread
21:32
i know what you're all thinking how do
21:33
you make a bread that's 122 meters long
21:35
do you get one that's 200 meters long
21:53
you know after you finish talking about
21:55
this i'm going to tell you what's wrong
21:56
anyway
21:58
wow okay well let me can i please tell
22:01
you first
22:02
because oh my god it was in 2015 it was
22:06
at the milan world expo
22:07
there were 60 bakers involved and how
22:10
did they make it 122 meters long they
22:12
made a portable
22:13
oven which slid all the but
22:16
yeah that is impressive and then they
22:19
cut it into and they spread
22:20
nutella all the way along it because
22:23
nutella was sponsoring this
22:25
attempt anyway no that's true they did
22:28
do that but that's not the longest
22:29
bugger ever
22:30
oh the record was broken this year i'm
22:32
afraid
22:33
yeah how long was it five million miles
22:45
it was 133 meters and it was done to
22:47
raise money for the italian red cross
22:49
who you've just ridiculed you're a
22:54
ridiculous guest
22:55
sorry i'm very sorry
22:58
okay it is time for fact number three
23:00
and that is
23:01
jaczynski my fight this week is that
23:04
whitney houston's
23:05
record label once sent a cease and
23:08
desist letter to saddam hussein
23:13
asking him to please stop using the song
23:15
i will always love you as part of his
23:17
political campaign
23:23
and yes it's risky to kick off with the
23:26
saddam hussein facts
23:27
in the america tour but this
23:30
it was a song that he used this was in
23:32
2002
23:33
and he was running for president against
23:36
um
23:36
nobody and
23:38
[Laughter]
23:42
it was sort of leaked in the western
23:45
media
23:46
that he'd been using as a political
23:48
campaign song
23:49
this arabic version which is basically a
23:51
knockoff version
23:52
exactly sort of verbatim and exactly the
23:54
same you know nuances and sounds as
23:56
whitney houston's song i will always
23:58
love you and so her record company
24:00
arista records got in touch and said
24:02
please stop doing that and surprisingly
24:05
enough i don't think he took a blind bit
24:06
of notice
24:08
but yeah how weird is that he did very
24:10
well in that election he got one
24:12
he got genuinely 100 of the vote because
24:14
there's normally
24:15
i was reading an article about how
24:17
dictators like to pitch it
24:18
you know do you are you modest do you
24:20
just get 90
24:22
do you do you go all in and you get 100
24:24
or do you sort of say around 95.
24:26
actually in the course of this i found
24:28
out the um the most
24:30
impressive result of all time in any
24:32
election and that was in 1927 in liberia
24:36
in the country at the time there were
24:37
fewer than 15 000 registered voters
24:39
the winner charles king won 243
24:42
000 votes turnout was one thousand six
24:47
hundred and eighty percent
24:50
and he was given a guinness world record
24:51
for fraud
24:57
and so that song of course made famous
24:59
by whitney houston but actually
25:01
uh dolly parson originally yeah
25:05
and she made an absolute fortune on the
25:07
song from when whitney houston
25:09
released it but then they asked her
25:11
about this thing with saddam hussein
25:12
and she said i was surprised as anyone
25:14
but it's too serious an issue to comment
25:17
on
25:18
not for us guys
25:22
um saddam hussein was
25:25
possible i think we can all agree but
25:28
in 1980 he was given the keys to the
25:30
city of detroit
25:32
[Music]
25:34
yes this was when he was still you know
25:36
very much in uh
25:37
in the good books of the usa and um he
25:40
had made a big donation to a detroit
25:41
church
25:42
and i read that i read an article about
25:44
it which said that he he still had them
25:46
you know even to the end um but other
25:49
key holders
25:51
they weren't on him right at the end i
25:53
mean he's not trying to get into his
25:55
bunker going i'm [ __ ] detroit
25:59
no but other people who are key holders
26:04
to the city of detroit
26:06
include santa claus stevie wonder
26:11
and elmo
26:14
what a group photo
26:21
we should at some point i think we
26:23
should move away from salaam who's
26:24
saying
26:25
yeah so just something about
26:28
campaign songs yeah america does a very
26:31
good line
26:31
in cool campaign songs for your
26:34
presidential campaigns it's almost the
26:35
highlight of your presidential campaigns
26:37
but um i like bob dole so do you know
26:40
what bob dole chose in 1996 when he he
26:43
ran against clinton
26:44
he um he so used the song soul man
26:48
as in written by isaac hayes david
26:51
porter in the 60s a big kind of
26:53
civil rights anthem isaac hayes who was
26:55
the voice of chef in south park as well
26:58
[Music]
26:59
so this big civil rights
27:00
african-american anthem and he used it
27:03
but he changed the lyrics to
27:05
dole man
27:09
incredible and not only this i can't
27:11
believe he did this it was performed by
27:13
sam and dave like a duo who sang it and
27:16
sam actually re-recorded it
27:17
how ignominious is that with the lyrics
27:20
dole man
27:21
um and then he so he changed the lyrics
27:23
he sung it a bit and then the writers
27:24
got in touch and said we really don't
27:26
endorse you at all
27:27
nothing to do with this song please go
27:28
away um and also it didn't work
27:30
at all anyway because it sounded either
27:32
like a dull man or
27:34
souled man when he's done
27:37
it and they do like their puns don't
27:39
they in their campaign slogans there's
27:41
been loads of good ones oh well good
27:44
so um ulysses s grant said grant us
27:47
another
27:48
term um thomas e dewey when he was up
27:50
against roosevelt said
27:52
dewey or don't we and
27:55
did he did he win no thomas yeah he
27:58
famously was the president no of course
28:00
he didn't win
28:04
there was alfred landon who was up
28:06
against fdr and he said let's make it a
28:08
london
28:09
slide very good
28:12
yeah it's funny because all these people
28:14
were on the losing side weren't they
28:16
okay here's someone who's on the winning
28:18
side franklin pierce
28:19
he said we poked you in 44
28:23
we shall pierce you in 52.
28:27
wow and then it really was another time
28:30
wasn't it
28:31
and then four years later james buchanan
28:34
came in
28:35
and he said we poked him in 44 we
28:38
pierced him in 52
28:39
and we'll book him in 56.
28:44
yeah there was another one and so
28:45
stephen douglas another famous
28:47
u.s president not uh so he ran against
28:50
lincoln
28:51
and he had a song written or he wrote a
28:54
song
28:54
which i don't know what the tune was but
28:56
it was about kind of how uh
28:58
people were always going on about how
28:59
lincoln was this kind of saint it was
29:01
like tell us how great he is how he
29:03
seeks his closet every night to kneel
29:05
and pray
29:05
any lie you tell will swallow swallow
29:07
any kind of mixture
29:08
but oh don't we beg and pray you don't
29:11
for god's sake show his picture
29:13
because he was so ugly oh really
29:17
i know right and now we think of him as
29:20
quite a noble looking character but
29:21
apparently back in the day
29:22
yeah maybe not hot he was eight feet
29:24
tall
29:27
only only with the hat yeah you don't
29:30
know what happened when you take the hat
29:31
off it might have been a really tall
29:33
thought yeah he could fit an entire
29:35
frenchman
29:36
under that hand george w bush
29:41
he relied on tom petty's single i won't
29:44
back down
29:45
during his 2000 campaign uh he then got
29:48
a cease and desist letter from tom petty
29:50
and immediately back down
29:58
there's a good sort of argument that you
29:59
should not get into politics because
30:01
when you do you just find out
30:02
that all your heroes hate you like it's
30:05
well it's really
30:06
so this is the thing so there are all
30:07
these stories about musicians
30:08
complaining but basically if you're
30:10
playing at a venue which has a public
30:12
music license you can play their songs
30:16
basically yeah so
30:17
i mean this happens lots and lots and we
30:19
should say so people who have
30:21
um asked donald trump to stop using
30:23
their song
30:24
or declined his you know said please
30:27
please don't play that
30:28
have included neil young rem twisted
30:31
sister
30:31
adele elton john the rolling stones
30:34
queen
30:35
george dead george harrison's estate
30:39
dead pavarotti's estate stephen tyler of
30:41
aerosmith
30:42
dead prince's estate pharrell rihanna
30:45
guns and roses and neil young
30:46
again
30:49
i'm interested that neil young is the
30:51
one who they went back to twice
30:53
do you think he was the one they thought
30:55
okay who was sort of the like the least
30:57
against us
30:58
yeah we're gonna have to move on to our
31:00
final fact very shortly
31:01
uh on political songs um so
31:05
when america first became independent
31:07
they they kind of
31:09
took god save the queen or god save the
31:11
king
31:12
and they just added their own lyrics so
31:15
they had
31:15
god save great washington god save the
31:18
13 states
31:19
god save america but it was all to the
31:21
same tune as god save the king
31:23
until they stuck on the theme tune that
31:25
they have now
31:33
okay it is time for our final fact of
31:35
the show and that is
31:37
james okay my fact this week is that in
31:40
1898 a boston magazine
31:43
described the game of croquet as a
31:46
source of slumbering depravity
31:49
a veritable frankenstein monster of
31:52
recreation
31:57
and we've got a lot of depraved people
31:59
in tonight
32:01
so basically when like croquet was quite
32:04
uh
32:05
an elitist sport in the uk and then it
32:07
came over to america and everyone
32:09
started playing it became like a game
32:10
that everyone loved to play like the
32:12
whole country played it and
32:14
it was really thought to be quite
32:16
depraved
32:18
and there are a few reasons for this one
32:20
reason was people were like gambling on
32:21
it a little bit
32:22
but another reason is because men and
32:24
women played together
32:25
and often when women would play their
32:27
shots
32:28
boston are you still that puritan
32:33
we're all going immediately into the
32:34
stocks after tonight's show
32:37
so women would deliberately shorten
32:39
their dresses to play more comfortably
32:41
they've as they play the sh
32:43
i know as they played a shot they might
32:46
lift a skirt and show a bit of ankle
32:51
this article it is amazing like it's so
32:54
fervent that it all like it you know i i
32:57
you sort of think my god is this person
32:59
serious it's really
33:00
so the article that i read it in sorry
33:03
it is um it's in jstor and it's by a
33:04
historian called john stern gas
33:07
and it's called cheating gender roles in
33:08
the 19th century
33:10
croquet crates oh nice so the
33:13
and also the other thing was croquet it
33:15
is a devious game because
33:17
you get the no it is it is you know
33:19
there's a lot of
33:20
um sort of mucking around you can do
33:22
with your opponent's piece
33:24
it's like basically chess but you can
33:25
move the other guy's bishop like it's
33:26
mean
33:27
um and it's so nothing like
33:31
chess it is unbelievably like chess it
33:33
is unbelievably like chess
33:34
it's not i will go i will go to the wall
33:37
for this
33:38
there is a lot of tactical play i read
33:40
somewhere
33:41
saying it's a bit like chess and i
33:43
thought what kind of idiot
33:44
that's my word you've been reading my
33:46
blog i'm very glad
33:48
um but have you ever played chess with
33:50
andy where he comes with a mallet and
33:51
just smashes it
33:55
but it does it does provoke it's so
33:58
frustrating if you're losing at croquet
34:00
because your opponent just
34:01
uses your ball to get their ball all the
34:03
way around the course and this article
34:04
that you are quoting the the 1898 one
34:06
it said it is not long before every
34:09
honorable feeling
34:10
every dictate of morality has become
34:12
obliterated
34:14
in place of our refined and upright
34:15
people are two pairs of gruesome moral
34:18
monstrosities
34:20
the poison of croquet eats deeper and
34:22
deeper into their souls
34:24
i know it's really good like
34:27
so milton bradley who made these croquet
34:29
sets
34:30
they had the rules and one of the first
34:32
rules in capital letters
34:34
was keep your temper
34:38
the philadelphia evening bulletin called
34:40
it the destroyer of lifelong friendships
34:42
and a ruiner of happy homes
34:45
the international herald tribune
34:47
reported that a woman testified during a
34:49
separation hearing
34:50
that her husband refused to speak to her
34:52
for days
34:53
after she questioned whether his ball
34:55
had really gone through the hoop
34:57
[Applause]
34:59
okay first of all why on earth did that
35:01
get to court in the first place i read
35:03
that it was like the judge
35:04
said that this who's going to court
35:06
their husband didn't speak to them it
35:08
feels like there were underlying issues
35:09
in that relationship because it does
35:11
no but my my friend back in england um
35:14
she broke up with her boyfriend over a
35:15
game of croquet
35:16
really really and i was part of that
35:18
game and i have to say
35:19
i was the one who went that guy's got to
35:21
go because he was
35:22
horrific in this game he did exactly
35:24
what andy was saying he was
35:26
he was playing chess um
35:31
that doesn't mean anything
35:35
unless he was literally holding a
35:36
chessboard and playing chess
35:38
while playing croquet but it's you think
35:40
several moves ahead
35:42
you're the most controversial thing
35:46
about it so croquet was kind of a
35:48
feminist moment and the reason it was so
35:50
controversial largely
35:51
was because it was the first game ever
35:53
that women had played and
35:54
majority so every croquet set had on the
35:57
front of it a picture of a woman playing
35:58
croquet and this was crazy
36:00
between 1860 and 1890 you know women
36:03
weren't allowed to
36:04
leave the house if they rode a bike
36:05
they're in trouble and they were all
36:07
playing croquet
36:08
and not only that but it turns out they
36:10
were all heinous cheats
36:12
and so this this really pissed people
36:14
off
36:15
and so there's there was this big theme
36:17
that women were terrible cheaters in all
36:19
games um
36:20
there was i think added to the official
36:21
rules of croquet uh
36:23
when they were codified was this manual
36:25
that said don't cheat
36:26
we are aware the young ladies are fond
36:29
of cheating because
36:30
in quotes it is such fun and they think
36:32
the men like it
36:35
there are very good ways you can cheat
36:37
if you're a lady playing croquet
36:39
so it because ladies at the time were
36:40
very long uh
36:42
and often hooped skirts which come out
36:44
quite far so it's the work of a moment
36:46
to just walk over
36:47
to your ball just stand on top of it no
36:50
one can see because the skirts on the
36:52
ground all the way around
36:52
kick it over a bit into position and
36:55
then suddenly you're lined up for the
36:56
next shot
36:56
that's very clever that's very cool
36:58
there was it was an olympic sport at one
37:00
point wasn't it
37:01
what was that sorry it was an olympic
37:03
sport for one year uh yeah in the 1900s
37:05
1900s
37:06
in france in france yeah
37:09
they could barely move the balls
37:17
it was like the borrowers yeah
37:23
uh yeah nobody but the french did really
37:24
well in it didn't they no they well
37:26
they were the only it was a bit of a
37:27
saddam hussein moment they were the only
37:29
people who took part and they won all
37:31
the medals yeah
37:32
sorry the next olympics the 1904
37:35
olympics
37:36
croquet was kicked out but then the
37:37
american version of croquet which is
37:39
called
37:40
roque was then done at the 1904 olympics
37:43
and it was purely americans who played
37:45
it and won all the medals there
37:47
as well and yeah well done you guys
37:50
yeah but this is this is my i think this
37:53
is my favorite fact about um
37:54
what we found for this fact is that uh
37:57
rogue
37:58
so rogue is the american version the way
38:01
they got the name wrote it was invented
38:03
by a guy called samuel crosby he was
38:04
from new york and this was in 1899 and
38:07
he came to it
38:08
by removing the c from the front of the
38:10
word and the t
38:12
at the end of the word and that's it
38:16
wow is it that if you read wrote
38:18
websites that's like the legendary story
38:20
um yes it's q-u-e
38:24
well you know the reason why it was
38:25
dropped from the 1900 olympics
38:27
it's because one person turned up to
38:28
watch it yes there was one spectator and
38:31
there were seven players
38:32
yeah it was um it was an english guy who
38:34
was living in nice and he came all the
38:36
way over from nice to paris to watch the
38:38
first matches he didn't even watch the
38:39
final
38:41
and the reason that the french won it
38:44
and the french were the only people who
38:45
took part is because there was a group
38:46
of croquet players who lived in paris
38:49
and they didn't want any foreigners
38:50
playing at all and so they made it so
38:53
all the games took place over like three
38:55
or four months
38:56
and so no one could afford to stay in
38:58
paris for that whole time and so there's
38:59
only people who live there who could
39:01
play it
39:02
yeah sneaky so you had a courageous
39:04
cheating um
39:06
actually sorry can i just say that
39:08
olympics um so
39:10
there weren't that many spectators any
39:11
of the sports really um apart from
39:14
in the discus there was quite a few
39:15
because it was in the bladder below
39:17
so a lot of locals were there but the
39:19
1896 discus champion who came to the
39:22
1900 olympics
39:23
he managed to dispatch his discus into
39:26
the crowd on all three throws
39:31
is that extra points or a bonus prize
39:34
[Music]
39:35
do you guys know who invented croquet no
39:38
no it was a guy well his name's quite
39:40
controversial which is why i raise it
39:42
but um
39:43
it was a guy called walter thomas jones
39:45
whitmore he was an english guy
39:47
and i've actually he invented it in
39:48
charleston house which i've been to in
39:50
england it's a lovely place i've played
39:52
croquet on the lawn
39:53
um it's just that kind of life i lead
39:57
um but he was called so he was called
40:00
walter thomas jones whitmore
40:01
but he was born walter thomas whitmore
40:04
jones
40:04
the reason he changed his name which he
40:07
did in 1867
40:09
was because his best friend was called
40:10
willie dickens and they used to go for
40:12
walks together
40:13
down regent street and he got really
40:15
sick of willie dickens making a joke
40:17
every time they passed the drapery
40:18
dickens and jones at regent street and
40:21
going oh it's you and me mate
40:23
look at you and me dickinson jones so
40:25
[ __ ] it i'm gonna drop the surname jones
40:27
wow wow that's amazing that's petty
40:30
yeah it's very messy
40:34
we should talk a bit about modern
40:35
croquet because croquet's really
40:37
exciting today because they've
40:40
guys it is it is thank you
40:44
andy's actually an official commentator
40:46
back home in the uk
40:48
it's amazing commentary oh what a great
40:50
chess move he's just made there
40:54
there's a new game in town it's called
40:56
golf croquet and it's got
40:57
much less of the chess actually it's
40:59
much more it's a speed and
41:01
a speed game basically yeah yeah yeah
41:04
um it's uh
41:07
the champion uh the american champion is
41:10
called ben rothman one of the actually
41:12
egypt is one of the best countries in
41:13
the world at golf croquet they
41:14
they clean up they win all the awards
41:16
men's and women's they're really really
41:17
good at it
41:18
anyway the american champion ben rothman
41:20
was profiled by the san francisco
41:22
chronicle
41:23
and the entire interview red is
41:24
basically one long sick burn
41:26
on him so it started off ben rothman is
41:29
the champion of the world and
41:30
practically
41:31
no one knows it and and they do a series
41:34
of box pops over the course of the
41:36
interview with people
41:37
who are saying yeah i've never heard of
41:39
him uh
41:40
a few feet away from where he is
41:42
practicing his game
41:45
um so and the article ends at lake merit
41:48
the parade of passersby who had no idea
41:50
they were in the presence of greatness
41:51
continued
41:53
croquet doesn't do anything for me said
41:55
alex pineda who was walking by the
41:56
croquet ground
41:57
with his dog dominic for whom croco did
41:59
nothing either
42:04
it just ends with the line i think it's
42:06
cool that he's world champion
42:07

[Music]
01:32
hello and
01:35
welcome to another episode of no such
01:37
thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:40
this week coming to you live from
01:42
philadelphia
01:49
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
01:51
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
01:53
murray and james harkin and once again
01:55
we have gathered around the microphones
01:57
with our four
01:57
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:59
and in no particular order
02:01
here we go starting with you andy
02:04
my fact is that the star of the film
02:07
candyman
02:08
where a character has bees coming out of
02:10
his mouth negotiated a one thousand
02:12
dollar bonus for every time he got stung
02:16
he ended up with twenty three thousand
02:17
dollars
02:20
wow do you how bad is it to be stung by
02:22
a bee do you think you'd be deliberately
02:24
angering the bees so that you got a few
02:26
more stings a bit more money
02:28
or not i would yeah but that says more
02:31
about me than it does about
02:33
um yeah although in the mouth i imagine
02:35
it would be a lot more painful
02:36
than normal so this is candy man this is
02:38
uh tony todd
02:40
this is a kind of cult horror film and
02:42
one of the inspirations was from the
02:44
johnny carson show
02:45
where there was a man called norman gary
02:48
who was a b
02:48
based performer and he had an he had an
02:51
act where he played the clarinet while
02:53
covered in bees
02:54
and people loved this and he then became
02:57
the bee
02:58
wrangler the official bee person on
03:00
candyman
03:01
yeah and i think it's him and tony todd
03:04
they're the only two people to have done
03:05
all three candy man films is the star
03:08
and the bee guy wow can you explain can
03:10
you explain what candy man is because i
03:12
haven't seen it
03:13
so it's uh uh dan you you watch oh yeah
03:16
yeah it's a horror film um there's a guy
03:19
who has a hook
03:19
and if you say his name into a mirror
03:21
five times he kills you
03:22
so you in theory you shouldn't do that
03:24
but people's they do
03:26
yeah sometimes we said it so far
03:30
um but it was written by clive barker
03:32
the great horror writer i think he did
03:34
hellraiser as well
03:35
and the bees that they use actually
03:37
there is a logic it wasn't bees that
03:39
were just ready and furious and waiting
03:41
to sting
03:42
um they made sure that the bees were
03:43
only 12 hours old so imagine you've just
03:46
been born
03:47
and you're suddenly in a hollywood movie
03:49
it's it's incredible and uh so yeah so
03:52
they they went into the mouth
03:53
and um the idea is that the stings
03:55
wouldn't be sharp enough even when he
03:57
was stung it wouldn't have the sting
03:59
of a say 14 hour old bee
04:02
and once uh they'd done each take the
04:05
bees would be vacuumed up using a tiny
04:07
bee vacuum
04:08
did you know that you can get a bee
04:09
vacuum cleaner yeah how's that different
04:11
from a normal vacuum cleaner i think
04:13
it's just a little bit kinder on the
04:14
bees i would guess
04:15
um it was it was a mini one like it was
04:17
yeah it's different because it's a b
04:19
size not like a beer would use it as a
04:21
vacuum cleaner
04:23
and they'd be sucked up and then
04:24
returned to their dressing room for the
04:26
you know sort of to await the next
04:28
take wow they didn't have their own
04:30
dressing room did they do you mean i
04:32
bought
04:32
a wooden box i think yeah oh you've seen
04:35
our dressing room tonight
04:37
it's full of beans
04:40
but actually the main thing is with this
04:42
b bearding thing which is what the
04:43
clarinetist did okay so what you do is
04:45
you get a queen bee
04:47
and you put it in a little cage by your
04:48
face and then all of the other bees kind
04:50
of come along because they like the
04:52
queen bee so much and they hang around
04:53
your face
04:54
and the way that you get them off
04:55
normally is you spend maybe a couple of
04:57
hours getting them on so you have a
04:58
massive b beard and then you just jump
05:00
in the air and when you land all the
05:02
bees just disappear
05:04
no they don't disappear they just stop
05:06
holding on to your face
05:08
that's amazing yeah does it and does
05:09
that not uh irritate them
05:11
um a little bit you might get stung a
05:13
few times but then you walk backwards
05:15
and someone's kind of firing
05:16
um smoke in your face so that they're
05:18
getting a bit sleepy a little bit drowsy
05:20
and then you can get away that's so
05:22
crazy
05:23
that's so weird because virginia madsen
05:25
who i think was um
05:26
the lead female character in the film
05:29
said it used to take
05:30
ages for the their bee wranglers to
05:32
sweep the bees out well yeah because
05:33
what they did with them
05:34
is they kind of smeared their face in
05:36
the pheromone
05:38
yeah and so the bees just really did not
05:39
want to leave them yeah she said that um
05:42
it basically you have pheromones on them
05:44
so they're all in love with you
05:46
that's nice isn't it she was allergic to
05:48
bees i think she was very slightly
05:50
wasted
05:51
the director said no you're not you're
05:52
just afraid
05:53
[Laughter]
05:57
um this guy norman gary the b wrangler
05:59
he has a guinness world record that is
06:01
obviously b related but it is for most
06:04
bees in her mouth
06:06
wow really yeah any guesses um
06:10
i would say about fourteen fourteen four
06:13
one four fourteen
06:14
fourteen sixty-five sixty-five
06:16
sixty-five um
06:17
yeah um 66. okay
06:21
by an incredibly dubious method dan wins
06:25
but you're still out he had 109 live
06:28
bees in his mouth at one time
06:30
and you have to you get a sponge soaked
06:33
in sugar
06:34
and they like that obviously so they
06:35
always seek that out so that's
06:37
you can sort of train them to go where
06:39
you want them to go by that with that
06:40
sponge
06:40
so then he um put it in his mouth you
06:43
have to close your mouth for 10 seconds
06:44
for the record to be valid
06:46
so they're all in there and then you put
06:47
a mesh cage up to your lips
06:49
you blow them all into the cage at the
06:51
same time then you close the bag
06:53
and then you to to do the count you have
06:55
to allow them to escape one by one
06:57
while you tally them until then you
06:59
don't know if you've got the record
07:00
because you've just got a load of bees
07:01
in your mouth
07:03
it's easier to count them out than it is
07:04
to count them in i guess yeah i see that
07:08
hey i was looking into horror movies
07:10
generally because i i realized i just
07:12
don't know much about sort of like the
07:13
behind the scenes of movies uh found
07:15
this really fun fact which is the omen
07:17
the movie the omen
07:18
so damien who is it's now the classic
07:21
name for
07:21
yeah so he wasn't meant to be called
07:23
damien
07:25
yeah originally the screenwriter david
07:27
seltzer he wanted to name
07:29
the antichrist domlin um d-o-m-l-i-n
07:33
and the reason he wanted to call him
07:34
domlin is because he knew a donlin who
07:36
was a totally
07:37
obnoxious brat he said it was a friend
07:40
it was
07:41
the child of a friend of his and it was
07:44
his wife the screenwriter's wife who
07:45
went you can't do this to tomlin
07:48
immortalize him as the antichrist in the
07:50
movie it's not they're not going to go
07:52
well it might be another dumbling
07:54
yeah exactly so it's damien but yeah it
07:58
should have been dominant wow
07:59
but now all the damien's get that it
08:01
seems unfair but at least there are all
08:03
the damien's there's not just one damien
08:05
in the world
08:06
who knows it's about him they used to
08:08
have a lot of horror movies within
08:10
sexton
08:10
like this one candy man with the bees
08:13
with it between
08:14
1966 and 1978 there were six major films
08:18
featuring bees as the main horror in
08:21
that film
08:21
wow one of them was called the swarm
08:24
and the sunday times has says it's the
08:26
worst film ever made
08:29
um richard belton the wilmington morning
08:31
star said the swamp
08:32
may not be the worst movie ever made
08:34
i'll have to see them all to be sure
08:37
but it's certainly as bad as any i've
08:39
ever seen
08:40
all the actors involved in this fiasco
08:42
should be ashamed
08:44
apparently it's absolutely awful it's
08:46
got michael kane in it
08:48
it cost them tons it was really
08:49
expensive the budget was like 20 million
08:52
it came out in the same year as star
08:53
wars um which was made for a lot less
08:56
money
08:56
and it's basically about a load of
08:58
killer bees now
08:59
the american bee association decided to
09:02
do a cease and desist to the swamp for
09:04
defaming the american honeybee
09:07
and as a result at the end of the movie
09:09
there's a disclaimer saying that the
09:10
killer bees in the film
09:12
are no resemblance to real crop
09:14
pollinating honeybees
09:17
that is so good or some resemblance i
09:20
mean
09:21
i i was reading about this one too it
09:23
does sound absolutely amazing it's 2
09:24
hours and 40 minutes long which is
09:26
hefty michael caine said that he only
09:29
did it because his mother needed a house
09:30
to live in
09:31
um it's quite sweet but also he they
09:34
kept they kept fighting all the way
09:35
through the film they were because they
09:36
they filmed it with nearly a million
09:38
bees there was a big
09:39
huge cast uh basically um huge cut what
09:42
the credits at the end
09:43
b1 b2 b3 but the cast and the crew they
09:47
kept finding little yellow dots on their
09:49
clothing because of all the bees and
09:50
michael caine would eat that
09:52
uh before eventually being informed that
09:54
that was not honey he was eating but
09:55
that was just b
09:57
excrement that he'd casually been
09:59
snacking on throughout the filming wow
10:01
yeah that's when you do need to be with
10:03
a little vacuum cleaner don't you
10:06
the cleaner bee another horror film
10:09
which involves sort of
10:10
animals going nuts was the birds and
10:13
that they had a bird trainer in the
10:14
birds and in fact he's a guy called ray
10:16
beric
10:17
and he trained all birds in all films
10:19
that you've seen with birds in for about
10:20
20 years
10:21
so like the birdman of alcotron is
10:22
another big one and um he has such cool
10:25
tricks so you know if you i don't know
10:26
if you've seen the birds but
10:27
there are lots of scenes where the birds
10:29
like fly towards the lens of the camera
10:30
and attack it
10:31
and they put meat in the lenses of the
10:33
camera so the birds would fly at it
10:36
but if you re it was quite weird because
10:37
there are no special effects in that so
10:39
they just had these birds attacking them
10:41
all the time
10:42
and the lead actor in it said it was rod
10:44
taylor who was the lead actor who said
10:46
there was one particular raven
10:47
who absolutely hated him and ravens do
10:50
take against people we've discussed this
10:51
before so he said he'd get up go on to
10:53
set
10:53
every day this raven would immediately
10:55
turn up next to him and go
10:57
and start just biting him manically and
11:00
every day on set he'd say
11:02
look is archie working today being the
11:05
raven
11:06
and he'd always turn up and it was
11:08
really sad because tippy hedren who was
11:09
his co-star
11:11
also uh had a relationship with a raven
11:13
but she had a really nice one so raven
11:14
befriended her
11:15
loved her they couldn't actually use
11:17
that raven in the film because it was
11:19
too nice
11:20
but imagine if you watch the movie and
11:22
they're all attacking her but one of
11:23
them is just kind of on her shoulders
11:26
leave them alone leave them alone
11:30
[Applause]
11:31
[Music]
11:33
uh okay it is time for fact number two
11:35
and that is my fact
11:36
uh my fact this week is that as well as
11:39
using crash test dummies
11:41
volvo tests its cars with a crash test
11:44
moose they have a crash test
11:47
moose which as far as i can tell is
11:49
called moosis um
11:52
so this is done in sweden it's uh
11:55
they have a 790 pound moose surrogate
11:57
and they make it from a stack of 114
11:59
rubber disks
12:00
and the idea is that it's sort of
12:02
sitting in front of a car
12:03
so rather that it's not the moose inside
12:05
the car as a crash test dummy
12:08
it's sitting in a distance and they ram
12:10
the car into it
12:11
and it splays itself all over the car so
12:14
it's just to show the damage that's
12:15
being done to the car
12:16
actually it's really it's really
12:18
important isn't it because if you're
12:19
driving along and there's an animal in
12:21
the way a lot of people say really
12:22
the best thing to do is not to swerve by
12:24
the way because you might hit a tree or
12:25
another car
12:26
you basically should keep going but with
12:29
a moose you definitely shouldn't do that
12:31
and the reason being on the shop people
12:33
here know but basically they're they've
12:35
got spindly legs and a massive big
12:37
off body and so you go into those
12:40
legs
12:41
and they just like matchsticks just go
12:43
and then the body just hits you at the
12:45
right height
12:46
right into you and it's really really
12:48
dangerous there is amazing footage of
12:50
the crash tests
12:51
happening and it's yeah the top of the
12:53
car just gets taken out basically but
12:54
there are i think there are yeah did you
12:55
say there are two of these
12:56
no only two on the planet but they are
12:59
both in
13:00
sweden basically well you do need it in
13:02
sweden because that's where they have a
13:03
lot of moose
13:04
of course i'm not saying it's a bad idea
13:05
i think yeah yeah no it's
13:07
a very good idea i'm surprised there is
13:08
one in canada to be honest yeah yeah so
13:10
but
13:10
the thing with moose in sweden is there
13:12
are so many moose in sweden
13:14
that if you're traveling across a
13:16
highway you will pass within a thousand
13:18
feet of a moose every 23 seconds on
13:21
average
13:22
whoa but it's just one moose and he's
13:24
really fast
13:29
isn't that amazing yeah incredible they
13:31
do have really cool
13:32
so there's a place in uh rural virginia
13:35
called the
13:36
insurance institute for highway safety
13:38
and it's their testing center
13:39
and it's where they do a lot of uh crash
13:41
testing for cars
13:43
but they occasionally will have sort of
13:45
fun um
13:46
derbies between different cars well what
13:48
do you mean i've really oversold that
13:50
basically i wasn't that excited about it
13:54
well for their 50th birthday they had a
13:56
grudge match between a 1959 bel air and
13:59
a 2009 malibu
14:00
and what do you mean they just crash
14:02
into each other yeah yeah it was to show
14:03
how much safer cars are these days
14:05
because the beautiful old 1950s car
14:07
the whole front just really crumples and
14:09
the the other one doesn't
14:11
wow it's a good news story in many ways
14:12
style haven't you in that nice old car
14:15
i guess so but they really had to
14:17
persuade people that safety was a good
14:18
idea for cars
14:20
like car like death in car accidents
14:23
kept creeping up and up and up and the
14:24
car industry kept saying
14:25
god yeah it's awful but what are we
14:28
gonna do about it
14:29
and they really had to persuade them so
14:32
ford introduced a car in 1956 which had
14:35
a steering wheel where the steering
14:36
wheel if you hit something the steering
14:37
wheel column
14:38
would deform on impact this is a good
14:41
thing because it means
14:42
you don't get hit in the middle of the
14:44
chest by a spike of metal basically
14:46
the car was not popular despite being
14:48
sold with that it was
14:50
very much outsold by other cars which
14:51
had very dangerous steering columns
14:53
the first crash test dummies were live
14:56
humans
14:57
so they so there was this this happened
15:00
a few times actually but from like the
15:01
1950s they started testing uh
15:03
like the crash impact on human bodies
15:05
and there was a researcher called
15:06
lawrence patrick
15:08
and he basically volunteered himself and
15:11
he made the point that
15:12
actually that you know people have been
15:13
talking about using inanimate objects or
15:15
things like the dummies we have today
15:17
but you can crash a dummy into a car as
15:20
many times as you like and go oh look
15:22
it's really dented here and its heads
15:23
exploded and
15:24
his foot fell off but you don't actually
15:26
know what that would mean if it was a
15:28
live human
15:29
you don't actually know if the dummy's
15:30
dead so like but would this kill a human
15:34
right he um so this guy from 1960 to
15:37
1975 was a human crash test dummy
15:40
and he used to do things like um he took
15:42
a 50-pound metal pendulum to the chest
15:45
repeatedly
15:46
and that was to test the steering column
15:48
so he used to break ribs and things like
15:50
that
15:50
um part of his job was hurling his knee
15:52
repeatedly against a metal bar
15:54
that's amazing uh yeah he took over 400
15:57
deceleration rides
15:58
to that and that's where you sort of
15:59
simulate the feeling of a crash and yeah
16:02
it sounds horrendous and him and his
16:03
students would lie down and they'd have
16:05
stuff like what's called a gravity
16:06
impactor
16:07
where you'd have to be lying down and
16:09
you had kind of this like metal rod
16:11
suspended above your cheek and then it
16:13
would just jab you
16:14
in the cheek it'd be like a robot jab
16:16
you repeatedly and harder and harder in
16:17
the cheek
16:18
to see how much you could take and once
16:19
you said you couldn't take it anymore
16:21
they weren't well let's make cars that
16:22
don't inflict more than that
16:26
but let's bring it right up to that
16:27
point wow and he was that guy was
16:30
lawrence patrick you say yeah and it was
16:31
one of his students called harold mertz
16:33
who went on to develop the first
16:35
or the standard crash test dummy right
16:37
so it was based on all that kind of
16:39
stuff oh wow because he has such a
16:40
traumatic experience here
16:42
dummies are they are getting older we're
16:45
all getting older
16:47
who are getting older the dummies
16:49
they're being made to be
16:50
older now oh they're made older as in
16:52
when they're first
16:54
oh right yeah because how does that work
16:56
as in the bones aren't as strong
16:57
they're a bit more fragile basically
16:59
because people are getting older
17:01
again back to your point james we're all
17:02
getting older but
17:04
uh drivers drivers are getting uh
17:06
society's aging so
17:08
you know the crash test dummies which
17:09
simulate uh you know a strapping
17:11
young person in their prime uh are not a
17:14
realistic way of simulating what's
17:15
happening
17:16
if you're driving and you're 120 years
17:18
old you know
17:19
and faster as well they're getting
17:20
aren't they because we're getting fatter
17:22
or and sort of more varied there's this
17:24
problem with dummies and it happens with
17:25
all technology where
17:27
it says uh this standard dummy's been
17:29
made for the average man
17:30
and so then we've proven the uh that's
17:33
that's
17:34
how strong this car is and it's always a
17:35
man and it's always western man
17:38
and they finally clocked onto the fact
17:39
that not everyone on earth is a western
17:41
man
17:41
and so obviously like women tend to be
17:44
lighter different parts of their body a
17:45
bit weaker
17:46
and so now they've finally started
17:48
making dummies that are like vary in
17:50
size but one of the things is they've
17:51
had to get fatter i think the average
17:53
american has put on just over two stone
17:57
um in the last 20 years 25 years
18:00
okay so the dummy's about to follow suit
18:01
yeah
18:03
28 pounds 28 pounds sorry
18:07
yeah okay well that's not much weight to
18:11
put on over
18:12
25 years you're actually keeping quite
18:13
fit if that's all you put on in that
18:14
period
18:16
you don't gradually put on more and more
18:18
weight each year that's not how it's but
18:20
it's not like a healthy one sorry as a
18:21
man in this 40s yes you do
18:22
[Laughter]
18:26
um i've got something that you might
18:27
like then oh yeah there is a theory
18:29
that crash test dummies explain the
18:31
roswell landings
18:32
jesus what so
18:35
this is a claim that was made about
18:37
crashless tummies that people might have
18:38
mistaken crash test dummies being used
18:40
in parachute drops if you're testing a
18:42
parachute you want to see how hard
18:43
you know someone hits the ground with
18:45
that particular parachute yeah so maybe
18:47
the air force were collecting in crash
18:48
test dummies and mistook them for alien
18:50
bodies being collected in
18:51
right because that's where a lot of
18:52
military testing might happen and these
18:54
were six foot long things and they were
18:56
hairless and they were made of a weird
18:57
rubbery substance
18:58
yeah yeah so it's not a widely adhered
19:00
theory no
19:01
it's obviously aliens but i can't
19:03
believe it yeah
19:04
i can't believe you thought that would
19:06
excite me what i wanted you to say is
19:07
aliens are real
19:11
speaking of theories and adhering
19:15
to tenuous very tenuous let's go with it
19:18
google has invented a new
19:19
thing which is human fly paper and the
19:22
idea is if you have a self-driving car
19:24
you put this fly paper on the front of
19:26
your car
19:27
and one of the problems or one of the
19:28
main ways that people get injured if
19:30
they get hit by cars
19:31
it's not even the first impact is where
19:33
you get thrown
19:34
and you end up hitting your head on the
19:36
floor or stuff like that or you get run
19:38
over
19:38
and so they think that what might happen
19:40
is you drive along
19:42
you hit pedestrian instead of throwing
19:44
them over they stick to the car
19:46
oh wow and then you can slow down and
19:49
then they can just unstick themselves
19:52
there must be so many situations though
19:54
where you're late to somewhere and
19:55
you're like i'm sorry i'm just going to
19:56
have to go
19:57
and you're on passing cars on the
19:59
highway with a dude stuck to the front
20:04
oh i found a great uh moose-related
20:05
headline because i was looking up some
20:07
moose facts as well
20:08
this is a headline from uh south dakota
20:11
is it kilo land or kelo land
20:14
all right no one knows and i think it's
20:18
fair to say no one here cares
20:22
okay let's say kilo land news
20:25
this is a genuine local news headline in
20:27
south dakota
20:28
moose moves from one field into another
20:30
field
20:32
this is a real local new store it goes
20:33
on be on alert driving near the marion
20:35
road exit on interstate 90.
20:37
a little after five thursday night a
20:39
combine scared the moose
20:40
clearly just one moose involved in this
20:42
whole state scared the moose out of one
20:44
field and into another
20:46
this is the same moose that's been
20:47
hanging out in the area north of
20:48
southwestern sioux falls since monday
20:53
so maybe there's a reason that nobody
20:55
here has been to south dakota is all i'm
20:56
trying to say
20:59
[Applause]
20:59
[Music]
21:01
as we move on let's move on to our next
21:03
fact uh it is time for fact number three
21:05
and that is james okay my fact this week
21:08
is that americans
21:09
used to make their slippers radioactive
21:12
so they could find them in the dark
21:16
now i must say probably not many
21:18
americans know this
21:20
but i think definitely some of them did
21:22
so there is an advert online
21:24
for this product and which you could buy
21:27
in the 1930s called undark
21:29
okay and it's like a paint and it
21:31
contains radium which is already sorry
21:33
can we just clarify that it wasn't
21:35
online
21:35
in the 1940s was it
21:39
you're absolutely right it wasn't online
21:41
in the 1930s it was a different medium
21:43
back then it's been put online now got
21:45
it just checking
21:45
um i saw it online in the last few days
21:48
um
21:48
but yeah i think it was in it was in
21:50
magazines and things like this
21:52
and it was called undark and it says the
21:54
advert says
21:55
does undark really contain radian most
21:58
assuredly
22:02
so it's real radioactive stuff and the
22:04
whole point of it is you would put it on
22:05
things
22:06
so you could find them in the dark so
22:08
they said that you were putting on
22:09
watches and clocks on push buttons
22:11
on the buckles of your bedroom slippers
22:14
on house numbers flashlights compasses
22:17
well flashlights i don't know why
22:18
because you can turn them well you need
22:19
to find it in the dark you need to find
22:21
it in the dark
22:22
you're absolutely right and basically in
22:24
the 1930s they were putting radium on
22:26
everything
22:26
no even though not realizing perhaps
22:28
that um it was killing people
22:30
yeah yeah they were obsessed it was
22:33
a craze uh complete and like the
22:36
newspapers constantly contained it i
22:38
think um
22:38
george bernard shaw said the world has
22:40
run raving mad on the subject of radium
22:43
and of course there was uh very famously
22:45
the radium
22:46
girls who are the people who worked in
22:49
sort of uh 1919's
22:51
um and the radium girls were there and
22:54
they were had to paint radium onto
22:55
clocks to make their hands glow
22:57
in the dark and they would lick the
22:58
paint brushes and so they would swallow
23:00
a little bit of radium every single time
23:02
they did that
23:03
uh which was extremely bad for them it
23:05
turned out
23:06
worse still they would paint like little
23:08
messages on their teeth for their
23:09
boyfriends and yeah
23:11
like their clothes would glow in the
23:12
dark so when they went out clubbing
23:14
or whatever they did in the 1920s they
23:17
would always wear their work clothes
23:18
because it meant they shined in the in
23:20
the nightclub they were like human glow
23:21
sticks
23:22
dancing in the clubs wow they were
23:24
properly glowers in one so it was a big
23:26
scandal by the 1920s
23:27
they started dying um and people
23:29
realized it was probably because of all
23:30
this radium and when they exhumed their
23:32
bodies years later they were still
23:33
glowing from all this radium
23:36
it was amazing and they'd open their
23:37
cupboards in the morning yeah and all
23:39
their clothes are just
23:40
glowing absolutely and then of course
23:42
because they were getting very sick
23:44
there were lawsuits
23:45
and it was due to a guy called leonard
23:47
grossman who was a lawyer who worked pro
23:49
bono for
23:50
the whole time and it was after eight
23:52
appeals that they managed to get
23:53
the companies to admit that they were
23:55
wrong and managed to get something back
23:57
although the last one the last um radium
23:59
girl died
24:00
at the age of 107 not so long ago only
24:03
in the last
24:04
20 years i think but she quit within a
24:06
week of working there because she hated
24:08
the taste of the paint
24:09
yes and she was counting herself
24:13
lucky age 107 in 2014. but
24:16
like they weren't to know i suppose and
24:17
it must have been so exciting and also
24:19
uranium had the same thing when uranium
24:21
then became a thing and this was this
24:23
other very very dangerous nuclear
24:24
substance people got very into
24:26
there was a time when hamburgers came
24:28
with free shares in uranium mines
24:31
like a little happy meal but it was a
24:32
share in uranium really
24:34
wow yes there were some right did you
24:36
know it was is it pronounced
24:37
boogie you know b-o-u-g-i-e the sort of
24:40
uh
24:41
things bougie there were radioactive
24:44
bougies which were wax covered rods to
24:46
be inserted into the penis
24:48
sorry i didn't know this word bougie
24:50
until now is that what it is
24:51
yeah well there's a there's a modern
24:53
meaning of bougie which is a bit
24:54
different a bit different to that
24:56
is that what bougie nights that movie's
24:57
about that's right yeah
25:01
it basically is about that isn't it
25:04
yeah wow some people said if you fed
25:06
your chickens radium
25:08
then their eggs would incubate
25:10
themselves
25:12
wow not true we have weirdly you
25:14
mentioned the curies earlier so
25:16
uh mary curie um she she was in the news
25:19
this year she's in our book
25:21
our new book uh is she yeah because
25:23
someone um it was her birthday and the
25:25
cake arrived surprise cake
25:27
they opened it up and on the cake was a
25:29
drawing of mary curie
25:31
and she was confused because she had no
25:35
idea who it was it turns out that there
25:36
was a mishearing over the phone
25:38
what the parent had actually asked for
25:40
was a cake of mariah carey
25:42
and
25:45
as a result had this nobel prize winner
25:48
on her cake with no idea who it was
25:52
all i want for christmas is uranium
25:56
they marie curie uh pierre her
26:00
her husband died uh in a traffic
26:03
accident
26:04
and then years years later you know she
26:06
um
26:07
she started dating again and she had an
26:09
affair with a married man
26:10
which was very scandalous at the time
26:12
and it led to this huge core celeb there
26:14
were either two
26:15
or five armed duels over this uh affair
26:19
that she had
26:20
and the the wife of the man she was
26:22
having the affair with her name was
26:23
madame long van
26:24
she had someone break into curie's house
26:26
and steal the love letters
26:28
and all of this about mary curie nobel
26:30
prize winning you know yeah and
26:31
the letters were stolen and then they
26:33
were leaked to the press so suddenly
26:34
this is a huge story
26:36
and um her lover paul long there had a
26:39
duel between
26:40
uh him and a journalist who'd insulted
26:42
him and
26:43
there there's a letter from uh einstein
26:46
to marie curie saying don't worry about
26:48
all this this is irrelevant
26:50
it's really cool because it was
26:51
just before she won the nobel prize so
26:53
her
26:53
nobel prize was slightly overshadowed by
26:55
this huge story
26:57
yeah yeah three days before she was due
26:59
to go and collect it
27:00
the story broke and they were saying oh
27:02
maybe don't come and collect a nobel
27:03
prize because this is scandalous
27:04
but then einstein wrote her a letter
27:06
saying forget all that you've got the
27:07
award get the award
27:09
wow yeah she used to be always called on
27:11
to test the radium products you know you
27:13
were saying at the start james uh
27:14
that a lot of products called themselves
27:16
radioactive but they didn't
27:17
always radiate in is that right yeah
27:19
they very often just pretended and then
27:20
put a bit of different glow-in-the-dark
27:22
stuff in it
27:22
she would be cool to verify that stuff
27:25
contained radium that it like definitely
27:26
was deadly basically it'd be like my
27:28
child's toy says it's radioactive
27:30
can you just check marie curie that it
27:32
is like yep definitely got
27:34
lots of radium in it good luck to that
27:36
kid
27:37
she actually fell on a little bit of
27:39
hard times after a while and she didn't
27:40
have enough radium to continue her
27:42
research because radium was really
27:44
really expensive
27:45
it's there's not much of it in the
27:46
ground so it's really hard to get and so
27:49
there was a fundraising campaign led by
27:51
american women
27:52
and curie traveled to the united states
27:54
and she was presented with one gram
27:56
of radium by president warren harding in
27:59
1921.
28:00
a single okay and it doesn't it doesn't
28:03
sound like a lot that right
28:05
but it was cost them 100 000
28:08
for a single gram of radium and
28:11
that at the time in 1921 was about the
28:14
average budget of a hollywood movie
28:16
wow one gram of radium you could make a
28:19
whole movie
28:20
that's so cool isn't that amazing they
28:22
did because when they were trying to
28:23
refine it in the foot like before they'd
28:24
even discovered it
28:25
they were using a thing called pitch
28:27
blend which is a kind of uranium ore
28:30
and it's got the it's got radium in it
28:32
but it needs to be refined a lot
28:34
they went through seven tons of pitch
28:36
blend and they ended up with
28:38
one gram of radium after all of that
28:40
refining that's incredible
28:41
this is why there was a a ballet dancer
28:44
and choreographer called
28:45
louie fuller who in 1904 created the
28:48
radium dance which was a really famous
28:50
dance at the time and she wanted all the
28:51
ballerinas to be wearing head-to-toe
28:53
costumes made entirely of radio and
28:57
she was sort of mates with marie curie
28:58
and she wrote to her and said can you
28:59
make me a bunch of ballerinas dresses
29:01
made entirely of radium
29:02
and thought thank god mary curie said
29:04
i'd absolutely love to it sounds like a
29:05
great idea but it's just too expensive
29:07
and so she had to make do with a sort of
29:10
slightly less glow-in-the-dark other
29:11
material
29:12
and the ballerinas lived just the other
29:14
day
29:15
have you heard of uh magic radium
29:17
massage
29:18
no this was a 30s product which is
29:21
curious because if the radiant girls
29:22
were dying in the 1920s then you would
29:24
use a lot of radium until the 40s and
29:26
50s i think well the magic radium
29:27
massage
29:28
this ointment when massaged into the sex
29:30
parts this is the other
29:32
acts as a healthy tonic stimulant
29:33
tending to give firmness and strength to
29:35
the organs
29:36
it is especially effective for improving
29:38
the circulation in the genital
29:40
organs when they feel cold clammy and
29:42
lifeless
29:44
soon that is that is useful
29:47
if you need to get up to go to the
29:48
toilet in the night you just follow your
29:49
cut
29:52
where did i leave that penis yeah
29:58
[Applause]
29:58
[Music]
30:02
uh it's time to move on to our final
30:05
fact of the show and that
30:06
is cecinski my fact this week is that
30:09
the man who introduced chewing gum
30:11
to the world had already been president
30:14
of mexico
30:15
11 times it's crazy
30:18
it's a very strange career trajectory
30:22
of course probably the most famous maybe
30:24
the most famous of mexican ever general
30:26
santa anna uh in the 19th century he was
30:28
president
30:29
constantly um he's got about he's sort
30:32
of hated in
30:33
three different very specific places so
30:36
the u.s hate him the
30:37
mexicans hate him and texans hate him
30:39
and i know texas is part of the us but
30:41
some people say that they don't they
30:42
pretend they aren't um
30:44
but yeah he's a so he was at the battle
30:46
of alamo and he was disgraced there
30:48
because he was very very brutal and then
30:51
that was what led to the cries of
30:52
remember the alamo which led to
30:54
um him him and his troops being defeated
30:57
at just into later
30:58
but anyway he had uh lots of sort of
31:00
military defeats and somehow they kept
31:02
on making him president again he kept on
31:04
being exiled from the country
31:06
and when he was finally exiled from
31:07
mexico permanently in 1869
31:10
he went to new jersey and all he brought
31:12
with him
31:14
that's not the joke
31:20
that's what you do when you hit rock
31:21
bottom
31:25
wow you can just say new jersey
31:29
it's good to know so he went to new
31:31
jersey and he brought with him his
31:33
insurance a ton
31:34
of this chickel gum which they all
31:36
chewed in mexico and the bloke he was
31:38
living with
31:38
said oh what's that gum can i try and
31:40
make something out of i'm gonna try and
31:41
sell it
31:42
and he tried to make sort of tires out
31:43
of it and toys out of it and uh
31:46
masks and wellington boots and none of
31:48
it stuck as it were and so
31:50
eventually he saw santa anna chewing it
31:52
one day and so he thought okay sorry
31:54
i'll try and sell it to people and tell
31:55
them to chew on it and they loved it
31:56
and their chewing gum was born or
31:59
popularized
32:00
at least in the west he is he was quite
32:02
amazing wasn't he santorana so
32:04
after the independence from spain in
32:06
1821 basically a whole country just kept
32:08
having these coups and counter coups and
32:10
whatever
32:11
and he just kept reinventing himself to
32:13
whoever was taking over he said oh i'm
32:15
with these guys
32:16
and then they would make him president
32:17
so at one stage he was
32:20
started off as conservative and then he
32:21
became liberal then he became a democrat
32:23
and then he became a dictator
32:25
and all those times each time he became
32:28
the president
32:28
and by way of um comparison donald trump
32:32
started off as a republican became a
32:34
member of the independence party
32:36
then was a democrat and then was a
32:38
republican again
32:39
hasn't been a dictator
32:43
yeah he's like he just kept reinventing
32:45
himself so he could get the power yeah
32:47
it's really amazing this is interesting
32:49
he didn't go to either of his own
32:50
weddings
32:53
he he just he couldn't be bothered to
32:56
turn up basically
32:57
or he was traveling or busy or whatever
32:59
so he just deputized someone by
33:00
just saying you are about to get murray
33:03
certainly it doesn't work that way
33:06
um he so he married twice mostly for we
33:10
think for money both times because the
33:11
the women he was marrying had very large
33:13
estates
33:14
and he was in need of cash um so the
33:17
first
33:17
the first wedding he had he empowered
33:20
his father-in-law to be
33:22
as his proxy oh so basically
33:26
her dad would walk her you know up the
33:28
aisle to himself basically yeah
33:31
wow do we know if he sort of jumped
33:33
around the other side of her
33:35
just put a different hat on yeah he
33:38
actually lost
33:39
texas to the us possibly because he was
33:42
having sex in a tent
33:44
no so this is the tale is that at the
33:46
battle of jacinto he was distracted
33:49
by a texan woman who it was a ploy on
33:52
her part she's sort of this folk hero
33:54
and this is reported at the time by an
33:55
english journalist and apparently this
33:58
texan woman snuck into his tent and
33:59
seduced him and shagged away
34:01
and then he lost the battle while he was
34:03
in the tent not in charge of his troops
34:05
and then had to leg it how long was that
34:07
sex session that he lost
34:09
the battle the battle famously only took
34:10
18 minutes
34:16
in my house my wife will be going here
34:20
that 18 minutes he can do 18 minutes
34:23
dad you can always use a proxy if you
34:25
haven't
34:27
so it's okay honey your dad's on his way
34:32
over
34:34
um was did he still have his leg at the
34:36
time that that happened
34:38
he did have his original legs because he
34:40
he
34:41
one of the other things he was famous
34:42
for was losing a leg uh
34:44
in a conflict called the pastry war
34:46
which was against french
34:48
forces who had invaded mexico i think
34:50
that's why it's called that so
34:51
um he was wounded and he had his leg
34:53
amputated
34:54
and then four years later as a kind of
34:57
political move he
34:58
had it disinterred and he held a state
35:00
funeral for his leg
35:02
so he got to attend and it was a really
35:04
fancy funeral so the leg got taken to
35:06
the capitol in a coach
35:07
and there was a beautiful monument
35:09
constructed and there was cannon fire
35:11
and poems were red
35:12
and then the leg was eventually
35:14
re-buried yeah how is that for his
35:16
wife that he shows up to a funeral for
35:18
his leg
35:19
but not to his own wedding
35:23
but then on the bright side two years
35:25
after he'd done that it was exhumed
35:27
again by his opponents and dragged
35:29
through the streets with people chanting
35:31
death to the
35:32
so yeah he was obsessed with this leg he
35:35
used to um
35:36
sort of like before he'd even done the
35:37
big state funeral he used to carry it
35:39
around waving it above him in parade
35:40
really
35:41
and he even he gave it two funerals he
35:44
gave it a small funeral
35:46
on his little hacienda before the big
35:48
one when it first got lost
35:50
he was always reminding people like one
35:51
of these really annoying like you
35:53
couldn't he'd always let it
35:54
let it drop into conversation but the
35:56
pastry award do you know why it was
35:58
why it was called that specifically i no
36:00
i don't it's it is related to the french
36:02
thing but it's specifically because
36:03
there was one french pastry cafe in
36:06
mexico and it was owed a big debt by the
36:09
government
36:10
and it wasn't being paid and so this
36:12
pastry chef
36:13
called the french government said mexico
36:14
owes me all this money it's not paying
36:16
and so it got a bit out of hand and war
36:19
happened
36:20
oh man because of that
36:23
the french ended up really overreacting
36:25
so they uh
36:28
he rang them up and said they owe me an
36:30
arm and a leg and then
36:34
they negotiated down to half of that
36:39
you know uh you can visit his leg in
36:40
illinois
36:42
yeah well his fake leg it's in a museum
36:44
in illinois
36:45
yeah um and it's uh there's there's like
36:47
a chicken dinner there as well because
36:50
supposedly he was eating chicken at the
36:51
time so it sort of like sets the so when
36:53
you say is fight clegg you mean there's
36:54
prosthesis
36:55
yeah yeah exactly um yes someone
36:58
galloped off away when he wasn't looking
36:59
took his leg
37:00
and it's now in illinois it's been there
37:02
for years yes so this was another fight
37:04
this is the later
37:05
battle that he actually lost wasn't it
37:06
yeah when he had the prosthetic leg and
37:08
as you say he was eating a chicken
37:10
dinner in his tent and
37:11
um the battle was lost again
37:15
he really lingered over it he spent
37:16
about 20 minutes eating the chicken
37:18
disaster this guy needs to stay out of
37:21
tents
37:23
i always think it's really weird though
37:24
because in that thing where the soldiers
37:26
came along and they took
37:27
his leg and they also took eighteen
37:29
thousand dollars
37:30
and the chicken dinner but everyone that
37:32
always talks about the chicken dinner
37:35
it's so weird and then he got another
37:36
leg and he got a peg leg
37:38
and so just a piece of wood for a
37:40
prosthesis and then that got stolen as
37:42
well
37:43
yeah it got stolen and was reportedly
37:45
later used by lieutenant abner doubleday
37:47
as a baseball bat
37:50
wow hey um so this fact was also about
37:52
the fact that he introduced chewing gum
37:54
to the world
37:55
can i can i mention a couple of chewing
37:57
gum things i found
37:58
um so chewing gum obviously we had
38:00
chewing gum that was around for a while
38:02
and then bubble gum arrived
38:03
and bubble gum was invented in
38:05
philadelphia
38:07
yeah how cool is that did you guys know
38:09
that
38:10
probably you didn't know that okay so
38:12
bubble gum was invented here it was by
38:14
a guy called frank h flier although he
38:16
didn't invent bubble gum itself so
38:18
double bubble was the first ever
38:20
bubble gum that came out you guys yeah
38:22
there was no
38:23
bubble before no chewing gum was just
38:26
chewed and then he was like let's
38:27
let's he went straight to the double
38:29
there's no single bubble
38:30
oh i see well no no there was a
38:32
prototype which
38:34
which so he's not the inventor of
38:38
double bubble he is the inventor of its
38:40
prototype blibber blubber
38:43
stop absolutely true blibber blubber
38:46
was the original bubble gum that he
38:48
invented but unfortunately it was
38:50
it didn't quite work out so the problem
38:52
was is when you blew the bubble no one
38:54
could say it for a star
38:57
so yeah so frank h flair so the the
38:59
problem was is that you would blow the
39:01
bubble
39:01
it would pop and it would go all over
39:03
your face but the stickiness of it was
39:05
too much
39:06
that you needed a solvent to actually
39:08
take it
39:09
off your face so okay so
39:12
when he was marketing it initially it
39:14
was with this little product that would
39:15
make sure that would come off so it
39:16
didn't work out
39:18
never sold never made it actually to
39:20
shops um but instead then someone who's
39:22
working for him
39:23
said let's let's take it differently and
39:24
that's how we have double bubble wow uh
39:28
this was 1906.
39:30
he posted this yeah because there were
39:32
there was one other claimant to the
39:33
invention of bubblegum who is
39:35
waldo seaman who wow
39:38
what did he call his
39:43
and it didn't go down very well i don't
39:46
with chewing gum
39:47
make sure you never swallow that's all
39:48
i'm saying
39:51
so mr mr seaman was
39:54
waldo seaman working
40:03
that's a much more difficult and more
40:05
adult version of the book
40:08
he's easier to spot though you turn the
40:09
lights off you shine until it glows in
40:11
the dark
40:17
that's the best uv seamen where's wally
40:20
bubblegum joke that's ever been made
40:23
that's the only one
40:25
no top ten
40:28
anyway he was a very serious guy i
40:29
wanted to be taken seriously his
40:31
business was in making plastics and
40:33
rubber and polymers and he worked for a
40:34
tire company
40:35
and so when he made this thing that blew
40:38
bubbles the tire company thought well
40:39
that's a huge defect we don't want tires
40:41
that
40:41
are bubbles um so stop making it
40:44
and so he had to stop making it but
40:46
interestingly did you know that
40:48
tire manufacturers goodyear tyre and
40:50
rubber for instance are the biggest
40:52
provider of the
40:53
rubber core of chewing gum today is it
40:56
yes
40:56
it's a bit of tyrant because it's not
40:58
made out of that chickley stuff anymore
40:59
it's made out of
41:00
like petrol chemicals basically chewing
41:02
gum yeah essentially yeah
41:04
like made out of kind of rubber in the
41:06
middle that's amazing yeah so actually
41:07
when
41:08
like cars drive over the road they
41:10
should be able to just pick up the
41:11
chewing gum and just become part of the
41:13
tower oh yeah
41:14
eventually just have a massively high
41:17
car
41:20
the ancient greeks had chewing gum a
41:22
kind of chewing gum yeah so
41:24
as you say it was popularized when it
41:25
became nice but the the ancient greeks
41:28
were going around chewing mastic gum
41:29
sometimes
41:30
that was a thing and um it was really
41:33
horrible back in the old days because it
41:34
used to be made with paraffin
41:36
so it's very bitter and very you know
41:38
brittle and unwholesome
41:40
the one thing that you might do if you
41:42
had some paraffin chewing gum is you'd
41:43
have a plate of sugar
41:44
next to you and you just have to
41:46
repeatedly take it out of your mouth dip
41:47
it in the sugar
41:48
and put it back in oh nice yeah
41:51
that sounds all right no not i've
41:55
explained it wrong
41:55
[Laughter]
41:58
um we're going to have to move on in a
41:59
second one more thing about chewing gum
42:01
the university of copenhagen is
42:02
currently working on
42:03
fertility chewing gum so is this another
42:06
waldo semen invention
42:11
[Applause]
42:13
that's the second best waldo semen
42:16
bubblegum based
42:19
[Laughter]
42:22
no it's it's for it's for women to chew
42:24
so that you know where you are
42:26
in your menstrual cycle so if you chew
42:29
it it reacts
42:30
with the i guess the enzymes in your
42:32
saliva
42:33
and it turns a particular color
42:34
depending on how far along you are and
42:36
whether you're
42:36
in the perfect time to concentrate do
42:38
you have to keep pulling it out of your
42:40
mouth and looking at it and then putting
42:41
it back in again
42:42
um i think there's a well you have to
42:44
take it out at least once yeah
42:47
but that is cool
42:50
if it happens that's going to be great
42:53
in 1904
42:55
they had a big craze in america of
42:56
chewing gum parties
42:58
and the idea of what you would do there
43:00
is you would each guest would come along
43:01
with a big pack of chewing gum actually
43:03
lots of packs
43:04
and then everyone would sit around and
43:05
chew their chewing gum until it was soft
43:07
and then they put it on a plate and they
43:09
would sculpt it
43:10
into things cool and that was the game
43:15
that's kind of fun this audience doesn't
43:17
seem to think as much
43:18
[Laughter]
43:21
wow philadelphia is a bit too good for
43:22

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
this week coming to you live from new
00:22
york city
00:28
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:30
here with anna chazinski
00:32
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:34
and once again we have gathered round
00:35
the microphones with our four favorite
00:37
facts from the last seven days
00:39
and in no particular order here we go
00:42
starting with fact number one and that's
00:44
my fact this week
00:46
my fact is carl sagan spent two years
00:49
suing
00:50
apple computers for calling him a butt
00:53
head
00:55
that's gonna be hard because you have to
00:56
prove that you're not a butt head right
00:58
yeah
00:59
absolutely so uh for for listeners who
01:01
don't know who carl sagan is he is of
01:03
course the great
01:04
scientist he did the tv show cosmos uh
01:07
the golden disc on the voyager he was
01:09
the person who dreamt that up
01:10
he's one of the greatest public science
01:12
speakers of all time if not the best
01:14
is he uh he's a new yorker who's he was
01:16
born in brooklyn yeah
01:18
born in the same little village that the
01:20
three stooges were born in
01:22
um so this was in 1993 so basically what
01:26
happened is that apple computers were
01:27
releasing the power macintosh 7100
01:31
and when they were putting it together
01:32
and they had to talk to the media and
01:33
stuff they had a code name
01:35
that they used which was carl sagan and
01:37
the joke
01:38
in the in the team was that the idea was
01:41
they wanted to sell
01:42
billions and billions of the new
01:44
computer
01:45
so sagan found out about this and he
01:47
said he wrote them a letter saying you
01:49
absolutely can't do this you're using my
01:51
name to profit with your company and i
01:53
don't want you to do that can you please
01:55
stop
01:55
so they did stop but what they did
01:57
instead was renamed the code name
01:59
bha which stood for butt head astronomer
02:04
and he thought that's defamation of
02:06
character so he sued them
02:08
and unfortunately he lost and so they
02:10
carried on with it
02:11
and so then he then tried to sue them
02:13
for calling it carl sagan to begin with
02:15
at all
02:16
and he lost that as well but then he
02:17
then tried to sue them once again
02:19
and they settled outside of court um so
02:21
we don't know what happened there but
02:23
the final code name that was given in
02:25
place of bha was
02:26
law law which stood for lawyers or wimps
02:30
[Music]
02:32
wow so there were no hard feelings at
02:33
the end of it clearly
02:35
yeah it must have hurt though because so
02:37
billions and billions billions and
02:39
billions is the phrase that he's really
02:41
famous for and uh that's as you say why
02:44
they named it that
02:45
and he never bloody said it and this
02:47
always used to really annoy him for
02:48
someone who was interested in the huge
02:50
cosmic questions he had a quite a petty
02:52
side it seems
02:53
so he he once
02:56
uh was presenting one of his
02:57
documentaries and he said there are
02:59
billions of stars out there and i think
03:02
johnny carson on the tonight show did an
03:04
impersonation of him where he said
03:05
billions and billions and that became
03:06
his catchphrase and it really pissed him
03:08
off
03:08
and he used to be asked to save billions
03:10
and billions it's not even a good
03:12
catchphrase
03:12
and um and he'd refused to say it and
03:15
he'd refuse to write it
03:16
and eventually he caved and started
03:18
saying it and writing it all over the
03:19
shop well that's the thing i first read
03:21
about
03:21
billions and billions the fact that it
03:22
wasn't his in one of his later books a
03:24
collection of essays which was called
03:26
billions and billions oh there we go
03:28
really yeah but he did
03:31
that unit that he said that has become a
03:33
kind of joke unit in astronomical
03:35
terms a sagan means because it means
03:37
four billion
03:38
oh really yeah really it's billions plus
03:40
billions wow
03:41
well it's approximately four billion
03:43
it's any number greater than four
03:44
billion yeah it's a sagan so it's very
03:46
useless
03:46
uh term yeah exactly how often are we
03:49
using the sagan
03:50
in life never never never the story of
03:52
the the voyager gold disc is also very
03:54
very cool because i did not know that he
03:55
was behind this so the voyager
03:57
uh you know exploration into space it
03:59
was nearly a tape a cassette tape
04:01
they nearly put that up but they
04:02
realized that it would get shot to
04:04
pieces by
04:04
radiation and things like this um yeah
04:07
but it's copper coated in gold and that
04:08
will last for
04:09
a quarter of a sagan
04:13
oh years very cool and there's a there
04:15
are lots of stories about it and one of
04:17
the stories that i knew that you would
04:18
like dan is that
04:19
uh the song here comes the sun by the
04:22
beatles
04:22
uh was going to be on it but the beatles
04:24
weren't allowed to put it on there
04:26
because they didn't own the copyright to
04:27
a lot of their own material at the time
04:29
that's the story it turns out it's not
04:30
true and the producer of the disc i
04:33
didn't know i had a record producer
04:34
behind it but there we go
04:35
uh he said uh in an article that he
04:38
wrote about it
04:39
it's not the beatles strongest work and
04:40
the witticism of the title
04:42
if charming in the short run seemed
04:44
unlikely to remain
04:45
funny for a billion years
04:49
he's asking a huge amount of any joke to
04:51
remain funny for one billion
04:55
he must have been really insulted to be
04:56
called a butt head as well
04:58
because he hated beavers and butthead
05:00
did he yeah
05:01
is he on record as having hated he is in
05:04
one of his petty side
05:05
in one of his books he said the dumbing
05:07
down of america
05:08
is most evident in the slow decay of
05:11
substantive content
05:12
in the enormously influential media as i
05:15
write
05:16
the number one video cassette rental in
05:18
america is the movie dumb and dumber
05:20
beavers and butt head also remains
05:22
popular
05:23
wow he absolutely hated beavers and
05:26
butthead
05:27
i think he just didn't get it yeah
05:31
yeah do you know beefs and butthead and
05:33
named the two people are named after
05:34
real people
05:35
no yeah so um the guy who created it was
05:38
mike judge
05:39
and he lived next door to a 12 year old
05:42
who called himself iron butt
05:44
because he claimed that he felt no pain
05:46
whenever anyone kicked him in the
05:48
backside
05:49
right and his best friend um everyone
05:52
called him butthead because he was such
05:53
good friends with iron butt
05:55
and then they had a third friend who was
05:57
called bobby beavis
05:58
wow and he was really not famous for
06:01
anything apart from me had a really
06:02
weird laugh
06:03
this is the kind of high brow content
06:05
you get from our podcast
06:06
if only sagan could have heard us
06:08
speaking tonight it's amazing that he
06:10
didn't like them because he was he was a
06:12
proper stoner
06:13
carl sagan yeah like he he really loved
06:16
smoking and it to the point where he
06:18
used to write articles to
06:19
magazines that just dealt purely in
06:21
marijuana sort of saying i wish this was
06:24
legalized and
06:25
he wrote them under pseudonyms we didn't
06:26
find this out until after he died but he
06:28
was an advocate while he was still alive
06:30
and can i just tell you who the first
06:31
person in history who was called the
06:33
butt head was
06:34
yeah yeah that was in 1896
06:37
it was describing a guy called thomas
06:39
gage who was a british
06:40
commander-in-chief during the battle of
06:42
bunker hill
06:43
wow yeah and that was when the british
06:46
kind of won the battle
06:47
but it was a massively pyrrhic victory
06:49
because they lost like 1 000 men
06:50
in the battle and someone wrote about
06:53
him saying he was an absolute butt head
06:55
ow that seems actually a bit too weak an
06:57
insult for someone who's
07:00
murdered thousands of men i know someone
07:02
else who was called um
07:03
what was it iron butt iron butts so iron
07:06
ass
07:06
was also the nickname of richard nixon
07:09
was it
07:10
yeah people used to kick him in the butt
07:12
and he couldn't feel it no well
07:13
he he got it for a slightly different
07:16
reason when he was a student
07:17
he was known for his cast iron ass
07:20
if you've got an iron ass it just means
07:22
you're very dedicated and you keep on
07:23
sitting down until
07:25
you've finished sitting i don't know
07:26
until keep on sitting yeah until the
07:28
work is done i'm going to sit here with
07:29
my iron ass and i'm all right
07:31
okay but it's also if you're being
07:33
stubborn deliberately because iron man
07:35
like um not the cartoon character the
07:38
actual like thing that you do to become
07:39
an iron man is the triathlon all that
07:41
sort of stuff
07:42
oh yeah that's as far as like there's no
07:44
bit where you just have to sit on a
07:45
chair
07:47
for hours oh we've come to the iron ass
07:49
segment of the
07:50
iron man competition

08:14
what there's an in-between
08:18
it's a promiscuous lady from days of
08:21
yore largely i thought it was
08:24
i actually thought it was still in
08:24
common parents but apparently not
08:27
has everyone else heard that wow
08:30
okay usually if you're at a dinner and
08:34
you say has anyone said that one other
08:35
person's like yeah
08:36
900 people is embarrassing
08:40
there's a good german insult which is if
08:42
you call someone
08:43
uh an ash geiger that means a butt
08:46
violin which is cool
08:49
and there's there's another one they've
08:50
got quite a few of these and another one
08:51
is uh an ahmed uran
08:53
which is uh if you're an idiot they call
08:55
you an ashmit iron which means you're
08:57
just an arse with ears
08:58
[Laughter]
09:01
it's a strong insult um we're gonna have
09:03
to move on soon to our next fact
09:05
i've just got one more defamation slash
09:08
buttock
09:08
fact oh yeah well i've got a few more
09:11
but i'm only gonna say one
09:13
um this is do you guys know the company
09:15
uh the north face that makes clothing
09:17
yeah
09:18
um well there was a guy called jimmy
09:20
winkleman senior
09:21
who decided that he was going to make
09:22
his own company called the south
09:24
butt very funny
09:28
and they obviously said you can't do
09:30
this because the the logo was pretty
09:32
similar
09:32
right to the face and they said you
09:34
can't do that and he said no no it's a
09:35
parody it's a parody
09:36
and in the end they went to court and
09:38
they sued him and he was forced to cease
09:40
all promotion and sales of south butt
09:43
products and abandon his trademark
09:45
immediately
09:46
and they also forced him to get rid of
09:48
his other trademark
09:49
the butt face
09:53
just there's one other weird defamation
09:55
case which has been in the news
09:56
recently um and so you know rebel wilson
10:00
have you ever okay yeah um see now i'm
10:02
talking your language
10:04
um she just won the biggest payout in
10:07
australian history for a defamation
10:09
suit uh it was 4.6 million australian
10:12
dollars and it was because
10:13
she was accusing a media group of
10:15
defamation for saying that she'd been
10:17
well brought
10:18
up so really she goes around saying that
10:22
i'm such a bogan
10:23
you know and she talks about how she's
10:25
such a bogan she really embraces it dana
10:26
bogan is like a male trumpet i guess
10:28
[Laughter]
10:33
i'm an aussie it's not you guys here do
10:36
you know what a bogan is it's like a
10:37
uh it's so hard to explain what it is
10:39
without being derogatory
10:41
it's an australian term for someone
10:42
who's a bit rough and ready so
10:44
she's always really embraced this said
10:46
she's gone from a real working-class
10:47
background real bogan upbringing
10:49
and a media group called her upper
10:51
middle class and she's managed to
10:53
successfully sue them she had to go to
10:54
court with her family and prove that she
10:56
was
10:57
a bogus wow no way wow
11:00
unbelievable amazing they had to do
11:02
things like um talk about what the kids
11:04
were called what her siblings were
11:06
called so their names are
11:07
rebel liberty and anarchy and it's anna
11:11
anarchy spelled a double n a c h i
11:16
i don't think understandably the judge
11:18
decided this was irrefutable evidence
11:20
that she was in fact
11:24

12:32
on with the show bond with the show
12:38
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:40
that is
12:41
andy my fact is that in 1995 astronaut
12:44
bill gregory
12:45
ate 48 meals in a row which included
12:48
shrimp cocktail
12:50
was he in space at the time he was he's
12:53
in space
12:54
in in 1995 while in space
13:00
so astronauts love shrimp cocktail
13:03
yeah they can't get enough of it it's
13:06
and it's hard to come by up there
13:08
obviously
13:09
um what do you mean sorry they love it
13:11
is this part of the selection process
13:13
yes it's one of the ques it's the final
13:16
question
13:17
you go through all of your training for
13:18
a few years and then they very
13:20
they just give you a plate of shrimp
13:21
cocktail and say what would you do with
13:22
that
13:25
yeah they do absolutely love it don't
13:27
they so um
13:28
chris hadfield who was in space what
13:30
just a couple of years ago he said it
13:32
was his favorite food
13:33
and edward white who was in space in
13:34
1965 said it was his favorite food
13:37
and pretty much everyone from that guy
13:39
to that guy has just loved this stuff
13:41
so i mean gregory was having it for
13:43
breakfast you know he was having it with
13:44
his breakfast he'd have
13:46
fruit yogurt some oatmeal and then a
13:48
shrimp cocktail for his breakfast
13:50
um and jim riley when he was on the
13:53
endeavor he would take his russian
13:54
colleagues
13:55
on mere bags of shrimp cocktail as a
13:58
friendly offering between neighbours you
14:00
know although i think he might have done
14:01
that because the americans aren't
14:03
allowed alcohol
14:04
on board whereas the russians are and so
14:07
often they'll get some medicinal alcohol
14:09
in return from the russians yeah there
14:12
was one there was one astral called
14:13
story musgrave which was a brilliant
14:15
name he was on the space shuttle
14:17
and he sometimes would threaten other
14:18
astronauts when they were making their
14:20
menu choices he'd say
14:22
you better put shrimp cocktail on your
14:23
menu or you'll be sorry
14:26
wow because he thought that if they
14:27
didn't put it on their menu they'd try
14:29
and steal his because they would realize
14:30
how delicious it was
14:31
it's because it stays spicy in space
14:33
basically and it provides a lot more
14:35
flavor than other foods oh and that's a
14:36
thing isn't it spice is a thing because
14:38
the spice
14:38
they're often clogged up in their
14:40
nostrils and the spice rises and clears
14:42
them
14:43
i didn't know the um prawn cocktail i'm
14:45
going to call it um
14:46
because i'm british i didn't know that
14:49
it was spicy
14:51
no but they add um they add spicy stuff
14:54
in there
14:54
so they could just bring up cups of
14:56
tabasco if it's they like it because
14:58
there is tabasco in it definitely yeah
15:00
yeah tomatoey tomato tabasco shrimpy
15:03
goodness um the university of suffolk
15:06
have just done a study
15:07
where they pulled a load of shrimp out
15:09
of britain's waterways
15:10
and found that every single shrimp they
15:12
looked at contained cocaine
15:15
wow really
15:18
wow everything you had a good time as a
15:21
shrimp
15:23
how are you doing up there bill yeah i'm
15:24
doing really well that's really big it's
15:25
really massive it's
15:26
not as important as me though i feel
15:27
like i'm on top of the whole situation
15:29
up here
15:29
desperately shoving shrimp up their nose
15:33
that's incredible do we uh why do they
15:35
all have so much uh it has been flushed
15:37
into the rivers from
15:38
uh human sewage because too many humans
15:41
are taking illegal drugs
15:45
and we're on to you ketamine as well
15:49
it's not a kettleman it's horse
15:51
tranquilizer
15:52
yeah is it a downer yeah it's a bit of a
15:55
downer
15:57
when you're giving it to shrimp yeah you
16:00
must have to take
16:00
much less as a shrimp than you do as a
16:02
horse i mean
16:04
sorry just to clarify horse don't take
16:05
it for fun they don't
16:08
i don't think the shrimp is doing that
16:10
either
16:11
someone emailed me actually this week
16:13
saying that new york's drinking water is
16:15
full of crustaceans
16:16
is this a thing that you guys are all
16:17
familiar with is it there seems to be a
16:20
theme online which is that new york has
16:21
the best drinking water in the world but
16:23
it's also
16:23
riddled with yeah someone agrees good
16:26
riddled with tiny crustaceans
16:28
and i read that once that that is a
16:29
problem because it's technically not
16:31
kosher is that right
16:32
oh so yeah which i think if you're a
16:35
really orthodox jew you have to
16:37
get filtered water i think a few people
16:40
in this audience feeling so horrified
16:43
i have another new york shrimp fact this
16:46
is surprising so there are some
16:48
is tangential but there are some shrimp
16:50
species
16:51
which are social and they form little
16:53
kingdoms
16:54
so there's a king and a queen shrimp in
16:56
these shrimp societies
16:58
and these are really small shrimp
17:00
they're about the size of a grain of
17:01
rice they're many
17:02
but they live inside sea sponges and if
17:04
an intruder
17:05
comes in and meets a single shrimp you
17:07
know shrimp
17:08
is face to face with a big predator the
17:10
shrimp will
17:11
snap its claws rhythmically to summon
17:14
its friends
17:14
like is it west side story wow
17:18
jesus it's the jets the sharks and the
17:20
shrimps
17:23
they've got the cocaine trade stitched
17:25
up the shrimps
17:28
they're good clickers actually prawns
17:30
aren't they so they um
17:31
they do a strong line in making clicking
17:33
noises with their claws
17:34
and there's the pistol shrimp which does
17:37
this so it has
17:38
it looks bizarre it's got one incredibly
17:40
fat swollen claw
17:41
and one like really slender one it looks
17:43
kind of like nadal remember when he had
17:45
like one huge left arm
17:48
right it's the nadal of the shrimp world
17:50
and
17:52
basically it uses its giant claw to fire
17:55
bubbles at its foes it's like a machine
17:57
gun fire so it
17:57
projects bubbles through the water and
17:59
they go so fast and they reach
18:01
unbelievable temperatures so when their
18:02
bubbles burst and
18:03
like smash into the face of a predator
18:05
then they reach 8 000 degrees fahrenheit
18:07
they are hotter than the surface of the
18:09
sun
18:11
which is mad and they also have um this
18:14
bizarre thing with their pincers where
18:16
if they are attacked on the pincer
18:18
then they can shed it so their pincer
18:20
will drop off so let's say they're
18:21
attacked in their big pincer it drops
18:23
off and that's okay
18:24
because it grows back but if they lose
18:26
the big fat pizza it grows back
18:28
as a thin one and then the other one
18:31
that used to be thin
18:32
compensates and becomes big and fat and
18:34
occasionally
18:35
you get shrimps who have screwed this up
18:36
somehow and they've got
18:38
two huge fat pincers and that seems
18:41
really cool but it's really sad because
18:43
they're essentially like a knife and
18:44
fork so they they have respective
18:46
purposes
18:46
so the slender pincer is needed for sort
18:48
of picking the meat
18:49
out of their out of their prey once
18:51
they've killed it so if they only have
18:53
the big fat ones they're just killing
18:54
their prey left right and center and
18:55
then they can't actually
18:57
so it's like nadal if he could only play
18:59
really hard shots he couldn't do any
19:00
drop shots
19:01
exactly regret starting that analogy
19:07
um i was looking at general crustaceans
19:09
as well as this there are some
19:10
ancient crustaceans which spent so much
19:13
energy growing their genitals
19:15
that they went extinct
19:20
isn't no what these are things called
19:23
ostrocods they're small
19:25
they're chalk shelled crustaceans
19:27
they're tiny and they're very ancient as
19:28
well they go back hundreds of millions
19:30
of years
19:30
and in fossils you can tell the
19:32
difference between male and female ones
19:34
because
19:34
the males have more genitals and they
19:36
are a slightly larger
19:38
shape to uh to accommodate those said
19:41
genitals
19:42
um in fact they're they're mostly a
19:45
third of the internal volume of the male
19:46
is genitals
19:48
you've said genitals a lot in this sense
19:49
i have a bit yeah
19:52
will get ready james because there are
19:53
more to come um
19:55
i wish that's the first time i heard
19:56
that
20:03
it's all it's all flooding back um
20:08
i wish this wasn't the show that our
20:09
respective partners were at
20:13
so the male ostrogods with the bigger
20:16
genitals
20:17
of the species studied were likely to go
20:19
extinct
20:20
because they had put so many resources
20:23
of their life
20:24
into growing their genitals that they
20:25
couldn't really respond to change
20:27
it's like spending an enormous amount of
20:29
money building a giant penis statue on
20:31
your house
20:32
if you then have a run of bad luck
20:34
you'll go bankrupt because you haven't
20:35
got the necessary cash
20:37
packing this is not as good as the nadal
20:39
one i know
20:40
i know i know what it's like is
20:44
if you play tennis and you grow your arm
20:46
really really big your right arm yeah
20:48
you get really good
20:49
but then the rules change and everyone
20:50
has to play left-handed
20:52
isn't it it's like is it it's that is
20:54
better than
20:56
oh i've spent so much money on that
21:00
statute
21:03
they also so just on them they also had
21:05
a huge sperm
21:06
this is the incredible thing about them
21:08
their sperm were i think their sperm
21:10
were 10 times bigger than their bodies
21:13
yeah they had to sort of yeah so when
21:16
once they developed a sperm they'd only
21:17
have one i think how does that work
21:19
though
21:20
they're folded oh they're right so it's
21:21
not like coming out of his mouth
21:24
well it does when it's delivered so it's
21:26
all coiled up like a hose pipe but when
21:28
it's delivered i suppose you'd be it
21:29
would just go on and on like one of
21:30
those handkerchiefs coming out of a
21:31
magician's pocket
21:32
wow what how upset
21:36
how fun would sex me if that's what
21:38
happened every time
21:40
how fun were children's parties every
21:42
time
21:45
um so there was one shrimp-like animal
21:48
from the cambrian
21:49
period called cynophelos zainos
21:52
and they had a groove on their face that
21:55
could lock
21:56
onto the tail of another one of their
21:58
kind and so what they would do is they
22:00
would keep locking themselves on like a
22:01
load of legos
22:02
and just became a massive version of
22:05
that animal
22:06
the human centipede the
22:09
the shrimp conga i think
22:13
that is a much nicer movie isn't it
22:18
[Music]
22:20
i imagine dan you in a human sense be
22:22
going let's do a conga
22:25
you always like to see the good in every
22:26
situation don't you
22:30
worst birthday party ever
22:33
now the magician
22:37
okay we're gonna have to move on to our
22:39
next fact it is time for fact number
22:41
three
22:42
and that is james okay my fact this week
22:44
is that the loudest
22:46
male birds on earth use their voices
22:50
to yell at females who are sat right
22:52
next to them
22:55
and i don't think we could see any kind
22:57
of parallels in our
22:58
in our species um so this is an article
23:00
in the journal current biology
23:02
by a couple of scientists called jeffrey
23:03
podos and mario cohen haft
23:06
and they have found this bird called the
23:08
white bell bird
23:09
and it can shout at an average of 106
23:12
at 116 decibels from a distance of one
23:16
meter
23:17
and the reason that they're really good
23:19
at shouting
23:20
is they have a really really simple song
23:23
so there's no trills nothing like that
23:24
no flourishes it's just one it's like a
23:27
fog horn and also when they've cut them
23:30
up they've realized that they have
23:32
well according to this article it says
23:34
unlike most birds the species
23:36
has great abs whoa
23:39
and so what he can do is just go to a
23:41
female
23:42
and just go right next to her and go
23:43
i've got great abs
23:46
and she will find that very attractive
23:49
well
23:50
they i think because that's this is how
23:52
they this is the ones that have been
23:54
observed and
23:55
the scientists studying them this guy uh
23:56
dr podos he said
23:58
um that they they start by facing away
24:01
from the female
24:02
and they start shouting when they're
24:04
looking in the other direction and then
24:05
suddenly they just swing around
24:07
and start shouting and potter said that
24:10
we never saw copulation we never saw
24:13
what a really good male does
24:14
the ones we saw might have just been
24:17
losers
24:18
oh really i didn't see that there
24:22
starts to make a lot more sense doesn't
24:23
it i suppose the idea
24:25
from what they're saying is because they
24:27
don't have all these trills and whistles
24:29
and things like that
24:30
the females can't judge how good the
24:32
song is on how technically good it is
24:35
all they can judge it on is how strong
24:37
it is and how loud it is
24:38
what they're saying or how thoughtful
24:40
and quiet it is
24:44
and i think isn't it the case that they
24:46
the reason they are able to be so loud
24:48
is because they don't chew their food
24:50
so they right yeah their beaks open
24:53
don't they really wide yeah they've got
24:55
massive mouths and they just eat whole
24:57
fruit swallow it down completely whole
24:59
and then it just sits there in their
25:00
stomach for ages which maybe is what
25:01
makes their abs so
25:02
so impressive and then they just throw
25:05
up the seeds when they're done and
25:06
because they've got these huge mouths
25:08
and these strong
25:08
digestive muscles and that's meant had
25:11
the side effect have been good at
25:12
singing wow that's very cool they're
25:13
part of a
25:14
so they're called the bell bird i
25:16
believe that's right the white bell bird
25:17
the white bubble so there's a few of
25:18
those species dotted around and there's
25:20
one which is called the three wattled
25:22
bell bird and they have a similar call
25:24
um as loud so if you're a human
25:26
listening to it it's just under a mile
25:28
away that you would hear
25:29
this sound that comes out and that's not
25:32
the loudest your one's the loudest
25:33
imagine being right next to it but um
25:35
they are their sound which is a
25:37
three-part song that they do
25:38
uh for the mating call and for the um
25:40
sort of telling males that i'm in this
25:42
territory
25:43
is called and this is a very english
25:44
word but it's called the bonk
25:47
so for a mating call the bonk is um
25:50
is so in england bonk means to have the
25:53
the sex
25:54
and yeah i mean fancy a bonkey's trumpet
25:58
is a common phrase
26:00
in our culture yeah
26:02
[Applause]
26:06
so um there are other birds called uh
26:09
satin bowel birds and they actually are
26:11
a bit more
26:12
uh sensitive to the females than these
26:15
uh
26:16
these what was it the billboards so they
26:18
they are very they're capable of being
26:20
very loud
26:21
but they realize that if they continue
26:24
very loud once they have an initial
26:25
lead with a female then they will
26:27
startle and put off the females
26:29
so they deliberately tone it down yeah
26:32
they give very intense behavioral
26:33
displays as it's called and then the
26:34
females crouch and say
26:36
i'm not having a nice date anymore and
26:39
the males then back off
26:40
really yeah do you say they're bowel
26:42
birds yes so the one thing i know about
26:44
bowel birds is some of the species they
26:46
make like
26:47
um they make nests that are like little
26:49
tunnels right
26:50
and the at the end of the tunnel they'll
26:52
put a load of
26:53
um like blue objects for instance so
26:56
it's always kind of the same color and
26:57
they'll put a lot of objects there and
26:58
then they'll
26:59
funnel the female into this tunnel and
27:01
show her the amazing objects that they
27:03
collected
27:03
yeah but what they like to do is they
27:06
like to put the bigger objects at the
27:08
back
27:08
and the smaller objects at the front and
27:10
that creates a forced perspective
27:12
so when they stand in the middle of
27:14
their blue objects they look way
27:16
bigger oh isn't that cool well so they
27:19
stand next to the big ones
27:20
yeah or is it the other way around i
27:22
can't remember they understand
27:24
perspective more than you do is what
27:25
you're saying
27:28
they did a study on zebra finches i
27:31
think last year in 2018
27:33
and they found that they practice
27:34
singing in their sleep so they look at
27:36
zebra finches and they see that their
27:37
vocal cords move
27:38
in the exact same way that they move
27:40
when they're awake and their neurons are
27:42
firing in the same way that they're
27:43
firing when they're awake so they're
27:44
literally singing the same tunes
27:46
and the only reason that you can't hear
27:47
them is because they have their mouths
27:49
shut and they're not passing
27:50
air over them and so if you were to
27:53
get a sleeping zebra finch open its
27:56
mouth and then blow
27:58
into its face well you're gonna be
28:00
arrested first of all
28:03
you do not get arrested for blowing it
28:05
as everything well if you don't you
28:07
bloody well should be
28:09
anyway if you do that it will play the
28:10
bird song wow
28:12
isn't that incredible that's incredible
28:13
that's amazing do you know there are
28:14
some birds that french kiss
28:18
white fronted parrots french kiss um
28:21
they will open their beaks and they'll
28:22
flick their tongues back and forth
28:25
it's quite romantic actually uh the male
28:28
the male will then regurgitate his food
28:30
into the female's mouth
28:32
as a form of affection i was just
28:35
looking into mating rituals generally
28:38
within the animal world
28:39
um and i found so this is a bit of it's
28:41
not quite
28:43
directly connected but i found the story
28:45
that happened in china
28:46
a male cat that had been put into a pet
28:50
uh sort of hotel for the evening while
28:52
his owners were away
28:54
um and they told them the cat's not been
28:56
neutered and so you know keep them away
28:58
from other cats
28:59
and they came back in the morning and
29:00
the cats it turned out had all been let
29:03
out
29:03
and the staff had gone home and they saw
29:06
on cctv that this cat
29:07
ended up sleeping with five different
29:09
cats over the course of the evening they
29:11
they didn't know this to begin with but
29:12
they worked out because the cat was so
29:14
exhausted
29:14
that it needed to be put on a glucose
29:16
trip
29:19
it was this cat was absolutely knackered
29:23
and the owner asked to see the cctv and
29:26
he said between the hours of 10 40 p.m
29:28
and 5 00 a.m my cat mated with five
29:31
female cats and those are the only ones
29:32
i could see on the cctv footage
29:35
who knows what else and so they blamed
29:37
him they were like well you should have
29:38
neutered your can
29:39
he said i told them and now all these
29:41
cats are gonna be pregnant
29:42
no cat one no owner wants their cat to
29:44
be pregnant um and his quote is my
29:46
favorite quote
29:47
my [ __ ] cat is exhausted and on a
29:49
glucose drip and this is my fault
29:55
[Applause]
29:56
okay it is time for our final fact of
29:59
the show and that
30:00
is chozinski my fact this week is that
30:02
in the 1490s
30:04
the italians called syphilis the french
30:06
disease
30:07
the french called it the italian disease
30:10
the russians called it the polish
30:12
disease
30:13
the polish called it the turkish disease
30:15
the turkish called it
30:16
the christian disease and the tahitians
30:18
called it the british disease actually
30:22
they all should have been calling it the
30:24
american disease
30:27
it's just scientific facts guys i want
30:30
to make clear at the start of this fact
30:32
i really don't think a nation should be
30:33
blamed for being the origin of an
30:35
illness
30:35
i'm making that clear from the start but
30:37
syphilis started here and
30:43
this was a it was a huge deal so it was
30:45
1495 this syphilis outbreak suddenly
30:47
happened in europe and they didn't know
30:49
where this awful illness had come from
30:51
and there had been a lot of talks it was
30:52
just when columbus had just popped over
30:54
to america
30:55
and picked up some stuff and come back
30:58
and
30:58
so there's been speculation that maybe
31:01
one of the things that he brought back
31:02
with him was syphilis
31:03
but they've recently done a study in
31:05
2011 they actually did a study
31:07
and they looked at all the bones of
31:09
people who maybe died of syphilis from
31:11
the pre-columbus era
31:12
and they found that none of them
31:13
actually had that they're all sort of
31:15
masquerading as syphilis but was
31:16
something else
31:17
and syphilis did not arrive in europe um
31:19
until that
31:20
expedition to the americas yeah but it
31:22
really it devastated europe this is one
31:24
of the reasons why everyone was blaming
31:26
their neighbors because it was ruinous
31:28
and disgusting
31:29
there was a thing about the about the
31:32
people who
31:32
were living in europe and were thought
31:34
to have had syphilis pre-columbus
31:37
so there were 16 bodies uh that were
31:39
found
31:40
and i think there might have been monks
31:42
in england in lindisfarne somewhere
31:44
um but they all beard would have had it
31:47
and they were older so this was very
31:48
good evidence for syphilis not being
31:51
uh a columbian thing however this is the
31:54
amazing thing they lived in coastal
31:55
regions where a load of their diet was
31:57
seafood
31:58
okay and if you eat a load of seafood uh
32:01
a lot of
32:02
uh the water in the deep ocean contains
32:04
old carbon
32:06
is carbon which is a lot older than the
32:08
carbon we get from our food today
32:09
so this thing called the marine
32:11
reservoir effect means that if you eat a
32:12
lot of seafood that will have had deep
32:14
old carbon in it and the carbon in that
32:17
is older so your skeleton
32:19
will look hundreds of years older to
32:22
experts in the future
32:23
so these people died of syphilis but
32:25
they were older than we thought no
32:27
younger than we thought
32:28
these people were a lot younger than we
32:30
thought we thought they were from
32:32
eight hundred eighty seven for example
32:34
but actually they were from way later
32:36
than that
32:36
isn't that bizarre yeah you can make
32:38
yourself seem older by eating seafood
32:40
yeah
32:40
it's a good anti-aging tip actually for
32:42
the afterlife
32:45
avoid fish it wasn't just syphilis that
32:48
we got from the americas
32:49
um we also we also got
32:53
shaggers disease which sounds like a
32:55
synonym for syphilis actually but isn't
32:57
it
32:58
um and there are about eight thousand
32:59
people a year die of that
33:01
uh sorry what do we know what that is uh
33:03
yeah it's like a parasitic
33:05
infection that you get people always
33:06
thought the darwin had it yeah i think
33:08
they've decided that he didn't now
33:09
yeah their pinter is another one which
33:11
is non-fatal and as far as i can see
33:13
they're the three main things that we
33:14
got from the americas
33:16
uh in return americans got bubonic
33:19
plague chickenpox cholera diphtheria
33:21
gonorrhea influenza leprosy malaria
33:24
measles mumps rubella
33:25
scarlet fever smallpox and tuberculosis
33:31
so it doesn't feel like we should be
33:33
blaming them that much oh no
33:35
i like whoever it was he was cheering
33:37
that list though
33:39
some level of pride i've got them all
33:44
got to catch them all
33:47
do you think that was the pokemon go of
33:49
the 1400
33:51
pokemon go immediately to a doctor um
33:54
do you know what in the middle in the
33:56
15th 16th centuries
33:58
or 16th onwards if you it was very
34:00
contagious obviously
34:02
uh and transmitted sexually so you know
34:04
it was a big it was seen as a big social
34:06
problem hence everyone blaming everyone
34:07
else
34:08
so if you were uh in a country that was
34:10
not your own you might be deported if
34:12
you got the disease
34:14
and if you were wealthy you might be put
34:15
under house arrest but
34:17
for people who are not wealthy it was
34:18
still an enormous problem and you could
34:20
go to a hospital they actually
34:22
you know constructed some hospitals to
34:24
help people with this disease but the
34:25
catch was
34:26
you would be publicly whipped before you
34:29
went into hospital
34:30
and then again after you came out oh
34:35
wow yeah it's a good disincentive though
34:38
if you're trying to keep the health
34:39
budget down
34:40
i think telling people you'll beat them
34:42
before and after they go into hospital
34:44
would stop some people from going
34:45
wouldn't it
34:46
i guess yeah i'm not advising it as a
34:48
policy i'm just thinking
34:49
elections coming up in both of our
34:51
countries
34:53
it is definitely a thing though of
34:54
blaming foreigners isn't it for
34:56
um illnesses so for instance um us
34:59
senate um candidate from new hampshire
35:02
scott brown
35:03
said that undocumented immigrants were
35:05
bringing ebola into the u.s
35:08
tom tillis said that they should shut
35:10
down the southern border completely to
35:11
keep ebola at bay
35:13
fox news anchor chris wallace said that
35:16
ebola-infected terrorists might launch a
35:18
biological terror attack from mexico
35:20
basically they thought that people with
35:22
ebola were going to come up from mexico
35:25
and spread it in the u.s now mexico has
35:27
had no confirmed cases of ebola
35:30
in its entire history and in fact the
35:32
closest country to mexico with any
35:34
confirmed ebola cases is of course the
35:36
united states of america
35:37
[Laughter]
35:40
there's a bizarre disease called jumping
35:43
frenchman syndrome
35:45
just a since this fact is about sort of
35:47
us blaming illnesses on the gallic
35:49
peoples
35:50
um so jumping frenchman syndrome was
35:52
only recorded
35:53
in one place one time and it was in
35:56
among the jumping frenchmen of
35:57
maine in 1878 and there were 50 cases of
36:01
it and basically
36:02
it was these people who reacted really
36:04
abnormally to sudden stimuli
36:06
so if you sort of shouted at them they
36:08
just jumped really high in the air
36:10
they either jumped really high or they
36:11
shouted or they hit someone and they
36:13
also had this thing where they
36:14
instinctively obeyed
36:15
any instructions that you gave them if
36:17
you gave them immediate instructions
36:18
they did it straight away without
36:20
thinking about it so if you said you
36:21
know
36:22
push your wife off a cliff they just do
36:24
it and no one knows
36:26
what it is they were all french canadian
36:28
or sort of on the border of canada
36:30
lumberjacks in this remote region and
36:32
they think it might be just one of these
36:33
remote illnesses confined to a very
36:35
like a genetic thing i guess yeah across
36:37
the place how long how long would the
36:39
um the belief in the command last world
36:41
because if you were a lumberjack
36:42
and they said push your wife off a cliff
36:44
you'd have to grab her and run
36:46
quite a long way yeah it would find your
36:49
clip
36:49
yeah okay but you could say punch that
36:51
guy to two
36:53
of the lumberjacks and they would punch
36:54
each other immediately wow
36:56
yeah yeah yeah it was dangerous you
36:57
shouldn't say that around them in fact
37:00
anyone from northern maine just don't
37:01
risk it in case
37:03
i so i found a disease which one of us
37:05
has
37:06
i've discovered um and we won't be this
37:09
is like the best reality show ever
37:11
andy you've got syphilis
37:13
[Laughter]
37:14
well if i have james
37:22
a huge gossip there
37:25
to be discussed in the dressing room
37:28
does the one of us know that we have it
37:30
no no right yeah and i'm not sure
37:32
actually if we do
37:33
have it but um wow but i've got
37:37
evidence that we might so there's a
37:39
thing called coprographia
37:41
um there's a few other variations on
37:43
that word oh i know where you're going
37:45
yeah so the the idea is that you find
37:47
yourself involuntarily if you're just
37:49
sitting down and let's say you have a
37:50
pen and paper or you're near a window
37:52
drawing a [ __ ] and balls on the thing
37:55
it's you just find yourself just doing
37:58
it you didn't know you were doing it
37:59
now the reason i think that one of us
38:00
has it is because when we were recording
38:02
the audiobook of the book of the year
38:04
2019
38:05
instead of reading from the book they
38:07
gave us ipads to read it from
38:09
and halfway through anna discovered
38:11
there's a little button that means you
38:12
can draw on the ipad
38:15
and there was a bit in the book where
38:17
she just didn't say anything for a tiny
38:19
bit
38:19
and we stopped and she went sorry guys i
38:21
don't know what happened i was really
38:22
distracted turned her ipad to us and
38:23
there was a massive [ __ ] and balls
38:25
sitting there wasn't one massive one
38:28
there were loads of small ones
38:30
to be fair that's a big difference
38:32
actually that dad okay
38:34
it was like the shrimp conga it's one
38:36
big one made up of lots of little oh
38:38
that's the thing um i was looking into
38:41
so this fact is about
38:42
how a disease got its name and everyone
38:44
said it was the french and it'll give it
38:46
a different name so i was just i was
38:47
curious about
38:48
names of diseases and how they get them
38:50
and actually uh quite recently a
38:52
colorado
38:53
colorado-based scientist did a thing
38:55
where she wanted to see if an
38:57
ai machine could generate serious
38:59
sounding
39:00
disease names and she fed in 3765
39:05
conditions
39:05
all the all the descriptions of them
39:07
into this machine to see what they came
39:09
up with
39:10
and um some great names came out of it
39:12
so according to a.i
39:14
people out there are suffering from
39:16
penis arthritis
39:20
makes me feel a bit stiff in the morning
39:22
[Laughter]
39:25
they were all amazing insect skulls was
39:28
one
39:28
um cancer of the cancer
39:33
and r.i.p syndrome
39:37
got something we need to wrap up guys
39:41

00:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:23
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:25
this week coming to you live
00:27
from new york city
00:35
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:37
here with anna chazinski
00:39
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:41
and once again we have gathered around
00:42
the microphones with our four favorite
00:44
facts from the last seven days
00:46
and in no particular order here we go
00:49
starting with fact number one and that
00:52
is james
00:52
okay my fact this week is that when race
00:55
horses
00:56
travel by airplane they're allowed to
00:58
bring an emotional support
01:00
goat for no extra cost
01:04
so this is absolutely true it was an
01:07
article i read
01:08
in usa today about a company called
01:11
um h e text sutton and they
01:14
are the only company in america that has
01:17
a specific
01:18
aircraft that it uses to fly horses uh
01:21
that plane
01:22
is known as air horse one
01:26
nice amazing so i i've read the the the
01:29
pet goats sort of keep them calm when
01:31
they're flying because they they are
01:32
friends but they're free they're
01:34
basically hand luggage
01:36
for the because but they also there are
01:38
human grooms who are accompanying the
01:40
horses and you don't have to pay for
01:41
them either
01:42
so they're also hand lugging the humans
01:44
are the basically the carry-on luggage
01:46
of the horses
01:46
and who goes up in the overhead
01:48
compartment and who goes under the seat
01:50
of those two go in the overhead goat in
01:53
the overhead it's not always ghosts
01:54
actually
01:55
is it it's anything that makes the
01:56
horses feel chilled
01:59
so chickens quite often come with them
02:01
basically they try to recreate the
02:02
atmosphere of their stable
02:04
exactly because these racehorses are
02:05
very precious so to make them feel
02:07
comfortable they do that and they have
02:08
constant grooms don't they it's not like
02:10
the proper resources the big guns we'll
02:12
have
02:13
sort of 12 15 grooms constantly
02:15
streaming assuring them
02:17
dan you're not a very good flyer are you
02:18
no yeah would you like it to have like
02:20
15 men just stroking you throughout
02:22
their journey
02:23
well only help right yeah exactly they
02:26
do get uh separated by according to how
02:28
much they pay
02:29
so if you don't pay very much there are
02:31
three of you in a stall and
02:32
that's basically economy and then if
02:34
you're in first class you get a whole
02:36
stool to yourself
02:37
and they're separated by sex are they
02:40
yes
02:40
the the phillies the lady horses
02:44
are loaded at the back so the cults
02:46
which further up don't smell them
02:48
and get excited because the wind is
02:51
going this way
02:52
why is the wind going that way well
02:54
you're flying no no no no
02:56
i'm pretty you have fundamentally you've
02:58
misunderstood how error played
03:00
the air is rushing past this way they
03:03
don't wind the windows down
03:05
i think andy flies in convertible planes
03:10
um so there's no mile high club in the
03:12
horse world nothing no imagine
03:14
it would be mayhem there must have been
03:16
at some point no no there's no
03:18
come on they don't they don't have free
03:21
time it's not like the seat belt sign
03:22
goes off and the horses can wander
03:23
around the plane
03:24
all right i bet sometimes one of the
03:26
backs like oh this toilet's taken do you
03:28
mind if i just pop up front
03:30
and use the girls um maybe not
03:34
this air horse one it's not just horses
03:36
that go in it
03:37
um one time someone took their miniature
03:40
cow
03:41
in the airplane and apparently once they
03:43
took five
03:44
dolphins no but i have no idea how that
03:48
works
03:48
how does that work well they just they
03:50
just have an emotional support crab with
03:52
them
03:52
and then they're fine did you say you
03:54
did know yes
03:56
because uh they they did this another
03:58
time so in 1965 they flew with dolphins
04:00
for the first time
04:01
and this was from the us to the
04:02
netherlands i'm not entirely sure why
04:04
maybe they was going on holiday
04:06
but they had hammocks for them so you
04:08
can see pictures of these dolphins in
04:09
these hammocks with little holes for
04:11
their fins
04:12
and they had each dolphin had a groom
04:14
next to them
04:15
covering them with water at all times so
04:17
they had to be constantly flanneling
04:19
them down
04:20
wow i read about this dolphins the
04:21
dolphins going on um air horse one
04:23
and the operations manager was
04:25
interviewed about the the trip
04:27
and he said everyone involved with those
04:29
dolphins was very hush-hush
04:31
they had a police escort and no one
04:34
would say
04:34
anything or answer questions which made
04:37
you think they were probably
04:38
military dolphins
04:41
okay you know they get the pilots
04:45
treat these animals better than they
04:46
treat us when they're flying they fly
04:48
more carefully
04:50
for the animals so the horses they're so
04:52
worried because the horses are really
04:53
expensive much more expensive than a
04:54
human
04:55
and so they really don't want them these
04:56
resources to be damaged
04:58
by falling over or whatever so the
04:59
pilots do extremely wide turns in the
05:02
air and
05:03
very very gentle ascents and descents to
05:05
the extent that the aircraft can
05:07
actually detour for more than 500 miles
05:10
in order to just not disturb the horses
05:12
no
05:13
because they do a massive loop instead
05:15
of going just going and then turning
05:17
straight left yeah exactly
05:18
whenever you've been in a plane that's
05:19
turned straight left you really fly
05:22
economy what do you mean fly economy
05:26
it's not like the economy people going
05:28
one direction the business class going
05:29
another direction
05:30
we've already established that andy
05:32
thinks there's a gust of wind blowing
05:34
so uh emotional support oh yeah animals
05:37
on planes
05:38
uh this is obviously a big a huge thing
05:41
and um i mean the stories keep cropping
05:43
up and they keep on being funny because
05:45
animals on planes
05:46
just doesn't work so i don't know if you
05:48
guys saw this there was a
05:50
british flight from what was from
05:51
gatwick to austin this was
05:53
last month and it was delayed by an hour
05:56
and a half
05:57
because two emotional support bulldogs
06:00
which were wearing tutus and were there
06:03
to help their owners get through the
06:04
flight
06:05
they themselves became too distressed to
06:07
be on the plane
06:09
oh really yeah the dogs the dogs needed
06:11
emotional support
06:12
and did they get it no no of course no
06:15
they might be
06:16
well it does make sense because animals
06:18
with anxious humans
06:20
become more anxious don't they that's
06:21
been proven i think so
06:23
really if you do have an emotional
06:24
support animal they should have one
06:26
and it should go smaller and smaller and
06:28
smaller yeah
06:29
mostly support amoeba
06:33
i don't know one of the first ones that
06:34
kind of um became big online and was a
06:37
bit of a meme was someone called carla
06:38
fitzgerald
06:39
and she had a duck and she was getting
06:42
on the plane and someone took a photo
06:43
and put it online
06:44
um i do remember that but what i didn't
06:46
remember is that the duck's name
06:48
was daniel turducken stinkerbot
06:53
not the first ever emotional support
06:55
animals turducken turducken that's the
06:57
thing where you put it
06:58
is it don't check inside a turkey and
07:00
then a chicken inside the duck
07:02
sure if i if i think so i think that's
07:05
it
07:05
all i'm saying is that if i was a duck
07:06
and my middle name was turducken i would
07:08
be concerned
07:09
about that the future held for me
07:11
[Laughter]
07:12
that's right but maybe that's the
07:14
incentive to be emotionally supportive
07:15
to your owner
07:16
otherwise it's sort of a warning about
07:17
where you might end up yeah
07:19
this is my pet duck donald hoyson murray
07:25
this is crazy though so that was um 2013
07:27
i think that story happened 2011 so
07:29
there's a national service
07:30
for animal registry and they're the ones
07:32
who will sort of issue a vest
07:34
that the um the animal will have to wear
07:36
and they give the certificate as well
07:38
2011 there was 2 400 animals that were
07:41
issued with that
07:43
now we've got over two hundred thousand
07:45
so
07:46
it's exploded into but i've never seen a
07:49
duck on the plane
07:50
no me neither all the articles you read
07:53
imply that they're creating havoc on all
07:54
of our flights has anyone ever
07:56
seen an emotional sport and i want to
07:57
fly yeah oh yeah
07:59
wow they're all here all right well
08:01
that's what we've left okay it's
08:02
horrible
08:03
that's not then um they are they are
08:04
controversial though because they have
08:06
exponentially increased as you say and
08:08
there is
08:09
almost no evidence to back up the idea
08:11
that if you have a genuine mental
08:13
illness that
08:14
having an emotional support animal on
08:16
the flight can um make it
08:18
make you feel better as in there hasn't
08:19
been the studies done but obviously for
08:21
individuals
08:22
it does seem to work but there is this
08:24
industry cropping up to make money so
08:26
you can get these certificates really
08:27
easily off amazon you just like click a
08:29
button and you get a certificate saying
08:30
this is an emotionally support certified
08:33
frog
08:33
or whatever and um it's actually really
08:35
weird researching this because i was
08:36
reading all these articles about how
08:38
it's being so fraudulently used and how
08:39
no one should do it but
08:40
because you know the google algorithms
08:42
are sort of idiots sometimes
08:44
in the middle of these articles i kept
08:45
getting advertised do you want an
08:47
emotional support certificate for your
08:48
dolphin in three easy steps
08:51
can i just say um we went to google the
08:53
other day and i think some of our
08:54
friends from google might be in here so
08:56
i'd just like to say they're not idiots
08:59
they're very smart guys i'm very vocal
09:02
um do you know
09:03
one of the first in my opinion uh
09:05
emotional support animals
09:07
go on uh from the early 20th century um
09:10
so in the early
09:11
decade in the first decade of flight a
09:13
lot of people would fly with an animal
09:15
called a spotted cockpit terrier
09:17
and this was a special breed of dog that
09:19
didn't really get upset if you put him
09:21
in an
09:21
aircraft and also it gave off a lot of
09:24
heat and so it would keep you warm in
09:26
your cockpit
09:27
so for instance in your kind of planes
09:28
where the wind is coming
09:31
and you're getting cold you have this
09:32
little dog and it keeps you warm sorry
09:34
is this real this is real
09:36
wow there's loads of photos of them if
09:38
you go on smithsonian you'll see loads
09:40
of pictures of
09:41
these early pioneers of flight with a
09:43
little dog next to them
09:44
that's not emotional support any more
09:46
than really wearing a jacket is
09:47
emotional support is it
09:50
um i was looking into the history of
09:52
flying horses
09:53
um so
09:58
it's just like from pegasus yeah let me
10:01
rephrase that
10:02
um i was looking into the history of
10:04
horses that have been made to fly
10:05
and and and surprisingly it goes back to
10:10
the
10:10
17th uh century uh actually more the
10:13
18th century
10:14
um i found this and i can't believe this
10:16
is true but i've seen numerous drawings
10:18
of it they used to do hot air ballooning
10:19
with horses
10:21
um back in france and there's an image
10:23
and so
10:24
initially it's not like the horse is
10:26
even in the basket they attached the
10:27
strings around the horse
10:29
and it was a person called m who used to
10:32
ride the horse
10:33
up into the air as it was attached to
10:36
the balloons
10:37
yeah so the horse was the basket and
10:40
he just used to go up and just wave and
10:43
then
10:43
land and trot off into the distance
10:46
which is crazy and then there was this
10:47
other guy pierre
10:48
tetsu brissy who had a basket but he had
10:51
a horse in it and he did over 50 flights
10:53
with his horse
10:54
wow he is amazing that guy yeah he did a
10:56
lot of experiments in the early days of
10:58
ballooning and one of the things that he
11:00
did
11:00
is people didn't really know what
11:02
happened with electrical storms and
11:04
um and thunder and lightning and stuff
11:06
like that and so he went up
11:07
into clouds where there was thunder and
11:09
lightning with
11:10
a metal rod to see if he could get the
11:13
lightning to strike it wow
11:15
and presumably it didn't if it did it
11:18
only happened once again
11:21
well right so this is not an animal but
11:23
i was looking into what are the things
11:24
that aren't allowed on planes and if
11:25
we're allowed all these animals on what
11:27
what can you get on and there's a lady
11:28
called jan bevin a few years ago so
11:30
she's in switzerland and she was going
11:31
to baltimore to do
11:33
a concerto and she plays the cello the
11:35
cello was too big
11:37
um for she was worried about it being
11:38
checked in blow so she bought the cello
11:40
a seat
11:41
on the plane which is actually done
11:42
quite a lot so
11:44
she signed it in as chuck cello she gave
11:46
it a name and
11:47
and she got to the airport and they
11:49
didn't let her fly to america because
11:51
the cello did not have a visa
11:53
to get in
11:57
it's got a seat so it has to be a thing
11:58
and it hasn't got a visa so she got
12:01
kicked off the flight she didn't never
12:02
made it yet never made it to her concert
12:04
i think it's really dangerous to
12:06
uh call your cello chuck cello when
12:08
airport staff are handling it
12:10
it sounds too much like an instruction
12:12
[Laughter]
12:18
it is time for fact number two and that
12:20
is cecinski
12:21
my fact this week is that the french
12:24
can't decide how to say the word
12:26
pencil in their own language
12:30
so i couldn't believe this a lot of us
12:32
learned friends when we're growing up
12:33
and i guess we're just taught to say
12:35
creon but there's an article about how
12:37
basically france is split up into
12:39
regions depending on their word for
12:40
pencil
12:41
and i counted seven different words for
12:43
it it is insane and if you talk to
12:45
people from
12:46
the individual regions they think the
12:47
guy next door is an idiot who says it a
12:49
different way
12:50
so and i actually i i called my french
12:53
friend
12:53
and said okay what do you think of this
12:55
article what do you say
12:56
and so he said he would call it
13:00
as in a crayon for paper or a crayon
13:04
and which seems to mean crayon of the
13:06
mine
13:07
uh which is very weird but then uh he
13:09
said but also apparently you can call it
13:11
crayon de papier now my friend who's
13:13
from provence said
13:14
if someone asked me for a crayon i would
13:17
very politely
13:18
give him a pencil and i would ask him to
13:20
go and draw some stick figures you
13:21
functional illiterates
13:23
because that means a pencil made of
13:26
paper
13:29
but apparently not to these guys he
13:32
speculated that it was on the east side
13:33
of france he speculated maybe it was
13:34
something that came over with the nazis
13:37
that was this that feels like a stretch
13:39
doesn't it
13:42
they did a lot of bad stuff that feels
13:45
like a longer term destabilization
13:47
project doesn't it
13:49
so what did cause the second french
13:50
revolution well
13:51
[Laughter]
13:53
wow it is weird so i mean they are the
13:55
creogri
13:56
is another one grey crayon which my
13:57
friend said maybe i heard that if i read
13:59
a book from the 50s i might have read it
14:01
like that
14:02
um a pencil made of wood
14:05
maybe to distinguish from those little
14:06
plastic ones that have the lead come up
14:08
through them
14:10
uh and yeah seven different words for
14:11
pencil don't know how to say it i don't
14:12
know how they've got anywhere
14:14
in life discounts they probably just use
14:18
pens
14:20
good point and they do they all they're
14:23
always having
14:23
furious rails about their language
14:25
though the french and they have this
14:26
body the academy francaise
14:28
which is very very ancient it was
14:30
founded nearly 400 years ago
14:32
and its job is just to rule on french
14:34
language disputes
14:35
and especially if an english word makes
14:37
its way into the language they have to
14:38
come up with a french
14:39
equivalent for it yeah and they so
14:43
the generally very elderly once you
14:46
joined you're in for life
14:47
uh in 2010 they made a big decision they
14:50
voted that new entrants
14:51
must be under 75 years old because too
14:54
many were over there and they didn't
14:55
make it retroactive because they would
14:57
have had to kick out
14:58
almost everybody in the academy
15:01
and they're called immortals aren't they
15:03
yeah which i don't know if that can't be
15:05
they're not they frequently die they
15:07
[Laughter]
15:11
um they they have a special uniform they
15:14
have an official uniform
15:15
which is known as la biver which i think
15:18
translates as green clothing
15:20
because there is green but then there
15:23
also means worm
15:24
it also means towards and it also means
15:27
glass
15:28
okay so if in french you want to say the
15:31
green worm
15:31
goes towards the green glass is
15:34
translated as
15:35
la verve the lavertha
15:38
no cool
15:42
that's amazing
15:45
so today today at home have the
15:48
bear which is the green clothing and the
15:51
next have a worm costume so oh no i've
15:54
turned up in the night
15:55
when i meant to turn up in my head i'm
15:57
sure that has happened on numerous
15:59
occasions it's too
16:00
it's too far-fetched i regretted
16:01
conjuring up the image as i said it
16:03
um yeah there are they are also almost
16:06
exclusively men there have only ever
16:08
been
16:08
nine female immortals although they've
16:10
already been 730 in the last 400 years
16:13
in total but that is still a low
16:14
percentage yeah that's that's sorry
16:17
but we just established that as
16:18
definitely a low percentage
16:20
they they also there's a thing i've been
16:22
trying to actually find out if this is
16:23
true um so i wonder if you guys have
16:26
heard but
16:27
so when someone passes away that's when
16:28
they have to refill a seat right
16:30
but each seat has a different number
16:32
assigned to it and so you fill a pre
16:34
you fill up someone's a predecessor's
16:36
seat and as part of filling it you need
16:38
to make a speech about how great they
16:40
are
16:41
there's currently a bunch of empty seats
16:43
because no one is willing to say nice
16:44
things about the person
16:46
who that was their predecessor wow and i
16:49
looked into the list there's about six
16:50
empty seats and there's no reason for it
16:52
because
16:52
it's an elite they say this is the most
16:54
this is the greatest elitist secret club
16:56
that you could be a part of
16:58
in france you're commanding the language
17:00
some of the greatest writers in the
17:01
history of france have been a part of it
17:03
and the six mtc is the last six with
17:05
dicks
17:06
a lot of the great writers didn't get to
17:08
be part of it right so balzac tried to
17:10
get in zola tried to get him
17:12
none of them could wow yeah they do
17:14
sound like a kind of a bunch of
17:15
arseholes too no no
17:24
and it was basically created to stop the
17:27
english invasion
17:28
of the french language and they've done
17:29
quite well in 1635 uh by louis xiii
17:32
chief
17:33
minister and yeah because they didn't
17:36
like the idea that english might be
17:38
you know might start encroaching on
17:39
their territory but it does mean they
17:40
have these weird words so
17:42
um they have a word for a podcast in
17:45
fact
17:46
which so most countries would sort of go
17:48
with podcast
17:49
uh but they're french well yes french
17:52
podcast will be german yes
17:56
pilfcast russian italian
18:03
let's try nigerian no i don't think we
18:05
should
18:07
we've reached my limit thank you let's
18:10
move on quickly
18:11
uh so there for podcast is uh diffusion
18:16
which is a broadcast for walkman
18:20
wow and this is where the academy
18:23
members age i think really starts to
18:26
show
18:28
um so the but the french language has it
18:31
just the size of the whole lexicon is
18:33
smaller than the english language
18:34
so this causes problems for translations
18:37
for example
18:38
so uh the harry potter books are long
18:42
uh in french they're even longer in
18:44
french um
18:45
so voldemort he who must not be named is
18:50
pronounced
18:54
and they have really fun times
18:55
translating those books so
18:57
uh hufflepuff is poof
19:01
nice so good and they like
19:05
some of them they're really literal so
19:06
neville longbottom is
19:08
long duba or neville long in the bottom
19:12
um and then but the uh
19:16
hogwarts the school is uh
19:19
which means pig lice so hog warts
19:22
has become pig lice nice yeah
19:25
so they've taken two words for pig and
19:27
put them together and then two words for
19:29
an std and put them together
19:31
very cool yeah no you're right
19:35
yeah so there is a letter in french
19:37
which is a letter u
19:39
and then it's got like a graph accent so
19:41
it's going down down from the top left
19:43
to the bottom right
19:44
and that letter is only in one word in
19:47
the entire language
19:48
wow and that is the word which means
19:51
where and the only reason it's there is
19:53
because there's another word
19:55
which means or but they're pronounced
19:57
exactly the same but they put this extra
19:59
letter in so you know which one you're
20:01
talking about
20:02
so it's only in a single word and yet on
20:04
a french keyboard it still has its own
20:06
key
20:08
that's awesome amazing isn't that
20:09
amazing and you know that key it feels
20:11
so cocky because it is not nearly as
20:13
rubbed off as
20:14
any of the others
20:14
[Laughter]
20:17
did you know the french didn't have a
20:19
word for french kissing until 2013.
20:21
did they no they they they didn't did
20:23
they dance no
20:28
what did they what did they say when
20:30
they were like oh let's do the let's do
20:32
the put my
20:36
like fish don't need a word for water
20:38
you know like
20:39
[Laughter]
20:44
i i believe that what i found is that
20:47
they had phrases like
20:48
kissing at length in the mouth
20:51
which is so sexy um but they've changed
20:54
it to
20:55
uh galoshes which is a word that also
20:58
means an ice skating boot so
21:02
the idea is that you're kind of sliding
21:04
around
21:07
don't shoot the messenger
21:12
the world to kiss is actually another
21:14
disaster for the french
21:16
they have seven different ways of saying
21:17
to kiss as in just a pec on the cheek
21:19
depending on where you're from so like
21:20
fair labez
21:22
bass bj and then there's one which is
21:25
beze
21:26
which i think in belgium means kiss and
21:29
comes from the origin kiss and in like
21:31
the 30s you would use it to mean kiss
21:32
but now
21:33
means very explicitly to have sex with
21:36
but if
21:36
like that word starts with an f um and
21:40
but if you come from belgium and you
21:41
just say that like give me a kiss then
21:43
someone books a motel room
21:47
do you know you're allowed to say the
21:48
word [ __ ] in canada
21:50
on the radio in canada we've got some
21:53
canadian [ __ ] in tonight
21:56
in canada you're allowed to say the word
21:58
[ __ ] on the radio
22:00
as long as you're on a french language
22:02
station and the reason is because they
22:04
think the french speakers don't have the
22:06
same connotation of the word as english
22:08
speakers
22:10
just coincidentally with that word i was
22:12
looking into in china they have a lot of
22:14
censorship obviously from the government
22:16
about what words they can use
22:17
particularly online and one of the
22:19
things that you can't say are swear
22:20
words
22:21
um and so they've managed to get by that
22:24
by using
22:25
[ __ ] the english word but using chinese
22:27
words to sort of use that
22:29
to appropriate it so what they'll say on
22:31
chinese
22:32
on a chinese website is [ __ ] you
22:35
so wait so far
22:44
yeah you too
22:48
that doesn't that's not a chinese word
22:49
too great um okay yeah
22:51
all right what but what does that what
22:52
does that mean oh it will it literally
22:54
translates as french croatian squid
22:58
which is a mythical creature in china a
23:00
squid that was simultaneously found in
23:03
both france
23:04
and croatia and they thought we'll call
23:07
it [ __ ] are you
23:08
because hence that so yeah that's how
23:10
they get buy-in that's really
23:12
great are you talking about this
23:13
mythical script the french croatian
23:15
squid
23:17
do you wanna hear some french phrases
23:19
and just see if you can get what they
23:20
mean
23:20
okay so uh avoir i'm pett
23:24
you're farting sideways farting sideways
23:28
um um it means that um
23:31
you're not doing anything right you're
23:33
doing something really simple that
23:35
normal people will be able to do but
23:36
you're doing it
23:37
sideways that's much better it just
23:39
means you're grumpy
23:40
oh ah okay um all right all right all
23:43
right
23:44
pc long this is like pissing in a violin
23:48
this is like pushing uh is it something
23:50
to do with bringing musical instruments
23:52
onto a plane
23:53
yes uh you'd need a lot to fill up a
23:55
cello
23:56
it's like this is fun but i feel like
23:59
there's strings attached
24:04
i've got my penis out and i feel like i
24:06
need a fiddle
24:07
yeah yeah
24:11
these are all much better than the real
24:12
ones end this
24:14
and this it just means something's
24:15
useless just useless there's no point to
24:17
this this is like
24:18
pissing at a violin well if you need the
24:20
toilet
24:21
it's i think it's because it's got holes
24:23
in it no no no no no
24:26
no anna's right if you
24:30
in extremis and you've got a lot of
24:32
violins to spare
24:34
you only need one it depends how fully
24:36
bladder is but two max i would have
24:37
thought
24:39
this is why they had a revolution louis
24:40
xiv kept wasting priceless stradivarius
24:44
the french do really protect their
24:46
language this academy really shows that
24:48
there's a rule that i think they're a
24:49
bit
24:49
going a bit lacks on now in france and
24:51
sort of talking about it but on radio 40
24:53
of all music needs to be french yes
24:55
that's that's the thing
24:56
but this other thing that i discovered
24:58
is that at the olympics
25:00
there is someone who is hired
25:01
specifically from the french side
25:03
to go around all the events of the
25:05
olympics to make sure there's enough
25:07
french going on in them okay
25:10
what do you think what do you mean by
25:11
that so they go to the javelin and they
25:13
make sure one person's throwing a
25:14
baguette
25:18
it's all to do with language the
25:20
language needs to be the commentary
25:21
needs to do it if there's a sign to the
25:23
toilet
25:23
it needs to say you know he say don't
25:31
and the person whose job it is for every
25:32
olympics to do that is called the great
25:34
witness
25:35
and the great witness goes around going
25:37
no not french not enough french
25:39
because it's the official language
25:40
english and french are the official
25:41
olympic languages i've never heard
25:43
olympic commentary
25:44
and heard them shout out french words
25:46
they're like
25:47
you know you don't hear that it's all in
25:49
english
25:51
i mean being a prostitute is not an
25:52
event in the olympics
25:54
so um
25:58
uh should we move on to our next act i
26:00
think we should okay it is time
26:03
it is time for fact number three and
26:05
that is andy
26:06
my fact is that there is a gravity
26:08
measuring device in maryland
26:10
so sensitive that it can tell whether or
26:13
not the scientists working on it
26:15
have had lunch i can already tell if
26:18
i've had lunch
26:20
don't even need this thing no you're
26:22
right well that's several million
26:23
dollars they have really
26:26
chucked away um um
26:29
this is an amazing thing so this is uh
26:31
nasa's goddard space flight center it's
26:34
in maryland
26:34
and they have built a machine that
26:41
is the punchline or my pronunciation of
26:43
it is the punchline
26:45
say it again and let's see when they
26:46
laugh
26:50
uh guys [ __ ] you
26:55
[Applause]
26:59
i don't ask you to pronounce lester and
27:01
chumbly and all these weird english
27:02
words
27:05
right so in maryland
27:10
there is a machine that says it's just
27:13
written there it's just maryland
27:15
mary right great can we all just can we
27:18
plow on
27:19
we've you know got to be out by nine um
27:25
i can't read anything out anymore i'm
27:26
too nervous
27:28
look it doesn't matter where it is the
27:31
location is not important of the machine
27:35
it's in america
27:38
um so it uses uh quantum mechanics there
27:41
are 100 billion cesium atoms in a column
27:43
and it times
27:44
how quickly these individual atoms fall
27:46
from the top to the bottom wow
27:48
so it and it basically it weighs nearby
27:50
material and the scientists noticed they
27:52
were getting different readings
27:54
when they came back after lunch to this
27:56
machine than when they did it before
27:58
than when they were working on it before
27:59
so sort of the most expensive fat
28:00
shaving device in history
28:06
um yeah so it's an incredible thing so
28:08
the reason
28:09
it is useful is not just because it can
28:10
tell you if you've had lunch
28:12
but if they want to put it in space
28:15
they're already a couple of
28:16
amazing gravity-sensing satellites in
28:18
space but this one is
28:20
ten times better than the existing ones
28:22
and what it means is that you can point
28:24
it at individual places
28:25
and you can measure the size of a
28:26
glacier and you can say that glacier is
28:28
shrunk by that much because the gravity
28:30
has altered around it or you can observe
28:33
changes in
28:34
aquifer levels even underground like
28:36
it's it's insane stuff
28:37
that's incredible because glaciers are
28:39
changing the weight
28:40
of the world aren't they constantly
28:42
melting glaciers so
28:44
england and scotland or england and
28:45
wales versus scotland
28:47
are on a seesaw right now with each
28:49
other because of
28:51
glacial melting so basically this weird
28:53
thing happens where as glaciers melt
28:55
which is happening a bit more due to
28:57
supposed climate change you've got to
29:00
play to your audience
29:04
yeah play to the coast yeah i don't mean
29:08
that
29:08
but basically scotland which is much
29:11
colder used to have a huge weight of
29:12
glacial ice which has been melting over
29:14
the few tens of thousands of years
29:16
and so as it melts the water dissipates
29:18
and scotland's losing weight
29:20
whereas comparatively england getting a
29:21
bit fatter comparatively
29:23
and so england is sort of sinking so
29:25
it's like a very gradual seesaw a very
29:27
boring seesaw where if you're at the
29:28
scotland end
29:29
you're on your way up at the england and
29:31
you're on your way down
29:33
oh well and at some point i think we
29:35
should just jump off the seesaw and give
29:37
scotland a broken coccyx
29:41
what a difficult child you must have
29:43
been
29:46
on these kind of measuring devices that
29:48
are really really sensitive
29:49
there are seismograph stations at
29:51
yellowstone
29:52
that can measure the flushing of toilets
29:55
at the old faithful
29:56
inn that's amazing
29:59
they're trying to get the geezers and
30:01
they see something on their on the scale
30:03
and it's actually someone flushing the
30:04
toilet
30:05
wow that's insane yeah i feel like i
30:08
would feel like my privacy had been
30:09
violated if i used the toilets at the
30:11
what was it the old
30:12
at the old faithful ed faithful in yeah
30:14
and i knew that scientists was watching
30:15
that and judging
30:16
they're not watching
30:19
i've misunderstood i bet they radio
30:21
through to their scientists mate outside
30:23
the old faithful to point at the guy
30:24
leaving the loo and be like
30:26
we know what you've done
30:29
i was just looking at weighing things
30:31
and um
30:32
so do you guys know the first person to
30:34
weigh the world
30:36
was no oh sorry yeah take a take a guess
30:41
was it someone ancient greek or no no it
30:43
wasn't actually so
30:44
newton told us how we could weight the
30:46
world uh
30:47
but he didn't bother doing it yeah yeah
30:49
and a hundred years later henry
30:51
cavendish signed us henry cavendish
30:52
decided to try and weigh the world
30:54
and the way you can do it basically he
30:56
did it by uh
30:57
so he knew that objects with larger mass
30:59
will attract objects with smaller mass
31:01
and even if you're on earth if you've
31:02
got a big lead ball and you suspend a
31:04
little lead ball next to it it will very
31:06
very slightly be attracted to it and
31:08
basically because of the
31:10
gravity equation that newton worked out
31:12
if you can measure exactly how much that
31:14
little lead ball
31:15
moves towards the big one you can work
31:17
out the mass of
31:18
the earth so he weighed the earth it was
31:20
pretty amazing he came within
31:22
just by balancing two lead balls
31:23
together he came within one percent of
31:25
what we know the earth weighs
31:26
today wow but he was a real weirdo
31:30
so he he was terrified of women henry
31:34
cavendish he never addressed strangers
31:36
directly because he was cripplingly shy
31:38
um he had so he had a house and servants
31:41
but he had a private staircase built in
31:43
the back of himself of his hat of
31:44
himself
31:47
no wonder he didn't like strangers if
31:49
they're climbing up the back of him all
31:50
the time
31:53
private staggers built in the back of
31:54
his house for himself because he was so
31:57
terrified of meeting servants on the
31:58
stairs and he actually he was a really
32:01
smart guy
32:01
and he went to cambridge and his final
32:04
oral exams that he had to take to pass
32:06
his degree his natural philosophy degree
32:08
he just dropped out all together because
32:10
he was so terrified of talking in public
32:12
in this oral exam didn't get his degree
32:14
he was insane he when he got introduced
32:16
to people sort of a gathering his famous
32:18
scientist
32:19
he'd be introduced and sometimes he used
32:21
to just be introduced
32:22
turn away turn his back on the person
32:24
and sprint out of the room as fast as he
32:25
could and hail the nearest carriage and
32:27
just gallop off into
32:28
the sunset wow do you guys know just on
32:31
gravity do you know that
32:32
people have a phobia of gravity there's
32:35
a word for that
32:36
okay is that people who are scared of
32:38
that that might fall over
32:39
it's it's yeah there's different
32:41
versions of their fear so it's called
32:43
barophobia
32:44
um so one thing is that they've their
32:46
fear is that gravity will get really
32:48
strong and just crush them
32:49
all of a sudden well i wasn't scared
32:52
about that until now yeah
32:54
so just a sudden change in the universe
32:56
and we'll all just go squat
32:57
um and then the second one i think
33:01
it would be quite funny for a few
33:02
minutes and everyone walking around when
33:04
you would yeah
33:05
yeah the other version is that you're on
33:07
a high place and gravity suddenly pulls
33:09
you off so that's
33:10
that's a sort of fear of falling
33:11
basically yeah and then the third one is
33:13
that
33:13
gravity kind of just goes away and we
33:15
all just float away
33:17
like a horse on a hot air balloon we and
33:20
that's these are these are genuine fears
33:22
that people have
33:23
wow yeah hey i was reading so obviously
33:26
the best example that we have
33:27
of understanding how gravity works for
33:29
humans who aren't on planets are
33:31
astronauts and how it plays with the
33:33
body and so on
33:34
um and so i was reading that the bladder
33:36
of humans is a really interesting thing
33:38
when you go to space because
33:39
we don't know because everything's
33:41
floating around astronauts don't know
33:43
that they need to go to the toilet
33:45
they have no idea so they've been told
33:48
it must become obvious at some stage yes
33:50
so john glenn when he was up there it
33:52
became obvious when his bladder
33:54
had a full 27 ounces in there that's
33:57
seven ounces more than a bladder is
34:00
meant to take
34:01
so he was expanding basically with urine
34:04
and
34:04
the problem is is that when it gets too
34:06
full the urethra gets covered so
34:08
it's a problem with actually being so
34:10
astronauts just have to go every two
34:11
hours regardless
34:12
just to get rid of the urine sorry there
34:14
was a bit in there that i didn't quite
34:15
understand
34:16
yeah your urethra gets covered yes
34:20
by urine i didn't read the whole article
34:23
but and yet that's the bit that i'm
34:27
going to wake up in the middle of the
34:28
night remembering
34:31
you can't need to go too much to go yeah
34:34
that's not because the urine is blocking
34:36
off the entrance to your
34:38
the urine hasn't solidified at the
34:39
entrance and then stopped the rest of
34:41
the urine getting through
34:42
i assume not until dad said that
34:46
but this is so if we ever get to mars
34:48
and live on mars
34:50
that will be a problem for the people
34:52
who grow up on mars
34:53
because gravity is much lighter there so
34:55
they will probably be
34:56
taller but when they come back to earth
34:58
if they ever do they will not be able to
35:00
get out of bed
35:01
because the gravity is three times
35:02
stronger oh right so
35:04
it's like um is it superman who comes to
35:07
earth and then the gravity is different
35:08
on his planet to our planet and yeah
35:09
that means he can fly around is that
35:11
right
35:11
is that why he can fly yeah
35:15
according to one person in the audience
35:17
who i am gonna believe
35:18
the original mythology was that he could
35:20
leap us a building in a single bound
35:22
that was the thing because they couldn't
35:24
quite work out with the movies and the
35:25
animation how to make him fly and then
35:27
they worked that out and then it turned
35:28
into
35:29
okay is that because the gravity is so
35:31
strong on his planet that he's developed
35:32
incredibly strong legs to counteract him
35:34
so he can
35:35
leap really easily i think that is true
35:37
but the thing is about humans
35:39
right no no no no is everyone on his
35:42
planet just walking around normally
35:44
well i think his planet got destroyed i
35:45
don't really know anything about it
35:48
andy krypton's no longer i'm afraid oh
35:50
man yeah
35:51
really anyway
35:54
back to the real world um the the amount
35:57
that humans can manage on other planets
35:59
about um
36:00
depending on how big their gravity is
36:02
people have looked into that
36:03
that was such a strange sentence i'm
36:05
going to start again so
36:07
scientists have looked on other planets
36:09
that have more gravity and try to work
36:11
out how much we would be able to manage
36:13
and they've looked at that by seeing how
36:15
much people can squat
36:17
and what they can lift when they're
36:18
squatting and they reckon the absolute
36:20
maximum that anyone will be able to do
36:22
is
36:23
4.6 times of our gravity
36:26
if you couldn't do that you wouldn't
36:27
have enough strength to even lift your
36:29
legs to walk around the planet
36:30
and the way that they found that out is
36:32
by looking at a guy called um
36:34
hathor julius bjornsson
36:37
who was also sir gregor the mountain
36:40
clegane from game of thrones
36:42
oh cool and he has the world record for
36:45
squat lifts he was the world's strongest
36:47
man and he did that this year
36:48
and they worked out how much the gravity
36:51
would they be able to work so that the
36:52
mountain will be able to
36:54
walk and it's 4.6 times so if we were on
36:57
if it was dan's world where gravity
37:00
suddenly got really really strong that
37:01
we all got squashed
37:02
if it was 4.6 times he would be the only
37:05
person able to walk on the whole planet
37:07
wow that's the tv series i would watch
37:09
yeah it's just gregor clegane walking
37:12
around a load of pancake people
37:14
[Laughter]
37:18
[Music]
37:19
okay it's time for our final fact of the
37:21
show and that is my fact
37:23
my fact this week is that the pirate who
37:26
mentored
37:26
blackbeard once attacked a ship purely
37:29
to steal
37:30
all of the hats of everyone on board
37:33
because his crew had drunkenly thrown
37:35
all of their own hats overboard the
37:37
night before
37:40
[Applause]
37:42
so this is a guy called benjamin horner
37:45
gold and
37:46
he was he was a pirate i just say horny
37:48
gold is a great name for a pirate
37:50
yeah but when he goes the two things
37:52
he's after in life
37:53
that's true is it horny first name
37:56
surname gold middle name four
37:58
hold it yeah i'm horny for gold yeah
38:01
yeah um no it's not um
38:05
okay so benjamin let's just call him
38:06
benjamin um no so this was in the 1700s
38:09
1717
38:10
and basically they had this massive
38:12
night out on their ship they threw their
38:13
hats
38:14
on you know into the ocean just yeah and
38:17
so
38:18
and we know about this because we have
38:20
reports from the ship that was
38:22
was robbed and basically terrifying a
38:24
bunch of pirates come on they said
38:26
please don't hurt us and they went
38:27
okay cool can we have your hat took the
38:29
hat and left there was money on there
38:31
there was everything on there
38:33
they didn't need it um and yeah so this
38:36
was
38:36
blackbeard's mentor blackbeard was his
38:38
second in command for many many years
38:40
yeah it's weird to think of pirates
38:42
having mentors
38:45
you sort of assigned an older pirate
38:47
student to
38:48
look after you through your early years
38:50
yeah um so blackbeard
38:52
so did he teach blackbeard all of his
38:54
trademark [ __ ] like blackbeard was very
38:56
famous for having
38:57
sort of fireworks sewn into his hair
38:59
wasn't he had this huge
39:01
head of black hair full of fireworks to
39:03
scare people
39:04
um and so he did sorry because you're
39:06
mowing over that as a
39:08
fat that was a crazy thing that he did
39:10
this was a pirate
39:11
who put fireworks in his head as he was
39:15
robbing people and he didn't have he had
39:17
a beard like
39:18
fire hazards are everywhere in that
39:20
situation yeah
39:22
and that's how he scared people it is
39:24
also no record of him ever
39:26
killing anyone i don't think but he just
39:28
yeah he's sort of ruled by fear and in
39:30
fact i think the reason that we
39:32
romanticize pirates
39:33
uh is because of this thing that was
39:34
written in 1724 a general history of the
39:37
robberies and murders of the most
39:39
notorious pirates
39:40
and this described blackbeard and it
39:43
said his beard was black
39:44
extravagant length as to breadth it came
39:47
up to his eyes
39:48
which i didn't even know bears could do
39:50
that and he was i don't know how you
39:52
grow it that way and he was accustomed
39:54
to twist it with ribbons in
39:56
small tails and turn them about his ears
39:58
which suddenly sounds actually much less
40:00
threatening
40:00
yeah it sounds like his mentor is just
40:04
there doing pigtails
40:07
yeah he uh this just to go back to horny
40:10
gold for a second yeah yeah
40:12
pornygold do you know how he was got rid
40:14
of from his ship
40:16
he got voted out by his crew right like
40:18
hex factor
40:19
yes it was quite uh placid
40:23
so he didn't want to attack british
40:26
ships
40:27
and um his crew said look we're missing
40:29
a lot of opportunities here
40:30
and they deposed him in a vote and then
40:33
he was just a passenger on board their
40:35
ship
40:35
as they were going around attacking
40:37
other people he was sitting in the brig
40:38
going well i wouldn't do it this way if
40:39
i were you but you know
40:41
we've had a vote and finally people do
40:44
use pirates as a good example of sort of
40:46
early democracy because they were
40:48
weirdly egalitarian
40:49
and yeah they had this democratic system
40:51
and there was quite a lot of equality
40:53
income equality
40:54
or like spoils equality pillage equality
40:57
whatever on board so
40:58
you know the lowest mate didn't really
41:00
earn very much less than the captain
41:02
and it was basically to prevent yourself
41:04
being overthrown literally
41:06
thrown over they had compensation as
41:09
well
41:10
if you had an injury at work you would
41:11
be compensated there's a list we have
41:13
numbers if you lost a right arm you get
41:15
600 pieces of silver if you lost the
41:17
left arm you get 500 pieces so much more
41:19
important to lose that one if you're
41:21
looking for money
41:22
um if you lost your right leg you got
41:24
500
41:25
lost left leg 400 lost either eye same
41:28
amount um
41:29
lost a finger 100 like there was every
41:30
bit of your body had compensation well
41:32
and also and this is where i think
41:34
the real scammers would come in in this
41:35
health insurance system
41:37
if you lost a leg and then you after
41:40
that lost your
41:40
your peg leg then you got the same
41:42
amount of compensation
41:48
have ye been in an accident at work that
41:50
was not your fault
41:51
[Laughter]
41:58
although robert louis stevenson made up
41:59
almost everything he made up shiver my
42:00
timbers
42:01
he made up the song 15 men on the dead
42:03
man's chest
42:04
one legged pirates parrots it's all well
42:08
parrots i have found some evidence that
42:10
pirates and parrots did
42:12
hang out together so the
42:16
you had an emotional support parrot yeah
42:20
so the biggest pirate stronghold was
42:22
port royal uh in jamaica and
42:24
actually this so this was in the 1600s
42:26
and it was being fought over between the
42:27
english and spanish
42:28
but it was the second largest european
42:30
city in
42:31
the new world so it was second only to
42:33
boston port royal and the
42:35
pirates controlled it and it was a it
42:37
was a great laugh so a quarter of the
42:39
buildings were bars or brothels
42:41
um there's a matter of frat boy kind of
42:43
drinking culture so they used the
42:44
pirates used to dump a
42:46
massive fat of alcohol on the street and
42:48
force all passes by to drink from it
42:50
wow apparently it was great fun and
42:53
apparently according to a dutch explorer
42:55
who visited
42:56
he said that the parrots drank as much
42:58
as the pirates there he said the parrots
43:00
gather to drink from the large stocks of
43:02
ale with just as much alacrity
43:04
as the drunks that frequent it so
43:07
amazing
43:07
yeah so funny another place that's
43:09
associated with pirates is uh pittsburgh
43:12
oh yeah of course uh this is a sporting
43:16
thing
43:17
yes it is yeah well done yeah um so
43:20
the pittsburgh pirates they weren't
43:22
always called the pittsburgh pirates
43:24
they were originally known as the
43:25
pittsburgh and i'm going to let you try
43:27
and read this
43:29
oh god knows it's a it's a mountain
43:32
range
43:33
allegheny's allegheny's ah
43:37
all right redeem yourself so they were
43:39
the pittsburgh legends
43:43
and they got renamed in 1880 they stole
43:47
away a second baseman
43:48
from a from another team and they got
43:50
called in one of the newspapers a bunch
43:52
of pirates
43:53
and they took the name from that and
43:55
that's how they got called the
43:56
pittsburgh pirates
43:57
wow a legend right allegedly yeah yeah
44:00
allegedly i don't know
44:01
[Laughter]
44:03
that yeah that was true have you had no
44:05
sorry
44:06
i only want to say because the reason i
44:08
brought this up is because i have a fact
44:09
about the pittsburgh pirates okay which
44:11
i really want to say because i want to
44:12
know if you guys have heard this this is
44:13
amazing so
44:14
the pittsburgh pirates had a scandal in
44:16
1985
44:17
when it turned out that some of their
44:19
team had been buying cocaine from a
44:21
giant parrot
44:22
whoa what so
44:28
i can think of two ways that is either a
44:30
giant parrot which has been trained as a
44:32
i guess a mule yes or
44:35
a team mascot who is unbelievably brazen
44:38
about the way he sells
44:40
his drugs you're absolutely right it's
44:41
the second one yeah they have um
44:43
they had this giant pirate mascot and he
44:45
was kind of taking the cocaine from the
44:47
street and giving it to the players
44:49
wow cool and it wasn't an actual parrot
44:51
it was a human
44:52
it was a human in a parrot suit yes
44:56
that's a bit obvious in an alleyway when
44:57
there's a giant
45:02
you'd never suspect a guy in a parrot
45:04
suit yeah but if you're buying drugs and
45:06
then some kind of massive parrot suit
45:08
comes up yeah
45:08
i think yeah i'd be like these drugs are
45:10
[ __ ] working wow
45:15

45:21

uh
00:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:22
no such thing as a fish
00:24
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:26
live from washington dc
00:35
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:37
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:39
murray and james harkin
00:41
and once again we have gathered round
00:42
the microphones with our four favorite
00:44
facts
00:45
from the last seven days and in no
00:46
particular order here
00:48
we go starting with you
00:51
andy my fact is that one of the main
00:54
reasons
00:54
people fail to get into the us army in
00:56
the first world war
00:58
was because the military required
00:59
recruits to have a minimum
01:01
of six teeth
01:02
[Laughter]
01:05
and this was a problem so
01:08
this is this is from a book called
01:10
making the american mouth
01:12
by alyssa pickard which is a great book
01:15
and it's all about
01:16
uh problems of of dentistry and it turns
01:20
out that the famously great american
01:21
teeth were not always that great
01:23
and you know in the first world war you
01:25
needed good teeth because you had to eat
01:27
horrible
01:28
tough military rations and you had to
01:30
have three pairs of decent opposing
01:32
teeth
01:33
and um and one in ten recruits failed
01:37
because of that
01:39
of the two million people who were
01:40
rejected from the army that was the main
01:41
reason and a few sources of difficulties
01:43
to say 12 there are quite a lot of
01:44
saying six as well so
01:46
yeah and one of the other reasons in war
01:48
was uh
01:49
certainly in this civil war where they
01:50
had a similar problem is you would
01:52
load one shot in each gun and to get
01:55
your shot out you had to rip it open
01:57
with your teeth right
01:58
and so if you didn't have any teeth you
01:59
just like gum elite like
02:02
sucking on it into cartridge that's
02:05
so i read in the in the civil war so you
02:07
know if you are disqualified from going
02:09
to war
02:10
the the category you're given is 4f
02:12
that's what they say
02:13
you're a 4f and that means you're not
02:15
able to go and this is for modern-day
02:16
war as well
02:17
and it's suggested and i say it's
02:19
suggested because it's probably
02:21
definitely not true
02:24
that the four f stands for four front
02:26
teeth
02:27
four four fangs yeah right
02:30
and then and what they're saying you
02:32
didn't have those four if you didn't
02:33
have those four you're not you can't go
02:34
to war because you can't bite open
02:36
the clip for your gun and there was
02:38
quite a disparity in the civil war
02:40
between the two sides though
02:41
teeth-wise um and in some other ways
02:47
so actually historically like the last
02:50
200 years
02:51
the northeast of the united states has
02:54
had much worse teeth in the southwest
02:56
and the confederate army had much better
02:58
teeth and they just had better dental
03:00
care
03:00
um and they're not really sure why this
03:02
is actually because it's
03:04
not about sort of socioeconomic status
03:06
it doesn't really correlate with that
03:07
often wealthier people had worse teeth
03:08
because they ate sugar
03:10
they think it might be something in the
03:11
soil quality but anyway it was like
03:13
vermont was the worst i think vermont
03:14
was the one where
03:15
literally more than 10 percent of people
03:18
in world war ii i think even got
03:19
rejected
03:20
and i think in world war ii when teeth
03:22
were still as bad
03:24
no progress made between the world wars
03:26
um
03:27
they they had this requirement again
03:28
which was like you've got to have the
03:29
three pairs of opposing teeth and they
03:30
actually had to change the rules
03:32
because they realized they weren't going
03:33
to get enough people going into the army
03:35
so they changed the rules to say um
03:37
actually you just need to have
03:39
enough teeth in your lower arch like on
03:41
your lower jaw to hold
03:42
a denture so basically as long as you've
03:44
got kind of one tooth there to hook a
03:45
dent a set of dentures on
03:47
then you're okay really yeah it's
03:48
actually still true that if you don't
03:50
have enough teeth you can't join the us
03:52
army um but i read all the rules um
03:55
today of
03:57
of what you can and can't do did they
03:58
accept you
04:01
um so they had it says inefficient
04:05
natural healthy teeth is a reason for
04:07
not being allowed in the army
04:08
uh some other things polydactyly so
04:11
having too many fingers
04:12
that's insane i know that rules you out
04:15
yeah you can fire more guns faster
04:18
you would think so right yeah how right
04:22
when did you call you a diagram dan you
04:24
got a gun on each finger
04:26
you're a super soldier my bad thank you
04:30
um if you have ingrowing toenails you
04:33
can't join the army really
04:35
remedied quite easily yeah so if they're
04:37
particularly bad ones
04:38
if you're taller than six foot seven you
04:40
can't join
04:41
and if you have an unexplained absence
04:44
of a testicle
04:46
what is a mystery missing testicle
04:48
that's the mystery of it
04:51
[Music]
04:52
is it it's not because they think you
04:54
might be hitler trying to join
04:57
take it down from the inside um at least
05:00
so teeth were actually another way of
05:02
getting out of war as well so at least
05:04
one soldier in the
05:05
this is the first world war if you got
05:06
wounded if you threw away your false
05:09
teeth
05:09
and you no longer were able to eat the
05:11
rations you might be invalided out of
05:13
the entire army
05:14
this is a good way of escaping military
05:16
service that's amazing
05:18
that's an extremely easy way people are
05:19
shooting themselves in the kneecaps and
05:21
stuff to get out of military service
05:22
just chuck away
05:25
they really needed to invent the blender
05:26
in war didn't they because this was the
05:28
issue
05:29
it was that they couldn't chew if
05:30
everything was a smoothie they wouldn't
05:31
have had to remove any of these people
05:33
that's true that's true having bad teeth
05:36
is still a massive massive problem
05:38
for the army um and so for the over
05:40
seven years they've been working and
05:41
they've put
05:42
12 million dollars worth of research
05:43
behind this into some combat chewing gum
05:46
that's what they're currently trying to
05:48
invent yeah so what does it do yeah
05:50
well it's sort of the idea is that it
05:52
stimulates the flow of saliva in your
05:53
mouth
05:53
the longer you chew it so it neutralizes
05:55
acid so that's true of all chewing gums
05:57
surely i guess this is just like
05:59
super soldier chewing gum so then you
06:01
start chewing it and you just get loads
06:02
of water and saliva
06:04
yeah you're just dribbling away or yeah
06:06
no it's i mean it's designed just to
06:08
keep your teeth more healthy um
06:09
because the big problem that they have
06:11
is that uh 10 i believe it is of all the
06:14
emergencies that they have that are
06:15
not front line are teeth-based 10
06:19
so there's 47 different types of dental
06:21
emergencies
06:22
that they deal with that are graded in
06:24
like a booklet that you can get yeah
06:26
um and they go from mildly uncomfortable
06:28
which is like gingivitis
06:29
um all the way to totally
06:36
well you're the one with it in front of
06:37
you i don't know why you're looking at
06:38
me
06:39
it looks like you just fell on your
06:40
keyboard
06:41
[Laughter]
06:44
so yeah so gingivitis or absolutely
06:48
gosh um and that's real when you've got
06:50
after lucid dude it's really bad yeah
06:52
that's so sometimes it's so bad you
06:53
can't even say it yeah that's
06:55
that's what's happened so by the end of
06:57
the 1990s
06:58
six percent of british people had none
07:01
of their natural teeth remaining so
07:02
um i guess it's an old person you've got
07:04
full dentures 100 in 1978
07:06
that was 37 wow 37
07:10
of adults zero teeth wow
07:13
yeah is it true that they used to
07:14
deliberately knock them out
07:16
yes like on your 21st birthday as a
07:19
present they would knock all your teeth
07:20
out yes
07:21
i have known elderly people who were
07:23
offered that yeah yeah
07:24
it wasn't like a punch in the face no i
07:26
know the idea was wasn't it that um
07:29
if you would lose them all as say when
07:31
you were 21 and replace them with
07:32
dentures and then you wouldn't have
07:33
tooth problems as you go older yeah
07:35
right yeah well do you know the most
07:37
teeth anyone has ever had
07:39
oh yeah how many do we normally have 32
07:42
yeah give or take yeah is this is it
07:44
that one time in the mouth
07:46
is it one time in the mouth oh um wasn't
07:48
there a guy this year who
07:49
had sort of like hundreds or thousands
07:51
or something
07:52
seven thousand okay well there we go yet
07:55
again dan has absolutely guested out of
07:56
the park um
07:58
it was 547. now these were very small
08:02
teeth obviously
08:03
it was a boy in india he had a slight
08:05
pain in his jaw it was a little lump
08:07
as a thing called an odontoma or an
08:09
odontoma and
08:11
doctors removed it it grew to the size
08:12
of a golf ball before they did
08:14
and it was a little sack and inside
08:15
there were 526 tiny teeth
08:18
yeah it's just when stem cells go a bit
08:20
haywire and start thinking
08:22
teeth sure but he got
08:25
like he woke up the next morning
08:26
absolutely loaded right lift up your
08:29
pillow you've got
08:30
hundreds of dollars i have a weird
08:34
teeth in war story that i love um which
08:37
is
08:37
from the second world wars so this was
08:40
after japan had surrendered in world war
08:42
ii then a lot of japanese people were
08:44
put on trial by the allies and
08:47
that included the japanese prime
08:48
minister hideki tojo
08:50
and he wanted to so he was going to be
08:52
executed in japan
08:53
but he wanted to speak at his trial and
08:55
he couldn't speak because his teeth were
08:57
in such terrible condition
08:58
and so he was being looked after by u.s
09:01
naval officers
09:02
and he said okay well i need some
09:04
dentures so i can at least speak at my
09:05
trial
09:06
and there was a dentist called jack
09:07
mallory who was in charge of doing this
09:09
and he made the prosthetics
09:11
and i mean how yeah how kind of [ __ ]
09:14
is this i know everyone had beef with
09:15
each other in world war ii
09:16
but he engraved in his dentures in
09:19
morse code on the back of his dentures
09:22
the words remember pearl harbor
09:25
whoa yeah that is
09:28
a real move and a half and um he gave
09:31
these dentures to the japanese prime
09:32
minister and he thought that's so great
09:34
he's going to have the words remember
09:35
pearl harbor in his mouth
09:36
for eternity and then he chickened out
09:38
so he had this guy was in prison with
09:40
his new dentures and then this guy was
09:42
like [ __ ] i'm going to get in trouble
09:43
for this if anyone sees oh my god
09:44
so he told his superiors and they had to
09:46
do this whole operation
09:48
where they sort of broke back into the
09:49
prison in the dead of night him and his
09:51
dental associate and stole the dentures
09:52
back
09:53
so he could scrape but they hadn't been
09:55
installed in the
09:57
mouth he did have them in his cell with
09:59
him so maybe they were sort of on his
10:01
bedside table or something
10:02
it's weird that he thought anyone would
10:04
ever find out isn't it what if you
10:06
because sometimes you run your tongue
10:07
around yeah but you can't read morse
10:09
code if you're
10:10
if you're uh was he a prime minister did
10:11
he say he's a prime minister you know
10:13
yeah all prime ministers can do that
10:16
running your truth going hang on
10:20
hey we need to move on in a second a
10:21
couple of facts about military
10:23
recruitment
10:23
this kind of thing oh yeah so to join
10:25
the u.s army in the first world war
10:27
there was an insane questionnaire that
10:29
you had to answer if you wanted to sign
10:31
up it was all yes no questions okay
10:34
and it was a list of a couple of hundred
10:35
of the questions and just to test your
10:37
aptitude to make sure
10:38
you had sort of standard intelligence so
10:41
things the question started quite simple
10:43
can a dog run okay yes yes you're right
10:45
brilliant oh james okay great
10:47
um is water dry
10:51
no no right great okay can you read yes
10:54
okay great so you're doing great so far
10:55
then again
10:56
we're doing really badly i was out two
10:59
questions ago
11:01
uh it gets a bit weirder then um on
11:03
newspapers made of iron
11:06
and i didn't think so until you said
11:07
that do handkerchiefs frequently injure
11:10
human beings
11:14
do conscientious brunettes exist
11:18
really and then they get then
11:22
and then so that those are the real ones
11:24
then it goes completely bananas right so
11:26
do vagrants commonly possess immaculate
11:28
cravats
11:30
do tendrils terminate in cerebral
11:32
hemorrhage
11:34
uh is a guitar a disease sorry exactly
11:37
the tendril one what's the answer to
11:39
that one do tendrils terminate in
11:40
cerebral hemorrhage yeah
11:42
i don't know what the i mean no
11:45
no no is the answer what it seems to me
11:47
is like a load of words that don't
11:48
really make a sentence yeah exactly
11:50
there's no yes or no answer you just
11:51
have to go next to it
11:54
what was what exactly was this testing
11:56
intelligence
11:57
it feels like it's testing the level of
11:59
hallucination
12:00
[Laughter]
12:02
[Music]
12:07
it is time for fact number two and that
12:09
is chozinski
12:11
my fact this week is that the ronald
12:12
reagan presidential library
12:14
has been protected from wildfires by a
12:17
herd of goats
12:18
that includes vincent van goat saline
12:21
yes very sweet um selena gomez
12:27
and goat's art
12:31
so highbrow and lowbrow references in
12:33
that herd of goats
12:35
and this is this amazing story this year
12:37
that actually the live the ronald reagan
12:39
presidential library which is just
12:40
outside
12:41
la uh hired 500 goats and it's to clear
12:44
up the sort of flammable scrub material
12:46
because that's a really useful way of
12:47
creating a barrier against wildfires you
12:49
know they eat all the stuff
12:50
that the fire would eat and then the
12:52
fire can't move
12:54
um i've personified that's another one
12:56
of those sentences that didn't make
12:57
sense isn't it
12:59
just testing your iq james and so yeah
13:02
this is really cool and then there were
13:04
wildfires a few months later and the
13:06
brush created a fire break which
13:08
massively slowed down the fire and it
13:09
meant that the firefighters could defeat
13:11
it
13:11
and save ronald reagan's library which
13:13
contains
13:14
um various cool stuff like air fort his
13:16
air force one
13:17
and a bit of the berlin wall and him
13:20
himself
13:21
whoa really i think he's there isn't he
13:24
there
13:24
maybe he's buried there he's buried
13:25
there there's the less sensationalist
13:27
way of putting yeah sorry
13:29
yeah he's not he's not in the dewey
13:31
decimal system
13:35
yeah those are incredible at this kind
13:36
of thing i didn't realize how much they
13:38
were being used
13:39
they are and well this company is a
13:41
really cool one as well so it started
13:43
only last year i think they've got
13:44
really lucky it's called 805 goats i
13:46
don't know why because they don't have
13:47
805 goats
13:49
and it was started by this couple called
13:51
scott on emily morris
13:52
and he just had no experience in this
13:54
but he went to a talk where a
13:56
firefighter was saying what a shame we
13:57
don't have more goats
13:58
to prevent fires so he decided i'll just
14:00
buy some goats and hire them out
14:02
and he did it in a really weird order
14:04
though so he left this talk
14:05
and he started by booking in a bunch of
14:08
weed clearing jobs so he rung around
14:09
advertised himself said
14:11
i'll clear your weeds with some goats
14:12
this was before he bought any goats
14:14
and he got loads of stuff booked in and
14:16
then he was like oh god i've started
14:17
this now i better buy some goats
14:18
and then he bought a few dozen goats and
14:20
then he realized i live in a tiny house
14:22
i don't have anywhere to put these goats
14:24
and so then they had to they actually
14:26
appealed to her former school
14:28
and it's staying on their school they're
14:29
staying on their school grounds now
14:31
um but yeah he's a very happy man that's
14:34
cool yeah
14:35
it's now legal for you to hire goats in
14:37
washington dc
14:39
as of as of 2019 there's a new law
14:42
wow i read the law it says that the
14:44
mayor shall allow goats to be
14:46
temporarily imported into the district
14:48
for the purposes of eating grass milking
14:51
demonstrations
14:52
participating in yoga and similar
14:54
activities
14:56
nice that's great it's very cool
14:59
it seems like it's been going on for a
15:00
while in america because i was reading
15:02
that in 2015
15:03
um you could actually order goats off
15:05
amazon so
15:06
it was live yeah live goats amazon
15:10
launched a home delivery service in 2015
15:12
there was a bit of stuff like that going
15:13
on with the amazon so in japan you could
15:14
order
15:15
a buddhist monk to your house via amazon
15:18
um to do prayers for funerals and so on
15:21
if you wanted
15:22
but yeah it's been going on here and
15:23
it's specifically for that it's just the
15:25
goats come in and it's for fire
15:26
clearance and stuff
15:27
it's happening a lot there's there's
15:29
gofundmes which are called uh goat
15:31
fund me yeah um yeah i wonder if it's
15:34
happening solely because of the
15:35
propensity for puns
15:37
i wonder if that's why all these
15:38
startups have happened because
15:40
it's just a good word to pump with this
15:41
news although this company sorry
15:43
selena gomez has hired their goats
15:47
and there's no reference to whether or
15:49
not that's connected to the fact that
15:50
one of their ghosts is called selena
15:51
gomez
15:52
was there any kind of hilarious
15:54
misunderstanding where someone mistook
15:56
selena gomez for selena goatsmes
15:58
and selena gomez is currently chewing
16:00
brush somewhere in california
16:02
and there's a really really worried goat
16:04
in a green room about to go on stage
16:07
um she's not the only selena gomez
16:09
there's there's another selena gomez out
16:11
in new zealand
16:12
um in canterbury they have um a sort of
16:14
rspca where they look after goats and
16:16
they
16:17
send them back out so they've got selena
16:18
gomez there they've got
16:20
eva longhornia um brilliant
16:23
uh jessica alba
16:27
and nicole kidman nothing yeah it's a
16:30
kid there's a baby goat
16:34
kid
16:36
yeah and that's what i knew wow that's
16:39
the thing i knew about that one so
16:43
not everyone is happy about this goat
16:44
situation um
16:46
of how many are being hired so in 2017 a
16:49
michigan union issued an official
16:50
complaint
16:51
saying that goats were taking the jobs
16:53
of good honest humans
16:55
basically like people who mow lawns for
16:57
a living exactly yeah
16:59
the goats were clearing weeds they were
17:00
clearing brush and this is taking jobs
17:02
from human
17:02
union workers and the western michigan
17:06
university got a complaint about this
17:07
and the washington post did a
17:08
calculation about the potential impact
17:10
of goat labor
17:11
and they found out that even if all
17:13
stuff was
17:15
given over to goats it would only cost
17:16
about 347 jobs
17:20
what do you mean if all stuff is given
17:22
to go it's like not all jobs
17:24
you can't ever go to as president of the
17:26
united states well
17:28
can't you um
17:33
yeah no it's a good point sorry all kind
17:35
of um as many gardening jobs as possible
17:38
that don't require fiddly stuff
17:41
um there is a goat in the british army
17:43
of course
17:44
that is of course and that is william
17:48
billy windsor
17:49
the second uh and he is new actually
17:53
he's quite young
17:54
and the previous one william billy
17:56
windsor the first was a lance corporal
17:59
in the first battalion the royal welsh
18:01
until he was demoted to fusilier after
18:04
inappropriate behavior during the
18:05
queen's official birthday celebration
18:10
he apparently refused to keep in step
18:13
and try to headbutt a drummer
18:15
wow yeah that'll do it and so he got
18:18
eventually he retired and they brought
18:20
in this new one uh they went into the
18:22
fields in wales just looking for a goat
18:25
it's the queen's own herd yeah you have
18:27
to write to the queen for permission say
18:29
can we hunt one of your goats
18:30
and sort of bring it into the fold
18:32
literally bring it into the fold
18:34
and the new one because it's so young he
18:36
still gets his ration of two cigarettes
18:38
a day
18:40
but he's not allowed to have his
18:41
guinness until he's a few years older
18:43
does he smoke for cigarettes no he eats
18:46
them okay
18:47
although oh there's a fact so goats
18:49
don't have upper front teeth
18:51
they don't have upper front teeth they
18:52
just have to get into the army
18:59
they just have this weird pad at the
19:01
front it's just a sort of dental pad
19:03
yeah it's kind of gross it it is very
19:05
sort of gummy isn't it i find that a bit
19:07
it's gummy it's just like a huge wad of
19:09
tissue
19:11
and that's why when you see them eat
19:12
they just sort of grind stuff sideways
19:14
along it don't they
19:16
i'm not i'm not judging them but i think
19:17
it's kind of gross
19:21
so they did a study recently which
19:22
showed that goats are next to dogs man's
19:25
best friend they're man's second best
19:26
friend really
19:27
as in they bond emotionally with us very
19:29
well and people always lump them in with
19:31
sheep
19:31
and they're completely different so they
19:33
don't they're not really into herds they
19:35
don't mind being in a herb but they
19:36
don't mind being out of it at all
19:37
they're much more intelligent
19:39
when they do intelligence tests and they
19:41
have this thing they do
19:42
where when they're in trouble they do
19:44
the imploring puppy dog
19:46
eyes thing at humans so they did this
19:49
test with them where
19:50
one of those classic kind of scientists
19:51
doing an intelligence test where they
19:53
got the goats to
19:54
figure out that if they pulled a string
19:56
and it released a lever and then they
19:57
nudged that
19:58
lever then they could get access to a
20:00
nice treat um
20:01
and they actually did this on 12 goats
20:04
and they tested them and they learned
20:05
how to do it very quickly
20:07
and then they made the task impossible
20:08
for them and when they made it
20:09
impossible
20:10
the goats all looked around at the
20:11
humans with like a little raised eyebrow
20:13
kind of help me expression
20:15
i know but they were smart so of those
20:17
12 goats within
20:19
four tries uh nine of them had
20:21
completely mastered this trick
20:23
this puzzle solving trick um two of them
20:25
cheated so were disqualified
20:27
wow which is harsh i didn't know you
20:29
disqualified
20:30
a ghost test from an intelligence test
20:32
because they cheated they tried to
20:33
headbutt it open
20:35
and they do you know for someone who's
20:37
your best friend they do headbutt a lot
20:40
it's meant affectionately um but yeah so
20:43
nine did it two were disqualified and
20:45
there was just one go in this test that
20:46
showed no signs of improvement by her
20:48
20-second try
20:51
and they wrote her off as a hopeless
20:52
case have you heard of the
20:55
so the the us navy has a goat as well
20:58
didn't they
20:58
yeah um so the u.s navy cadets i'm sure
21:00
a lot of people here have heard it
21:01
before
21:02
but i had no idea about this there's an
21:03
official goat mascot called bill the
21:05
goat
21:06
and that either takes the form of a
21:07
person in a costume but there is an
21:08
actual goat as well
21:10
and the army and the navy cadets for the
21:12
last
21:13
70 years have been attempting to kidnap
21:16
each other's goats before
21:18
their annual football match wow
21:21
they will not stop and do they do they
21:24
succeed quite often they succeed quite a
21:25
lot i said well the the
21:27
the army are trying to kidnap a goat
21:29
which is a lot easier than trying to
21:30
kidnap
21:30
the army mascot which is a mule which is
21:33
six times as heavy
21:35
so almost always the you know the the
21:37
goats have frequently been gone but the
21:39
mule has only been got
21:40
once and it was increased in 1991
21:43
and the navy cadets were so annoyed
21:45
about having repeatedly lost their
21:47
their goat so they they went a bit
21:49
overboard they visited
21:50
west point academy disguised as tourists
21:53
they drew maps they planned their escape
21:55
routes
21:55
they studied the alarm systems they
21:57
recruited a friendly mule farmer
21:59
to tell them how to steal a mule they
22:01
then went to west point disguised as
22:03
soldiers
22:04
they claimed to be the military police
22:06
they tied up a sergeant there
22:09
they locked everyone else at the mule
22:11
sort of the mule stable in a room
22:13
they cut the phone lines and then they
22:16
escaped only to be followed by the state
22:18
police the military police and
22:20
three helicopters wow
22:25
with a mule in tow and at that point the
22:28
pentagon intervened and they said can
22:29
you please
22:29
stop doing this that's amazing
22:33
um i found um so in the headline of this
22:35
fact one of the goats was called vincent
22:37
van goat
22:38
and as well as finding another selena
22:40
gomez i found another vincent van goat
22:43
and vincent van goat is a comic book
22:45
character
22:46
um and it's a goat that had super powers
22:50
and it lived in washington dc yeah
22:53
so this is your superhero vincent plant
22:55
goats
22:56
um i mean it's not spiderman or batman
23:00
is it wait till you hear the backstory
23:01
james
23:02
uh yeah he's a goat okay and he was in a
23:05
laboratory where they were doing tests
23:06
and this guy
23:07
called derek henderson had passed away
23:09
and during some sort of
23:11
weird experiment the consciousness of
23:13
derek henderson went into the goat
23:15
and became vincent van gogh but no one
23:17
knew that derek henderson had gone in
23:19
there
23:19
so this guy continues experimenting on
23:21
this go and he gives him the ability for
23:23
flight
23:23
laser vision and super human history
23:25
without knowing that he has without
23:26
knowing that derek henderson is inside
23:28
him yeah so then
23:30
two people called quantum and woody come
23:32
to um
23:33
pick up this goat and it turns out that
23:35
they're the children of derek henderson
23:37
so they've got it's goat dad but
23:40
yes but they don't know that he's in
23:42
there so he spends his whole time trying
23:44
to go i'm your dad inside a goat and
23:46
it's
23:47
and they they eventually start believing
23:49
through little cryptic
23:50
codes that you get to see text messages
23:52
does the goat text
23:54
well it's they they train it because
23:56
it's a very good goat it can fly it's
23:58
got lasers
24:00
and it's just been entrusted to two
24:02
random children yeah
24:03
well they're they're the big people of
24:04
the of the comic books so
24:06
it's a text-to-speech device so they
24:08
suddenly communicate with it and work
24:10
out that it's the dad
24:11
derek henderson but they don't properly
24:13
believe it because it turns out the goat
24:14
is a woman
24:15
a female goat um all right yeah so then
24:18
they discovered that the goat is
24:19
pregnant
24:21
and she gives birth to derrick
24:25
henderson wait wait wait wait do you
24:28
mean
24:29
a huge human baby that they think no
24:32
they think
24:32
derek henderson is coming out they don't
24:34
know what's going to come but it turns
24:35
out
24:36
nothing it's just a spirit that flies
24:38
away well
24:40
wow that's
24:44
that's your superhero
24:48
that is maybe the longest we've ever
24:51
gone on this podcast without a single
24:52
fact being spoken yeah
24:56
it won't be by the time i've edited it
24:59
that sounds incredible and now you're
25:01
going to say we have to move on and we
25:03
all know that but you're one who just
25:04
wasted 10 minutes of our time
25:06
crazy comic book story i just know that
25:08
the people of dc know what an incredible
25:10
comic book character they have why he's
25:12
called vincent van gogh
25:14
no [ __ ] clue nothing in that suggests
25:17
it
25:17
um we do need to move on in a second um
25:20
should we do that yeah
25:21
yep okay it is time for fact number
25:23
three and that
25:24
is my fact my fact this week is that the
25:28
apollo 12 moon landing footage was
25:31
faked okay
25:34
is this a real fact or is it in a comic
25:36
book
25:38
so this is a fact that is actually in
25:40
our latest book the book of the year
25:41
2019
25:42
and um on the 12 on the 14th of november
25:45
it's going to be the 50th anniversary of
25:47
the apollo 12
25:48
moon landings of the launch happened on
25:50
the 14th and um
25:52
this is a true fact what happened is
25:54
when they landed they had one camera
25:56
that was going to film the whole thing
25:58
and um as they were starting to film and
26:00
go on to the moon
26:01
the camera was pointed directly towards
26:03
the sun
26:04
and it burnt out the camera entirely the
26:07
only camera that we had their video
26:08
camera
26:09
so as a result they had no footage and
26:12
now
26:12
all the tv channels back in america
26:14
suddenly were freaking out we had the
26:15
audio but we didn't have the visuals
26:17
so cbs had to cut to a long island
26:19
studio where two actors in space suits
26:22
had to pretend that they were walking on
26:24
the moon
26:25
while using the actual audio underneath
26:27
it and over at nbc
26:29
they had two astronaut marionettes that
26:31
were created by bill
26:32
baird who was the puppeteer behind the
26:34
lonely goat hood in the sound of music
26:38
using that underneath the audio of the
26:40
apollo 12 astronauts so
26:42
they had to fake the footage there is
26:44
actual fake footage of an apollo moon
26:46
landing which is real
26:47
why did they have all these things at
26:49
the ready
26:51
so there was a lot of obviously
26:53
demonstrations of like what it might be
26:54
like the experiments that they would be
26:56
doing up there so there was a lot of
26:57
news channels that were showing what
26:59
were going on and then there was a lot
27:00
of fun things like the marionettes that
27:01
were made by this guy just to sort of
27:03
play
27:04
so they had that just in the studios and
27:05
they had to as an emergency go
27:07
get those guys back in the suits we need
27:09
we need visuals for this
27:10
but that i mean that is the role of
27:12
those marionettes life isn't it they
27:13
thought they were just there for this
27:14
stupid segment in the outbreak
27:16
and suddenly they are the people on the
27:18
moon that's so cool
27:20
not that many people watched it did they
27:21
apolo 12 because i think
27:23
basically everyone watched apollo 11 and
27:26
they thought it's probably going to be
27:27
quite similar
27:29
and also apollo 11 was on a sunday night
27:32
so everyone was at home watching tv
27:34
but um apollo 12 was at six in the
27:35
morning on a tuesday so no one was
27:37
yeah there's always a way to watch it
27:39
but it was i mean
27:40
even um who were the guys who were the
27:43
guys who
27:43
alan bean was on there um yeah he was
27:45
one of them pete conrad
27:47
yeah so pete conrad didn't seem that
27:48
impressed and they asked him what the
27:50
moon was like and he said it's very
27:52
light
27:52
gray like concrete if i wanted to go out
27:56
and look at something that looks like
27:57
the moon
27:57
i'd go and look at my driveway
28:01
[Music]
28:04
so he um he had a bet that was made
28:07
before he went to the moon because
28:08
uh someone on earth who was interviewing
28:10
him said oh i
28:11
so what are you going to say when you
28:12
get on the moon it doesn't matter what
28:14
you're going to say because i know
28:15
you're told what to say and he said no
28:17
i'm not told what to say i can say
28:18
whatever i want and she went of course
28:19
it's written for you nielsen was
28:20
obviously written for him as well
28:22
so he said i bet you i can say what i
28:24
want to say and i'll tell you right now
28:25
we'll come up with it together
28:27
what i'm going to say so the first words
28:28
the third man said when he landed on the
28:30
moon was
28:31
whoopee man that may have been a small
28:35
one for neil but that was a long one for
28:37
me
28:38
that was his first words on the moon
28:41
it was a 500 bet he never got the 500.
28:44
um because it because he was short he
28:46
was sure
28:48
it was five foot five yeah and it was a
28:49
play on neil's quote how much do we need
28:51
to spell out no no no no
28:53
um he wasn't really such he was such a
28:55
cool character
28:56
conrad um so he was actually supposed to
28:58
be in the
28:59
mercury seven who were the original
29:01
seven people who were going to work for
29:03
nasa to be going out into space
29:04
like the original seven he was asked to
29:06
do the exams but he was kind of a wild
29:09
card and he thought the exams were
29:10
really invasive and annoying
29:12
and so for instance they did a raw shack
29:13
test on him you know where they show you
29:15
a blob of ink and they ask you what you
29:16
can see in it
29:17
and he basically was like this is
29:18
completely [ __ ] and so
29:20
when the psychiatrist said what do you
29:22
see in this bob of ink he described in
29:24
extreme and graphic detail a sexual
29:26
basically a porn film that he was seeing
29:29
in the blob of ink and so
29:31
then they were like okay thank you sir
29:32
and then they pushed a blank card
29:34
towards him
29:34
and said okay well what do you make of
29:36
this and then he just turned it round
29:37
and pushed it back and went it's upside
29:39
down
29:41
that's very good was that did you say
29:44
that was conrad
29:45
yeah yeah he was quite um conscientious
29:47
when they got up there though
29:49
because when they got there they had to
29:51
set up this generator that was powered
29:52
by plutonium and there was a
29:54
there was a problem a snag so the
29:56
plutonium got stuck inside its container
29:58
and bean and beans suggested why don't
30:01
we just hit it with a hammer
30:02
and conrad said no obviously we can't do
30:05
that we're on the moon restaurants we
30:06
can't just hit it with a hammer
30:07
bean did it anyway uh and it worked it
30:10
freed it up and it got the thing working
30:11
and bean later said never come to the
30:13
moon without a hammer
30:16
it's very nice and he so he became an
30:18
artist when he came back to
30:19
when he came back to earth and those
30:20
paintings you can still buy on his
30:22
website he drew a lot of apollo
30:23
paintings so he would do neil armstrong
30:25
he would do buzz and so on
30:27
um but he would also do these works that
30:28
were sort of chipped into
30:30
steel and stone and he did it using the
30:33
hammer that he did exactly
30:36
yeah that's very cool um they had to use
30:38
a sextant
30:40
to get to the moon did you know this
30:42
what no i don't
30:43
what so this is amazing so apollo 12 got
30:45
hit by lightning as it was taking off
30:48
uh not once but twice and this was
30:51
stressful
30:51
because
30:55
you know they're taking off they're
30:56
burning 15 tons of fuel every single
30:58
second
30:59
this is a high-stakes bit of the mission
31:01
and it just bang twice with lightning
31:03
and the electrics got completely fried
31:04
no one knew for a long time that they'd
31:06
been hit by lightning they just saw
31:08
everything turned off
31:09
and they had no idea so they say uh can
31:10
we restart so anyway
31:12
normally once they got up into orbit of
31:15
earth they need to set their course for
31:17
the moon and they would normally have an
31:18
automatic program to do that for them
31:20
that wasn't working thanks to this so
31:23
they they needed to use a sextant to
31:25
chart
31:26
the stars basically and say that's where
31:28
we need to go
31:29
surely you can just see where the moon
31:31
is though can't you just
31:33
like why do you need to look at the
31:34
stars
31:36
the moon's probably bigger than all
31:38
those stars
31:40
okay first of all the moon is not bigger
31:41
than all those stars
31:47
but i'm taking a point you're right i
31:49
can only assume it's a bit more
31:51
complicated than that
31:52
i don't know what were they doing with
31:54
the sexton do they have an abacus on
31:56
board
31:58
i think they got trained with star
32:00
charts just in case yeah just in case
32:02
yeah
32:02
handy another thing someone i think we
32:04
should mention was
32:06
dick gordon always the third person on
32:08
the moon voyages is forgotten the guy
32:10
who's up there in the command module
32:12
hovering above the moon or circling the
32:13
moon
32:14
when they're down on the moon in the
32:16
lunar module so
32:17
dick gordon's up there and i think it
32:19
was quite a long what time they were out
32:21
there i think it was uh in this like 36
32:23
hours or something they were down there
32:24
and he's just on his own circling the
32:26
moon they did two space walks
32:28
about eight hours of space walking and
32:30
then it's it is very dusty and they got
32:32
covered in kind of black dust so by the
32:34
time they were returning to the command
32:36
module
32:37
they were dirty and so they went back up
32:40
to see dick and be like hey look what
32:41
we've done
32:42
and they went back up in the lunar
32:43
module and they latched on to the
32:45
command module that he was flying
32:47
and dick pulls the hatch down takes one
32:49
look at them
32:50
and says you're not coming in here like
32:52
that
32:52
[Laughter]
32:54
covered and filled and he makes them
32:57
take
32:58
all of their clothes off and so they
33:00
re-entered the command module
33:02
completely naked
33:06
amazing i think it was a prank i think
33:08
he'd been up there on his own thinking
33:09
those [ __ ] got to walk on the moon
33:11
[Laughter]
33:16
can we talk a bit about how they fake
33:17
the apollo 11 moon landing
33:20
yeah yeah absolutely right okay no just
33:22
about the theory
33:23
um because it's very you know it's been
33:26
carefully thought about by quite a lot
33:27
of people it's obviously not true
33:28
but um you know the theory is that
33:31
stanley kubrick was hired
33:32
but i did not know that the theory runs
33:34
that he was hired to direct three apollo
33:36
missions um and that there was a
33:39
specially designed set in alabama
33:40
and that kubrick did apollo 11 did
33:44
apollo 12 fake both
33:45
but then refused to direct apollo 13
33:47
because nasa rejected his screenplay
33:51
he wrote a screenplay where it all goes
33:52
catastrophically wrong as happened with
33:54
apollo 13.
33:55
and um nasa said no that's not glorious
33:58
enough
33:59
okay but then they did end up using his
34:01
uh screenplay in the end
34:03
i see so i haven't actually seen apollo
34:05
13 but is that different to the
34:07
the real one no no no no it did it did
34:09
go very badly wrong
34:10
yes but in the film it's the same thing
34:12
happened yeah
34:13
well yeah yeah yeah what do you mean
34:14
yeah of course okay
34:16
he didn't change the ending that would
34:18
have been insensitive actually now i've
34:19
come to think about it
34:20
um
34:21
[Music]
34:23
can you imagine being jim lovell
34:24
watching that movie
34:26
you just killed me at the end
34:32
it's hollywood but the the telegraph
34:34
wrote about this there was a famous
34:36
famous it was a deathbed video of
34:38
stanley kubrick in which he purportedly
34:40
confessed to
34:41
faking the moonlight yeah he says the
34:43
u.s government perpetrated a fraud they
34:44
wanted to go to moon they weren't quite
34:46
ready yet but they needed a cold war
34:48
victory
34:48
and was that a real video well the
34:50
telegraph wrote up
34:52
how people can tell there are some signs
34:54
that it's not
34:55
genuinely authentically kubrick so the
34:58
telegraph wrote perhaps the biggest
34:59
giveaway
35:00
is the fact that the man in the video
35:02
quite clearly isn't kubrick
35:07
yeah and then some of the footage went
35:10
up online just an old man in a bed but
35:12
the interview footage also includes
35:13
someone off camera calling him tom
35:15
and instructing him how to act
35:19
so you know when you said the conspiracy
35:22
theorists have thought this through
35:23
carefully
35:25
there are a few holes it feels a bit
35:27
weird talking about it because we think
35:29
it's the most
35:29
insane thing to discuss but the stats
35:32
are really bizarre on people who think
35:33
the moon landings are fake
35:35
so in britain one-sixth of people
35:38
like one in six humans in the uk thinks
35:41
they were staged
35:42
and not only that but worryingly and i
35:44
think because
35:45
older people get quite a hard time in
35:47
the uk these days amongst the hipsters
35:48
but they're the ones who have their head
35:50
screwed on when it comes to this
35:51
so in the over 55s it's 1 8 of people
35:55
but in people aged 24 to 35 it's more
35:57
than a fifth of us
35:59
who think it's fake and it's just um the
36:02
internet the web of knowledge
36:04
has told us the truth there is
36:08
well 53 of people who do think it was
36:10
faked
36:11
53 of them think that man did land on
36:14
the moon
36:15
but just later okay so they think we did
36:18
apollo 11 didn't land on the moon
36:20
although i'm sure we got around to it
36:21
eventually that's what a lot of people
36:23
think really yeah
36:26
do you remember bart zibrel you all
36:27
remember him i'm sure uh oh yeah yeah
36:29
he's a conspiracy theorist and filmmaker
36:32
who had an encounter famously with buzz
36:33
aldrin
36:34
uh in which aldrin punched him and
36:38
because he was he was following him
36:39
around and yeah yeah
36:41
so this is how it was written up by the
36:43
guardian
36:44
cybril 37 demanded that aldrin swear on
36:47
a bible that he had really landed on the
36:49
moon
36:50
aldrin 72 declined to do so and then his
36:53
fist
36:54
really landed on cybril's face
37:01
james and i met buzz aldrin and it was
37:04
kind of we did a show with him in the uk
37:06
and it was a bit scary because every
37:07
question you asked him there was a sense
37:09
when he looked back at you because
37:10
he took a few seconds before he answered
37:12
any question it was almost you know like
37:14
imagine the time lag
37:15
when they sent messages to space it was
37:17
that similar kind of distance and you
37:19
thought he's going to punch me he's
37:20
going to punch me
37:21
every single time and we asked him the
37:23
thing about remember the um
37:24
the yeah so we said that there was more
37:27
uh processing power in a musical
37:29
birthday card than there was
37:30
on the apollo 11 mission yeah he did not
37:33
like that one bit he did
37:38
yeah he went could this land on the moon
37:41
and slander on the ground uh we went for
37:43
a drink with him afterwards didn't we
37:44
and
37:45
my wife was there who's russian and we
37:47
left
37:48
her and him together because we had to
37:50
get one of the other guests out and she
37:51
was just stuck with buzz aldrin
37:53
didn't really have anything to say to
37:54
him and just went sorry about the cold
37:57
[Music]
37:59
[Laughter]
38:02
war
38:07
okay we need to move on to our final
38:09
fact of the show
38:11
and that is james okay my fact this week
38:14
is
38:14
that australian poppy fields have crop
38:17
circles
38:18
they are caused by wallabies getting
38:20
high and jumping around in circles
38:26
very nice we think or it could be aliens
38:30
so this was an interview with tasmania's
38:32
attorney general
38:34
laura giddings because tasmania makes
38:37
about 50
38:38
of the world's legally grown opium so
38:40
they have loads and loads of poppy
38:41
fields
38:42
and she said basically it's a real
38:44
problem they're wrecking the crop
38:46
they get really really high and then
38:47
just start going round and round in
38:49
circles
38:50
and then it kills all the puppies and
38:52
it's bad enough for tasmanian poppy
38:54
farmers because
38:55
like everyone's trying to stop people
38:57
from taking opiates and stuff like that
38:58
so it's really they're really struggling
39:00
to sell their
39:01
sell their opinions let's think of those
39:03
guys in this yeah
39:06
does it harm the wallabies or are they
39:07
kind of okay after they're over there
39:09
come down i don't know what i think
39:11
they're fine because they keep going
39:12
back for more
39:13
oh yeah yeah so i think they're all
39:15
right there's cases and um so some
39:17
people have worked out that they get
39:18
high off these kind of poppies
39:19
there's a dublin society um who uh well
39:22
dublin society had to step in because
39:24
some people over there were purposefully
39:26
feeding them and watching them do this
39:28
and i think the wallabies
39:29
yeah yeah wow and i think it uh did
39:32
cause them hot there's a lot of
39:32
wallabies overseas in many places that
39:35
you wouldn't expect them to be we have
39:36
them in the uk
39:37
yeah yeah exactly yeah i love man
39:39
there's about over a hundred on the isle
39:40
of man sorry this means nothing to you
39:42
united states but you wouldn't expect to
39:44
see them there it's what i'm saying
39:46
they're not the only ones who like opium
39:48
though right so parrots are addicted to
39:50
opium
39:51
oh yeah and humans
39:55
it's parrots humans and wallabies um
39:58
this is in parts of india
39:59
and this is a real problem so the so
40:02
india again
40:03
does a lot of growing opium for
40:04
medicinal purposes and they're ruining
40:06
farmers crops and so there's one farmer
40:08
in the state of madhya pradesh
40:10
who estimates that he's lost 10 percent
40:11
of his crop to parrots
40:13
who just like eat it and get high and
40:15
they
40:16
they don't respond very well to it in
40:18
the end so
40:19
they absolutely love it they're addicted
40:21
and they've even learned not to squawk
40:22
so these are parrots that usually
40:24
squawk when they're doing stuff but they
40:25
know that they shouldn't draw attention
40:26
to themselves so they do it very quietly
40:29
but they get really really woozy um you
40:31
know they go into an
40:32
opiate kind of stupor they get into a
40:34
very deep sleep so they often fall off
40:36
their perches and die
40:38
because they're taking it which is very
40:39
sad and they get terrible withdrawal so
40:42
the opium season ends
40:44
and they've got no dealer left and lose
40:47
their appetites and just sort of some of
40:48
them you know
40:49
starve themselves to death or just
40:51
horrible cold turkey cold parrot
40:55
[Laughter]
40:57
it's an issue it's so it's so much
41:00
there's so much more of this overseas
41:02
than there is in the uk
41:03
one of the main stories about this kind
41:04
of thing happening in the uk
41:06
involved a drunk pony called fat boy who
41:10
ate too many fermented apples and fell
41:12
into a swimming pool in cornwall
41:14
wow did he was he okay he was fine
41:20
uh there was uh you were right to say
41:22
that um humans like opium
41:24
thank you in 2014 there was a chinese
41:28
noodle shop owner
41:29
uh who was found guilty of lacing his
41:31
noodles with opium poppy seeds so that
41:33
his customers kept coming back
41:35
wow and they only found out when one of
41:37
his customers was given a routine urine
41:39
test by traffic police
41:41
and he was like honestly i've just had
41:43
some noodles
41:45
because you can if you eat poppy seed
41:47
bagels you can fail drugs test
41:49
and that's why yeah in the u.s and
41:51
britain i think now they've introduced
41:52
this rule that if you're
41:53
in prison and you are let out like on
41:55
bail or if you are allowed out for the
41:57
day
41:57
you have to sign a form promising you
41:59
won't eat poppy seed bagels
42:00
because you'll show up positive and
42:02
there was even in 2014 the queen's
42:05
racehorse who was called estimate i
42:08
think
42:08
won a race and then tested positive for
42:11
opiates
42:12
and the argument was that there had been
42:14
some poppy seeds mixed in with the feed
42:16
because it doesn't feel like something
42:17
that would help a racehorse to run
42:19
quickly doesn't it
42:22
no it's not what you'd instinctively go
42:24
for but she had to fall for the 81 000
42:27
prize money so please donate generously
42:33
um wallabies yeah yeah one of these i
42:36
didn't know anything about wallabies
42:37
before this but they
42:38
there are loads of different species of
42:40
them um and they're obviously pouch
42:41
animals that basically small kangaroos i
42:43
guess
42:44
to be unscientific about it but the
42:46
tamar wallaby
42:48
can breathe through its skin wow it's so
42:51
cool
42:52
it's not for very long it's just after
42:53
it's born so it's absolutely tiny when
42:55
it's born
42:56
but on the day they're born they get a
42:57
third of their oxygen through their skin
42:59
because they're just about the size of a
43:00
bean
43:01
and they are small enough that they have
43:03
a big
43:04
uh surface area to weight ratio
43:07
so it's more effective it's more
43:09
efficient for them to get
43:10
yeah i guess i don't know the
43:14
the oxygen molecules just managed to
43:15
sort of pervade into their body
43:17
um but they're really really tiny and
43:18
then they forget by the time they're an
43:20
adult
43:21
they don't forget they don't they don't
43:24
remember
43:24
um no one's asked them if they remember
43:27
it oh you mean they don't remember how
43:28
to do it sorry yeah yeah
43:29
they might remember to having done it
43:30
though maybe but they are they're kind
43:33
of gross
43:34
when they're like that aren't they
43:35
they're like a tiny little worm when
43:36
they're first born and of course they do
43:38
the huge trick and we still don't really
43:40
understand how
43:41
at what is basically still a fetal stage
43:43
they climb up through the fur
43:44
and into the pouch but they do it and
43:47
then they clock onto the teat in the
43:49
pouch and then the teat swells up the
43:50
mother's teeth swells up in their mouth
43:52
so they're stuck on it which i always
43:54
think must be so uncomfortable
43:56
and they can't take their mouth off the
43:58
mother's teeth for a couple of months
44:00
they're just round there really are they
44:02
like kangaroos that they make different
44:04
types of
44:05
milk so the baby when it first comes it
44:08
needs the real
44:09
lots of cream but then as it gets bigger
44:11
another baby comes along gets that and
44:13
then it gets the half and half
44:14
yeah and while they're doing that they
44:17
can also be growing a new baby in their
44:19
uterus so they can have sort of a kid
44:20
that's jumping in and out of the pouch
44:22
on one teat
44:22
then the very newborn wormy one on the
44:24
other and then they're growing a third
44:26
one in their uterus they're like a
44:28
super mum they'd be on a documentary or
44:29
a reality tv show or something
44:31
human and they do that without having
44:33
extra sex
44:35
as in they've say again
44:38
what well so usually if you want a
44:40
second kid
44:42
sex has to happen right sure i'm so glad
44:45
you know that with somebody who has a
44:47
second kid on the way
44:49
weirdly though we didn't have sex a
44:50
second time so
44:52
do you think your wife is a wallaby
44:56
dan's wife is actually a scientist in
44:58
the body of a wallaby
45:07
so what the what they do is when they
45:08
have sex um they
45:10
um the first bit goes in it and they
45:13
conceive but they save
45:14
some of the sperm and once they have the
45:17
wallaby go
45:18
out the sperm goes round into the other
45:20
they have a few vaginas i'm not sure how
45:21
many sure
45:22
but hang on sorry sorry sorry i mean how
45:24
do they
45:26
because i've heard about that we've
45:27
talked a bit about how i don't
45:28
understand how they keep
45:29
sperm cells alive that they've received
45:32
mating i don't understand
45:33
where and how you keep them well let me
45:35
tell you you are asking the wrong guy
45:42
that is cool i didn't know they could do
45:43
that i knew they could save a fetus
45:46
when it had been fertilized so they'll
45:48
have an embryo growing
45:49
uh it'll just start to grow and then
45:50
they'll be like oh i don't want to get
45:51
pregnant yet
45:52
and so they just pause their pregnancy
45:54
um and
45:55
uh it's called something like pregnancy
45:57
pause or something
45:59
and they can hold put the pregnancy on
46:00
hold for like a year but yeah that's
46:02
when the sperm has fertilized the egg
46:04
and this little baby just sits there and
46:05
waits in them for a year or so
46:06
yeah it's extraordinary it's amazing i
46:08
found out so okay so i grew up in
46:10
australia so there's a wallaby and a
46:11
kangaroo i only found out while
46:13
researching this today
46:14
there's a wallaroo and a wallaroo is not
46:17
them a wallaby in a kangaroo mating and
46:19
a mixed breed this is a separate this is
46:21
you've got small large we've now got
46:23
medium
46:25
this is the medium size wallaby
46:28
if you've never seen a walla root and a
46:29
powder melon which again powder melon is
46:31
a smaller version
46:32
you've got powder melon wallaby woolaroo
46:34
kangaroo there's another one too
46:36
they're all over the shop yeah they all
46:39
look kind of the same though
46:41
i'd never heard of that that's very
46:42
impressive that's cool to me
46:44
there were giant kangaroos of course oh
46:46
no sorry giant wallabies
46:48
the giant wallaby weighed uh 330 pounds
46:52
or 150 kilos and the giant short-faced
46:56
kangaroo
46:57
weighed 530 pounds so about 240 kilos
47:01
and its closest living relative
47:03
is the banded hair wallaby which weighs
47:06
four pounds yeah they had um
47:10
they have wombats that were the size of
47:11
small cars
47:13
which had teeth longer than knife blades
47:16
um
47:17
they had five meter long lizards they
47:19
had birds that
47:20
weighed half a ton and they had
47:22
tortoises the size of
47:23
small dinosaurs is they say the size of
47:25
dinosaurs but it was the size of small
47:27
dinosaurs
47:28
but all these things existed at the same
47:30
time as humans were in australia when
47:31
the
47:32
humans first came over all these massive
47:34
things
47:35
were there that must have been a
47:37
terrifying time to be an australian
47:40
humans did sort out th that problem they
47:42
did yeah
47:43
relatively quickly they are so good at
47:45
that
47:47
um i've got a um nasa apollo fact are we
47:51
too late for a bit late for that i'll
47:53
just go for it anyway
47:54
um wow if if this doesn't end up there
47:58
being a wallaby on the moon
48:00
then you've broken some serious codes
48:02
here
48:03
so it was it was a guy called walter
48:06
kuniger who was charged with the task of
48:09
trying to work out what the best way to
48:11
walk on the moon was
48:12
right and he spent years and years doing
48:14
it up until the point where they went to
48:16
the moon and he produced
48:17
a five volume report on the best ways to
48:20
move around on the moon and according to
48:22
him
48:23
the best way to move around the moon
48:24
with your gate as a human
48:26
is to jump like a kangaroo the kangaroo
48:29
hop
48:29
is how he wanted neil armstrong
48:33
to go around the moon that's so weird
48:35
like what does that even mean though
48:36
because like kangaroos use their tail to
48:38
push themselves around and stuff don't
48:40
they yeah so he just thought you're
48:41
pushing both feet and you're landing and
48:43
it's and if you get the balance right
48:44
that's the perfect gate for getting
48:46
distance so
48:48
not moving your legs independently
48:49
exactly not moving your legs
48:51
independently and they didn't do it
48:52
because they thought it would look [ __ ]
48:57
despite five volumes of work
49:01
all right that was tangentially related
49:02
to marsupials
49:04
we'll let it go do you know there's a
49:05
wallaby with a purple neck
49:07
and this was thought to be a mythical
49:09
creature people talked about there being
49:10
a purple neck wallaby
49:12
and everyone said it's not true and
49:13
people said they'd seen it in australia
49:15
and then people kept on having these
49:16
sightings that it's like purple dye on
49:18
its neck
49:19
and then everyone would just say no it's
49:21
obviously just rubbed up against some
49:22
purple paint
49:23
and there was a hundred year period
49:24
where scientists were just telling these
49:26
people who saw them it's just rubbed
49:27
against a purple wall or something
49:29
anyway they finally they finally sort of
49:33
categorized
49:34
the purple neck rock wallaby and it's
49:36
really cool it's a new species
49:37
discovered in 2001
49:39
and it basically secretes purple dye
49:41
onto its neck and kind of its face
49:44
and it's quite hard sometimes to spot
49:45
because when it rains it washes off
49:47
and it just looks like a wallaby again
49:50
so where does the
49:51
where does the ink come from from within
49:54
their body with
49:55
their glands yeah but what do we know
50:01
um we're going to have to wrap up in
50:03
soonish um
50:06
we could go back to some um like stoned
50:08
animals
50:09
oh yeah oh yeah you get stoned
50:11
platypuses
50:12
in australia what happens is it's kind
50:15
of interesting with those guys so
50:16
what happens is you get drugs that are
50:18
flushed into the rivers
50:20
by humans and then that's eaten by
50:23
larvae
50:24
and then the larvae is eaten by spiders
50:27
and then the spiders are eaten by the
50:28
platypuses
50:29
and all the way up that food chain
50:31
everyone is kind of getting stoned
50:34
but it's really weird because it's this
50:36
thing called bioaccumulating so it
50:38
becomes more and more concentrated as it
50:40
goes up through the
50:41
through the food chain so as you go
50:43
further and further up they're just
50:44
getting more and more into it and it's
50:45
especially bad with antidepressants
50:48
i think you get platypuses who take like
50:50
50
50:51
of what you would expect a human to take
50:53
for antidepressants every single day
50:55
yeah and they're small they're like this
50:58
big
50:59
yeah so it's a bit bigger it's not great
51:02
for a podcast i must say
51:04
i have to say james i don't think they
51:06
are but that big i think they're more
51:07
like this big oh yeah yeah
51:09
that's mad so it's like the old lady who
51:11
wanted to fly basically but if the end
51:13
of that rhyme was
51:14
and then she got massively got the
51:15
munchies
51:17
it's like if the fly had a little bit of
51:19
drugs in it and then the whatever it was
51:22
the bird had a bit more and the cat had
51:23
a bit more and by the time you get the
51:25
horse it's just full of ketamine
51:26
[Laughter]
51:31
it's time to wrap up okay that is it
51:33
that is all of our facts thank you so
51:34

=300
00:00
hi everybody just before we start this
00:01
week's show we have a bit of
00:03
special news if you look at the episode
00:06
number
00:07
we have done 300 podcasts it is
00:10
quite astounding isn't it who would have
00:12
thought it when we put that first
00:14
episode out
00:14
and we accidentally said it was a weekly
00:16
episode that
00:18
300 weeks down the line we would still
00:20
be doing it thank you so much for
00:22
continuing to listen if you have done if
00:24
you stopped listening some time ago you
00:25
probably won't hear this bit so don't
00:26
worry about it another really exciting
00:28
thing about the 300th episode is it was
00:31
recorded live in vienna of all places
00:34
because we got given an award yes
00:38
this is the heinz obama award for
00:39
scientific communication
00:41
heinz obahuma was a physicist he was a
00:43
great austrian
00:44
scientist communicator and you know just
00:47
scientist as well as anything else and
00:49
comedian
00:50
he very sadly died several years ago but
00:52
his colleagues have set up this award in
00:53
his name
00:54
and we were honored we were so honored
00:57
to receive it
00:58
i really hope you enjoy the show because
00:59
we had a great time making it as well we
01:01
had a right good laugh
01:02
on this episode are we gonna say by the
01:05
book this week
01:06
do you mean are we gonna say this is
01:08
your last chance to buy the book of the
01:09
year 2019 an incredible book full of the
01:11
most
01:12
interesting stuff that happened across
01:13
the entire planet this year
01:15
i wasn't going to say that no yeah i
01:17
don't think we should say that no no and
01:18
i
01:18
probably wouldn't explain the things
01:20
that are in the book oh what like the
01:22
the lawnmower records and the british
01:23
government hunting down a single bee and
01:25
the women's world cup and all the
01:26
amazing stuff
01:27
no absolutely won't mention that at all
01:28
great probably won't mention where you
01:30
can buy the book
01:31
uh just book shops isn't it and online
01:33
yeah yeah and we've already
01:34
um not mentioned the name of the book
01:36
but should we not mention it one more
01:37
time oh yeah
01:38
let's not mention that it is called the
01:40
book of the year 2019. okay
01:41
but let's definitely mention that this
01:43
is our 300th episode
01:45
okay i'm with the podcast and merry
01:48
[Music]
01:52
christmas
02:00
[Applause]
02:00
[Music]
02:03
hello and welcome to a very special
02:06
300th episode of no such thing as a fish
02:10
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
02:12
live from the heinz obama awards
02:14
ceremony
02:15
in vienna austria
02:24
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
02:27
here with anna chazinski james harkin
02:30
andrew hunter murray and once again we
02:32
have gathered around the microphones
02:33
with our four
02:34
favorite facts from the last seven days
02:36
and in no particular order
02:38
here we go starting with my fact
02:42
my fact this week is that the last tv
02:45
show
02:45
that the award-winning eminent physicist
02:48
heinz
02:48
obahuma made before he passed away was
02:51
called
02:52
the universe is a
02:56
the whole universe saw the whole
02:58
universe is a
02:59
according to a man who studied it his
03:01
entire life
03:03
um this is um i suppose some people in
03:06
the audience will be aware of this
03:07
uh show it was also transformed into a
03:10
book this is the actual
03:12
book here das universum ist ein scheisse
03:15
agent
03:16
um from the audience reaction i'm not
03:19
sure you
03:19
quite got that this was uh given to me
03:24
by uh heinz's wife doris thank you so
03:26
much for this book
03:27
um and yeah so um the reason we're
03:30
mentioning this fact tonight is because
03:32
we are actually the recipients of the
03:34
award this year
03:35
we are the 2019 obahuma recipients it's
03:38
very exciting for us
03:40
but he'd lost his faith in the universe
03:41
by the end apparently
03:43
why did he why did he think it was such
03:45
a okay he was he was
03:47
an amazing physicist um he was an
03:50
astrophysicist he was a nuclear
03:51
physicist this is a guy
03:53
who had a whole career behind him of
03:55
sort of doing proper amazing science
03:57
um but he also had a fantastic sense of
03:59
humor and
04:00
in the sort of later half of his career
04:03
he met a group who've given us this
04:04
award tonight the science busters who
04:06
are
04:06
a big austrian collective of comedy
04:09
geeks like us
04:10
and the whole thing was they would
04:12
present ideas that were funny as well as
04:14
being really interesting
04:15
and this idea was to do with the fact
04:18
that
04:18
the universe it's such an inhospitable
04:21
place
04:22
everywhere you go in it is horrible that
04:25
there's only a tiny little bit of it
04:26
that is quite nice yeah earth being one
04:29
the rest of it
04:30
yeah if you got dropped
04:32
anywhere in the universe the chances are
04:34
you would die
04:35
almost immediately right so you're
04:38
probably not going to end up on a planet
04:40
you might be in the middle of space you
04:42
might be in the middle of a star in
04:43
which case you're
04:44
almost certainly going to die um almost
04:47
almost certainly
04:49
you are you are confident sometimes
04:51
about your own chances
04:54
people from the north of england are
04:55
very confident um
04:57
no because um carl sagan the famous carl
04:59
sagan um the scientist he wrote that
05:01
space is so
05:02
empty that if you were randomly inserted
05:05
into the universe
05:06
your chance of being on or near a planet
05:09
is 10 to the power of 33
05:11
or one um against that which is 10
05:14
followed by 32 zeros
05:16
and to put that into perspective if you
05:18
were to take every bacteria
05:20
on earth and put it in a random place in
05:23
the universe
05:24
and you did it every single day for a
05:26
year only one of them would end up on a
05:28
planet
05:29
whoa and that's even on a planet not not
05:32
even on earth
05:32
no it's very unlikely to be earth i mean
05:35
it's so it's so annoying for the
05:36
bacteria because they're on earth to
05:38
start with
05:40
what kind of a weird prank was this it
05:42
was a terrible package holiday company
05:44
for bacteria only
05:46
and it's not just planets is it it's
05:48
anything as well
05:49
so the chances are you would have
05:51
nothing around you the universe is
05:52
almost entirely made up of
05:54
what are called voids which is just a
05:56
fancy word for nothing
05:58
and so if i didn't really realize this
06:00
but if you really zoom out on the
06:02
universe which is hard to do
06:03
then it basically looks like a cobweb
06:06
it's connected by sort of
06:07
threads of galaxies where all the stuff
06:09
is so you know the
06:11
stars the planets the moons the nebulae
06:13
and the rest of it is literally
06:15
nothing the the occasional blob of
06:18
helium
06:18
maybe if you're really lucky on an
06:20
exciting day so i was looking at ways of
06:22
improving the universe
06:24
and some people have done some
06:26
calculations on on what would happen
06:28
so if you filled the whole universe with
06:30
breathable
06:31
air you would think this is a good move
06:33
yeah it would collapse within 24 hours
06:35
oh nightmare yeah also to
06:39
let's just shrink it down if you filled
06:40
up the solar system with air
06:42
what we think would happen is that
06:45
because there would be air in the 93
06:47
million miles between earth and the sun
06:50
uh the sun would be
06:51
loud enough because there are all these
06:52
air molecules to pass on the sound
06:54
it will be loud enough to cause you
06:55
physical injury uh
06:57
it would be like having a train horn one
07:00
meter from your head
07:01
all the time all the time right
07:05
but you wouldn't be able to see it
07:07
because the air would be so
07:08
thick for 93 million miles that you
07:11
wouldn't see what was making the noise
07:13
right does it matter if you can see it
07:15
what are you gonna turn that what do you
07:17
what do you i think it is quite
07:19
important that the light from the sun
07:21
reaches our planet um i'm really happy
07:25
it kind of like that defeats the whole
07:27
object of the sun right we don't want it
07:28
for its nice but it would still be very
07:30
hot
07:30
it'll be very very hot and loud and dark
07:33
yeah
07:34
it's like being a nightclub forever
07:38
so we've got it good we've got it good
07:40
got it good because
07:41
like andy was saying if you ended up on
07:43
a planet the likelihood is it won't be
07:45
as nice a planet as earth
07:47
so for instance there is a planet called
07:50
corrupt 7b
07:51
where it's always raining but it's
07:53
always raining rocks
07:57
and the temperature is around 2800
08:00
kelvin
08:01
which is almost 5000 degrees fahrenheit
08:03
um but the one
08:04
good thing about it is it's so close to
08:07
its star
08:08
that the year lasts only 20 hours
08:11
and so that means it's your birthday
08:13
every day
08:15
oh that's cool but you but it's also new
08:17
year's day every day and you're so
08:18
hungover
08:19
every day from new year's eve the night
08:21
before
08:22
i found a planet um that would be
08:24
horrible to land on as well
08:26
if you got there by chance um it's
08:28
called hd189773b
08:32
very catchy name at 63 light years away
08:36
from us
08:36
and one of the main issues with it is
08:38
that um
08:39
it's raining a lot but the rain isn't uh
08:42
it doesn't go vertically down it goes
08:44
horizontally across the planet it's not
08:46
so bad we get that in england sometimes
08:48
yeah we do get that uh the problem is is
08:50
that um the surface temperatures is such
08:52
that the particles condense to form
08:54
glass so it rains shards of glass at 4
08:57
000 miles an hour
08:58
constantly around the planet
09:03
let's go back to rock planet
09:04
[Laughter]
09:06
i was looking at um other other things
09:08
that could happen that would be a bit
09:09
catastrophic in the universe
09:11
and um do you know what would happen if
09:13
the moon
09:14
turned into a black hole with the exact
09:18
mass of the moon okay i'm going to say
09:20
bad
09:22
just bad things would happen that's fair
09:24
it's a fair
09:25
point uh so black holes are usually
09:28
quite big remnants of
09:29
like massive massive stars that have had
09:31
this huge
09:33
exotic death and then collapse it on
09:34
themselves so that's a black hole
09:36
usually
09:37
um but then they've got this um this
09:39
like enormous
09:40
mass and so it's if there's a black hole
09:42
with the same mass as a moon
09:44
that would be they've got this enormous
09:45
density sorry that would be extremely
09:47
extremely small
09:49
but it would like pull everything that
09:51
came quite near it towards it
09:53
but other than that nothing would happen
09:55
so ronda monroe did this the moon would
09:56
disappear we wouldn't see the moon
09:58
because it's got the same mass as as the
10:01
moon had it's just a little black hole
10:03
the only thing that would happen is
10:04
there'd be a tiny little black hole and
10:05
if a little bit of dust was drifting
10:07
past it
10:08
it would get sucked in okay or there
10:10
will fly or something the world would be
10:12
less romantic
10:13
without that would be less romantic yes
10:16
and we do get a bit of heating from the
10:18
moon
10:18
so that would go and so that would put
10:20
off global warming
10:21
by about two weeks
10:25
so this is really a last plan to deal
10:27
with global warming
10:29
the emergency extinction rebellion if
10:33
this was their plan that they revealed
10:35
after all these protests turn the moon
10:38
into a black hole
10:39
two more weeks one bad thing that could
10:43
happen
10:44
in the universe is the entire universe
10:46
could die due to a massive
10:48
bubble okay this is the thing that
10:50
astronomers have looked into it's called
10:52
death by bubble
10:54
that's what it says on the tin yeah and
10:56
the idea is quite complicated but the
10:58
idea is that the universe
11:00
is at a certain energy level and that is
11:03
not the lowest energy level it could
11:04
possibly be in and due to quantum
11:06
physics it might
11:07
go down one level and then there would
11:09
be a massive bubble and it would just
11:10
eat up everything in the universe
11:13
and there was a new paper published in
11:15
the journal physical review d
11:17
and they said they've worked out when
11:19
this is going to happen
11:20
so the universe may be killed by a death
11:23
bubble
11:24
somewhere between 10 octo decilion years
11:28
which is a one with 58 zeroes after it
11:31
and 10 quin quadragintillion years
11:35
which is one with 139 zeros after it
11:39
okay and according to the lead author
11:41
that is a very
11:42
very very very very very very very very
11:46
very long time
11:50
so is that just the range of when it's
11:52
going to happen yep
11:54
it's like a delivery slot from a
11:56
supermarket
11:56
[Laughter]
12:01
um so this is the thing we're talking
12:02
about this is heinz obama's sort of big
12:05
work wasn't it when he was
12:06
when he was sort of in his proper
12:08
science stage
12:09
yeah so a lot of his works were more
12:11
about the fine-tuning of the universe
12:13
so for instance the fact that you have
12:16
certain particles in stars
12:18
and if the forces between them was
12:20
changed even by
12:21
something like 0.4 percent complete life
12:24
would be completely impossible
12:26
the stars would that which currently
12:27
make carbon and oxygen they'd either
12:29
make just carbon or just oxygen
12:31
so we wouldn't be able to have any life
12:33
whatsoever and it's all about the
12:35
unlikelihood of life and the
12:37
unlikelihood of
12:38
all this yeah okay but then i mean there
12:40
is also a likelihood of life given the
12:42
size of the universe right
12:43
according to a lot of scientists but
12:45
then the bad news about that is
12:47
if we ever bump into it it'll probably
12:49
want to kill us so it seems like stephen
12:51
hawking's
12:52
final warning uh before he died was
12:55
that if we meet aliens they're going to
12:57
want to destroy us all because the
12:58
chances are
12:59
if an alien gets to us they're a nomadic
13:02
alien you know they're looking for land
13:04
otherwise why have they left and if
13:05
they're looking for land they're going
13:06
to wipe us off their land
13:07
it's basically we've set an example uh
13:10
constantly throughout history by going
13:11
to different countries
13:13
and then you know conquering those
13:14
they're going to do the same to us
13:16
we need to be advertising to the aliens
13:18
that it's all a
13:20
and then they won't want to come here
13:21
exactly
13:23
heinz's master plan could i tell you
13:27
quickly my favorite fact about heinz
13:29
he um was a word when he was doing
13:33
speeches in english
13:34
that he would say to the audience um
13:36
this might be a word that you find hard
13:37
to pronounce
13:38
um so why don't you call me by my other
13:41
name which is the translation of that
13:43
i go by chief lobster
13:46
wow yeah chief lobster chief lobster
13:49
hormone lobster
13:50
and oba being a sort of chief character
13:53
so yeah so
13:55
he wanted to be known as chief lobster
13:57
um
13:58
and apparently he used to do gigs like
14:00
like the gig we're doing right now you
14:01
know in front of an audience and he
14:02
always used to get really hungry
14:03
and after getting really hungry after a
14:05
gig he'd go and find a sausage stand
14:07
which was out after the gig and one
14:09
night it was too late and the sausage
14:10
stand was
14:11
shut and he had no choice but to go to a
14:13
burger king and
14:15
he was like i don't want to go to a
14:16
burger king is this when he realized the
14:17
universe is a
14:20
no apparently he went into this burger
14:21
king and suddenly because in this in
14:23
austria he's he's such a famous name but
14:25
kids love him he's such a great
14:27
communicator
14:27
everyone in the burger king queue was
14:29
like hides oh my god it's hyde's
14:30
overhaul
14:31
oh my god this is amazing so from then
14:33
on after every gig
14:34
he found the local burger king and made
14:38
sure that he was recognized by everyone
14:39
inside
14:40
um and i think my favorite thing from
14:42
this award is that
14:44
we've been given the actual award itself
14:46
is from a farm
14:47
that his family runs which is alpacas
14:50
and these alpacas obviously
14:52
have poos and um our trophy tonight is a
14:55
collection
14:56
of their poo that's that is the award
14:59
which is
15:00
unbelievable and we
15:03
and we saw it being made we saw our
15:06
trophies being made
15:07
or well we saw we we saw an alpaca
15:11
having a poo who knows
15:12
in fact i think we helped next year's
15:14
trophy be made because we went
15:16
we were invited to see these alpacas and
15:18
meet them and they're amazing and we fed
15:20
them
15:21
so actually next year's winner hopefully
15:23
will thank us
15:24
for contributing to the making of their
15:26
trophy yeah yeah
15:27
because that's only going to come out
15:28
the other end you'd assume
15:30
amazing creatures though i've never seen
15:32
an alpaca before they're very they're
15:34
very cool
15:35
i was reading a little about their um
15:37
[Music]
15:38
their habits and their lifestyle and one
15:41
thing
15:42
they do so the way there's a way you can
15:44
tell if a female alpaca is pregnant
15:47
okay and there are some scientific ways
15:49
you can tell obviously with an
15:50
ultrasound
15:51
but you could also tell with a
15:52
behavioral test
15:54
and all you have to do is introduce a
15:56
male alpaca
15:58
into the same space and when the male
16:01
approaches the female if the female is
16:03
pregnant
16:04
she will spit in his face
16:08
that is how you know that the female is
16:11
pregnant
16:12
and they can do it consistently they can
16:14
do it with accuracy they get it exactly
16:16
right
16:18
yeah but then they get sour mouth right
16:21
this is an alpaca
16:22
piece of terminology because their spit
16:24
is actually it tastes very sour and
16:26
disgusting but they do need to spit
16:27
sometimes
16:28
and so then they get this like loose
16:29
floppy lower lip so you know when you
16:31
see them sort of exposing their lower
16:33
teeth they look a bit gormless
16:34
that's because the taste in their mouth
16:36
is so foul that's this
16:38
it's too bitter for them but that will
16:40
teach them not to spit in the first
16:41
place really
16:43
another bit of alpaca terminology is the
16:46
ogle
16:48
and this is a sound that alpacas make
16:49
when they're ready to mate
16:51
and it's really you've got to listen to
16:53
it on the internet it's absolutely
16:54
amazing
16:55
um it's been described as like a rusty
16:57
jazz trumpeter
16:59
attempting to play a solo inside a
17:01
swimming pool
17:05
james i don't have a very good
17:06
imagination i just wonder
17:08
as you've heard this sound could you
17:11
could you just give us something close
17:13
to it
17:15
go on right
17:20
[Music]
17:22
okay if there's any alpacas in the
17:24
audience
17:25
you're about to get very excited it go
17:28
it's something like
17:32
that's really good you very impressive
17:36
that's fantastic
17:38
[Music]
17:40
i think my favorite uh terminal sorry
17:43
how is your career going james well
17:46
i was on stage in vienna doing an
17:47
impression of a horny alpaca
17:52
um my favorite terminology um we just
17:55
talked in terminology
17:56
is that um when an alpaca gives birth
17:58
that's called
17:59
unpacking
18:03
that's true and what might that sound no
18:08
um yeah they they're incredible am i
18:11
right in saying that they can kind of
18:13
the females can ovulate on command
18:16
i think they they have to be stimulated
18:17
by a male
18:19
uh to so yeah when they when they can't
18:21
when they're contacted by
18:22
the male member but it can't be that you
18:25
go up to a female alpaca and just say
18:27
ovulate
18:28
yeah and she just does it when guardian
18:30
obviously yeah
18:32
and that was actually why obama's family
18:34
kicked us off the farm yesterday
18:37
um yeah sorry to the family for that um
18:41
there is one alpaca in the world which
18:43
can surf
18:44
cool are you talking about surfing on
18:47
water or on the internet on water
18:49
on water um there is a peruvian surfer
18:52
domingo pianezzi
18:54
and he has taken his alpaca to the
18:57
pacific
18:57
ocean and he put it in a flotation vest
19:00
it's called pisco
19:01
and it's not great at surfing
19:04
but it it is able to kneel on the board
19:08
for a little while well i think yeah
19:12
being as he said about it he was asked
19:13
about it he said i've surfed with
19:16
a dog a parrot a hamster and a cat
19:19
but i was at a competition in australia
19:21
and i saw people surfing with kangaroos
19:22
and koalas
19:23
so i thought it would be interesting to
19:25
surf with an animal that represents peru
19:27
cool yeah poor
19:30
alpaca hating it we're gonna have to
19:33
move on to our next fact in a second
19:35
i was just just reading a little bit
19:37
about because they're peruvian and
19:38
they're related to llamas they're
19:39
camellids closely related to their
19:41
larger cousin and the imara
19:45
people of bolivia and peru have
19:47
interacted very closely with alpacas and
19:49
llamas for a while and i stumbled upon a
19:51
book in this research describing
19:53
how they would use them and this this
19:55
book said
19:56
uh that alpaca the alpacas actually had
19:58
a very often had a disease that was very
20:00
similar to syphilis
20:02
in symptoms which i thought was weird
20:04
and then it said whether this was
20:06
communicated from alpaca to man or vice
20:08
versa is an open one
20:12
what and then i checked and it was
20:14
written in 1870 when i think they had
20:16
different ideas
20:17
um but the other thing in this book this
20:19
book also said apparently
20:21
llamas if offended will stamp their foot
20:23
with rage
20:24
like a woman
20:25
[Laughter]
20:30
[Music]
20:32
okay it is time for fact number two and
20:34
that
20:35
is chozinski my fact this week is that
20:38
early
20:38
laser eye surgery was performed in a
20:41
trailer
20:41
next to a trash compactor that whenever
20:44
it was switched on
20:45
would vibrate the trailer as the doctors
20:47
were trying to operate
20:50
now i don't know if you're familiar with
20:52
how laser eye surgery works but it's
20:54
quite a
20:55
particular process that requires a
20:57
steady hand and a lack of serious
20:59
vibrations of the room that you're
21:01
standing in
21:02
i think anything that has a laser and an
21:04
eye involved
21:05
probably you don't want it to be
21:06
vibrating yeah was that wobbling
21:09
i don't worry about it so this is in
21:11
1988
21:12
and this was straight after the first
21:14
ever successful eye surgery
21:16
laser eye surgery on a human a lab was
21:19
created in louisiana state
21:21
university school of medicine but they
21:23
were scared about sort of radiation from
21:25
the laser
21:26
going into the main building so they
21:27
made them have it in this caravan
21:29
basically
21:30
next to this massive vibrating machine
21:32
and you know
21:33
a rubbish compactor is just a huge
21:35
machine which crushes down
21:37
shed loads of rubbish and so it would
21:39
turn on every ten minutes
21:40
vibrate the trailer and the doctor
21:42
during the surgery got really annoyed
21:44
and said this is
21:45
screwing up my surgery and the company
21:47
the trash company refused to close the
21:49
compactor and so the doctor marguerite
21:51
mcdonald
21:52
did a study to prove that it was
21:54
damaging the medical outcomes
21:56
these vibrations that's uh what was the
21:59
study
21:59
yeah uh well she didn't operate on 100
22:02
people
22:03
and then ruined 10 operations you really
22:06
want to be part of the control group
22:07
[Laughter]
22:10
she uh she used the evidence from the
22:12
people who'd been in the vibrating room
22:15
and saw if you know their eyes had
22:16
accidentally been gouged out in the
22:17
process or anything
22:19
and to her astonishment she found out
22:22
that the people who'd been operated on
22:23
when the room was vibrating
22:25
had actually done better the surgery had
22:27
been more
22:28
successful than when it wasn't vibrating
22:31
what
22:31
and this was a crucial part of laser eye
22:33
surgery science
22:35
they realized that basically when the
22:36
laser is scraping the
22:38
the top of your cornea off then it had
22:41
to go up and down to make the incision
22:43
and it was going up and down about 40
22:45
times a minute
22:46
and that was actually turned out it was
22:47
a bit too jerky but when you added in
22:49
the vibrations of the big rubbish dump
22:52
next door
22:53
it sort of smoothed it out a bit no i
22:55
can't believe that
22:57
because these days when you have laser
22:59
eye surgery they're not doing it
23:00
when there's an earthquake going on yeah
23:04
so what they did was they sped up the
23:06
laser vibrations
23:07
so they said well obviously it's working
23:09
and we can't guarantee we'll always have
23:10
this rubbish thing here
23:12
so they made the laser go up and down a
23:14
bit faster that's extraordinary is there
23:16
is there a thing do we know where by if
23:18
it was a bit faster the compactor a bit
23:20
slow like was it the
23:21
was it the goldilocks kind of amount of
23:23
vibration oh i don't know if it was just
23:25
the right amount of porridge
23:27
and i think it was just important that
23:29
it vibrated a bit more
23:30
to make it less jerky it's so mad she
23:33
was amazing
23:33
oh she is amazing she's still alive
23:35
isn't she uh marguerite mcdonald yeah
23:37
um and i think she was the first person
23:40
to do laser eye surgery is that right
23:43
yes i think she might have operated on
23:44
the first lady as well
23:46
yeah so the first lady was a patient
23:47
called alberta cassidy
23:49
who'd been just diagnosed with a
23:51
melanoma of her eye
23:52
and they were going to have to remove it
23:54
but before they did so
23:56
she was so amazing she just basically
23:58
said if anyone wants to do
24:00
any experiments on this eye while it's
24:02
here then you can do it and they rushed
24:04
her in
24:04
and they did the operation wow she was
24:07
very cool and
24:08
alberta cassidy uh knew sort of had a
24:11
what they called a dire
24:12
prognosis and she did in fact die a few
24:14
months later
24:15
but she volunteered herself yeah so they
24:17
rushed her into a primate center
24:18
because that was the only place they
24:20
were doing laser eye surgery at the time
24:22
and so she laid down on a bed and had
24:24
her eyes lasered alongside the
24:26
sort of shrieking and crying out monkeys
24:30
and primates
24:31
um presumably quite off-putting but yeah
24:34
and it worked yeah
24:35
maybe the vibrations of the shrieking
24:38
yeah now every laser operation you have
24:41
a chimpanzee next to you um some of the
24:45
first
24:45
surgery a laser eye surgery was done on
24:48
turkey dinners so this was they were
24:51
trying to test
24:51
uh the lasers in the first place this is
24:53
before they even got to operating on
24:55
any uh humans or any animals there was a
24:58
doctor called rangaswamy's rangaswamy
24:59
srinivasan
25:00
and he was one of the pioneers because
25:02
the lasers they were using were normally
25:04
for
25:04
uh carving computer chips in the right
25:07
shape
25:08
and they thought maybe we can use this
25:11
for a medicinal purpose somehow
25:13
and so this doctor srinivasan he brought
25:16
his
25:16
leftovers from his thanksgiving dinner
25:18
in just a leftover turkey dinner
25:21
and they practiced etching patterns in
25:23
the cartilage and on the bones and on
25:25
the skin and all of this so
25:27
yeah yeah this was how they developed it
25:30
in the early days
25:30
wow there was another another part of
25:32
development of laser eye surgery was
25:34
um a boy smashed his glasses into his
25:38
face so he fell over
25:39
and the glass went all over his eyes and
25:42
it made his eyes better
25:44
um yeah this is i mean this is a thing
25:46
so this was a there was a russian
25:48
surgeon who dealt with him called doctor
25:51
oh dear okay um
25:58
i think it was dr theodorov maybe yes
26:02
he was uh dr fearledov
26:05
and um yes that's what i said a theater
26:08
of
26:09
um so he was treating a near-sighted boy
26:11
who'd fallen
26:12
the he'd fallen over these glass shards
26:14
had gone into his eye
26:15
and the damage was minimal but what it
26:17
did was a sliver of the glass had shaved
26:19
off
26:20
a bit of the top layer of his eye oh
26:22
yeah which largely what uh laser eye
26:24
surgery is now is to sort of
26:25
reshape the eye it reshaped the eye so
26:28
while they were studying him he was like
26:29
i can see everything now
26:31
and that's what made them realize okay
26:33
this is where we have to get we just
26:35
gotta start shaving eyes
26:36
and so if you can't afford laser eye
26:38
surgery no
26:39
no no no no no we can't recommend we
26:43
can't recommend anything because
26:44
actually i don't know if you guys saw in
26:47
the news this year uh do you know the
26:48
pop star
26:49
or the singer grimes yeah grimes uh who
26:52
was a partner of
26:53
elon musk well she apparently has had
26:57
laser eye surgery that blocks out the
26:59
color blue
27:01
whenever she's looking at things and the
27:03
idea is that she suffers from seasonal
27:05
affective disorder and by getting rid of
27:08
the blue light
27:09
it'll make her feel better and feel less
27:10
sad okay
27:12
now i went on the website
27:15
lookafteryoureyes.org
27:16
and they said this surgery is not
27:18
supported by scientific evidence
27:21
yeah so whatever you do don't do that
27:23
well how does she
27:25
know where the sky is anymore it's it's
27:27
in the same places where she left it
27:31
when she goes swimming how does she know
27:32
which bit is the c and which bit is the
27:34
sky
27:36
andy andy did the faqs for why you
27:38
shouldn't have this surgery
27:41
do you think that when you're swimming
27:43
towards the horizon if you keep going
27:45
eventually you start swimming into the
27:46
sky
27:49
and anyway yeah both those things are
27:51
blue
27:52
so if you can't see blue you can't tell
27:54
the difference but you can't tell the
27:56
difference anyway because they're both
27:57
blue
27:57
that's true i can't believe i can't
28:00
believe i said that
28:04
well at least we're not recording it so
28:06
you're fine um
28:07
[Laughter]
28:08
this is this is supposed to be about
28:10
science communication
28:12
they're gonna take our away from us
28:14
andy
28:16
oh monet couldn't see the color blue you
28:18
know couldn't he
28:19
well i've got a question about monet and
28:22
that's why he drowned
28:24
trying to swim in the sky
28:27
now he had a cataract
28:32
he had cataracts and actually a lot of
28:34
people say this is why his paintings
28:36
were so blurry
28:37
um because his vision was quite blurry
28:39
because when he went into a really
28:40
blurry phase it was because
28:41
he had eye problems which when they were
28:43
fixed uh meant that he looked at all the
28:45
paintings he'd done and sort of tore
28:46
most of them up and chucked them away
28:48
saying well these are all blurry they're
28:49
oh no why have you been saying
28:51
they're good
28:52
but he was so annoyed at having to wear
28:53
an eye patch for one eye
28:55
that in the other eye he refused surgery
28:57
and the cataracts
28:58
they meant that he could never see blue
29:00
or purple again gosh
29:02
yeah you know there's a um guinness
29:04
world record
29:05
um it's the latest i'd read possibly
29:08
it's changed but
29:08
uh for the longest eyesight for longest
29:11
human
29:12
being able to spot something the biggest
29:14
distance but wait a minute i can see
29:16
stars which are billions of light years
29:18
away
29:20
and it's you james who holds the um
29:24
i'm here to present you with your second
29:25
award of the evening
29:28
so yeah is there a is is she able to
29:30
read an
29:31
eye test chart from a long way away is
29:33
that the idea so the test that they did
29:35
on her was to put humans very far away
29:37
and for her to go oh it's bob
29:40
that was it and she could identify um
29:42
someone as far
29:44
more than 1.6 kilometers away oh
29:47
yeah her name was veronica cedar and
29:50
uh she was tested because everyone at
29:53
school was like gosh she can see
29:54
you know how did she know the bus was
29:56
coming it's miles way and
29:58
yeah and she can actually tell she could
30:00
actually say that's about 1.2 miles away
30:02
she could she could judge distances as
30:04
well yeah they presumably they did not
30:06
just test her with people she knew who
30:08
wore
30:09
very interestingly shaped clothing well
30:12
so that if you
30:12
cause if you wore your special hat yes
30:15
good point
30:15
good point if you dressed as a star
30:17
james would be all over it
30:21
no she she the the fascinating thing was
30:23
not only was she able to
30:24
spot the person but she could spot she
30:26
could make differentiation in the colors
30:28
of clothing that they were wearing as
30:29
well which apparently at that distance
30:31
is even harder to do because they all
30:32
kind of blur into one
30:33
right yeah it's amazing she'd be a
30:35
horrible person to try and
30:36
hide from wouldn't she or to run away
30:38
from why run away from
30:40
well just because if you're trying to
30:41
run away you know she can still see you
30:43
even though
30:44
you think you've got a distance between
30:46
you guys well you should i
30:47
you should just go into a building yeah
30:50
exactly
30:52
this is only a problem if you're trying
30:53
to run away from veronica cedar yeah on
30:56
a featureless desert plane
30:57
yeah you're very rarely playing hide and
31:00
seek on a featureless
31:04
it's just about being so far
31:06
away guys you obviously haven't got the
31:08
advanced level hide and seek that i've
31:10
graduated to
31:11
the gobi desert chesinski challenge
31:14
um i've got a fact about uh the
31:18
lenses in the eyes of newts wow yeah
31:22
okay so newts uh this is a
31:25
similar word in german maybe newts
31:28
like a little lizard
31:41
[Laughter]
31:45
it does sound like an irish person
31:47
called mike doesn't it
31:49
i told mike the news
31:50
[Laughter]
31:52
sorry go on no no well mike the newt
31:56
um he is very lucky because he can
31:59
regenerate the lenses of his
32:02
eyes indefinitely wow so
32:05
a group of scientists tested this
32:07
because i think it was known that this
32:08
could be done
32:09
so they removed the lenses it doesn't
32:11
have a cruel ending the story okay
32:13
that's the important thing to say
32:14
i mean this bit is arguably very cruel
32:15
but the they removed the lenses from a
32:18
group of newt's eyes
32:20
and the newts grew back perfect lenses
32:22
so the scientists
32:23
did it again and they grew them back
32:26
again
32:27
scientists removed them again they grew
32:30
them back
32:30
uh 18 times in a row
32:34
and perfectly the lenses
32:37
that were grown back were
32:38
indistinguishable from the lenses of
32:40
a 14 year old adult mute that had never
32:43
had a lens removed in the first place
32:45
that is
32:46
amazing that's incredible on the 19th
32:48
time did it screw it up yeah screwed it
32:50
up
32:50
that was it it's 18 max i think they
32:52
stopped at 18 probably because their
32:54
ethics committee had started asking
32:57
questions but actually because i read a
33:00
story in the news
33:01
this year about a 67 year old woman
33:05
who had 27 contact lenses removed from
33:08
her eyes
33:10
and i thought that she'd been putting
33:11
them in and then kept forgetting to take
33:13
them out but
33:14
now i'm thinking she might be a newt
33:16
[Laughter]
33:18
it's mike's wife
33:21
um we're gonna have to move on in a
33:22
second um
33:24
i've got one last thing i was just i was
33:26
just looking into eyes
33:28
generally and it was very romantic
33:30
[Laughter]
33:36
a number of women in vienna have issued
33:38
restraining orders now yeah
33:40
my wife is not happy honey it's research
33:44
um no i um so sometimes research takes
33:47
you down a rabbit hole and you go to
33:48
different places and i was looking into
33:50
eyes in movies
33:52
because we had 3d and how you have eyes
33:54
but my favorite fact that i discovered
33:56
is that there was a movie that was made
33:58
called blade trinity
33:59
oh yeah with wesley snipes as blade it
34:02
was a disastrous production and he hated
34:04
being on it and he refused
34:06
to do so many things called himself
34:07
blade on set not wes
34:09
on blade um but the most the head
34:12
to head came between the director and
34:14
wesley snipes for one scene
34:16
where they were filming his face just
34:17
his face and wesley snipes refused to
34:20
open his eyes
34:21
in the scene oh and he refused for so
34:23
long that the director went screw it
34:25
we've done we got it
34:26
and they cgi'd his eyes opening no
34:30
cgi cgi so if you watch and you can see
34:35
it online it's amazing these weird
34:36
cartoon eyes suddenly appear
34:38
because he refused to open them on set
34:41
that's amazing yeah oh there's one other
34:44
movie i
34:45
fact it just is so relevant um so and
34:48
it's about contact lenses and
34:49
eye correction the first use of contact
34:51
lenses to change an actor's eye color
34:53
was in
34:54
a film called miracles for sale and they
34:57
used a blue
34:58
ceramic lens this is really early to
35:01
change an actor's eye color i think
35:03
from brown to blue the weird thing is
35:06
this happened in the film miracles for
35:08
sale which was released in 1939
35:11
and is in fact a black and white film
35:17
incredible
35:17
[Applause]
35:21
okay it is time for fact number three
35:23
and that is
35:24
andy my fact is that some inuits
35:27
if they got extremely hungry would have
35:30
been able
35:31
to eat their own sleds someone in the
35:34
audience said what
35:35
yeah fair enough so some inuit sleds
35:38
were partially made of fish
35:42
this was a thing you could do
35:45
if you were in frankly if you your
35:48
normal sled had broken
35:49
or you've been lost or for instance if
35:51
you lived so far north that there were
35:53
no trees
35:53
exactly and you wouldn't have much
35:55
driftwood and so you needed something
35:57
you couldn't make it out of
35:58
uh what yeah so what you would do is you
36:00
would take three fish there's a
36:02
particular kind of fish that the
36:03
uh the inuit hunter great deal they're
36:05
called arctic char
36:06
you cut them in two lengthways and you
36:09
put them in a row
36:10
and then you wrap those up in seal skin
36:13
with leather strips so it's made of fish
36:15
and seal now overnight
36:17
bang they freeze you have an instant
36:20
runner for a sled
36:21
then you need crossbars and those are
36:24
sometimes made of caribou leg bones
36:26
or walrus skin some sources say walrus
36:29
meat
36:30
so this is a very edible sled we're
36:32
putting together
36:33
you tie it all together with more strips
36:35
of seal and
36:36
you've got a sled basically and the main
36:38
thing you have to do is stop your dogs
36:40
from eating it
36:42
that's amazing it's like the the
36:44
extension of you know one of those
36:45
necklaces you can wear
36:47
that has sweets around it that you can
36:48
eat if you get hungry yeah
36:50
they've taken that one step further well
36:53
they had a lot of fish
36:54
they like they like fish they liked fish
36:56
back in the day they like fish a bit
36:58
less now since i think inuit's largely
37:00
um have been i suppose invaded by
37:02
western culture a bit so they now like
37:04
fish and mcdonald's
37:05
but they would eat seal a lot
37:09
but have like a huge respect for seals
37:11
right so they thought that
37:12
seals would be offended if they stopped
37:14
eating them and
37:16
so and they would they would treat them
37:18
with huge reverence so
37:20
as they killed a seal they would give it
37:22
a drink of water to quench its thirst
37:24
as it died so it would be like well what
37:26
a nice guy they
37:28
did that and the yupik people actually
37:30
who are related culturally to the inuits
37:32
and who are slightly further south
37:34
they would return a preserved seal
37:36
bladder to the sea
37:38
every year hoping that the seal bladder
37:41
would swim
37:41
back to its seal friends and say i was
37:44
treated really well
37:45
by the yupik people don't worry about
37:47
them they're good guys
37:50
and yeah that would encourage them to go
37:51
and give themselves up to hunters
37:53
that is amazing it's a complex morality
37:58
this um fish sled i think was first
38:01
described by an explorer called peter
38:03
franken
38:05
and he found some people in a town
38:07
called
38:08
igloo lick who are doing this uh and the
38:11
name igloo lick it's
38:12
this is a town that's absolutely in the
38:13
middle of nowhere no trees it's a tiny
38:15
little island
38:16
the name igloo lick means there is a
38:18
house here
38:22
but also it is the home of the world's
38:24
only
38:25
inuit circus yeah they're called the art
38:29
circ
38:30
um but they actually were invited to do
38:33
a show
38:33
in mali in timbuktu and so they've gone
38:36
from a town where it's usually around
38:38
minus 50 degrees centigrade
38:41
and they've gone to mali where it's
38:42
normally plus 40 degrees centigrade and
38:45
they turned up
38:46
and they basically couldn't do it wow
38:49
and so
38:50
the only shows they could do were at
38:51
midnight
38:53
and so they would do shows at midnight
38:54
and the whole rest of the day they would
38:56
just sleep
38:57
because it was so hot but did they have
38:59
the same animals like
39:00
walruses and seals presumably there is a
39:03
there is a balloon guy but he only uses
39:05
the
39:06
bladder removed from a seal it was
39:09
it was a non-animal circus it was more
39:11
like trapeze and juggling and things
39:13
like that
39:13
okay so cool yeah um the uses of uh
39:16
seals by inuit people are very very
39:19
broad because if you have only a few
39:21
resources then you have to use the ones
39:22
you can as well as possible
39:24
so raw seal liver was a childhood treat
39:27
food for some inuit groups there was
39:30
chewing gum which was made of
39:31
seal blubber sealed blood soup was a
39:35
good thing for new
39:36
mothers and it was sealed blubber oil
39:39
was used as a body lotion
39:41
and as a fuel and as a laxative
39:44
yeah okay dry skin
39:48
too cold constipated
39:53
you know you can be proposed to for
39:54
marriage by a seal in an igloo
39:57
um you're going to have to explain it
39:59
further so
40:00
the singer seal proposed to his
40:04
model girlfriend heidi klum in an igloo
40:06
is that right
40:07
yeah in the canadian rockies
40:14
i have never been more disappointed with
40:16
a fact in my life
40:18
that's the best fact i've ever said in
40:19
my life
40:22
i was because that was for you guys
40:24
because there's no way james is going to
40:25
leave that in the edit so
40:26
uh hope you enjoyed um here's a really
40:29
really interesting thing
40:30
this is quite sciency and it's to do
40:33
with the inuit people so
40:34
the inuit elders at the moment think
40:37
that the earth's
40:38
tilt has changed and the reason they
40:40
think that is because they often tell
40:42
the time by looking at the moon and the
40:44
stars and where the sun comes up
40:46
and they found that over the last few
40:48
years that the sun is coming up in a
40:50
different place
40:51
and the stars are in a different place
40:52
and the moon's in a different place when
40:54
compared to the mountains
40:56
and the reason is that global warming
40:59
has caused
41:00
the atmosphere to get warmer and so when
41:03
you see light coming from space
41:05
it refracts and so actually where the
41:07
sun
41:08
used to you thought it was is not there
41:10
anymore and it's in a completely
41:12
different place and their explanation
41:14
was that the earth's tilt had changed
41:16
and we're just all too scared to tell
41:18
them about global warming because
41:20
they are going to be pissed off
41:23
wow that's very cool they must have such
41:25
a specific uh
41:26
because it hasn't changed that much the
41:28
position of the sun i would have noticed
41:30
yes so um in even in viking times you
41:32
would tell
41:33
if you live in say babylonian places
41:36
you live near the equator and you would
41:38
tell the time because the sun rises in
41:40
the east and sets in the west
41:42
but if you live in the north if you're a
41:44
viking or something like that or you
41:45
live in the polar circle
41:46
then the sun is always rising and
41:49
setting in different places
41:50
and so the way that they tell the time
41:52
is they would take specific things on
41:54
the horizon
41:54
like for instance a mountain or a goat
41:57
or a gate
41:58
not a goat's you goat there's old
42:01
veronica 1.6 kilometers away
42:05
i know that goat
42:10
that was going so well
42:14
uh yes anyway they would take something
42:15
on the horizon and they would use that
42:17
to tell exactly what time of day it was
42:20
very cool but not a goat not a girl
42:22
unless you cement it into the ground
42:26
um so there was a woman called gene
42:29
briggs who was an anthropologist in the
42:30
1960s who lived with the inuits
42:33
in alaska and wrote down a lot of what
42:36
like what they were like and followed
42:38
them for many years
42:39
and discovered that they never got angry
42:42
so
42:42
this was this and it was extraordinary
42:44
if anything went wrong they would stay
42:46
totally calm so
42:47
like there was a fishing line that took
42:48
days and days to braid
42:50
and it broke on first use and no one
42:52
flinches
42:53
they just say we'd better make a new one
42:55
now
42:56
but not like a creepy zombie like a
42:58
normal person
42:59
wow oh they do it through like is it
43:02
gritter teeth
43:03
no gritted teeth wow totally calm and
43:06
then one day
43:07
she was walking home and she saw a
43:09
mother and her
43:10
young son are saying and the son had a
43:12
rock in his hand and the mother was
43:13
saying throw him at me through that rock
43:15
at me go on throw that rock at me harder
43:16
and the sun was throwing rocks at her
43:18
and she realized that they act out plays
43:22
where they show children how to express
43:24
their anger
43:25
so and they show children exactly what
43:27
the consequences of their anger are so
43:28
in that situation she was acting out of
43:30
play the kid throwed a rock really hard
43:32
at his mum and his mum went ow that hurt
43:35
and then the child
43:36
learns it hurts if i throw a rock at my
43:38
mum
43:39
that wasn't a very good consequence
43:41
she's upset now
43:42
and this is how they did it and they act
43:44
out these plays constantly and that's
43:45
how
43:45
so they would never ever shout at their
43:47
children ever they find it bizarre
43:49
that that we would it's that that
43:52
requires
43:53
a lot of um knowledge of self and others
43:55
for the child
43:56
because you don't develop a clear idea
43:59
that
44:00
other people have feelings too for for
44:02
some years so
44:03
a more effective way was still
44:05
struggling right
44:06
um so wouldn't it be more effective
44:10
to throw a rock at yeah
44:14
the other throw a rock at the child yes
44:16
yeah yeah and then
44:17
good point you don't have children do
44:19
you have these i don't know
44:21
i thought that was where you were going
44:23
and i didn't know how to get you out of
44:24
it any more than you did
44:26
could it be that they were just training
44:28
themselves for an eventuality where we
44:30
all end up living on that planet that
44:31
rains rocks
44:32
all the time we're gonna have to move on
44:35
in a second to our final fact
44:36
oh um one thing they used to do with
44:38
these sleds we were talking about
44:40
is they would um tie all the bits
44:42
together
44:43
with uh something called walrus thung
44:46
and walrus thong
44:47
is a really really thin piece of rope
44:49
made from walrus skin
44:51
and according to anthropologist frilic
44:53
rainey it was the strongest
44:55
line known before the invention of the
44:57
steel cable
44:59
wow how amazing is that yeah they had
45:02
such incredible technology in the inuit
45:04
world um
45:05
they made armor out of walrus teeth and
45:08
so if they were attacked by animals they
45:10
wouldn't be able to get through these
45:11
walrus teeth armor or if your
45:13
bastard kid throws a rock at you one day
45:18
um i have another uh thong fact actually
45:21
yeah but it's the it is the other kind
45:23
of thong so
45:24
the greenland inuit they had a g-string
45:27
clothing a piece of clothing which is
45:29
called a natset and it's made of seal
45:31
fur
45:32
okay and it's pretty you know it's
45:34
pretty sexy um
45:36
it's strips of seal pelt but it's very
45:38
furry and it's threaded together with
45:40
whale sinews
45:41
and you would wear them under your
45:43
seal-skinned trousers
45:45
but it's not for uh romantic moments if
45:48
you've been looking in someone's eyes
45:50
for ages and ages
45:51
it's actually not for those moments it's
45:53
it's to where
45:54
uh if you had guests or if you were
45:56
going visiting other people you would
45:58
just turn up
45:59
in your uh g-string and danish
46:02
missionaries got quite
46:04
stressed about this when they visited
46:07
and made contact with the inuit here
46:09
and they tried to persuade them to wear
46:10
longer undergarments
46:12
that's amazing without success yeah yeah
46:15
oh i'd like to think that in the end the
46:16
danish missionaries adapted and they all
46:18
ended up wearing
46:20
well this is a really good reason for it
46:22
is because if you
46:23
uh sweat it's very dangerous actually to
46:25
sweat so your clothing needs to be able
46:27
to
46:27
expel uh heat and not let cold in
46:30
because if you sweat
46:31
it will freeze so the per the point of
46:34
the seal for
46:35
g-string is that you don't end up with
46:37
frozen sweat
46:38
trapped between your buttocks
46:42
well i'm sold i got one last thing the
46:46
um
46:46
we were just talking about how armor was
46:48
made out of teeth um
46:49
and i was thinking about how the fact
46:51
that the sleds you could eat a sled that
46:52
sounds really badass and i started
46:54
looking into that territory
46:55
found a guy from canada called francis
46:57
wharton and he lived away out in the
46:59
wilderness
47:00
and um in the 50s and 60s they're not
47:02
sure the exact year but
47:04
he shot a deer and he basically shot it
47:07
because he needed new dentures his teeth
47:08
had completely rotted and fallen out but
47:10
rather than to go get new dentures he
47:12
shot a deer
47:13
and he took its teeth out and he shaved
47:16
the teeth down
47:17
and he wore them as dentures and then he
47:19
ate that
47:20
deer that he shot with its own
47:24
teeth that's such a threat isn't it
47:27
i'm gonna eat you with your teeth that's
47:30
amazing
47:31
yeah so that's the way to scare a deer
47:38
it is time for our final fact of the
47:40
show and that
47:41
is james okay my fact this week
47:44
is that some bottled water in vienna
47:48
costs 9 000 euros per liter
47:51
yeah and this audience does not believe
47:53
me
47:55
um and yet it is true okay and i think
47:58
the reason the audience doesn't believe
47:59
me is because the
48:00
water in vienna is famously amazing and
48:04
so
48:06
well okay guys it's not that good and so
48:10
why would anyone buy bottled water in
48:12
vienna because the tap water is so good
48:14
but actually the reason is that there is
48:16
a thing called vienna standard
48:18
mean ocean water and it's used for
48:21
calibrating
48:22
instruments and it has a very specific
48:24
mix of isotopes
48:26
inside it so you know if you buy it it
48:28
will be exactly the same
48:29
every single time and you can use it for
48:32
all sorts of scientific reasons and it
48:35
is actually
48:35
20 times more expensive than inkjet
48:38
printer ink
48:39
wow and the reason it has the word
48:42
vienna in it is because
48:43
it was due to the international atomic
48:45
energy agency which is based in vienna
48:48
and that's where it was called that and
48:50
you have these things
48:51
that scientists use all the time they're
48:53
called standard reference materials
48:56
and if you're trying to measure anything
48:59
you really need a control you need a
49:00
standard
49:01
to put them against and this could be
49:04
literally anything so for instance
49:06
you can buy a jar of peanut butter for
49:09
761.
49:11
in america and the reason you're going
49:13
to buy that one is because it's a very
49:15
specific type of peanut butter
49:17
which is always going to be exactly the
49:19
same and if you want to measure how many
49:20
peanuts are in your peanut butter you
49:22
have to measure it against this one
49:24
wow yeah you can buy 15 grams of
49:27
specific turmeric for
49:29
and twenty dollars your grocery bill
49:32
james
49:32
it must be enormous but the lucky thing
49:36
is they always arrive between
49:37
400 octillion years
49:41
you could buy 40 grams of domestic
49:43
sludge for 715 dollars
49:46
so water is exactly what it sounds like
49:49
andy
49:50
what is the stuff that's come out of
49:52
your waste
49:53
of your toilet or your bathroom or
49:55
whatever but it's very specific so it
49:57
has exactly
49:58
that pretty much the average amount of
50:00
everything that a human
50:02
waste would have well like it's like
50:04
ratio number two to number one basically
50:07
yeah kind of it's got exactly the right
50:09
number of sweetcorn curdles
50:11
[Music]
50:11
[Laughter]
50:16
you can buy freeze-dried typical diet
50:19
for 912 and this is
50:22
basically i get the average american
50:25
diet of what americans
50:26
eat in a week and they squish it all
50:29
down
50:29
and they freeze dry it and you get in a
50:31
little package and you might want to use
50:33
it to
50:34
measure that against someone else's diet
50:37
for instance right
50:38
yeah and it's mostly for instruments and
50:39
things like that i was looking for other
50:41
expensive waters okay very expensive
50:43
kinds of water
50:44
so there's a hawaiian brand called uh
50:47
kona nigari and it comes from 2000 feet
50:51
under the ocean wow under the ocean
50:54
under the ocean
50:55
all right two thousand under two
50:56
thousand feet of ocean
50:58
it's two thousand feet deep in the ocean
51:01
oh boy
51:02
uh i've already got this wrong it's from
51:04
two thousand feet down
51:05
it's a specific sort of river flowing
51:07
within the ocean
51:08
so it's not salty i am not sure whether
51:11
or not it's salty it may be treated once
51:13
it's brought up
51:14
but it is it was discovered a while ago
51:16
because scientists wanted to use very
51:18
very cold water from the bottom uh
51:20
they and use the temperature difference
51:22
with surface water
51:23
they thought they could generate
51:24
electricity from this and power homes
51:26
they couldn't generate enough of that
51:28
but they had a source of this extra deep
51:30
water now
51:30
so they started just selling it as magic
51:32
bottled water
51:34
and you know it's supposedly free from
51:36
all pollution and contamination
51:38
it's got lots of seaweed minerals in it
51:40
it costs four hundred dollars
51:41
for 750 mils it's expensive they sell it
51:45
to athletes on the promise that
51:47
it helps you rehydrate twice as fast
51:50
after exercise
51:51
okay it does it well
51:54
the the the main study i think that it's
51:57
based on is a study which shows that
51:59
gerbils do better on treadmills when fed
52:03
this water and hamsters on surfboards
52:05
[Laughter]
52:07
so some scientists are a bit skeptical
52:10
because it appears that the gerbils run
52:12
better and
52:13
rehydrate faster but okay it sounds like
52:16
nonsense doesn't it but maybe it's true
52:20
because if you eat if you eat super pure
52:22
water or if you drink it
52:23
like ultra pure water then that really
52:26
is bad
52:26
so there are four types of water
52:28
classification i think in science and we
52:29
drink the really gross one
52:31
which is the only one that we can
52:32
actually stomach which is i think it's
52:33
called feeder water
52:35
and then the top one is ultra pure water
52:38
and that's
52:39
the well that's when it's gone through a
52:41
series of processes which basically
52:42
means
52:43
it has absolutely nothing in it no
52:46
minerals
52:46
nothing except hydrogen and oxygen and
52:49
if you drank ultra pure water
52:51
then it would start leaching all of the
52:53
minerals out of your body and sort of
52:55
dissolve everything because
52:56
it's because water's the the universal
52:59
solvent you learn at school
53:00
and so it literally dissolves everything
53:03
and so if that goes through your system
53:05
you're just a big you know well you're a
53:07
big solution
53:11
i found a really expensive bottle of
53:13
water
53:14
which is the water that goes up to the
53:17
international space station
53:19
which is approximately ten thousand
53:21
dollars american
53:22
per bottle of water when you have to
53:25
consider
53:26
the fuel costs to get it to space yeah
53:29
but that's roughly they broke it down
53:31
uh someone did a calculation that's
53:32
roughly what it costs and which is it's
53:34
why it's
53:35
such a thing where they're trying to
53:36
work out how you can turn
53:38
water or urine and so on that's that's
53:40
being
53:41
water being drunk and then the urine
53:42
coming out back into water and create
53:43
that cycle so
53:44
they use everything on the iss that
53:46
emits any kind of moisture
53:48
feeding it back into trying to turn it
53:50
into water do they drink their own urine
53:52
on the iss
53:53
they do they drink rat urine as well
53:55
there's rats in the iss
53:56
that um they recently converted some of
53:59
the urine so
54:00
i think it's 74 rats having a p that is
54:03
equivalent to one human p
54:04
so they need to they need to really be
54:06
going for it um
54:08
but yeah that's that's a problem up
54:10
there so but that's how much it costs to
54:11
get up there
54:12
that's very expensive listen there is um
54:14
there's a type of water you can buy in
54:15
japan
54:16
uh which is very specifically intended
54:19
to be used
54:20
in an emergency so obviously they have a
54:22
lot of earthquakes and things
54:24
and tsunamis and things in japan
54:25
compared to the rest of the world and so
54:27
they sell this specific water
54:29
for an emergency and it's called zai
54:31
ho's
54:32
emergency supply of water and it says on
54:34
the bottle that it's safe to drink
54:36
even after five years and it has one
54:39
more slogan
54:40
which is this is water from 30 000 years
54:43
ago
54:44
[Laughter]
54:45
wow so so they've taken it out 30 000
54:48
after 30 000 years
54:49
just before it goes back
54:53
that's the expiry date of order amazing
54:55
um we're going to have to wrap up
54:56
soon um i've got a thing on a weird
54:59
measurement
55:00
um so this is this was about scientific
55:02
um
55:03
what would the word be the standards yes
55:05
standards exactly um i found a standard
55:08
which is
55:08
not used in everyday life but it
55:10
certainly is used
55:12
near boston there was a guy called
55:14
oliver r smoot and he was the chairman
55:17
of the american national standards
55:18
institute
55:19
and the president of the international
55:21
organization for standardization this
55:22
was his whole world
55:23
and there's a unit of measurement that
55:25
is named after him called the smoot
55:27
and the smoot is the length of him which
55:30
is five feet
55:31
seven inches um and it's to measure
55:34
a specific bridge the harvard bridge um
55:38
so we know that it is 364.4
55:41
smooths and that is how they know
55:44
uh and when you go across this bridge it
55:46
has how many smooths you've walked
55:48
across
55:49
and in order to do it they laid him down
55:52
yeah they did so he laid down he got up
55:54
he laid down he got up he laid down then
55:56
he got tired so they started picking him
55:58
up and moving him to where the edge of
55:59
his head is
56:00
but the police over there use smoots
56:02
when an accident happens on the bridge
56:04
they'll say it's 160 smooths in on the
56:07
bridge so it's an official standard
56:09
you know what they should have done is
56:10
they should have a tape measure measured
56:11
him once
56:12
and then he could have gone home for the
56:14
rest of the day
56:16
morons
56:19
i got one more measurement yeah so you
56:22
can measure
56:22
what is the most livable city on the
56:25
planet
56:29
and that is the city of gratz
56:33
castle well i've lost the entire
56:37
audience but apart from
56:38
apart from one man in the front row no
56:41
of course vienna has the world record
56:44
the guinness world record as the most
56:46
livable city on the planet
56:47
and the way that they measure it is
56:49
there's loads of different um
56:50
subjects and each one is out of 100
56:54
and vienna got 100 in every single
56:57
category
56:58
apart from culture
57:02
okay
57:02
[Applause]
57:03
[Laughter]
57:05
now this didn't happen i've been walking
57:08
around absolute
57:09
desert out there
57:12
i thought to be fair they got like 95 in
57:15
cultural 96
57:16
but i thought i would look into some
57:18
culture in vienna uh in the guinness
57:20
world records um website
57:22
and i found the only other record i
57:23
could find is that vienna holds a world
57:26
record for the world's longest twerk
57:30
and that was two hours and one minute
57:34
wow wow that's the bum dance that's
57:36
that's where you're wobbling your bum
57:38
and i like to think that elena stellini
57:40
i like to think she was aiming for two
57:42
hours and it took an extra minute for it
57:43
to stop wobbling
57:47
um okay that's it let's wrap up okay
57:50
that is it that is all of our facts

[Music]
01:22
okay i'm with the podcast guys
01:28
i'm with the son of god
01:52
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:56
no such thing as a fish
01:57
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
02:00
live from birmingham
02:08
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
02:10
here with anna chazinski andrew hunt of
02:12
murray and james harkin
02:14
and once again we have gathered around
02:15
the microphones this time with our four
02:17
favorite christmas facts from the last
02:20
seven days
02:21
and in no particular order here we go
02:25
starting with you andy my fact is that
02:28
in 1958 the queen's speech was lost
02:32
on the day of delivery and then found by
02:35
a nearby
02:36
poodle it's a heartwarming christmas
02:39
story
02:40
for the people what it says to me is
02:42
that the corgis are really [ __ ] at fun
02:44
yeah that's true um this just this was
02:48
in 1958 so obviously she hadn't done
02:50
many of these speeches before pretty
02:52
nerve-wracking still live delivery
02:54
and one of the most important copies of
02:55
the speech one with all the producers
02:57
notes on it was lost
02:58
and uh and then found by a poodle so
03:01
what was the poodle doing
03:03
that i thought security was quite tight
03:04
around the queen i think it was not
03:06
by the queen so if it i mean she would
03:09
have found it if it would have been
03:10
next to her yeah it must have been near
03:13
the queen
03:13
i think it was at a nearby train station
03:15
what so this poodle has no involvement
03:18
in the story
03:19
no he's the main protagonist in the
03:20
story i don't know if you heard the
03:22
story
03:23
yeah sorry no so what i mean is it's not
03:24
like the poodle was in buckingham palace
03:26
going
03:26
lost script i'm on it no no they didn't
03:29
summon it in to
03:30
find the script he was brought in to
03:33
find them no no they didn't summon it
03:34
into
03:35
jesus you don't say i've lost a script
03:39
somewhere in the united kingdom i need
03:41
one poodle the poodle at a train station
03:45
noticed a bag there was a bag and poodle
03:47
went over and explored it i
03:49
i can't remember the name of the poodle
03:50
i think i wrote it how did he know it
03:51
was the queen's speech
03:53
well he
03:56
did a sort of series of mimes to his
03:59
master
04:01
um the owner of the poodle was a guy
04:03
called john harvey who then took it to
04:04
the police the queen's speech was saved
04:07
and um and things just carried on as
04:09
normal right
04:11
thank god because where would we have
04:12
been without that speech right
04:14
right everyone remembers in 1958 right
04:18
i remember the 1959 speech and when i
04:20
say remember i'm not that old
04:22
but i can tell you about the 1959 speech
04:25
because it was the first speech that had
04:26
a joke in it as far as i can see because
04:29
i read through the early ones
04:30
and this one the queen said she
04:32
explained all the places that what they
04:34
were going
04:34
all these new countries in the
04:35
commonwealth and she said so between us
04:38
we are going to many parts of the world
04:40
we have no plans for space travel at the
04:43
moment
04:45
i mean i'm not saying it's a great joke
04:46
[Laughter]
04:48
it passes our bar for joke but i'm not
04:50
sure if it passes many people's
04:52
it was a good one in 1957 um like
04:56
classic in 1957 i would say
04:58
it was again it was still live and the
05:00
queen was doing her speech in mid-speech
05:02
um the there was interference in the
05:04
signal for the speech itself on tv so
05:07
while people were watching
05:09
suddenly they could hear american police
05:11
officers
05:12
coming over in place of the queen
05:14
speaking and the line that was heard
05:16
most by most people was
05:17
joe i'm gonna go grab a quick coffee
05:19
that was suddenly just in the middle of
05:21
the queen's speech
05:22
in 1957 some of them they
05:26
they put them out on telly but there was
05:27
no picture yeah i think between 1952 and
05:30
1957
05:31
they realized they had television now
05:32
and so they broadcast it on tv but
05:34
she didn't have her makeup done or
05:35
something so because the first tv
05:37
broadcast was 57 wasn't it where you
05:39
could actually see her
05:40
but before that you could just listen to
05:42
her but watching a black tv screen
05:45
wow but wait a minute so people might
05:47
not have really known much about the
05:48
queen what she looked like and
05:50
stuff like that so when they heard
05:52
someone saying joe i'm going to get a
05:53
coffee
05:54
did they maybe think it was the queen
05:56
doing that i think
05:57
i think from all the money they knew
06:00
what she looked like
06:01
[Laughter]
06:05
yeah um okay here's a challenge for you
06:09
can you guys guess one thing that she
06:11
never does while she is recording the
06:13
speech burlesque
06:17
that's fair that's technically the
06:19
correct correct it's a correct answer
06:22
i've never seen her stuffing a turkey
06:24
yes
06:25
this andy you've got to reframe the
06:26
question for a long time
06:28
she never takes a wee she never stands
06:30
on her head
06:31
she doesn't smile in a
06:35
genuine way she does a kind of queen
06:37
smile
06:38
she doesn't do this sort of big friendly
06:40
smile
06:41
um she has a kind of control
06:45
controlled smile she's got a queen smile
06:46
that's cool yeah but there is
06:48
there was a time where the sound man
06:50
decided oh she's got such a nice smile
06:52
i've got to see if i can make her
06:53
smile during a thing so he attached a
06:55
sign saying smile
06:57
to the camera boom arm and he put a
07:00
sprig of holly and some tinsel next to
07:01
it
07:02
and she saw it and she immediately
07:03
frowned
07:04
[Laughter]
07:07
and he was the last victim of capital
07:09
punishment in this country
07:11
i discovered while reading about the
07:13
queen's christmas broadcast said she is
07:15
a podcast pioneer
07:18
is she yeah her the queen's speech was
07:20
released as a podcast in 2006.
07:23
wow wow we started in 2014
07:26
like that's how distant it is and it's
07:28
um
07:29
i haven't heard it um but i assume it's
07:31
the same as the speech but yeah
07:33
it's maybe if it was slightly you know
07:35
she could have done a podcast slant
07:37
one's father wrote a porno
07:41
queen speech stop the queen's speech
07:44
hello
07:44
we're sponsored this week
07:48
by the royal mint
07:51
by all of you
07:55
of course before the queen's speech was
07:56
the green speech it was a king speech
07:58
right so um it started i think the first
08:00
one was 1932
08:02
although it only became a yearly thing
08:03
in 39 and
08:05
uh 1932 they actually so john reese who
08:08
was general manager of the bbc
08:09
at the time have been trying to persuade
08:11
king george v to do a king's speech
08:13
for years and he really didn't want to
08:15
he was sweetly shy and nervous and
08:17
thought he wasn't a very good speaker
08:18
and
08:19
was a technophobe so didn't really
08:20
understand this newfangled radio thing
08:22
and he finally was persuaded to do it
08:25
when it turned out that roger kipling
08:26
was going to write it for him and then
08:28
he thought okay well that sounds good
08:29
he wrote it for him yeah he wrote the
08:31
speech for him jungle book guy
08:33
jungle book guy as some people know him
08:36
better what a speech the bare
08:38
necessities
08:45
he wrote some other stuff as well okay
08:47
cool yeah so it was one of those other
08:48
things
08:49
but apparently king george um from his
08:52
naval days i read felt most comfortable
08:54
in small rooms
08:55
and so he even though they made a fake
08:57
recording studio which was one of the
08:59
grand rooms
09:00
in the palace he actually recorded it in
09:02
a box room under the stairs at
09:04
sandringham house
09:05
and um yeah harry potter like it was
09:07
like harry potter yeah
09:09
his hand was shaking if you listen to it
09:11
you can hear the paper rustling because
09:12
his hand was shaking so much wow
09:14
and he said it ruined his christmas oh
09:17
guess who uh produced the can you see
09:20
i've got another christmas challenge for
09:22
you yeah see if you can guess who
09:24
produced
09:24
the messages between 1986 and 1991 was
09:27
it
09:28
dita von t's oh yeah
09:31
i wish i hadn't got you that book about
09:34
burlesque
09:36
uh no it was not deandra fronties uh so
09:39
produce a bbc producer yeah but also a
09:41
friend of the queens
09:42
friend of the queens oh david
09:45
attenborough
09:46
david attenborough great fact
09:51
it's just not his normal thing is it you
09:53
know but he was was he the guy
09:55
he was quite a famous producer before he
09:57
did his other he was in the 60s
09:58
is he the guy who i might get this wrong
10:01
but is he the guy who decided to put
10:02
snooker on television to sell color tvs
10:05
yes yes yeah yeah it was when he was a
10:08
controller of bbc one i think
10:09
then he said to sell color tv can i say
10:11
that's just a tiny bit worse than me
10:13
saying is that the jungle book guy
10:14
to say david attenborough is he the
10:16
snooker guy
10:19
well coming from you the queen is that
10:22
the woman after money
10:22
[Laughter]
10:25
oh why do we always argue at christmas
10:28
um some more stuff about tv and movies
10:31
around christmas
10:33
so there were four flintstones christmas
10:35
specials
10:36
which how exactly they celebrate
10:38
christ's birth i don't really know
10:39
oh yeah yeah they were pioneers
10:43
[Laughter]
10:44
uh there was a or there is a youtuber
10:47
called jake roper
10:48
and he decided to look at that classic
10:51
christmas
10:51
um movie home alone oh yeah uh and he
10:55
found out that he looked at all the
10:56
tricks that kevin played on
10:58
on the burglars and found out what would
10:59
happen in real life
11:01
um so apparently shame on me i haven't
11:03
seen this movie but i believe this is
11:05
what happened
11:06
i know james that's a better fact than
11:09
whatever you're about to tell us
11:12
so apparently at one stage he um heats
11:15
up a doorknob correct and they burn
11:17
their hand
11:18
and apparently the temperatures needed
11:19
to transfer enough heat to the outside
11:21
knob would have melted the door or set
11:23
the house on fire
11:26
but there is a crowbar that goes to the
11:28
chest of one of the burglars oh yeah um
11:30
that would have punctured his lungs and
11:31
his heart
11:33
um but it wouldn't matter because kevin
11:34
would have already murdered both of them
11:36
with the paint can trap
11:39
apparently the force of those paint cans
11:41
would have killed
11:42
both of them that would be a very
11:43
different movie yes
11:46
how do you know you don't know i'm
11:49
assuming
11:50
maybe they both die it is weird it's
11:52
like watching you read a foreign
11:53
language where you don't understand it
11:54
you obviously don't quite know what
11:56
it is what this is in reference to at
11:58
all look i read the synopsis on
11:59
wikipedia
12:01
do you know there's such a weird thing
12:03
about home alone so joe pesci who was
12:05
the
12:05
um bad guy who's not an idiot uh he
12:08
obviously was more used to doing kind of
12:09
gangster films he's in quite a lot of
12:10
serious gangster films and i think he
12:12
might have thought this is a similar
12:13
thing so we went really method in home
12:15
alone
12:16
so on on the set of home alone he
12:19
refused to see macaulay culkin at all
12:21
because he wanted macaulay to be really
12:22
really terrified of him so you know he
12:24
didn't want to kill the magic of him
12:25
being this bad guy
12:26
and um in the scene where which you may
12:29
remember and i do remember and james
12:30
doesn't remember where
12:32
he's he's hung up on a coat hook at one
12:34
point
12:35
by his coat um and joe petty says to him
12:37
i'm gonna bite all your fingers off
12:39
one at a time and in one of the
12:41
rehearsals he actually
12:42
bit cool kin really really hard and drew
12:45
blood and he still has a scar
12:48
really really yeah apparently this
12:50
little nine-year-old boy had to do a
12:51
screaming fit and be like i don't care
12:53
how many oscars you've got don't go
12:54
around biting nine-year-olds
12:58
that's apparently in um e.t when they
13:00
were filming it steven spielberg needed
13:02
drew barrymore to cry during a scene
13:04
there's a scene where she really sobs
13:05
right
13:06
and the behind the scenes of it is that
13:07
apparently before the take was done
13:09
steven spielberg leaned into her going
13:11
uh it's going to be a good scene
13:12
um you know you'll be great you'll be
13:14
great by the way your dog just died
13:16
and then walked back and she burst out
13:18
crying and that's her genuinely crying
13:20
wow anyway merry christmas
13:23
[Music]
13:27
we need to move on to our next fact uh
13:29
time for fact number two and that
13:31
is chozinski my fact this week is that
13:34
as well as being the birthplace of jesus
13:37
bethlehem is also where we found the
13:39
oldest known depiction of people having
13:41
sex
13:44
yeah which is very that's very ironic
13:48
because famously that was a sex-free
13:52
zone oh yeah
13:53
yeah i don't think it was a sex-free
13:55
zone it was just
13:57
they hadn't two people of many people
13:59
hadn't had sex right yeah yeah
14:01
it is related to non-sex they mary and
14:04
joseph didn't have access to this
14:05
piece of art otherwise they would have
14:07
known but they didn't have instructions
14:09
yeah so yeah i think this is such a
14:12
weird coincidence this is
14:14
really quite a beautiful piece of art
14:16
it's made of calcite it's
14:17
from 11 000 years ago so it's a stone
14:19
aged piece of art and it's kind of
14:21
this couple of androgynous humans sort
14:24
of inside i don't know how sex works
14:26
when they're that androgynous but um
14:27
sort of intertwined
14:28
like legs legs over each other look it
14:30
up it's very nice
14:31
um face to face so the traditional way
14:35
and um
14:36
[Laughter]
14:39
sure you've got to specify but not
14:42
missionary i would say
14:44
well when you look at it it's quite hard
14:45
to tell if it was meant to be upright or
14:47
horizontal
14:48
so that's sort of in the eye of the
14:50
beholder
14:52
anyway i'm really looking forward to
14:54
your bbc4 documentary on the history of
14:56
uh so
14:58
this it is when i first looked at it i
15:01
thought it just looked like a rock
15:03
okay i maybe i'm just not into my art as
15:05
much as anna is
15:06
it doesn't look like a rock it looks
15:08
like two people gloriously intertwined
15:10
sure okay but according to artist mark
15:13
quinn
15:14
depending on the perspective and how you
15:15
look at it it also resembles
15:18
a penis breasts or a vagina
15:21
depending on which way you kind of move
15:23
it around so it's like a bit of trick
15:25
art
15:25
oh cool it is it is very cool that
15:28
that's because if you put it if you put
15:29
it sort of sideways onto you
15:31
said it's widest it looks like the
15:32
couple one next to each other and then
15:33
if you move it so it's sort of end on
15:35
it looks like a penis and then on the
15:38
base there's a cheeky vagina so it's a
15:40
it's a very
15:41
it is amazing it's a three for the price
15:44
of one isn't it
15:45
yeah it's basically your pawn hub of um
15:48
10 000 years ago yeah because you could
15:50
just search for any of three things
15:52
and then you would get it anyway so it
15:54
was found in the 1930s
15:57
by some bedouin shepherd boys and
15:59
obviously it's now in the british museum
16:04
um it's quite nice that it was shepherds
16:06
that's cool
16:07
isn't it just watching their flock right
16:09
yeah
16:10
no because it's not while shepherds
16:11
looked at their horny rock by night
16:16
is that a star in the sky doesn't matter
16:18
keep looking at the rock
16:21
we have no evidence they got any kind of
16:23
arousal out of it they just
16:25
they found it and then they gave it to
16:26
an archaeologist it's in an area just
16:28
sort of within a few miles of bethlehem
16:29
called ein sakri
16:31
and it's in a cave and yeah made by the
16:34
natufians
16:35
who were they're called a sedentary
16:38
people
16:38
which isn't as insulting as it sounds it
16:40
just means that
16:41
they were not nomadic very unusually for
16:44
that time they
16:45
they weren't nomadic they thought they
16:46
were my favorite group of people from
16:47
history than the
16:49
really are they yeah because they're the
16:50
first example we have
16:52
of anyone who domesticated the dog
16:54
they're the first examples we have of a
16:55
big feast
16:56
they were the first example we have of
16:58
beer it might be just people are looking
17:00
in that place
17:02
but i think they sound like a really
17:04
cool you know bunch of people
17:06
the first known beer i think is that
17:08
it's from 13 000 years
17:10
bp which is not a petrol reference but
17:14
so i didn't know about this phrase but
17:16
it stands for before present and i don't
17:18
know why we need it when we have
17:19
bc but uh so it's 13 000 years bp
17:23
so i guess about 11 000 years bc and
17:25
when do you think before present
17:27
um is sort of starts from this well just
17:30
when you said it a few seconds
17:32
but not anymore now it's now and so and
17:35
so forth
17:35
is it is it not that i'm gonna have to
17:37
say your first answer um
17:38
and it's not it's 1950.
17:42
okay puma
17:47
that's not what archaeologists just
17:48
decided the present is 1950.
17:51
that is so easy is it because some
17:54
people think
17:55
it's like where there was atomic bombs
17:57
it's exactly that because of it and so
17:59
then any rocks from then on have some
18:01
kind of radioactivity so you can't use
18:03
carbon data
18:04
exactly everything's kind of screwed up
18:05
after 1950 because of all the nuclear
18:07
[ __ ]
18:08
as you say um there's a theory that it's
18:11
the other bethlehem that is this is the
18:13
bethlehem that we have where there is a
18:14
church and a cave and
18:16
all all the um tourism what do you mean
18:19
another bethlehem there's one in wales
18:20
for instance
18:21
it's not that one i know there's one in
18:22
pennsylvania it's not that one uh
18:23
there's one
18:24
in the galilee and an israeli
18:26
archaeologist has said that although
18:28
there probably won't be any proof due to
18:30
modern building work
18:31
um a lot of jesus's life happened near
18:33
the other galilee
18:35
or near the galilee so it and also that
18:37
one is only a few hours of a walk from
18:39
nazareth
18:39
which is where mary and joseph
18:41
traditionally came from
18:43
so it's more reasonable that a pregnant
18:45
heavily pregnant woman would have walked
18:47
for a few hours but did they say that
18:49
they spent like
18:50
weeks in the desert walking from one
18:52
place to the other they must have got
18:53
really lost if it's this one right next
18:54
it's true
18:55
that's the thing they didn't though
18:57
that's the weird thing so the um
18:59
nativity the birth of jesus is only
19:00
mentioned in two of the gospels anyway
19:02
luke and matthew
19:03
um and it's only in luke that they make
19:05
the journey so in matthew they're
19:06
already living in bethlehem
19:08
and even in matthew this is the extent
19:10
of the whole journey that we have the
19:12
impression of the donkey and the long
19:13
trip
19:13
he just says you know it was for a
19:16
census
19:16
so um they both confirmed that they were
19:18
going to bethlehem for a census and they
19:20
sort of happened to have a child while
19:21
they were there
19:22
but it went joseph went to be registered
19:24
with mary who was expecting a child
19:26
while they were there she gave birth and
19:28
wrapped him in bounds of cloth and laid
19:29
him in a manger because there was no
19:30
place for him in the inn
19:32
and that's it that's all we have and all
19:33
the other stuff is from later the donkey
19:35
the long journey
19:36
the cave it all comes from the
19:38
proto-gospel of james wait you didn't
19:40
say the keg did you
19:42
the cave of the caves they cracked open
19:45
a keg and a whale of a time
19:48
traditional english christmases used to
19:50
have a mince pie in the shape of a
19:52
manger
19:53
and you would put a little christ child
19:55
doll
19:56
in the pie but it's not in the pot sorry
19:58
not in the pie
19:59
on the pie on the pie which was sort of
20:01
shaped like a mango like a kind of
20:03
trough
20:04
and then uh you would put the christ
20:05
child and then at dinner time you would
20:07
eat the pie
20:07
so sorry did you eat the jesus no you
20:09
didn't eat the jesus the jesus i think
20:11
was an
20:11
annual decoration to be cut out every
20:13
year the pie was just the pie was the
20:15
edible bit he's complaining to the
20:17
waiter wait a waiter there's a jesus in
20:20
my party
20:22
and what comes next is there an ending
20:25
to that joke
20:26
are you joking with the fly yeah you are
20:28
but no i'm not what's the end to the fly
20:30
joke
20:30
oh my god is should we sit together
20:34
there's a flower in my soup don't talk
20:35
too loud everyone i want one
20:38
that's that's
20:41
that's dated um
20:44
it's the way we told it um do you guys
20:47
know where the
20:48
animals come from in the nativity you
20:49
know where you usually have an ox and a
20:51
kind of a
20:52
documentary so they're not mentioned in
20:53
the bible either they're not mentioned
20:55
in the bible but they come from the
20:58
gospel of pseudo-matthew who appeared in
21:01
the 8th century
21:02
and claimed that he sort of remembered
21:03
all this stuff um no he so pseudo
21:05
matthew wrote the gospel which is where
21:06
we get a lot of relativity ideas
21:08
and he introduced the stable where jesus
21:10
was born and adds an
21:11
ox and an ass but he also added to the
21:14
scene
21:15
uh lions leopards and dragons
21:19
no that's so cool yep that's correct if
21:21
you want to do the nativity properly
21:23
if you're having an ox you might as well
21:24
have a lion a leopard and a dragon
21:26
he said they were all whacking their
21:27
tails to show their devotion
21:31
have we spoken about nativity thefts i
21:33
can't remember if we've ever talked
21:34
about it before
21:35
people stealing nativity scenes yeah it
21:37
is and it's
21:38
so there's been a huge rash of this uh
21:40
in lots of places in the last few years
21:42
so there is another bethlehem in
21:44
pennsylvania and
21:45
there a woman stole the crib in 2016
21:49
and it you know it broke a bit and the
21:51
chief of police had to glue baby jesus's
21:53
leg back on it was very
21:55
you know embarrassing so they had to put
21:56
a security camera solely on the baby
21:58
jesus when they
21:59
uh reinstalled it but this keeps
22:01
happening so
22:02
uh there's a place in wisconsin called
22:04
west bend where
22:06
2017 jesus was stolen then they found it
22:09
they replaced the jesus
22:10
then on christmas eve it was stolen
22:12
again the baby jesus
22:14
and um there was a police officer who
22:16
saw a woman suspiciously cradling
22:18
something
22:18
i don't know how you do that um
22:22
and there was the replacement baby jesus
22:23
they put back in and the officer yelled
22:24
police stop
22:25
and she dropped the jesus and pegged it
22:27
so now
22:28
in west bend everything is bolted
22:30
literally everything is bolted down
22:32
the baby jesus is plastered to the
22:34
manger
22:36
and there is a camera which has hunting
22:38
technology where when someone leans in
22:40
for a closer look a motion
22:41
uh activated trail camera kicks in and
22:44
starts recording their every move
22:46
um we need to move on in a sec to our
22:48
next fact we could talk about some
22:50
erotic art oh okay yeah yeah sure well i
22:53
just wanted to
22:54
quickly imagine the a very another very
22:56
old piece of art which is
22:57
all the um statues of this egyptian god
23:00
called min
23:01
who i didn't know existed but he was the
23:02
god of fertility and you see um little
23:04
sculptures of him from around the 4th
23:06
millennium bc
23:08
so bloody long time ago and he has a
23:10
very close association with lettuce
23:12
and that is because so he's all if you
23:14
look at him he's always seen standing
23:16
with a very erect
23:17
very long penis which is cradling in his
23:20
left hand i think
23:21
um and then he's associated with lettuce
23:23
suspiciously cradling
23:25
[Laughter]
23:28
that's how you always suspiciously
23:30
cradle something if it's a penis it is
23:31
always i don't think that's how she was
23:33
created like the baby jesus though was
23:34
it no
23:35
no it was not i'm sure uh but yeah he
23:37
was the god of fertility and
23:39
associated with lettuce and it was
23:40
thought the lettuce was the most
23:42
aphrodisiacal food stuff because it
23:44
looks like a penis but also if you break
23:46
a leaf off a lettuce it oozes kind of
23:48
white substance
23:49
and so this was really revered sorry i
23:51
must say that these are old lettuces
23:53
that you would get in ancient egypt
23:54
if you go to sainsbury's and get an
23:56
iceberg
23:57
one it doesn't look like a penis and two
24:00
it doesn't ooze white liquid
24:01
it looks a tiny bit does that remain
24:03
long romaine
24:05
long phallic thing but yeah it looks
24:06
less like a penis and doesn't do the
24:07
oozing
24:08
wait a waiter there's a penis in my
24:10
lettuce
24:10
[Laughter]
24:12
that one actually doesn't have an ending
24:16
sorry can i say one last thing about
24:17
nativities sorry it's just there was a
24:19
nativity set available on amazon i've
24:20
read a lot of reviews of nativity sets
24:22
that you can buy for yourself
24:24
and there is one set that is available
24:26
on amazon
24:27
for three pound 69 so this is a very you
24:30
know
24:31
cost reasonably priced reasonably priced
24:34
nativity set
24:35
and the main review for it says this
24:37
bearing in mind the price i did not
24:38
expect a work of art
24:40
but i did hope for something tasteful
24:42
the three figurines were tatty and badly
24:44
painted
24:44
joseph had white paint splattered all
24:46
over his cloak and down his staff
24:48
the bit the bit notes are you sure that
24:51
wasn't lettuce juice
24:54
it gets like this not everybody gets
24:56
what the beer the beard on the right
24:58
side of his face was higher than the
24:59
left
25:00
and covered his whole nose mary's
25:03
paintwork was even tattier she has two
25:05
left hands
25:07
baby jesus has a right eye that is twice
25:10
the size of his left eye
25:12
and his mouth is on the right side of
25:14
his face
25:16
so it is an optimism and there was no
25:18
dragon
25:18
[Laughter]
25:22
uh we need to move on to our next fact
25:24
okay it is time for fact number three
25:27
and that is my fact my fact this week is
25:30
the most likely time in the year to have
25:32
a heart attack
25:33
is during a family christmas gathering
25:36
uh this is absolutely true this was this
25:38
was research that was done in sweden
25:40
they looked at data of 283 000 heart
25:43
attacks that took place in the country
25:44
between 1998 and 2013 and they found
25:48
that at 10 p.m
25:49
on december the 24th which is when the
25:51
swedes celebrate
25:52
that's when the christmas gatherings
25:53
happen um that that's when it was most
25:55
likely to happen
25:56
37 more likely to happen on christmas
25:59
eve than
26:00
um you know say 20 on new year's day or
26:02
any other period of the year
26:04
wow yeah it's really good and they got
26:06
this information from
26:07
a database they have of 283 0014 heart
26:11
attacks
26:12
and the database is called swedheart
26:18
that's sweet or something that ruins
26:20
lives
26:22
do we know what is they think it's due
26:24
to is it due to christmas arguments it's
26:25
due to
26:25
arguments stress of did i get the right
26:27
present um i've got all the family here
26:30
we're we're suddenly you know we've got
26:32
uncles and aunties and children who
26:34
don't usually hang in one room
26:35
necessarily or when they do
26:37
you say it's due to obviously we don't
26:38
know why it is but this is we're
26:40
speculating that it's because of that it
26:41
wasn't like they interviewed everyone
26:42
mid heart attack and said what is it
26:44
that you think has caused this and they
26:45
said well my wife is being a real [ __ ]
26:46
in the kitchen
26:47
yeah yeah because people thought that it
26:49
was the cold quite a lot
26:51
um but then they did a similar study in
26:53
the southern hemisphere and found
26:54
quite similar results i think didn't
26:56
they yeah i think it's monopoly
26:58
um have you seen this about monopoly
27:01
this year they've released the longest
27:02
ever game of monopoly
27:04
really yeah oh because they're always
27:06
doing new additions
27:07
yeah so the newest addition they have um
27:10
66
27:10
properties that you can get instead of
27:12
28
27:14
there are 40 extra spaces but you only
27:16
have one dice so it takes you way longer
27:18
to get between each one and the game
27:20
carries on
27:21
until one player has absolutely
27:23
everything on the board
27:25
so you keep going into more and more and
27:26
more debt and basically you just keep
27:29
going
27:29
forever until one person wins all the
27:31
money that's good isn't it because
27:32
that's what i've always said about
27:33
monopoly is that it's just over too
27:34
fast
27:38
actually in 2016 hasbro ran they're very
27:40
good at pr stuff they ran a monopoly
27:42
help line from the 24th to the 26th of
27:44
december
27:45
to stop does literally because they said
27:46
all people always argue while playing
27:48
this dreadful board game of ours
27:50
yeah yeah and the idea was the person at
27:53
the end of the hotline wouldn't solve
27:55
this sort of like family dynamic
27:56
argument it would be i will tell you
27:58
what the official rule
28:00
that you are disputing because that's
28:01
that's the main thing that so
28:03
um there would be people so people in
28:05
the in the list of why people would call
28:07
would be
28:08
why the arguments happen um free parking
28:10
no one really knows officially what the
28:12
rules are and that would be a big thing
28:14
that they would argue about
28:15
um and then it would be stuff like
28:17
people taking too long to take their
28:18
turn
28:19
someone buying a property that you want
28:21
when they definitely didn't need it
28:23
but on the top of the list it was people
28:25
i know it's allowed best part of the
28:26
game
28:27
exactly well this is this is why your
28:30
attitude is
28:31
causing and uh yeah the top being people
28:34
being too cocky when winning
28:36
uh so this is just a helpline people who
28:39
can't be asked to read the instructions
28:41
which are all of four pages long
28:43
is that what we're saying yes right just
28:45
checking
28:46
who this was targeting there are
28:47
theories about why people argue
28:49
actual psychological theories about why
28:51
people argue over christmas and one
28:52
theory that i really like is that there
28:54
are things which are social allergens
28:56
so you're not allergic the first time
28:59
someone makes a tiresome
29:00
joke uh to you over christmas but by the
29:03
fourth or fifth time you're having a
29:05
very much stronger reaction even if it's
29:07
someone completely different making that
29:08
joke again
29:10
i don't know that don't talk too loud
29:11
everyone will want one that never gets
29:13
old
29:15
um there was uh also there was a study
29:17
done recently which asked people their
29:19
main reasons for
29:20
post-christmas grumpiness so people get
29:23
very depressed in january
29:25
it's sort of kind of depressing things
29:27
like suicides go up but on
29:29
new year's day is the biggest day for
29:31
suicide but happily christmas day is the
29:33
smallest day for suicide
29:34
so people hang on um but people get
29:36
upset
29:37
in january and can i just apologize for
29:40
my fact i've never
29:44
i believe i did this to us tonight it's
29:46
it's a depressing fact no the
29:47
main reason people get upset after
29:49
christmas apparently is because
29:50
uh there were a list of 20 one of them
29:53
was our house is full of christmas
29:54
presents and i don't want most of them
29:57
which extremely ungrateful apparently
30:00
children become a complete nightmare
30:01
because they get used to the indulgence
30:03
of christmas which i don't know
30:04
if that's true but they become
30:06
terrorists basically
30:07
and then people cited chocolate
30:11
withdrawal symptoms
30:13
that's not real top 20
30:16
why i'm grumpy in january medical
30:19
chocolate withdrawal one bad thing that
30:21
in the olden days would happen just
30:23
after christmas
30:24
um in the 1600s in wales they had a
30:27
tradition
30:28
where you would beat up the last person
30:29
to get out of bed on boxing
30:35
bring day back and is that why it's
30:38
boxing day
30:43
they would also around the same time
30:45
they would throw food at the wall
30:47
on christmas day and whatever it's
30:49
spelled out on the wall that's who you
30:51
would marry
30:52
what i mean did they have
30:55
alpha betty spaghetti in 16th century
30:57
wales
30:59
what what can you hope to spell out i
31:02
suppose
31:03
trifle it'll go
31:06
yeah you're right i suppose maybe like
31:09
um spaghetti they probably didn't have
31:10
spaghetti in those days did they
31:12
wow have you guys heard these
31:16
they would get an eel from the table and
31:18
throw that up
31:19
again their name would better begin with
31:21
s oh
31:24
um have you guys heard of this song from
31:26
2004 called the 12 stis of christmas
31:29
no this was an official this was a song
31:32
written by the department of health as
31:35
part of a public
31:36
safety campaign and it was to teach
31:38
people especially young people about the
31:39
risks of unsafe sex
31:41
and it started it had had all the verses
31:43
um
31:44
so it started on the first day of
31:45
christmas my true love gave to me
31:47
a bug that made it hard to pee okay so
31:50
that's
31:51
right but they kept mixing up the verses
31:53
all the way along so i just want to
31:54
share verse
31:54
nine with you on the ninth day of
31:57
christmas
31:58
my true love gave to me genital warts
32:00
trichomoniasis hepatitis pubic lies
32:04
gonorrhoeae
32:07
genital herpes phil is chlamydia
32:10
and sores that spread ain't early
32:18
that's real that's an official thing i
32:21
reckon no one has ever stood on this
32:22
stage and sung the word gonorrhea
32:24
quite as beautifully as you did there
32:27
was a study in 2016
32:28
uh and it was a it was a christmas study
32:30
so it was quite light-hearted in its in
32:32
its
32:32
intent but it said recent estimates show
32:34
santa has to travel 510 million
32:36
kilometers at nearly the speed of light
32:38
each night before christmas
32:39
while controlling the estimated 5.6
32:41
million reindeer necessary
32:43
to pull his 2.3 million tonne slay
32:47
considering one fatality in commercial
32:49
aviation about every 323 billion
32:51
passenger kilometers
32:52
and assuming that santa sleigh is not
32:54
considerably safer than a standard
32:56
aeroplane
32:57
santa would die on duty every 45 years
33:02
[Laughter]
33:05
when's the next one jew do we know well
33:07
it says statistically he should have
33:08
died four times since his first
33:10
appearance in the 18th century
33:12
but he keeps on surviving he's fine he's
33:14
fine he's okay yeah
33:15
they looked at some injuries in america
33:17
between 2007 and 2016
33:20
over christmas uh and these are just
33:22
injuries but
33:23
um 36 000 people just over died from
33:26
sorry got injured from electrical
33:27
decorations uh 80 000 got injured from
33:30
other types of decorations
33:33
17928 got injured from artificial trees
33:36
and 277 children were hurt during
33:39
interactions with the santa impersonator
33:45
and apparently according to the
33:46
researchers their examples they gave is
33:48
by either falling off his lap
33:50
or falling while running away in fear
33:56
uh we need to move on to our final fact
33:58
of the show
33:59
and that is james okay my fact this week
34:02
is that mariah carey has three christmas
34:05
trees
34:06
one of which is decorated with pictures
34:09
of herself
34:11
okay so this is the modern day santa
34:14
claus mariah carey
34:16
and she has a main 19-foot tree in her
34:19
living
34:20
room she has a smaller one in her
34:21
bedroom and she has one in the
34:23
family room area that they call the
34:25
charlie brown tree
34:26
and it's a really cute kind of slightly
34:29
scraggly looking one but they put
34:31
polaroids of the family as well not just
34:33
her so it's a nice it's a nice thing
34:35
um and she has told us all about what
34:37
happens at her christmas
34:39
um she always takes a plane to aspen in
34:42
colorado
34:43
and she comes off the plane and she gets
34:45
onto a sleigh pulled by reindeers
34:47
while they play all i want for christmas
34:49
is you again
34:50
and again and again uh yeah and she
34:54
absolutely loves it she
34:55
actually she does really like her own
34:57
music she likes to do stuff
34:59
with her own music according to her
35:01
ex-husband nick shannon
35:03
when she gave birth as the babies came
35:05
out they were playing a mariah carey
35:07
song
35:08
and they didn't just want any old mariah
35:10
carey song they wanted a live version of
35:12
mariah carey singing fantasy in madison
35:14
square garden so that when the babies
35:16
came out they came out to a round of
35:18
applause
35:19
wow she is the absolute moby dick of pop
35:23
divas
35:24
she is just yeah the the perfect
35:28
wait is the monkey one decorated with
35:30
pictures of her
35:31
yes it's just like like like i said
35:33
charlie brown it's kind of a more
35:34
traditionally kind of
35:36
a small small one okay yeah she has i
35:38
think it's quite sweet actually i
35:40
yeah um i the thing is mariah carey i i
35:43
think we need a few people
35:44
who exist in that diva land that we just
35:47
celebrate as opposed to going they're
35:49
crazy because
35:50
it's so amazing to know that there's
35:52
someone out there just living this
35:53
insane life and all these rumors we
35:55
don't know which ones are true
35:57
and which ones are false so the things
35:58
like people say she never wears a watch
36:00
she can whistle with her hands she never
36:02
wears a watch it's not diva behavior
36:06
i mean you're not wearing a watch right
36:08
now oh dan schreiber the mariah carey of
36:10
no such thing as a fish
36:13
um she she has supposedly an extreme
36:16
aversion to overhead lighting and has
36:18
as she claims that elevator lighting is
36:20
toxic and the thing is
36:22
some people sometimes pick her up on the
36:24
fact that she has these big rumors about
36:26
her and ask her about it
36:27
and often the answer is crazier than the
36:30
actual accusation
36:31
she was interviewed by someone who said
36:33
there's a rumor going around that you
36:34
only bathe
36:35
in bottled water sort of sparkling water
36:38
and she said that is
36:39
insane i bathe in milk
36:43
um i don't think that was actually with
36:45
mariah carey though that interview
36:46
because
36:47
this was in the guardian and he the
36:50
description is so bizarre
36:51
but basically he sort of led into this
36:53
room where he says it's dimly lit and he
36:54
can barely make her out she's sitting in
36:56
a weird throne
36:57
and then she asks to be moved to a
36:58
different chair slash throne doesn't she
37:00
and there's this sort of air throughout
37:02
that all he can see is her glittering
37:03
diamonds and sort of the red of her
37:05
outfit
37:06
in this weird dimly lit space and i
37:08
think she's just sending standards
37:09
around the world to repeat mad stuff
37:11
about her
37:13
but there are clues that it might have
37:14
been her she wasn't wearing a watch for
37:15
instance
37:18
she whistled to beckon him um
37:22
so this song all i want for christmas is
37:23
you is uh
37:25
i think it's just over 25 years old
37:27
really yeah it's it's now an oldie and
37:30
um
37:30
when she was told when mariah carey was
37:32
told that the song was turning 25 years
37:34
old she had an amazing response she just
37:35
said
37:36
i don't acknowledge time
37:39
that's why she doesn't wear a watch
37:43
she doesn't acknowledge time because she
37:45
doesn't have birthdays we don't
37:47
truly know when mariah carey was born
37:49
that's that's
37:50
that's a real thing she was either born
37:52
i think it was in 19
37:54
uh what are the two days i think it was
37:56
was it 59 1960
37:57
yeah exactly and we don't fully know no
38:00
sorry she was either in 1969 or 1970.
38:02
she was either born in 1969 97 we don't
38:04
fully know because we haven't got the
38:05
birth certificate to tell
38:07
but she doesn't have birthdays she has
38:09
anniversaries
38:10
because she doesn't acknowledge time
38:12
well it's still acknowledging time if
38:14
it's an anniversary isn't it
38:15
you've just given it a different name a
38:18
good point
38:20
she hasn't thought this one through yeah
38:22
no she's i think she's a fascinating
38:24
character and
38:25
the amazing thing all i want for
38:26
christmas is you she's expanded it into
38:28
so many territories there's a
38:30
movie that she made recently an animated
38:32
movie all i want for christmas is you
38:34
the kids
38:34
cartoon which i watched the other night
38:36
um she's made
38:37
sorry you watched yeah i saw i saw it
38:41
the other night was it was it good
38:42
it was fantastic yeah did your son enjoy
38:45
it
38:46
he doesn't watch that [ __ ] he's uh
38:49
i put it on he was like i'm out he went
38:51
to play with his thomas the tank engine
38:52
toys um so i watched it on my own
38:54
but it's that is so depressing
38:58
why it's a fantastic song a fantastic
39:00
movie she's a fantastic human who
39:02
doesn't acknowledge that time exists
39:04
like it's uh
39:04
how long is the film if time doesn't
39:06
exist
39:08
to be fair it did feel like forever but
39:12
um there is a there is a whole article
39:14
deconstructing the the meaning of the
39:16
song all i want for christmas is you on
39:17
the atlantic which is really good uh and
39:19
it
39:19
kind of does it slightly academically so
39:21
it says um the author carefully sets out
39:23
her premises
39:24
there exists an entity i representing
39:26
conscious selfhood
39:28
this entity exists in relation to
39:30
material space
39:32
a lot and seasonal time for christmas
39:35
um the entity expresses this
39:36
relationality through the vocabulary of
39:38
desire or
39:39
want and though its desires could
39:41
theoretically be expansive
39:43
they are not yet how could we understand
39:45
the author's examination of christmas as
39:47
anything but an implicit critique
39:49
of capitalism
39:52
she doesn't want all the other stuff for
39:53
christmas she just wants you
39:55
they've plagiarized her notes when she
39:57
was writing that song
39:59
because she did write it we should say
40:01
she did i didn't quite realize that she
40:02
wrote all of her songs
40:04
i comment number one she said but dozens
40:06
she did write basically all of them
40:08
she co-wrote that one i think right she
40:09
co-wrote it i think as a co-writer
40:11
she is unique in that she has had one
40:13
number one hit for
40:15
every year of the 90s and no one else
40:17
has had that she's had
40:19
yeah so she's yeah i heard she'd had
40:20
about 19 and she'd written
40:22
18 of them or at the very least current
40:24
them and there is a theory our colleague
40:26
james rawson who is a big mariah carey
40:28
fan he has a theory that all the diva
40:29
stuff
40:30
is actually to distract us and is to not
40:32
it doesn't draw attention to the fact
40:34
she's a very good songwriter and she has
40:35
a five
40:36
octave range which is almost unheard of
40:39
but you know if she goes on about that
40:40
it might sound vain so uh she just does
40:42
the fun diva stuff instead
40:43
yeah okay although i don't want to
40:44
suggest her career is going downhill but
40:46
last year she was doing the tube
40:47
announcements
40:48
in london she she did the police mind
40:51
the gap
40:52
or she did she did uh all i want for
40:54
christmas is houston
40:59
very very strong the next train will be
41:02
along at some point
41:04
when
41:08
no she did she did please stand clear of
41:10
the yellow line and also have you heard
41:12
my new album
41:13
tube announcement wow did she actually
41:15
save the new album [ __ ] she did yeah
41:17
oh wow this year is a fight like every
41:21
year for christmas number one last year
41:22
it was won by
41:24
we built this city on sausage rolls by
41:26
lad baby
41:27
uh and as a kind of comment against that
41:30
there is a couple called
41:31
gavin chapel bates and giles bryant who
41:34
are from cambridge and suffolk
41:35
respectively
41:36
and they've recorded a single called
41:38
peace on your plate
41:39
which is the world's first vegan
41:41
christmas single
41:43
the lyrics include children are playing
41:45
by the fireside
41:46
there's magic at yuletide but in a
41:49
different land
41:50
it's a different scene in a factory shed
41:53
the animals scream
41:58
that honestly makes your fact dan look
42:00
like it's a wonderful life
42:04
i think it's unfair to call that the
42:05
first vegan christmas song when i think
42:07
a lot of other christmas songs haven't
42:09
been rampantly carnivorous
42:11
[Laughter]
42:14
do you know who invented christmas songs
42:16
christmas carols
42:18
oh it kind of been named after someone
42:19
called carol
42:21
i wish it was uh no it was a guy called
42:25
edward white
42:25
benson who was the bishop of truro in
42:28
the 19th century late 19th century
42:29
and basically carols were sung in pubs
42:31
and he wanted to move them to
42:32
churches and he went on to be archbishop
42:34
of canterbury he was quite a big deal
42:36
but he had this extraordinary family
42:38
life so he was married
42:40
his wife had she kept a diary of her
42:42
lovers and she had 39 lesbian lovers
42:45
so she was gay she kept this diary she
42:47
had this they had six children
42:49
four of whom were gay and two so their
42:51
two sons one went on to be a famous poet
42:53
the other one to be a famous novelist
42:56
one of their two daughters who was gay
42:58
stole her mother's girlfriend
43:00
and he was there being the archbishop of
43:02
canterbury just
43:03
wow she was brilliant the mother she was
43:05
called mary benson and gladstone at the
43:07
time called prime minister called her
43:09
the cleverest woman in england
43:11
um which you know she had 39 lovers
43:13
that's pretty smart
43:15
yeah but not when they count all those
43:17
stds she got it
43:21
we're gonna have to wrap up very shortly
43:23
um anything before we do
43:25
um just some more christmas songs yeah
43:28
yeah so for instance the song i saw
43:29
mummy kissing santa claus
43:31
was condemned by the roman catholic
43:33
church in boston
43:35
because they said it was showing
43:37
adultery because mummy is kissing
43:39
another man and it was only when the guy
43:42
who sang the song jimmy boyd met with
43:43
the church leaders to explain that
43:45
actually in this song
43:46
the part of santa is being played by the
43:48
father in this
43:51
and then they lifted their condemnation
43:56
i think it makes sense to release
43:57
christmas songs like so i was looking at
44:00
the royalties that you get
44:01
in 2016 channel 5 did a review
44:04
of all the biggest songs that gets the
44:06
number one royalty so she came in at
44:07
number
44:09
three what do you think number two and
44:10
number one their christmas songs
44:11
christmas songs i think it'll be slayed
44:13
merry christmas everybody
44:14
number one yeah yeah how cool is that
44:18
and according to this according to this
44:20
report they get one million
44:22
pounds in royalties a year from that
44:24
alone
44:25
slayed not all of them wrote it though
44:28
so it's only naughty holder and maybe
44:30
one other bloke yeah so probably not
44:31
he's getting mostly they get
44:33
they get it between them the other band
44:34
mates get nothing yeah
44:36
no yeah way i didn't even say no way
44:41
i just said no
44:45
but here's the thing you don't even need
44:46
to have written a good song that people
44:48
have heard about in 1978 there was a guy
44:49
called randy brooks who wrote a song
44:51
called grandma got run over by a
44:53
reindeer
44:55
sold 40 million copies it's been covered
44:58
three times
44:59
the the family have just been pulling in
45:01
royalties each year yeah why have we not
45:04
heard of this has anyone heard of that
45:06
oh oh really it's a famous song famous
45:09
song
45:10
we just don't know anything there is a
45:11
there is a film called mood media which
45:13
provides
45:14
tunes to shops so that and you know 300
45:17
000 american shops have this music
45:19
provided by this
45:19
one firm and they have 30 different
45:22
christmas music channels
45:25
that's how many different kinds of mood
45:27
shopkeepers might want to evoke in their
45:29
shops
45:30
so if you run a small um christian
45:32
bookshop
45:33
you might not want to have the raunchy
45:35
lady gaga christmas songs
45:37
oh yeah but if you're selling if you've
45:39
got a cool shop
45:41
for young people then you might want to
45:42
play a song called christmas in harlem
45:44
by someone called kanye west
45:47
yeah although some of the classic
45:48
christmas songs are raunchier than you
45:49
might think
45:50
so a lot of um i think christmas carols
45:53
didn't really stop being sung
45:54
in churches until the 19th century when
45:55
they had to rewrite lots of them
45:57
but deck the hall that opened the hall
46:00
with bowser holly that
46:01
um opening line used to be oh how soft
46:03
my fair ones bosom
46:07
really yeah it was a welsh song about
46:09
how fit someone's girlfriend was
46:13
of course oh come are ye faithful
46:17
have you tried the letters yeah
46:22
actually you know um that song oh come
46:23
on you faithful um
46:25
if you sing that you're technically
46:27
pleading for the french to invade
46:28
england
46:33
because at this stage why not try it
46:39
that feels like the big reset button
46:40
that we need to hit at this point
46:43
[Applause]
46:44
[Laughter]
46:47
it was written by john francis wade who
46:49
was an english catholic and he fled the
46:51
country during the 1745 rebellion
46:54
and he wrote this song and it was
46:55
basically oh come the catholics to
46:58
england
46:59
and save us from the protestants that's
47:01
weird because he must have screwed up
47:02
the lyrics come
47:04
ye o calm you to be ethlyhem
47:07
unless well he met the best
47:13

[Applause]
01:17
[Music]
01:20
hello and welcome to the audiobook of
01:23
the year 2019
01:25
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
01:27
here with andrew hunter murray anna
01:29
chazinski
01:29
and james harkin and we are four fact
01:32
nerds who host a weekly podcast called
01:34
no such thing as a fish
01:36
and once again we have gathered round
01:37
the microphones to tell you about the
01:39
most interesting things that have
01:40
happened on your planet in the last 12
01:42
months
01:43
that is correct so if any of you out
01:45
there are just sick of reading the same
01:47
old news stories fear not we're not
01:49
going to cover them we are going to tell
01:51
you about the stuff that you might have
01:52
missed the weirdest wackiest stuff out
01:54
there so things like the fact that three
01:57
new lawnmower records were set this year
01:59
wow
02:00
yeah pretty big deal uh or that
02:03
a winner of the first ever heavy metal
02:05
knitting championship was crowned
02:08
big stuff like that uh we might mention
02:10
one or two things about the big
02:12
news of the year so we might mention a
02:14
few things about trump i suppose
02:15
oh yeah i think climate change might get
02:18
a look in yeah
02:19
but there will be absolutely no mention
02:21
of brexit
02:22
oh what was that uh
02:26
i don't know so so let's try it again
02:27
you know the the the debate between
02:29
britain and the eu
02:30
about the membership and that of course
02:32
we refer to as
02:34
dead okay that's weird maybe they'll fix
02:38
that glitch
02:38
there'll be no mention of anyway in the
02:40
book it's not going to happen
02:42
yeah so it won't be relevant it won't be
02:44
relevant but i guess if anything slips
02:45
in
02:46
hopefully that little noise will remain
02:48
and uh you'll know that that's what
02:49
we're talking about why do you say
02:50
remain done
02:53
wait is this subconscious propaganda
02:56
this is
02:57
just looking at the list of
03:00
articles there's news about
03:01
uh whales and wigs and bees and bees
03:04
and pigs and post and creepy crawlies
03:07
all sorts of stuff
03:08
it's all in there weird articles full of
03:11
fabulous news indeed and you said bees
03:13
and bees us
03:15
pigs and what was the other one post yes
03:18
and
03:18
that gives you a clue that this is
03:19
actually a book in alphabetical order
03:22
we'll be going through all 26 letters
03:24
one at a time
03:25
but actually there may be some of the
03:27
letters that aren't recorded in this
03:29
very room where we're recording at the
03:30
moment
03:31
yep that's right we are gonna record
03:33
some of our chapters or some of our
03:34
letters or just some of our extracts on
03:36
the road as part of our live
03:38
tour it's basically a cheat so we don't
03:40
actually have to come up with an actual
03:41
live show
03:42
we're just gonna read this on the bits
03:44
from this book and then we're going to
03:45
insert them in here
03:46
so if you hear audiences laughing
03:48
broadcastly or
03:49
booing heinously then it's not because
03:51
we've invited a thousand people into our
03:53
recording studio
03:54
that'd be very distracting it's because
03:56
we're doing the live show
03:58
that's right and we should say before we
04:00
begin that we would like to thank
04:02

04:31
[Music]
04:33
or two tourists planning to visit the
04:37
norwegian village of orr
04:39
ended up 1310km away
04:42
in awe doesn't all begin with oh
04:46
it does sound that way doesn't it what a
04:47
confusing way to start the audio book
04:49
but does audio book begin with oh james
04:52
you're quite right it doesn't it's a
04:54
very good point
04:54
can you spell out these uh these can you
04:57
spell out every word you say from now on
04:59
certainly yeah it might take a bit
05:01
longer um so or
05:03
is a norwegian letter which is spelled a
05:06
a sort of capital a small a sometimes or
05:09
it's
05:09
alternatively spelled sort of like an
05:11
english a
05:12
with a little weird blob on top of that
05:14
it's called a hat technically i believe
05:17
it's like the little ring on top of a
05:18
christmas bauble you could hang it on a
05:20
tree
05:20
yes bauble demonstrating the all sound
05:25
so yes it is a confusing way to start
05:27
the audio book but
05:28
essentially it's the last letter in the
05:29
norwegian alphabet but it looks like the
05:31
first letter in
05:32
ours and basically these two tourists
05:34
these chinese travelers
05:35
were spotted by ore's deputy mayor they
05:38
were literally in her front yard
05:40
and she realized they had mistakenly put
05:42
all one spelling into their sat nav
05:45
and they'd actually intended to go to
05:47
all the other spellings so which
05:49
spelling was she
05:50
living in yeah was it oh oh oh it was
05:53
all james
05:54
okay
05:58
um so yes it was in a so or one of the
06:00
ores the place they ended up was in a
06:02
village called haiyan
06:03
which is more than 1300 kilometers south
06:06
of
06:06
ore and since the tourists didn't speak
06:08
norwegian they were chinese tourists and
06:10
the deputy mayor didn't speak mandarin
06:12
she was completely unable to help them
06:14
and in the midst of the confusion
06:16
actually it probably didn't help that
06:17
the deputy mayor's name
06:18
was or burger so spelled with another
06:21
ore
06:22
a third or it's a third or yeah the
06:25
tourist vanished before anyone could do
06:26
anything about it
06:28
if you're on a date in a boat you don't
06:30
want to be the third order
06:37
adventuring a 71 year old frenchman
06:40
crossed the atlantic in a barrel without
06:42
a paddle
06:43
or an engine or any sails or any oars
06:48
um jean jacques cervan a 71 year old
06:50
former paratrooper and sailor
06:52
wanted to become the first person to
06:54
rely solely on currents
06:55
to cross the atlantic so he built
06:57
himself a 10 foot long plywood barrel
07:00
it was designed to be killer whale proof
07:02
waited to stay upright
07:04
clever and his bed had straps so he
07:06
wouldn't fall out in the night
07:09
was he sleeping on top of the barrel he
07:11
was sleeping inside the barrel oh okay
07:13
but so just falling out of his bed as
07:14
opposed to falling out of land falling
07:16
into the sea yeah
07:17
he thought of everything um savannah
07:20
cast off from the canary islands on
07:21
boxing day last year and he hoped to
07:23
make it to the caribbean within three
07:24
months
07:25
things did not go quite to plan he was
07:27
blown 600 miles off course
07:29
almost immediately and the weather
07:32
remained against him for five weeks
07:34
on the upside as there was no need to
07:36
spend time maintaining an engine or all
07:37
the sails he didn't have
07:39
he was able to dedicate himself to
07:40
writing a diary playing the mandolin
07:43
and looking at passing fish through a
07:44
porthole in the bottom of the barrel
07:46
although he also had to spend three
07:48
hours a day replying to emails forwarded
07:50
to him by his secretary
07:52
as any good frenchman would he
07:53
celebrated his 72nd birthday with foie
07:55
gras and a bottle of bordeaux
07:57
finally after 2930 miles and four months
08:01
of bobbing around on the ocean
08:02
savan made it to the caribbean sea he
08:04
was then given toe by a friendly oil
08:06
tanker to the nearest land
08:08
the dutch island of saint eustacious
08:10
some 230 miles away
08:12
although that wasn't his plan he had
08:14
been hoping to end up on a french-owned
08:16
island because as he said
08:17
that would be easier for the paperwork
08:20
for his next challenge
08:21
is thinking of crossing the pacific in a
08:23
barrel his friends are trying to
08:25
dissuade him
08:26
amazon versus amazon amazon
08:29
bribed the amazon with five million
08:32
dollars worth of kindles
08:35
twenty-five years ago jeff bezos decided
08:37
to change the name of his nascent
08:39
company
08:40
cadabra.com after a conference call when
08:42
people misheard it as
08:44
cadaver he finally hit on amazon.com
08:47
the amazon is the largest river in the
08:49
world he said and he wanted to build the
08:51
largest bookshop in the world
08:53
amazon.com is certainly now the world's
08:56
largest bookshop
08:57
but bezos still wants it to expand and
08:59
to help him meet this ambition
09:01
he hatched a plan to create websites
09:03
that instead of
09:04
ending.com end with dot amazon
09:08
unfortunately that idea didn't go down
09:09
well with the governments of bolivia
09:11
brazil colombia ecuador guyana
09:14
peru suriname and venezuela
09:17
all of whom argued that since the river
09:19
amazon runs through their countries
09:21
they should own the rights to web
09:23
addresses that make use of its name
09:25
at one stage amazon.com offered these
09:28
countries five million dollars worth of
09:29
kindles to try to break the impasse
09:32
the gesture was rejected and the matter
09:34
was eventually turned over to the
09:36
internet corporation for assigned
09:38
names and numbers also known as icann
09:42
after five years of wrangling icann
09:44
finally judged in favor of amazon.com
09:47
but with the proviso that each country
09:49
the amazon runs through
09:50
will be allowed a single domain name
09:52
ending in dot amazon
09:54
they will also be able to request a veto
09:57
to up to 1
09:58
500 web addresses what the ruling did
10:01
not reveal was whether or not they still
10:02
get the kindles
10:04
do you think if you're very good looking
10:05
and you work at icann you get called eye
10:07
candy
10:08
not in the me too era yeah i don't think
10:10
you've been more suited to the
10:12
late 70s i think thanks guys
10:16
apollo 12 on july 20th
10:20
the world celebrated the 50th
10:21
anniversary of the apollo 11 mission
10:24
which landed the first humans on the
10:25
moon but few remembered the crew of
10:27
apollo 12
10:29
pete conrad alan bean and richard gordon
10:31
who arrived there
10:32
just under four months later so this is
10:35
one of the greatest feats
10:37
of mankind it got no press because old
10:39
buzz aldrin and neil armstrong were
10:41
stealing it
10:42
um this was an amazing mission there's
10:43
so many great facts we have here
10:45
um my favorite one i think is that when
10:47
pete conrad said he was the third person
10:49
to stand on the moon
10:50
when he did his words his opening words
10:52
were
10:53
whoopi man that may have been a small
10:55
one for neil but that was a long one for
10:57
me
10:59
okay why did he do that well two reasons
11:02
um it's a sort of pun on his height he
11:03
was five foot five
11:05
okay um so it was a longer step than it
11:07
would have been for neil coming off the
11:08
ladder
11:09
um but the second thing is that when he
11:11
was talking to a journalist
11:12
um the suggestion was made that they
11:15
were scripted by nasa everything that
11:16
was said was by nasa
11:18
and he said it's not and to prove it he
11:19
made a 500 bet
11:21
that he would say the exact words that
11:22
he said to her right there in the
11:24
interview and that's what it was
11:26
and so he um he won the bet but he never
11:28
got the money
11:31
um i think she lived in a different
11:33
country it was a bit of a hassle getting
11:34
back in contact
11:35
um you're right they made it to the moon
11:37
but they couldn't transfer money between
11:39
countries
11:40
did you write this article dan cause i'm
11:42
seeing a fact here which says the apollo
11:44
12 moon landing footage was faked
11:46
absolutely true come on how incredible
11:48
is that so this is that alan bean
11:50
so he was the fourth man to stand on the
11:52
moon right behind conrad
11:54
and uh he made the huge mistake of
11:57
pointing the only video camera that they
11:59
had with them
11:59
directly at the sun so all of the
12:02
components inside it burnt out and so
12:04
now we had a moon landing without any
12:05
visuals uh so back on earth you had news
12:08
channels like cbs who had the audio
12:10
coming through but no visuals so what
12:12
they had to do
12:13
was improvise and they threw to studios
12:15
where they had
12:16
set up two people dressed as astronauts
12:19
walking around and sort of half
12:20
mimicking what they were hearing through
12:22
the audio that's amazing
12:24
incredible yeah and then there was also
12:26
nbc who had marionettes on hand that
12:28
were made by the puppeteer who had made
12:30
the ones and performed in the sound of
12:31
music the lonely goat heard
12:33
that a generation of people grew up
12:36
thinking that the second bunch of people
12:37
to land on the moon were just yodeling
12:39
the whole time
12:41
they also speaking of alan bean i love
12:43
this when they returned to er
12:44
so it all gone really well they returned
12:46
to earth and then alan bean as they
12:48
splashed down was knocked
12:49
unconscious so as the command module
12:51
that they were returning in
12:53
sort of came down to earth this camera
12:54
was jolted out of place
12:56
hit him on the head he was knocked
12:58
unconscious the last minute needed six
12:59
stitches
13:00
wow do you think the camera was getting
13:01
its own back for being pointed at the
13:03
sun
13:04
a few days earlier yeah it would have
13:05
been that ruining its big chats it's a
13:07
big moment
13:08
um there was also there was a lot of
13:09
pranks that happened on apollo 12 which
13:11
is really interesting
13:12
so there was a backup pilot called dave
13:14
scott so if if one of the astronauts had
13:16
been sick he would have stepped in at
13:17
the last second but he was very involved
13:19
in
13:20
in setting up things like the checklists
13:22
so when astronauts were on the moon
13:23
they would have a sort of wristwatch but
13:25
it was a sort of booklet to tell them
13:26
the things they needed to do while they
13:28
were there
13:28
and he snuck on into this booklet
13:31
pictures
13:31
of playboy bunnies from the day so as
13:34
they were looking through the checklist
13:36
suddenly
13:36
as they flipped the page there is angela
13:38
dorian aka miss september
13:40
and he'd written special captions
13:42
underneath so for hers it was
13:44
seen any interesting hills and valleys
13:46
and it's nude shots of
13:47
of women oh he's a man after your 1970s
13:50
heart
13:50
okay please um
13:54
it wasn't the only saucy incident to
13:57
take place on this mission
13:58
you're not helping yourself um so when
14:01
comrade
14:02
and bean they had finished their
14:03
spacewalk and then when they were
14:04
returning to the command module
14:06
they had to do so nude and this was
14:09
specifically at the instruction of the
14:10
pilot of the command module richard
14:12
gordon
14:12
because he was really worried about moon
14:14
dust getting into the systems of the
14:15
spacecraft because it is extremely fine
14:17
and it might have damaged their machines
14:19
so he made them strip off all of their
14:21
clothing which feels a bit unnecessary
14:22
all of it
14:23
um before he let them pass back from the
14:25
lunar lander onto the main ship
14:27
so one more fact um this is quite
14:28
opposite actually um
14:30
pete conrad died on the 8th of july 1999
14:33
sadly after crashing his motorcycle
14:35
while riding through ohio california
14:38
and apparently ohai comes from the word
14:41
hawaii
14:42
which is a native american word from the
14:44
venturanio language
14:46
i really regret reading this one please
14:49
if you do
14:49
if you are someone who um knows about
14:51
the venturanio language
14:53
in fact you probably won't know that
14:54
because i probably pronounced that rob
14:55
as well do not write in but anyway that
14:57
word translates as moon
14:59
that is amazing so eventually he did die
15:01
in moon yeah
15:04
incredible apoppy lips
15:08
the population of lake elsinore tripled
15:10
thanks to the popularity of its poppies
15:12
heavy rain this spring meant that the
15:14
hills around the californian city of
15:15
lake elsinore population 68
15:17
000 became covered with a super bloom of
15:20
millions and millions of poppies so
15:21
extensive it could be seen from space
15:24
unsurprisingly their beauty attracted
15:26
eager selfie-seeking poppy tourists
15:28
over 150 000 arrived in the city in a
15:31
single weekend to admire them
15:32
at first the local mayor declared the
15:34
phenomenon poppy palooza
15:36
then it became the poppy apocalypse and
15:38
finally
15:39
the apocalypse other officials described
15:42
it as a poppy nightmare
15:44
presumably with slightly less good
15:45
imagination feels like a stepped handler
15:46
no it does doesn't it
15:48
all of this might sound histrionic but
15:49
the fact is that the super bloom was a
15:51
disaster for the people of lake elsinore
15:53
local services were overrun medical
15:56
assistance had to be offered to the many
15:57
tourists who fainted in the heat
15:59
the authorities had to watch out for
16:01
those who cut through barbed wire
16:02
fencing to get at the flowers
16:04
and one couple even illegally landed a
16:06
helicopter in the middle of the poppies
16:07
to skip the queues
16:09
and then there was the problem of
16:10
rattlesnakes which were coming out of
16:11
hibernation at the time
16:13
and which bit at least one visitor
16:15
eventually the town felt it had no
16:17
choice but to bar
16:18
access to the main poppy site walker
16:20
canyon and plead with people to
16:22
stay away this weekend has been
16:24
unbearable said the city's officials
16:26
adding that it had caused unnecessary
16:28
hardships for our entire community
16:31
once the poppy nightmare was over the
16:32
city posted on instagram
16:34
we survived the poppy apocalypse and the
16:36
la times recommended that poppy fans
16:38
should not thank the city authorities by
16:40
sending them flowers
16:41
as that would be horrifically
16:42
insensitive
16:45
opposite a shark which had just eaten a
16:49
shark was caught
16:50
by a man called the shark
16:54
former professional golfer greg norman
16:56
is known as the shark
16:58
because he's from the home of the great
16:59
white shark queensland and because he
17:01
plays very aggressively
17:03
while fishing off the coast of jupiter
17:05
florida he managed to hook an 80-pound
17:07
black-tipped shark which was then
17:09
immediately attacked and eaten by a
17:10
hammerhead shark 10 times as big
17:13
norman and his friends eventually
17:14
wrestled the hammerhead along the boat
17:16
swam next to it for a bit and then
17:18
released it
17:19
there's been other opposite news this
17:21
year gillette had to recall 90 000
17:23
disposable venus razors
17:25
because thanks to a manufacturing error
17:27
they posed a cutting hazard
17:29
very nice there was a disney cafe which
17:31
was closed because someone spotted a
17:33
mouse
17:35
so that cafe is located in birmingham
17:37
and it's inside the world's biggest
17:38
primark imagine that what are we still
17:40
doing here
17:41
exactly yeah so they serve mouth-shaped
17:43
pancakes there they have pictures of
17:45
mickey everywhere
17:46
uh but when a customer saw an actual
17:48
real-life mouse uh that was too much and
17:50
the cafe had to temporarily shut down
17:52
that's proportionate it's better than
17:53
shutting it down forever
17:55
uh speaking of fast food um this was
17:57
quite opposite five guys were arrested
18:00
at five guys they got into a fist fight
18:03
inside a florida branch
18:04
of the burger restaurant and the police
18:06
had got cold but do you think there were
18:08
only four guys involved in the fight and
18:09
the police said we gotta get the
18:11
headlines what about you get over here
18:14
uh also there was a lunar eclipse in the
18:16
uk on the anniversary of the moon
18:17
landings
18:18
which is nice yeah so good remember that
18:20
saw it well i
18:22
heard about it and looked out the window
18:24
and noticed there was cloud
18:27
it's a great cover yeah thank you uh
18:30
there was also the fact that the
18:31
spirit of britain abandoned the uk and
18:34
fled to the continent
18:36
mine did a long time ago this was a
18:39
piano ferry the spirit of britain and
18:41
the firm changed the country of
18:42
registration to cyprus
18:44
to avoid problems after a rapper who
18:47
wrote songs about credit card fraud
18:49
and was actually charged with credit
18:51
card fraud he's 25 year old self-made
18:54
cash
18:55
surprisingly that's not his real name he
18:58
was born jonathan woods
18:59
and he's written songs including in
19:01
swipe i trust
19:02
where he describes making a killing from
19:04
credit cards uh prosecutors said woods
19:07
claimed to be sophisticated at credit
19:09
card fraud
19:10
when in fact he is not and if you're
19:13
really sophisticated at credit card
19:14
fraud you don't tend to tell people
19:16
about it
19:17
no the better you are the lower the odds
19:19
that you'll be caught unless you make
19:21
write a song his next song is
19:24
basically his credit card number his
19:25
mother his first pet
19:28
arcs the owners of the world's largest
19:31
replica of noah's ark
19:33
sued for rain damage ken ham's
19:37
arc encounter is a fundamentalist
19:39
catholic theme park in kentucky
19:41
whose centerpiece is a full-sized
19:43
replica of noah's ark
19:45
it's probably the largest wooden
19:47
structure in the world
19:48
in 2017 and 2018 suffered extremely
19:52
heavy rains
19:53
which while not quite heavy enough to
19:55
cover the entire planet with 15 cubits
19:58
of water
19:59
has happened in the old testament
20:00
citation needed
20:02
they were enough to cause landslides in
20:04
the park hans company demanded one
20:07
million dollars from their insurers
20:09
and claim that so far they have refused
20:11
to pay out
20:12
the case continues with barely an olive
20:14
branch in sight
20:17
armageddon if bruce willis managed to
20:21
blow up
20:21
an earth-threatening asteroid it would
20:23
simply reform and hit the planet
20:26
anyway that reference requires that
20:29
you've seen the film armageddon
20:31
or know about it which i assume you have
20:33
but this was the conclusion of a group
20:35
of scientists at johns hopkins
20:37
university
20:38
who built a computer simulation of
20:39
asteroid collisions in order to study
20:41
what happens when the space rocks break
20:43
apart
20:45
they found that asteroids are stronger
20:46
than we thought and that existing
20:48
weapons would not be capable of fleeing
20:50
the pieces far enough apart to stop
20:52
their gravity from bringing them back
20:53
together
20:54
one way and another the world scientists
20:56
had a pretty bad year
20:57
fighting theoretical apocalypse
20:59
scenarios
21:01
around the same time as the johns
21:02
hopkins calculations were being made
21:04
some of the world's greatest minds
21:06
gathered at the international academy of
21:07
astronautics planetary defense
21:09
conference
21:10
and failed miserably to save the earth
21:12
from a fictional head-on asteroid impact
21:15
the simulation which was created by a
21:17
nasa engineer began with an alert that a
21:19
200 meter wide asteroid had been
21:21
detected
21:22
and had a one percent chance of striking
21:24
the planet in 2027.
21:26
the team challenged to deal with it
21:28
decided to build six kinetic
21:30
impactors which are probes designed to
21:32
hit the asteroid
21:33
to change its trajectory remember this
21:35
is all a simulation
21:36
the probes managed to deflect the main
21:38
body but they caused a fragment to break
21:40
off which then headed for the eastern
21:42
u.s
21:43
so despite having eight fictional years
21:45
to devise a plan to save the world
21:47
the team was unable to stop new york
21:49
from being flattened
21:51
the european space agency tweeted along
21:53
with the simulation although every tweet
21:55
had to be accompanied by the hashtag
21:57
in caps lock fictional event
22:00
so that people didn't freak out about it
22:02
the threat of an asteroid strike isn't
22:04
entirely theoretical
22:05
in july a hundred meter meteor with a
22:08
deceptively unthreatening name
22:09
2019 okay came within 40
22:13
000 kilometers of the earth and it was
22:15
discovered only a day before it skimmed
22:17
past the planet
22:18
if by skim past the planet you mean it
22:20
was 40 000 kilometers away
22:22
but that is a relatively small distance
22:24
in planetary terms
22:25
uh had it hit the earth it would have
22:26
exploded with the power of a large
22:28
nuclear bomb scientists who subsequently
22:31
tried to work out why they'd missed it
22:32
until the last minute
22:34
realized it had actually been captured
22:35
twice by telescopes
22:37
but no one had recognized what it was
22:39
and 2019
22:41
okay isn't alone there are an estimated
22:44
30 000 asteroids between 100 and 300
22:47
meters wide that are out there but we
22:49
have only spotted 16
22:51
so if an asteroid is heading our way
22:53
it's unlikely bruce willis would have
22:54
time to do anything about it anyway
22:57
how could you tell it's 300 meters wide
22:59
as opposed to 300 meters high
23:00
all long um because they're tumbling
23:03
around yeah but normally with spheres
23:05
you call it width rather than height
23:07
oh i feel like like diameter or radius
23:10
if you saw a circle you wouldn't say
23:11
how high is that circle no oh how long
23:14
is that circle
23:15
you'd always say how wide it is to be
23:17
honest i've come across so few
23:18
like theoretical 2d circles in my
23:21
day-to-day
23:22
life now i'm not doing gcse maths
23:23
anymore it almost never comes up can i
23:25
ask why they called it okay
23:28
yeah it does seem like a misnomer but it
23:31
comes from the year it was discovered so
23:33
that's the 2019
23:34
and then the okay comes from the o which
23:36
is the designated letter for the half
23:38
month of july as in so july 16th to 31st
23:42
when it was spotted and the k is because
23:44
k
23:45
is the 11th letter of the alphabet and
23:47
the asteroid was the 11th
23:48
such discovery in that period so the one
23:51
that came far
23:52
after would have been 2019
23:58
aussie election a pre-election poll
24:02
revealed australia's most trusted
24:04
politician
24:04
is the prime minister of new zealand
24:07
when he called the election
24:08
australia's liberal prime minister scott
24:11
morrison asked the electorate
24:13
who do you trust to deliver that strong
24:15
economy which your essential services
24:17
rely on
24:18
the answer according to the polls was
24:20
increasingly
24:21
nobody the controversies that plagued
24:23
the election didn't help
24:25
liberal candidates were forced to step
24:27
down over claims of islamophobia and
24:29
homophobia
24:30
the opposition labour party had to drop
24:32
candidates for alleged sexism and
24:34
anti-semitism and the government was
24:36
caught up in a scandal that centered on
24:38
a claim that
24:39
it had improperly spent 80 million
24:42
dollars
24:42
to purchase water from farms nicknames
24:45
about scandals tend to end with
24:47
dash gate like watergate or any other
24:50
gates can you think of any other gates
24:52
gate pleb gates oh i was thinking
24:56
squidgy gates do you remember that one
24:58
oh dimly yeah that was someone calling
25:00
someone squidgy in a
25:01
in a phone call prince andrew and fergie
25:03
was it
25:04
was it was it prince charles and diana
25:07
well it was one of the princes
25:09
garden gate garden gate is that one or
25:12
is that just
25:12
no it's just okay i was just trying to
25:14
contribute but yeah
25:16
well this scandal was about water of
25:18
course so the aussie press
25:20
somewhat lacking originality dubbed it
25:22
watergate
25:23
uh which also made it impossible to
25:24
google despite the failings of the main
25:26
parties voters didn't really flock to
25:28
the smaller parties such as the great
25:31
australian party
25:32
or the love australia or leave party or
25:35
the unnecessarily shouty
25:37
climate action immigration action
25:39
accountable politicians party
25:42
um there was lots of exclamation points
25:44
in that name i think you conveyed that
25:46
did i
25:46
yeah or the party was probably the
25:49
world's most contrived acronym
25:51
they were the help and marijuana
25:54
prohibition party or the hemp party
25:56
it was probably because some of the
25:58
candidates from these parties didn't
25:59
show much more integrity than the front
26:01
runners
26:02
one activist from the united australia
26:04
party was fined for exposing himself at
26:06
a polling station
26:08
while a candidate for the anti-immigrant
26:10
one nation party
26:11
shared a facebook post of a naked woman
26:14
photoshopped to look like a centaur
26:16
with the caption um interesting thoughts
26:20
there were also some exclamation points
26:22
in that he managed to avoid deselection
26:25
somehow
26:25
all of which meant that although scott
26:27
morrison managed to hold on to power
26:29
when it came to naming a politician they
26:31
trusted many australians looked to the
26:33
country on the other side of the tasman
26:35
sea
26:36
new zealand's prime minister jacinda
26:38
ardern has been gaining plaudits around
26:40
the world
26:41
thanks especially to her response to the
26:43
terrorist attack in christchurch
26:44
where she refused to mention the name of
26:46
the attacker her personal integrity has
26:48
been similarly unimpeachable
26:50
when a school child wrote to her asking
26:52
that the government do some research
26:54
into psychics and dragons and including
26:56
five dollars by way of a sweetener
26:58
ardern returned the bribe avengers
27:02
avengers assembled against their biggest
27:05
enemy
27:06
spoilers so avengers endgame is the last
27:09
of a 10-year run of films for comic book
27:12
franchise marvel and has become the
27:13
highest grossing film of
27:15
all time when it was released google
27:17
searches for
27:18
how to avoid spoilers reached a record
27:20
high as fans desperately sought ways to
27:22
avoid accidentally finding out what
27:24
happens in the film
27:26
in fact in recent years marvel actors
27:28
themselves have been the main culprits
27:30
when it comes to spoilers
27:32
tom holland who plays spider-man has a
27:34
reputation for repeatedly giving away
27:36
details of films he's in
27:38
he once talked about the plot of a film
27:40
at a screening not realizing that it
27:42
hadn't yet been shown to the assembled
27:44
fans
27:45
and mark ruffalo who plays the hulk once
27:47
accidentally livestreamed the first 10
27:49
minutes of a marvel film
27:51
from his seat at the premiere the makers
27:54
of avengers endgame tried to ensure
27:56
details of their film wouldn't emerge
27:57
too early by giving members of the cast
27:59
fake scripts that included fake scenes
28:02
and fake plot twists
28:03
they did however break cover to poo poo
28:06
a sizeable online campaign to introduce
28:08
a plot twist
28:09
that would have involved one of the
28:10
heroes ant-man
28:12
who can miniaturize himself the idea was
28:15
that ant-man
28:16
would make his way into the arch villain
28:18
thanos's bottom
28:19
then rapidly expand back to full size
28:22
tearing thanos apart in the process
28:25
now explaining their decision co-writer
28:27
christopher marcus pointed out that if
28:29
ant-man expanded
28:31
he would simply be crushed by the
28:33
immovable walls of
28:34
thanos's mighty rectum as someone who's
28:38
never seen avengers that sounded like
28:39
complete
28:42
gibberish
28:44
even if you do have a mighty rectum it's
28:47
still going to be uncomfortable isn't it
28:49
it'll be uncomfortable
28:51
yeah i think it would sorry i picked
28:54
i actually visualized it and tried to
28:55
feel the pain well done my own rectum
28:58
and i thought yeah not painful but
29:00
definitely
29:01
i think it wouldn't be painful i think
29:03
it'd be uncomfortable for
29:04
someone as powerful as thanos who is who
29:07
is basically immortal and destroying the
29:09
entire universe yeah i think it'd be a
29:10
little tickle in his bomb as opposed
29:12
to a stabbing sensation
29:16
i can't comment because i don't know
29:17
what ant-man is it's fine he's done
29:19
enough thinking for all of us about this
29:32
you

=302
00:04
hi everyone james here now before we
00:05
start this week's show
00:07
merry christmas i hope you've had a
00:09
great christmas when i edit every single
00:11
week
00:11
the sometimes bits that are just don't
00:13
quite fit in with the rest of the show
00:15
but maybe they're just really
00:17
interesting maybe they're really funny
00:19
and they don't fit in
00:20
maybe it's just one incredible joke
00:23
about hedgehogs
00:24
that was just so good i thought it would
00:25
detract from the entire rest of the show
00:27
if i left it in and so i took it out i
00:30
take all those bits
00:31
i snuffle them away like a hedgehog does
00:34
with nuts or whatever it is that
00:36
hedgehogs eat and then at the end of the
00:38
year
00:38
i put them all together for the best of
00:40
show and this one is a real
00:42
bumper special it's over an hour i
00:44
really hope you enjoy it
00:46
it's us just messing around and we'll
00:48
see you in the new year with one of our
00:50
normal shows
00:51
but in the meantime enjoy this one and
00:53
happy new year
01:10
oh
01:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:14
no such thing as a fish
01:16
a weekly podcast cubby what do i do
01:20
i don't know if i'm doing it too is that
01:21
okay he's trying to put you up okay cool
01:23
no sometimes because i think you're like
01:25
it's the volume thing so i'm like oh
01:26
[ __ ] should i just start again no no i
01:27
was just being a dick cool
01:29
all right what chang and eng
01:32
the original siamese twins as in the
01:34
first siamese twins to be
01:36
written about in the west they were
01:38
really interesting so
01:39
they had a system where they were both
01:40
married and they would spend three
01:42
nights each
01:43
with each wife and they their
01:46
great-great-granddaughter
01:48
was the first was the youngest ever
01:49
recipient of a pulitzer prize for music
01:52
but um yeah how weird is that 2013.
01:55
um and yeah do you know her name uh yeah
01:58
she's called caroline shaw
02:00
do you know her never heard of her okay
02:02
she's done work with kanye west
02:04
how's she do you know him never heard of
02:06
him
02:08
but the thing that tore chang apart is
02:10
that chang developed a drinking problem
02:11
quite late in life
02:12
and suddenly suddenly hang on if you
02:15
develop a drinking problem
02:16
surely your siamese twin also developed
02:18
a drinking problem
02:19
they were only they were joined at the
02:20
chest so i think they had different
02:21
livers
02:22
okay but it's still quite annoying if
02:24
you're constantly attached to a drunk
02:33
there's one thing that sunny day is good
02:34
for well actually there's loads of stuff
02:39
when i swim a sunbathe but mostly asking
02:42
someone out
02:43
so it's good to ask someone out on a
02:44
date and this is a french study
02:47
obviously and this french study found
02:48
one attractive man
02:50
and they sent him round to ask out how
02:52
did they find one of those
02:55
they had to recruit one from scotland
02:59
sorry looking forward to aberdeen next
03:02
week
03:04
i don't mean that um so yeah they
03:06
recruited this attractive
03:08
french man and made him ask out lots of
03:10
strangers on the street
03:11
and they found a huge difference so when
03:13
it was sunny
03:14
22.4 gave him a positive response
03:17
and when it was cloudy so not rainy just
03:19
cloudy then 13.9 percent did
03:21
that is quite a big difference but they
03:23
did warn that it's not necessarily the
03:25
you know we feel more prone to say yes
03:27
on sunny days it might be that your
03:28
flirting skills improve
03:30
in the sunshine it could be also that he
03:32
was very bad her die
03:34
and when it rains it kind of washes down
03:36
his face and everyone's like no i'm not
03:38
going to go out with you you've just got
03:39
ink all over your face
03:40
it's not raining maybe when it's cloudy
03:43
we don't know about this guy because
03:45
maybe when it's cloudy he interests are
03:46
wearing his donald duck
03:48
shaped raincoat
03:53
what is wrong with his red cut donald
03:56
duck actually is a very
03:58
very sexy character are you sure he's
04:01
the right guy for this study
04:03
i don't see him making a difference
04:09
in france there's been robots that have
04:11
been designed
04:12
to help out with any kind of fights that
04:15
might happen between let's say football
04:17
teams who happen to be watching
04:19
the match in the same area so in this
04:21
case there was a match going on
04:22
um between russia and england and there
04:25
was a robot put in place called allentim
04:27
or a lantern and his job the robot's job
04:30
was to basically stop the fight
04:32
but not only that they can see by using
04:35
data whether or not it thinks a fight is
04:37
about to break out
04:38
so it can alert the police if it thinks
04:40
that something is going to go wrong
04:42
um unfortunately before it could do any
04:44
of its stuff at this match someone beat
04:46
it with a baseball bat
04:49
yeah and they couldn't revive it so that
04:51
was philanthrom's career
04:53
because a lantern was at a rough time is
04:55
that the same instant that there's a
04:56
video of on youtube which is where
04:58
people are it was in russia and in
05:01
moscow in fact and there's a home video
05:02
people who are driving in their car
05:03
normal people
05:04
got a video and they see someone drive
05:08
out in front of them in a side cut with
05:09
a side car so on a bike with this icon
05:11
in the sidecar is a robot
05:12
so there's some chuckling in the car
05:14
that we're in as the viewer because
05:15
they're like what the [ __ ] is that robot
05:17
doing
05:17
and then they see that robot get cut up
05:20
by another car
05:21
and then both disappear around the
05:23
corner and then
05:24
you as the viewer so these guys in the
05:26
car with their home video
05:28
follow it around that corner and at that
05:30
point the bike with the sidecar has
05:32
disappeared
05:33
and allowed him slash alan tim will
05:35
never know
05:36
he's dead now um spoiler uh is just
05:39
standing by the side of the road
05:41
and the guy who's cut him up gets out of
05:43
his car pulls the baseball bat from his
05:44
passenger seat goes up to him and knocks
05:46
his head off oh i've not seen the
05:47
footage yeah so is this
05:48
like it could be a it wasn't a football
05:50
match no i should quickly say this was
05:52
in moscow i said it was in france um
05:54
this was in moscow and it was during the
05:55
2016
05:56
um matches the world cup but what
05:59
happened to alantum
06:00
is um they set up the first ever robot
06:02
cemetery
06:03
to bury him in yeah it was seen as like
06:05
don't do this to robots have you seen it
06:07
no i've not seen anything apparently
06:11
well i've i look at these pages that i
06:13
click on i don't just close my eyes and
06:15
hope for the best
06:16
right this energy
06:22
no this cemetery is a piece of [ __ ] if
06:23
it's made to give robots a proper burial
06:25
it says it was inspired by the murder of
06:27
the lantern
06:28
and um it's called a cemetery if you
06:30
look it up it's a cardboard box
06:32
full of parts of robot it's in the lobby
06:35
area
06:36
of some kind of random conference
06:38
building and she said
06:39
the person who set it up said it's great
06:41
the cemetery's been really popular
06:42
we're already getting lots of requests
06:44
from people to bring in their own dead
06:45
tech
06:46
like a red toy car and some batteries
06:49
wow it's a plastic bag
06:54
if you're um a hedgehog who's running a
06:56
circus don't say roll up roll up
06:59
because no one's gonna come
07:02
i'm just gonna stun that really boring
07:05
circus
07:06
yeah there was another elizabeth taylor
07:08
um as well as the famous one who
07:10
kingsley amos said was one of the best
07:12
english novelists born in this century
07:14
in the 20th century
07:16
and she was the problem with her
07:18
obviously she had the same name as this
07:19
extremely famous elizabeth taylor
07:22
and when um her book mrs lippinco
07:25
came out in 1945 it was almost the same
07:27
time as national velvet came out for
07:29
elizabeth taylor
07:30
the actress and then they interviewed
07:32
her towards the end of her life and she
07:34
said i've had a rather uneventful life
07:36
thank god
07:37
but sometimes the more eventful world
07:39
intrudes into my life
07:41
i get fan letters to the other elizabeth
07:43
taylor
07:44
men write to me and ask for a picture of
07:46
me in my bikini
07:49
my husband thinks i should send one to
07:51
shake them
07:53
but i have not got a bikini
07:56
it's actually slightly insulting from
07:57
your husband so you know how you could
07:58
really repel these people
08:00
is actually send that photo love i've
08:02
got a fact about
08:03
about people who are interested in nazi
08:05
memorabilia okay
08:07
so there is one guy who he he does just
08:10
seem to be an obsessive collector but
08:11
the guardian
08:12
profiled him a few years ago he's called
08:13
kevin wheatcroft and he
08:15
grew up a multi-millionaire he's the
08:16
head of a huge fortune and he has the
08:18
world's
08:18
largest collection of nazi memorabilia
08:21
he sleeps in hitler's old bed
08:23
which he says he has changed the
08:24
mattress
08:27
does he use a lisa mattress
08:30
but that's the last time they asked us
08:36
he owns 88 tanks which is more than the
08:40
danish and belgian armies combined
08:42
wow yeah jesus so they're quaking in
08:45
their boots
08:46
at the idea he might invade yeah i mean
08:48
it's more
08:49
the the historical pieces obviously and
08:51
they wouldn't be much good today for
08:52
invading anywhere
08:53
okay it is weird isn't it collecting
08:55
nazi memorabilia you've got to ask some
08:57
questions i think
08:58
they they did ask him a lot of questions
09:03
they're doing the right thing but they
09:05
concluded he was just you know he was a
09:07
collector
09:08
rather than uh if you ask some questions
09:10
and people answer them that's absolutely
09:11
fine
09:12
i'm just saying you've got to ask the
09:13
question there's lots of things he could
09:14
collect though why did he choose that
09:15
did they ask that question
09:16
um i can't remember what his answer was
09:20
but i'm sure it was a good one i really
09:23
like
09:23
the nuns and which like we're back
09:30
um i was reading that um so i was
09:32
looking into just general shrimp like
09:34
eating shrimp particularly um
09:36
because they're eating on the space
09:37
station did you know that there are
09:39
shrimp recipes available
09:41
from the rapper coolio
09:44
i i i did not know that yeah
09:47
so he he released a a cookbook a few
09:50
years back
09:52
called how to become a kitchen pimp and
09:57
and it's got i mean it's there's there's
09:58
great chapters appetizers for that ass
10:01
um salad eating [ __ ]
10:04
um vegetarians question mark okay
10:07
whatever
10:11
and then he has a whole chapter for
10:12
shrimps which is called it's hard out
10:14
here for a shrimp
10:15
which is uh some will know is a famous
10:17
song it's hard out here for a pimp
10:19
um yeah so and there's videos of people
10:21
trying out his recipes
10:22
and um he doesn't come across great with
10:25
his choices of what to do
10:26
but yeah but if anyone needs a coolio
10:28
shrimp recipe yeah it's there
10:30
it's what a lot of people here came for
10:32
tonight
10:35
um so hedgehogs there's a hedgehog
10:37
olympic games
10:38
which is from i found this out from a
10:39
book called a prickly affair
10:41
which is by a guy who's really into
10:43
hedgehogs but he was talking
10:45
i think they're in america somewhere and
10:47
he was saying one of the competitors is
10:48
a guy called zug standing bear
10:50
who was one of gerald ford's bodyguards
10:52
and he's now
10:53
a champion and he now has a champion hog
10:56
called buttercup which he competes at
10:58
the olympic games
10:59
and he reported of another one who's a
11:01
woman called dawn
11:02
robel who says that she communicates
11:04
telepathically with her hedgehogs that's
11:06
got to be
11:07
cheating isn't it yeah you can't do that
11:10
is it in the
11:11
human olympic rules that you can't
11:12
communicate no telepathies yeah
11:15
because what would you say as well throw
11:16
the javelin really fast the faster
11:18
you're saying faster
11:20
you can't cheat in the olympics well
11:22
actually we have learned over the years
11:25
you can't cheat by whispering in
11:27
someone's ear at the olympics
11:28
but she did she does say that her
11:30
hedgehogs call themselves star children
11:33
they call themselves that yeah they
11:34
refer to themselves
11:36
telepathically yeah sorry what are the
11:38
events of the hedgehog olympic games i
11:39
think sort of racing
11:40
and chopping and jumping um i actually
11:43
don't so i didn't
11:44
read in this article he didn't detail
11:46
what the events were like
11:48
hedgehog races because they run quite
11:50
fast yeah yeah
11:51
yeah not as fast as humans no you could
11:53
be a hedgehog yeah
11:54
that's why the inter-human and hedgehog
11:57
olympics have never taken out but
11:58
actually
11:59
what people don't know is that hedgehogs
12:00
are allowed to take part in the human
12:02
olympics
12:02
but they've just never qualified never
12:06
reached a qualified time
12:11
i found just a couple of animal smells
12:13
um
12:14
so male silkworm moths they can sense a
12:16
single molecule
12:17
of female sex hormone from a mile away
12:21
i never understand what they mean i know
12:23
i don't care and they say that because
12:24
presumably you need the molecule to get
12:26
into your nose
12:27
before you sense it yeah and so how can
12:29
it be a mile away i've just never
12:30
understood that it's the same with um
12:32
sharks sharks and blood yeah i just
12:34
don't get it yeah i know that's the
12:35
thing all the things i read about
12:36
animals
12:37
smelling it like albatross can smell
12:39
fish from the air
12:40
that makes a lot of sense because that's
12:42
the it's the scent molecules
12:43
the problem so the scent molecules are
12:45
coming off the fish that's fine then it
12:46
goes through the air and then up to the
12:48
albatross's nose but if you're smelling
12:49
a molecule
12:50
that's the thing that causes you
12:52
dismemberment i think it's a distance
12:54
though as with the albatross is what is
12:56
amazing scientists because
12:58
the molecules break up with whatever
12:59
direction the wind is blowing out
13:01
it is incredible yeah but at least we
13:02
understand how it's possible i guess
13:04
it must be that the molecule is entering
13:06
the was it a moth did he say
13:07
yeah it must be that they can when a
13:10
molecule
13:11
released by a female a mile away gets in
13:13
their nose
13:14
they can tell the direction it's come
13:16
from or it retains its potency or they
13:17
can still detect it
13:19
even though it's traveled a mile yeah it
13:20
must be where it is something like that
13:22
you can't start a molecule from a
13:24
mile away from the molecule but that's
13:25
the thing it's like when you're in the
13:27
sea
13:27
and you cut your finger right and
13:29
there's a tiny little blood goes in the
13:30
sea
13:31
then supposedly jaws is able to tell
13:34
it's there from like
13:35
10 minutes away that's the whole point
13:37
of it yeah yeah but surely he has to
13:38
wait for the blood to get to him yeah
13:40
take ages right if it's traveling
13:42
through water well currents though
13:43
currents happen
13:47
it's like set it's like me looking at
13:49
that wall on the other side of the room
13:50
and saying i can feel that from here
13:53
and it just doesn't in order to feel it
13:54
it has to come to you
13:57
exactly we have to me i mean anna that
14:00
was a
14:01
stunningly vivid example of that wall on
14:03
the other side of the room
14:05
where do you get these ideas i'm a
14:08
creative kind of guy
14:10
um did you know the iss is
14:12
battery-powered
14:13
i didn't know that is it a a or triple a
14:16
um they're actually no ways at all they
14:20
are the size of fridges the batteries on
14:21
the iss but sometimes they have to
14:23
change the batteries
14:25
how do you do that so take these fridges
14:27
out you rub them a few times
14:30
and then you put them back in again um
14:32
so there are 48 batteries
14:34
and it's for when the station's in
14:35
shadow because they're a big solar sails
14:36
for when it's in sunlight but these are
14:38
nickel hydrogen batteries and they're
14:40
slowly being swapped over for new kinds
14:42
of batteries which are run on lithium
14:44
so they all have to be changed and it's
14:46
you get two astronauts out there
14:48
who have to take a fridge out of
14:50
position
14:51
like carry it back to the right place
14:53
and then put the new one in
14:55
which is yes it really is and they have
14:58
to strap them to a palette they weigh
14:59
about 200 kilos but obviously in space
15:00
they don't you know
15:01
you don't feel that um however that is
15:04
stressful and also
15:05
if you slightly dent the back of it the
15:07
connection beard it won't fit in
15:09
and then you're absolutely stuffed and
15:11
they're they're trained obviously
15:13
and taught about it but they a lot of
15:15
them change the batteries without having
15:17
practiced it
15:18
yeah practice that kind of thing yeah
15:20
gone work in mfi for a weekend
15:23
moving bridges around i remember reading
15:26
earlier this year that there are massive
15:28
batteries all around the british
15:29
countryside
15:30
um which we use whenever our electricity
15:33
goes off do you remember there was a
15:34
massive power cut
15:36
when two things got hit at the same time
15:38
and loads of people went off apparently
15:40
what happens then is these batteries
15:42
kicking
15:42
and they're just kind of hanging around
15:44
there's like about 50 of them
15:45
absolutely massive batteries that's so
15:48
cool isn't it cool
15:49
i didn't really read any more about them
15:50
so i'm not going to tell you anything
15:52
because the way you're painting it i'm
15:53
now sort of imagine going on a roll walk
15:55
and finding a giant duracell
15:57
funny battery just standing up in a
16:00
field
16:00
that's what i imagine it is let's assume
16:02
it's that
16:05
i would say this is not a fact it was
16:06
just a thought i had today which is
16:09
what happens to rain when it rains on a
16:11
cloud
16:12
oh so you get higher clouds and lower
16:15
clouds
16:16
does it get collected by the lower cloud
16:17
like a sponge or does it go through the
16:19
cloud
16:21
like uh like it darts through and just
16:23
passes through the
16:25
some of it might become the cloud as
16:26
some of it might go down through the
16:28
cloud
16:29
it's such a good question that's a good
16:31
question the clouds are not like sponges
16:33
i should say no but i guess because it's
16:34
water i just didn't know if it just sort
16:35
of collected like a plug like
16:37
like sky puddles depends yeah it
16:39
probably depends how big the droplets
16:41
are
16:42
because clowns are very small droplets
16:43
by the time it's big enough to fall as a
16:45
raindrop that's that's really big it's
16:46
gotten quite heavy so actually yeah
16:48
that's right so um
16:50
it will be too big if it's big enough to
16:51
be falling it'll be too big to be
16:53
staying as a cloud
16:54
and it also yeah and it would never rain
16:56
on a cloud anyway would it it would only
16:58
have a snow on a cloud
16:59
basically doesn't all rain start out
17:02
with snow
17:02
yep no it's always if it's raining
17:05
outside it's all snow which happens to
17:07
have melted on the way down you're
17:08
kidding
17:09
it's always snowing if you look at it
17:10
that way yeah that's very cool didn't
17:12
know that
17:12
yeah just one more actual effect of
17:15
climate change as it's happening
17:17
is that some clouds may go extinct
17:20
what yeah this is how big the effect
17:22
we're having so uh stratocumulus
17:24
cloud decks they're the very low clouds
17:26
which reflect a lot of solar radiation
17:28
back into space
17:29
and if uh there are if levels of carbon
17:32
dioxide go up much more
17:34
this might suppress the actual formation
17:36
of these clouds so you won't get them
17:37
anymore
17:38
oh no we can no longer make hilarious
17:40
animal shapes in our imaginations out of
17:42
clouds
17:43
we will still have clouds it's just this
17:46
one particular
17:47
it's not going to be a sunny day every
17:48
single day but what if this one
17:49
particular cloud is the only one that
17:51
ever made those shapes
17:52
oh absolutely right could be that it
17:54
could be the animal shaped cloud
17:55
and really bringing home the eco crisis
17:58
that we're in at the moment
18:00
you're welcome extinction rebellion say
18:02
it loud and say it cloud
18:06
i went on to the to the um a website
18:10
cnn's most secretive jobs and they had
18:13
the usual
18:14
things like spies and restaurant
18:15
reviewers um another one is awards show
18:18
auditor
18:19
apparently you have to be very secretive
18:21
with that um it's for results so
18:24
you don't tell you know you don't screw
18:26
up and give lala land the right
18:28
um envelope so um what you need is a
18:31
bachelor's degree in an accounting or
18:33
related field and experience in
18:35
accounting or auditing
18:37
that's all it says you need and i've got
18:39
both those things yeah
18:42
off and apart from that you're doing so
18:45
well
18:45
damn it that's awesome hey how about a
18:48
made-up language
18:49
yes how about dothraki oh yeah yeah so
18:52
all languages are made up
19:02
sorry okay a recently made up language
19:05
made up language
19:06
yeah um so obviously so many people have
19:08
heard it being spoken because of game of
19:10
thrones you know being big big this year
19:12
so tens of millions of people have been
19:14
hearing it it's more than welsh irish
19:16
gaelic and scott scala combined
19:18
but i did not know the language is full
19:19
of little easter eggs
19:22
so um not many people speak it actually
19:24
speak it one of them is the inventor
19:26
david peterson who's really
19:28
he sort of makes languages for hollywood
19:30
as as his job
19:31
oh wow and obviously there are not many
19:33
jobs in the world but there are not many
19:35
jobs in that industry because it's such
19:36
a rare thing to be commissioned to make
19:38
a full language
19:39
um so he has a little fun with it so um
19:42
the dothraki word for eagle is
19:44
culver and that is based on stephen
19:46
colbert
19:47
uh for reasons i didn't get to the
19:48
bottom of yeah and there was based on
19:51
his wife
19:52
uh peter not colbert's wife
19:55
david peterson the inventor the word for
19:57
very attractive
20:01
um so david peterson's wife is called
20:04
erin
20:04
so in dothraki erin means kind or erenak
20:08
means kind one
20:09
[ __ ] bit
20:12
because he's really renting through
20:14
these languages
20:16
i think i read and i am so i hope this
20:20
is right but um i believe as well that
20:21
he's a monty python fan
20:23
and so there's points when there's
20:25
armies coming towards
20:26
some like a scene in um in game of
20:28
thrones where they're yelling at people
20:30
coming towards them
20:31
um he takes the words that we used in
20:34
monty python and the holy grail when
20:36
they're yelling you're a french cow
20:37
you're whatever whatever those words are
20:39
remember what they are but yeah it's
20:40
monty python dialogue
20:42
translated into dothraki used yeah
20:45
um so i've got a fact about modern
20:47
trains
20:48
which is uh about the queen who as we
20:51
know has the royal train
20:53
um so when she's traveling on the royal
20:55
train and when she's been traveling
20:56
overnight
20:58
uh there's a special instruction that
20:59
gets given out and that is
21:01
that the queen has a bath at 7 30 in the
21:03
morning so if the train is going then
21:05
the driver is ordered to the driver is
21:07
ordered to avoid any bumpy bits of track
21:10
so that her bath doesn't slosh around
21:11
too much okay
21:13
bumpy tracks first of all do we have
21:15
bumpy tracks or are they off
21:17
you get bumpy bits don't you yeah you
21:18
chop corners
21:22
well like you do not corner like round
21:24
bits but secondly how do you avoid
21:26
the bumpy bits you can't swerve in a
21:28
tree get lifted off onto a boat
21:30
then you gauge and then it comes back
21:32
down i think the queen's freedom of
21:33
movement is just severely limited
21:35
as to where she can go she can only go
21:36
to the flat bits she can only give her
21:38
the flap
21:39
queen's going all directions it's very
21:41
good point that's weird knowing when the
21:43
queen has a bath
21:44
i think you'd be freaked out as the
21:45
train driver every every morning at 7 30
21:47
you'd think oh
21:48
she's bathing now don't make any
21:51
mistakes she's naked 10 yards from me
21:55
it's a weird thought it's a big train i
21:57
don't think it's only 10 meters
21:59
like in the cab in the tub he puts the
22:02
bathroom next to the driver's
22:03
seat
22:07
one more thing about lu roll which is
22:09
more just a rant than a fact
22:11
coloured lurel disappeared off the face
22:13
of the earth right
22:14
uh-huh so um and you can still buy it
22:16
you can still buy it in 2004 it was 30
22:19
percent of blue roll that was sold
22:21
now it's under 10 and this i was reading
22:24
an article in the telegraph about why
22:25
this is happening about how angry people
22:27
are about it because people used to buy
22:28
their lu roll to match their decor right
22:30
and now they they did that was a thing
22:34
there was someone who wrote into the
22:35
telegraph saying um why is it impossible
22:37
now to buy blue lavatory rolls unless we
22:39
find some soon i will be forced to
22:40
redecorate my bathroom
22:44
there was another one a correspondent in
22:47
bletchingly
22:48
who described a priest friend who used
22:50
to change the hue of his loot rolls to
22:52
match the liturgical seasons
22:56
green for trinity purple for lent and
22:58
advent and pink for saints days
23:00
well there's a lot of saints days isn't
23:02
there yeah he was doing a lot of plural
23:04
changing
23:04
that is amazing i suppose the other
23:06
thing is like you don't really get
23:08
colored um sinks and stuff like that do
23:10
you
23:11
like in the 70s and stuff you get
23:13
avocado sink
23:14
yes yes in fact that was the first time
23:17
i knew the word avocado
23:19
because you didn't have avocados when i
23:20
was growing up you didn't really get
23:22
them in the 70s and 80s
23:24
but um we used the word to describe the
23:26
color of people's toilets
23:28
yes so when people started eating them i
23:30
was so confused
23:32
you break your teeth uh i have one more
23:35
drink that william of orange drank
23:37
um so i'm talking to william of orange
23:40
um who was married to
23:42
mary the so he was the king of england
23:43
there's a few other ones but this is
23:45
that one
23:45
um he drank benediction posit
23:49
which was a mixture of warm milk eggs
23:52
cream
23:52
and ale with nutmeg and custard on top
23:56
and he drank this on his wedding day
23:58
because it was what everyone who was
24:00
rich and posh used to drink on their
24:01
wedding day
24:03
and the priest would come along he would
24:04
bless them uh and then they would give
24:06
them this benediction possess
24:08
and people wouldn't leave until they
24:10
drunk it charles ii
24:12
waited until the bride and bridegroom
24:13
had finished off their bowl of posset
24:15
and then drew the bed curtains himself
24:17
on the day of their wedding
24:19
oh really so i read that he stayed in
24:21
the room shouting encouragement
24:24
there are lots of stories saying he was
24:26
shouting during the consummation but
24:27
we've that's the same before that
24:28
consummation doesn't mean they're
24:29
actually having sex partly i mean the
24:31
bribe was only 15 at the time
24:33
um but yeah that's the story
24:36
so charles we think charles might have
24:37
been there because if he drawn the
24:38
curtain he could sort of stayed on the
24:39
outside shouting encouragement couldn't
24:41
he yeah
24:41
that's not true you know when you were
24:43
younger and you just got
24:51
someone draws the curtain but they still
24:52
give you instructions now you know when
24:54
you go to the loo when you're a kid and
24:55
you're just learning to go
24:56
on your own and your mom stands on the
24:58
other side of the door and she's like
25:00
you know have you wiped your bottom yeah
25:02
maybe so it's sort of like that you pull
25:03
the curtain but you're still outside
25:05
saying
25:05
you know put it there put it there
25:10
no not that high no no that's the
25:13
nostril
25:16
split the difference
25:20
there's another old scottish one which
25:22
is if you're fishing and you catch a
25:24
boot
25:25
that can go either way for you if it's a
25:27
left boot
25:29
that's bad luck you're in serious
25:30
trouble fish are not going to come to
25:32
you if you get a right boot
25:34
you're in much luck and you have to nail
25:36
it to your mast to say
25:37
look at my right boot [ __ ] fish and
25:40
that's
25:41
because in both instances you're in a
25:43
cartoon
25:46
and in neither instance have you caught
25:47
a fish which presumably is the aim
25:51
yes but your boot business back home is
25:53
going you've got a soul
26:02
i was quickly just on rudeness i was
26:04
reading
26:05
danny wallace's book about rudeness
26:07
which is called [ __ ] you very much
26:09
uh the surprising truth about why people
26:11
are so rude and um he did some of his
26:13
own research and he asked what people
26:14
had done because like anna was saying
26:16
people
26:16
if people are rude to you you
26:18
automatically are rude back to them it's
26:19
a weird kind of
26:20
contagion thing he was asking people
26:22
what they had done
26:24
when someone had been rude to them and
26:26
answers included
26:27
i rubbed fries on their windshield i
26:30
turned all their possessions
26:32
upside down i let a dog lick a sausage
26:35
i was serving them and
26:38
i slept with their partner
26:42
that's rude was that all the same person
26:46
i had a very bad day
26:50
i was looking at floors some floors so
26:52
um the world's flattest floor
26:54
is owned by nasa it's in huntsville
26:57
alabama
26:58
and it's made of this kind of resin and
27:00
it's a bit like do you know
27:02
these um air hockey tables yeah so
27:04
there's a cushion of air on it
27:06
and whenever what they do is they kind
27:08
of get like a sofa
27:09
on it or anything they can do it with
27:11
anything but the funnest one is the sofa
27:13
and they have little air coming out of
27:14
the sofa and then they push it along
27:16
this extremely flat floor and it just
27:18
kind of glides along
27:20
it's really really awesome and the way
27:22
that and what it's for is to see what
27:23
it's like in space
27:25
so because it's like there's no friction
27:29
so things just keep moving if you push
27:30
them in one direction they just keep
27:31
moving
27:32
and i think we might have said before
27:33
that nasa around there also has the
27:35
world's biggest door
27:37
and they also have the world's most
27:38
perfect bowls
27:41
which is a pair of mathematically
27:43
perfect spherical bowls
27:45
uh if they are one point they are really
27:48
really small they're just 3.81
27:50
centimeters across
27:51
and if you scale them up to the size of
27:53
the earth then the highest
27:55
hill on there will be 1.5 meters high
27:57
wow
27:58
that's how perfect these balls are and
28:00
is that because um they're such perfect
28:02
spheres in this in space they're
28:03
imitating the sun um
28:06
they're using them for possible future
28:09
gyroscopic motors they don't know what
28:11
they're for do they
28:13
someone thought of the phrase the most
28:14
perfect balls in the world
28:16
and they thought better make those
28:19
you know the same beer before wine
28:21
you'll feel fine
28:22
oh i thought it was one before beer
28:25
feeling queer
28:26
i always get mixed up well it turns out
28:29
that neither of them works oh and this
28:30
is thanks to a scientist who got 90
28:32
students drunk and found that none of
28:33
them felt fine
28:36
no matter he was struck no matter what
28:39
um a combination he got 90
28:42
volunteers and they had i bet he did
28:46
there were only 70 people in this class
28:49
they all had two and a half point there
28:50
was the first group we had two and a
28:51
half pounds of lager and then four big
28:52
glasses of white wine
28:54
and then the second group had the same
28:55
drinks in reverse so you've got bare
28:56
their wine and wine then beer
28:58
and then there was a another group who
29:00
had only beer or wine
29:01
uh up to the same level and they all
29:03
felt terrible the next day
29:05
one in ten of them threw up and they
29:07
were light weights
29:08
yeah i knew you guys
29:12
um can i just say while we're on trains
29:14
this is so apropos
29:15
nothing but um when i was in japan i
29:18
noticed that the train drivers
29:20
they always point and shout stuff at
29:22
themselves while they're driving the
29:24
train
29:25
wherever they go so if you're near the
29:26
front you'll always see this because you
29:27
can see the driver
29:28
and just every like three or four
29:30
minutes they'll just point at something
29:32
that doesn't appear to be anything at
29:33
all
29:34
and they'll just yell something that i
29:35
don't understand right and they're
29:37
yelling to the passengers or to no
29:38
they're yelling to themselves
29:40
and i read this today of what they were
29:41
doing because i looked it up
29:43
they have a thing where every certain
29:45
amount of time they
29:46
point at like just a thing around the
29:49
tracks
29:50
it doesn't matter what it is and they
29:51
shout where they are and what they're
29:53
doing
29:53
and the reason they do it is so they can
29:55
concentrate the whole way
29:56
because if you're not doing that all the
29:58
time you're just kind of my daydream or
30:00
something like that but if every five
30:01
minutes or so you have to point and
30:03
shout something you're never gonna kind
30:05
of
30:05
not think about it that's wonderful
30:06
isn't that great yeah i think it's
30:08
stupid
30:09
has anyone ever read the story of cry
30:10
wolfe what happens when there's actually
30:12
you know a huge bomb in the middle of
30:14
the track and they're pointing and
30:15
shouting
30:16
there's a bomb everyone get off the
30:18
train everyone get off the train and
30:20
everyone's like oh it's just the
30:21
standard five-minute lee
30:22
shouting fest he does maybe he shouts
30:25
something maybe he doesn't always shout
30:26
bob on the track
30:28
maybe he's normally shouting i am
30:30
concentrating now but what i was
30:32
thinking is if you're driving on the
30:33
motorway yeah
30:34
then every time you go past a um a
30:37
junction
30:37
if you were to point at it and shout the
30:39
names of the places
30:40
that junction goes to yeah then it would
30:42
help you concentrate and you get less
30:43
sleepy at the wheel i think is a really
30:45
good tip
30:46
okay also your geography of the uk would
30:48
probably improve
30:50
you keep noticing all these irrelevant
30:51
voices yeah that's true
30:53
have you guys heard of hook swinging no
30:55
no this is another
30:56
indian ritual practiced in the 1890s not
30:59
very much in the 20th century
31:01
but basically in order to make it rain
31:03
if there's a drought
31:04
farmers would find a willing volunteer
31:06
and then they would sew large hooks into
31:08
his back
31:09
and they would lift him 50 feet into the
31:10
air sorry what
31:12
you would be lifted up into the air on
31:13
massive hooks it's very very very
31:16
painful
31:16
to make it rain to make it rain it
31:18
causes you lasting damage obviously
31:20
it's extremely painful however you were
31:22
allowed to keep the hooks afterwards
31:24
bonus but only for three months
31:29
you were allowed why would you keep them
31:31
well you were allowed to keep the hooks
31:33
and the cord
31:34
and the knife for three months
31:35
afterwards and beg with them and show
31:37
people
31:38
look i went through this for the
31:40
community
31:41
um to show your bravery but only for
31:43
three months so when you said
31:44
you had to find a willing volunteer that
31:46
actually does feel like the hardest part
31:48
where were they where were they finding
31:50
these enthusiastic people
31:52
that's a good point also i would
31:54
probably just trust that that was the
31:55
guy who was held 50 feet in the air with
31:57
hooks even if he didn't have them out of
31:58
his back
31:59
i imagine he's a local celebrity imagine
32:02
no one's like
32:02
oh did that happen oh okay no i didn't
32:04
read about that
32:07
um actually a lot of people thought that
32:09
chess wasn't
32:10
um well there are a lot of people who
32:12
thought that chess wasn't a particularly
32:14
intellectual game compared to something
32:16
like west for instance
32:18
and that was because the the argument
32:20
was that chess
32:21
has a finite number of moves there's
32:23
only a certain number of moves you can
32:24
make
32:25
it's quite a high number but it's finite
32:27
and in west you're playing with your
32:29
wits and stuff like that
32:30
and it was kind of like if you're doing
32:32
something which is
32:34
um really regimented maybe that doesn't
32:36
help the creative part of your brain
32:38
that's what they used to say like for
32:40
instance um there was an argument in
32:42
scientific american in 1859 that
32:44
napoleon the great love playing chess
32:46
but he was often beaten by a rough
32:48
grosser
32:48
in saint helena rough in what way
32:52
they didn't specify wasn't an asterisk
32:57
didn't shave much right okay i don't
32:59
really know what rough meant in those
33:00
days
33:01
it says neither shakespeare milton
33:03
newton or any of the great ones of earth
33:05
acquired proficiency in chess playing
33:08
um it seems to help people with an
33:10
intuitive faculty for making the right
33:12
moves
33:13
but at the same time these people have
33:14
often possessed very ordinary faculties
33:17
for other purposes
33:18
so they thought it was only a very
33:20
specific kind of person who'd be good at
33:21
chess
33:22
and they wouldn't necessarily be good at
33:24
other stuff whereas west
33:25
players all of those people you
33:27
mentioned were keem west fans
33:30
i mean if that's what they thought of
33:31
chess imagine their response to angry
33:32
birds
33:34
well you do know pop culture
33:39
there was another um old rule that used
33:41
to be in place which is that you could
33:43
use a baseball bat
33:44
which had a flat side to it like a
33:47
cricket bat
33:48
okay yeah it was it was just to help
33:50
with uh accuracy i
33:52
think yeah yeah um but uh yeah that was
33:54
kicked out so that was between
33:55
1885 and 1893. i think that was for
33:57
power wasn't it wasn't gonna get
33:59
like you can get a bigger hit on it if
34:01
you've got that big flat surface area
34:03
then they ditched it straight away i
34:04
can't remember why maybe it just made
34:06
the game too easy
34:07
i think it i think it was that because
34:09
in cricket for instance a full toss is a
34:11
very easy ball to hit
34:12
yeah um yeah why why then in cricket do
34:16
they have
34:17
the other side of the bat in a triangle
34:20
formation
34:21
well good question and i don't know the
34:24
answer but i would guess
34:25
that it's so that your sweet spot is a
34:27
thicker part of the
34:29
bat so you want your edge to be very
34:31
small because you don't want to edge the
34:33
ball so they can catch it
34:34
but you do need it to be thick so that
34:36
if it hits it right in the middle it
34:37
goes miles so you want it to be thick in
34:39
the middle and thin on the outside
34:41
i don't know for sure i think it's
34:42
because if you flip around the bat the
34:44
last minute then you get a mental angle
34:46
on your back and that's the technique
34:49
they used to use but they've never used
34:51
it since right
34:52
i don't know why they don't use it
34:53
anymore just uh this is just a brand in
34:55
fact nothing to do what we're saying
34:56
just hedges
34:57
um we were doing a live gig the other
34:59
day and someone told us in the audience
35:01
that
35:02
if you go to liverpool there's a hedge
35:03
of all the beatles there
35:05
sitting outside the station um but ringo
35:08
is really hated there
35:09
so people keep trimming his head off and
35:12
they have to wait ages for ringo's head
35:13
to regrow and then someone immediately
35:16
chops it up again yeah so sad on mud
35:20
so there's the disorder where you eat
35:23
soil or dirt it's called pica i think
35:24
where some people eat mud
35:26
but in southern parts of the u.s
35:29
eating mud is a traditional thing that
35:31
some people really enjoy
35:32
and i didn't know this still happened
35:34
but it does so it's in southern states
35:35
like
35:36
kind of mississippi and georgia real
35:38
deep south states
35:39
and people eat kind of clay and it's a
35:41
very specific thing called like white
35:42
mud or white clay
35:44
and it's um clay-rich dirt and they love
35:47
it
35:47
and it's part of the diet it's often
35:49
poorer families it's black and white
35:52
families
35:52
and there are various theories about
35:54
where it came from but i was reading an
35:55
article in the new york times from 1984
35:57
saying this is so tragic the tradition
35:59
of mud eating
36:00
will disappear in the next generation
36:02
and then an article from a couple of
36:04
years ago
36:04
it hasn't disappeared guys it's still
36:07
there
36:08
is it because it's like higher minerals
36:09
and stuff we don't really know
36:11
i think it's maybe it's just a
36:13
traditional thing but they like the
36:14
taste
36:15
of the recipes there are some recipes
36:18
well
36:18
sort of recipes if you count the fact
36:20
that for instance people who like it
36:22
will keep it in jars and sprinkle it
36:23
with salt and vinegar that's a recipe
36:25
okay yeah that's a recipe
36:26
but i thought you said they like the
36:28
taste of it why are they putting salt
36:29
and vinegar on it
36:30
james i like the taste of chips but that
36:32
doesn't mean i don't enhance it
36:34
yes sir right sometimes
36:37
they substitute it for baking soda or
36:40
for
36:41
starch because they can't get to the
36:42
right kind of soil right kind of
36:45
mud but apparently it's not quite the
36:46
same and there was an interview with
36:48
someone called mrs glass
36:49
who said she's been off the dirt for a
36:51
full year
36:52
even though she still gets really strong
36:54
cravings but she's been off the dirt
36:56
because her husband said it makes her
36:57
mouth tastes like mud
37:00
which does make sense it is one of those
37:02
pregnancy cravings that you hear about
37:03
it is yeah yeah my mom had that is she
37:07
yeah mud and coal i think yeah she
37:08
didn't eat coal yeah
37:10
people women do but she just had the
37:12
craving but usually it would be
37:14
charcoal like cousin you would get bits
37:16
of charcoal and you could chew on it oh
37:18
but not
37:18
not a large lump of coal you wouldn't no
37:21
you wouldn't go down to mine
37:23
my dad got home from work every day and
37:25
she was a black face
37:27
full of the coal basket that would have
37:29
been said if you're
37:30
having cravings for you know um gherkins
37:33
you don't eat a billy at the gherkins
37:35
you just need a small amount to get your
37:36
cravings sorted
37:37
yeah it's true it's just this funny idea
37:39
of like replacing miners with
37:41
pregnant women who they know where the
37:43
coal is because they have the desperate
37:44
cravings for it they're just chewing
37:46
through the rock face
37:47
yeah but none comes back up
37:50
just on big shoes yeah yeah odd shoes um
37:53
used to be a big thing
37:55
and they're called crack offs so krakows
37:58
were
37:59
shoes that were really popular from
38:00
about the 13th century to the 15th 16th
38:03
centuries and they're called that after
38:05
the assumed place of origin krakow in
38:07
poland and they're also called pulen
38:09
which is polish polish shoes polishings
38:11
and
38:12
they so it was just fashionable to have
38:13
these incredibly long shoes
38:15
and they would go on for sort of eight
38:17
nine inches and then eventually there
38:19
were various edicts past that said you
38:20
had to limit your toe length to two
38:22
inches which is still quite long
38:24
um and it was partly because it was seen
38:26
as showy like we've talked about
38:28
sanctuary laws before
38:29
and partly because it was quite
38:31
difficult to pray apparently
38:32
because it's quite hard to kneel down
38:34
when you've got a 10 inch
38:36
toe poking out but you can always see if
38:38
somebody's in a toilet stall
38:41
you can usually tell that just from the
38:43
engagement
38:58
you know they're using bacteria to solve
38:59
crimes now
39:01
that's a cup show i want to see um no
39:05
they are using it to solve crimes
39:06
because we all have this fingerprint
39:08
which is our huge cloud of bacteria that
39:10
we're walking around with
39:11
and they're all individual and so um
39:14
police have started thinking
39:15
maybe we can take the bacteria that's
39:17
left in a room that's been burgled
39:19
and then match it to a database of other
39:21
people's bacteria and if there's a match
39:23
they did the robbery but it's quite cool
39:25
because it's a very good plan
39:27
and they've um experimented with it by
39:29
staging a load of mock burglaries
39:31
which just sounded like the funnest
39:33
science experiment to be part of so
39:34
there were 400 study participants
39:36
some homeowners and some who had to
39:38
pretend to burgle their homes
39:40
and they had to properly act it out so
39:42
they did stuff like they rifled through
39:43
all their drawers
39:44
and they like carried away their tv they
39:47
all had to
39:48
they had to open the fridge and kind of
39:49
have a sip of the coke in the fridge
39:51
because that's something that burglars
39:52
do apparently sometimes
39:53
sip of the coke in the fridge yeah
39:54
burgers always do that you know do they
39:56
it's a signature move the one thing that
39:58
burglars do do a lot is poo in houses
40:00
don't they
40:01
sorry to bring it back to poo i think
40:02
they might have asked them to do that as
40:04
well maybe it didn't make it into the
40:05
study write-up but
40:06
apparently that does happen because
40:08
you're so stressed your body just wants
40:10
to
40:10
defecate i've if someone's left a poo in
40:12
a house you probably don't need to swab
40:14
for the microbiome
40:18
we're looking for a corn cob who
40:19
committed this robbery
40:29
if the four of us are in this room we
40:30
all have our our bacteria
40:33
what did you call it the cloud the biome
40:35
will all be
40:36
so different so noticeably different
40:38
yeah well the thing is
40:39
the more you hang out with people you're
40:41
more the more your biome is similar to
40:43
theirs because you
40:43
end up sharing bacteria yeah there is a
40:47
thing
40:47
yeah we're basically all the same
40:49
microbiome now probably well not really
40:51
the same but they are still really
40:52
individual
40:53
yeah yeah exactly people develop really
40:55
differently and you develop it in like
40:56
the first three or four years of your
40:57
life i think
40:58
specifically the stuff that your
40:59
bacteria you're going to want the other
41:01
thing is you can get a hotel room
41:03
and i think it's within something like
41:04
two or three hours that room will be
41:06
indistinguishable from your actual house
41:08
from the microbes in there
41:10
oh okay yeah and also because i always
41:12
take all my furniture to the hotel room
41:16
i always do it with the car
41:22
that's crazy they're using that for
41:23
crime that's crazy that would be really
41:25
weird if you could see
41:26
so if you spend all your time for
41:28
example with a dancing partner like on
41:30
strictly
41:30
if your microbiome came closer to your
41:32
dancing partners than it was to your
41:34
real life partner at home
41:35
i'd like to see that headline daily
41:37
express
41:39
sean walsh's microbiome
41:44
uh we're gonna have to move on to our
41:45
next fact in a second um i got one
41:48
last thing that i like which is that um
41:49
in 1956 there was an english composer
41:52
who is quite well known at the time
41:54
called malcolm arnold and he actually uh
41:56
wrote
41:57
a a overture for vacuums so
42:00
when you saw it it was vacuums on stage
42:02
it was three vacuums there was one floor
42:04
polisher
42:04
um four rifles bizarrely um and then an
42:08
actual orchestra and it was a piece that
42:09
he put on uh called the grand grand
42:12
and the and it was dedicated to us
42:14
president herbert hoover
42:16
so that was quite a nice thing very good
42:23
just on them losers as you were just
42:25
saying anna in
42:27
the campaign okay dan you know let's do
42:29
this backstage
42:32
um just some other rainmaking ceremonies
42:33
oh yeah because
42:35
they've always existed in hot countries
42:37
i guess because people need rain and
42:39
they are quite a big thing in various
42:41
parts of africa so in south africa
42:43
the lavadoo people have a rain queen and
42:46
the rain queen is basically their ruler
42:48
or they always have had traditionally
42:50
long may she rain long may she rain
42:53
indeed and she that sort of implies that
42:56
she's sort of urinating on her people as
42:58
a replacement for rain which she doesn't
42:59
do don't smile my little pun
43:01
sorry i've got disgusting images
43:05
so this is this woman who isn't allowed
43:07
to marry herself but she can have female
43:09
wives
43:10
um invested commons and so she also has
43:13
to bear at least
43:14
one child at least one daughter because
43:16
you inherit it um from your mother
43:18
so she has to bear one daughter by a
43:20
royal relative interesting rule
43:21
um and then age 60 when she hit 60 it's
43:24
assumed that her powers of making the
43:26
rain come or sometimes stopping the rain
43:28
uh her powers are perceived to have
43:29
waned and she is expected to commit
43:31
suicide by poison
43:32
oh and so she has to do this and there
43:35
was this really controversial scandal
43:37
in 1959 when the reigning rain queen
43:41
um refused to bloody committed suicide
43:44
she was
43:44
she was 80 and people kept going come on
43:46
you've lost your powers now do the thing
43:48
so your daughter can take over and she
43:49
understandably was like
43:51
i don't want to and so this sort of like
43:54
ruined the tradition for a while but
43:55
it's being brought back so the next rain
43:57
queen when she comes of age when she
43:58
turns 18 in a couple of years
44:00
is coming back into the fall have they
44:02
fixed the
44:03
um succession procedure i think they
44:06
might have tinkered with it a little bit
44:07
around the edges
44:09
yeah it's more optional these days
44:12
rain dance is quite big in north america
44:15
as well
44:16
uh historically uh they're probably the
44:18
ones we know of
44:19
most or we hear of most um the hoppy
44:22
snake and antelope ceremony
44:24
uh is quite a common one and people
44:27
wrote about this a whole lot
44:29
um because it was performed in august it
44:32
was to ensure abundant rainfall
44:34
but it used live snakes and they did
44:37
loads of different ceremonies all the
44:38
time for loads of different things but
44:40
this was the only one that used live
44:41
snakes and so this was the one that
44:42
became really famous
44:44
and that's why the north american rain
44:46
dance became one of the more famous
44:48
kind of ceremonies that they all had and
44:49
it's because it had snakes in it
44:51
and these snakes were exciting yeah
44:53
that's very cool do we know what
44:54
they did um you would dance around in a
44:57
circle
44:58
i mean me saying that makes it sound
45:01
like i'm just
45:02
doing a throwaway comment of what you
45:04
did it was very important yeah but yeah
45:05
basically it was dancing around in a
45:07
circle with live snakes
45:08
was the snake in the middle of the
45:09
circle were you holding the snake i
45:11
think you were handling the snake in
45:12
fact i know you're handling the snake
45:13
okay
45:14
yeah otherwise the snake might leave the
45:16
circle get a bit bored
45:17
probably doesn't believe in this you
45:19
know city it might have been ahead of
45:21
us scientifically
45:25
there was a cypriot rain ritual
45:28
in ancient times where you had to do a
45:30
rain dance and then after the dance you
45:31
had to spit
45:32
on the back of a turtle okay and in the
45:34
book i was reading it said that
45:35
henceforth it became popular as a spit
45:38
turtle such a rubbish jumped out
45:41
it's awful that's like at school if
45:43
someone spits on you once you get known
45:45
as spit handy or something
45:47
was it allowed to keep the saliva on its
45:49
shelf
45:52
it's a museum in kansas it's a very
45:54
small museum but it's um
45:55
it pays homage to all the losers of
45:58
presidential campaigns so it's got a
46:00
picture of them a bit of a biography
46:01
um and it's run um by this lady who
46:05
when i was reading the article she was
46:06
very excited about the last
46:08
election that you guys had because um
46:10
she really wanted hillary clinton to
46:12
lose
46:13
and i don't know if it's because she
46:14
didn't want her as president
46:16
it was more that she was excited to have
46:18
the first woman ever
46:19
in her museum and she's really proud of
46:23
that finally a woman will be in the
46:26
losing museum we have to find these
46:29
silver linings where we can
46:31
um do you know how you can weigh a whale
46:35
no oh well at a railway station
46:38
well no so it used to be that to weigh a
46:42
whale you would have to
46:43
um get one that's been beached or one
46:45
that's dead something like that but it's
46:47
really hard to
46:48
weigh them in the wild um but they've
46:49
got this new system of drones
46:51
wow which you're able to estimate the
46:53
weight of whales from the
46:54
from the sky cool so they no longer have
46:56
to shove a set of weighing scales
46:58
underneath the beach whale
46:59
well mostly it's just that joke doesn't
47:01
work anymore
47:04
another joke ruined by the scientists of
47:06
the world
47:07
you bastards i actually also have a
47:10
french
47:11
so this is very tangential though but
47:12
it's a french and fast food fact
47:14
which is about uh in 2016 there was a
47:17
mcdonald's in france which was subject
47:18
to an armed robbery
47:20
and two guys burst in with uh guns they
47:23
were armed it's obviously very
47:24
terrifying for the customers and they
47:25
wanted
47:26
all the money in the till which is about
47:27
1500 quid i think
47:29
but unfortunately for the two robbers
47:31
also dining in the restaurant were 11
47:32
off-duty members of the french sas
47:36
yeah the french paramilitary special
47:38
forces and they're really really good
47:40
and they kept their cool they didn't do
47:41
anything during the hold up and then
47:43
when one of the robbers was leaving he
47:44
tripped a bit and immediately they
47:46
pounced on him
47:47
and then they shot the other one in the
47:49
abdomen but still
47:51
well they took him to hospital i don't
47:53
think he died i mean he was
47:54
but then sent to prison for on robbery
47:56
okay so
47:58
it's a funny story with one quite bad
48:00
sounding injury at the heart of it
48:05
why did they wait for him to trip what
48:07
if they didn't trip they didn't
48:08
immediately want to
48:09
start firing their guns in the
48:11
restaurant because they
48:13
thought well there are customers here
48:14
and we want to yes customers are
48:15
enjoying their meals
48:17
trying to blank out the armed robbery
48:19
i'm imagining that um
48:20
ronald mcdonald has stood there with his
48:22
massive clown shoes and he kind of trips
48:26
i don't know what would have happened if
48:27
the guy hadn't tripped i'm sure they
48:28
would have thought of some other way of
48:29
resolving the situation
48:30
i know yeah yeah i'm sure that's not the
48:33
strategy
48:34
of all of the franchisees do not make a
48:37
move to
48:37
one of them trips do you guys know the
48:39
um chess pieces the pawns
48:41
they used to have jobs each of them well
48:44
did they work as so in the middle ages
48:46
monks tried to represent them
48:47
as citizens that was the idea and so you
48:50
had
48:51
an agricultural worker you had a farrier
48:54
you had a weaver
48:55
the fourth was a businessman there was a
48:56
doctor an innkeeper
48:58
a policeman and the last one was a
49:00
gambler wow
49:02
yeah but policeman so that's no longer
49:04
used that would have made blindfold
49:05
chess
49:05
a lot harder wouldn't it if you had to
49:07
remember all every individual pawn
49:10
yeah also you would think they would
49:12
have pawn broker and porn star
49:15
yeah yeah i'm not sure it'd have been
49:16
invented in the middle ages well
49:18
brokery pawn brokery had been i think
49:22
and well the queen didn't used to be a
49:24
piece either so and the queen wasn't a
49:26
piece until about 600 a.d
49:28
and then she was really rubbish for ages
49:30
because you know queens were quite i
49:31
thought it was quite inferior you know a
49:33
male should be the leader
49:34
and this only changed in the 15th
49:36
century when the queen came along who
49:37
was actually decent and people started
49:39
to say hey queens could be powerful and
49:40
this was queen isabella of castile so it
49:42
was isabella and ferdinand
49:44
and basically their relationship mirrors
49:46
the one of the king and the queen on the
49:47
board
49:48
she could only walk one step in any
49:49
direction and she was legging it
49:51
everywhere
49:53
he was always running and hiding behind
49:55
the baker and the candlestick maker or
49:56
whatever
49:57
was it but no behind the castile
50:00
yeah yes
50:03
um no she so when they got married she
50:06
forced him into this really humiliating
50:07
marriage where she got much more
50:08
authority than him
50:10
she used to ride out to command troops
50:11
on her own leaving him behind
50:13
she was made queen of a particular
50:14
country or state and she didn't even
50:15
bother to tell him about it but yeah
50:17
then they changed the queen and made her
50:18
more powerful and one argument to say
50:20
this is why that happened is that in
50:21
russia
50:22
the queen remained impotent until the
50:24
18th century
50:25
um when catherine the great came in and
50:27
then she got a lot of power there
50:29
um just this is not to go out really but
50:31
i just found out that um
50:33
i found the paper called reservoir dogs
50:35
and the implications for disease control
50:37
because obviously a reservoir is the
50:39
animal that the um
50:41
disease lives in oh and this is from the
50:44
early 80s which is before reservoir dogs
50:46
came out and no one knows where the name
50:48
reservoir dogs
50:49
came you're kidding yeah so my theory is
50:51
that tarantino was reading a very
50:53
obscure
50:54
medical paper about rabies in zimbabwe
50:58
and that's where he got the name from
50:59
nobody knows where the film's name comes
51:00
from no he
51:01
when he was selling it he claimed that
51:03
it was a gangster term for a rat
51:06
but actually that's not true and some
51:08
people think he might have
51:10
misheard the name of the title of the
51:11
movie au revoir
51:14
uh which is a friend's movie yeah it is
51:16
it's not very similar to reservoir dogs
51:17
is it
51:18
but yeah and also it doesn't sound very
51:20
much like reservoir dogs
51:22
no i believe your theory
51:26
um i just just one thing about um
51:29
someone who dealt with syphilis and this
51:30
is in the early 18th century there was a
51:32
guy called daniel turner
51:34
and he was the first person ever to use
51:36
the term syphilis
51:37
uh to refer to the illness so it came
51:39
from actually an epic poem
51:41
written about a hundred years earlier
51:42
about a guy who got it
51:44
uh in short and so he was called the guy
51:47
in the poem was called syphilis
51:48
he was a shepherd yes exactly it was a
51:50
poem about a shepherd called syphilis
51:52
and so then this this doctor said okay
51:54
well let's call this disease syphilis
51:56
like a boy named sue but worse
52:00
sue's poor sister um and so
52:03
and he also wrote about the use of
52:05
another new word that he had coined
52:07
the condom um so it's about um but i
52:10
think they're the same thing
52:12
um and he said that's the most effective
52:13
thing to prevent its transmission this
52:14
was 1717.
52:16
um but i was reading the thing the
52:18
report he wrote on it and he said the
52:20
condom is the best if not the only
52:22
preservative that we have from syphilis
52:24
but by reason of its blunting sensation
52:26
i have heard people say they've chosen
52:27
to risk the clap
52:29
rather than engage come hastis
52:37
and we're so sorry that you've got that
52:41
i actually really want to know if you
52:43
did get that did anyone get the latin
52:46
for that
52:46
no well i really enjoy the idea of
52:48
putting really rude stuff in latin to
52:50
uh make it more appropriate but it means
52:52
with spears thus
52:54
sheathed would you have a sheath for a
52:57
spear
52:58
you have a sheath for a sword sure
53:00
that's right it's a long sheath
53:02
or or it's a tiny sheath just for the
53:05
head of the spear
53:07
but both of them feel impractical in the
53:09
battle situation
53:11
let me just cut my feet
53:15
he hadn't thought it through you're
53:16
completely right he was
53:18
feeling so smug about the latin
53:20
translation
53:22
have you guys heard about james harrison
53:25
no
53:25
james harrison um he's an 81 year old or
53:28
sorry this is few years ago now but he
53:30
at the time he retired from being a
53:32
donor a blood donor at 81 years old and
53:34
he'd been donating blood for
53:36
every week virtually every week for 60
53:38
years of his life
53:39
um and he was known as the man with the
53:41
golden arm and in australia
53:43
he had a very rare type of blood which
53:46
they reckon there was only
53:47
sort of like 50 people or so that had it
53:49
and it was very important um because
53:52
mothers who were pregnant um they would
53:54
have rhesus positive blood
53:56
but if the baby had reese's negative
53:58
blood which would be inherited from the
53:59
father
54:00
that would go against the baby and it
54:01
would start killing the baby inside the
54:03
womb so they used his
54:04
blood specifically to save all of these
54:08
babies and
54:08
the australian red cross believe that
54:11
over the years he saved the lives of 2.4
54:13
million
54:14
australian babies from the 60 years of
54:16
giving blood 17
54:18
of women are at risk of this in
54:19
australia and every single batch of
54:21
anti-d
54:22
as it's called is from this guy wow yeah
54:25
so he's an absolute hero
54:27
um and he's just retired um kind of
54:30
mean to retire to be honest
54:36
stick out no i've done a good long time
54:38
saving children and now i'm going to
54:39
stop
54:42
wow crazy though right i was reading a
54:45
tiny bit about
54:46
dog research because dogs have been
54:48
researched on
54:49
in historic medicine for so long because
54:51
they were just a useful thing that was
54:52
always around
54:53
quite tame and so you know pavlov of dog
54:56
fame yeah
54:56
um he had some breakthrough dog research
55:00
although his most most of his
55:01
breakthroughs weren't what we now think
55:02
of him
55:03
as doing so obviously we think of the
55:05
pavlovian dog responses
55:06
a behavioral thing but really he was
55:08
interested in dog digestion
55:10
i think it's that kind of thing that he
55:11
got his nobel prize for in 1904
55:13
and not the experiment that people know
55:15
but one of the things that he did was
55:17
he looked it was really interesting dog
55:19
saliva and how dogs generate when dogs
55:22
generated saliva
55:23
and that he did this thing where he
55:26
created
55:27
fistulas in the esophagus of dogs and
55:30
so a little hole with a tube attached
55:32
which meant that when dogs ate
55:34
it would just come straight out again of
55:37
its neck and not go into its stomach
55:39
to find out what would happen if they
55:40
weren't getting the hung the
55:42
you know if they weren't filling up
55:43
their stomach because they ate yeah and
55:45
so we had all these dogs with food just
55:47
how frustrating would that be yeah eat
55:48
your food and it just falls straight out
55:50
of you again
55:51
what is going on that's like um a
55:54
torture in
55:55
but that you'd be given by the gods in
55:56
the afterlife it is isn't it
55:58
yeah forever hungry yeah yeah
56:01
he also used to sell quite a lot of dog
56:03
saliva i think
56:04
he what food he made quite a lot of
56:06
money out of it yeah he had a dog
56:07
gastric juice factory
56:10
that's just a duck
56:13
he does make him sound very evil yeah
56:15
yeah i think he wasn't a nice guy anyway
56:17
a lot of people say
56:18
but this one particularly he just had
56:20
these dogs working to produce loads of
56:22
saliva
56:23
and what was the purpose of selling it
56:25
the idea was that it helped out with
56:27
things like um dyspepsia and stuff sorry
56:29
you would drink it
56:30
yeah yeah before you were saying that
56:34
you would kiss a dog i know you're like
56:36
no i said jumborelli sorry it's a word
56:39
i'm not familiar
56:43
um i just have a couple of things about
56:46
saliva great humans um
56:49
obviously when the plague was around so
56:51
the 1400s
56:52
and the 1500s that was a massive thing
56:54
where kissing almost became taboo
56:56
because
56:57
they thought that that's what was
56:58
spreading it so so they stopped
57:00
um but what i didn't realize was the
57:02
alternatives to not kissing to make sure
57:04
you still had great
57:06
sort of sexual contact with your partner
57:08
uh in the face
57:10
and
57:17
and nibbling of eyebrows sorry wait a
57:19
minute lick
57:20
so you couldn't kiss because you didn't
57:22
want to get any bacteria going over but
57:23
you could just lick someone's face i
57:25
think you'd lick their forehead or their
57:27
ear or
57:27
you know go for just yeah general away
57:30
from the mouth legs
57:32
nibbling of eyebrows was a yeah was a
57:35
safe alternative supposedly
57:36
at the time wow so would you lick
57:39
someone on the cheek
57:40
if you didn't really know them and pick
57:41
them up in the middle of the face if
57:43
they were
57:43
your partner if you're in france you'd
57:45
have to lick them
57:48
that's so true can i just tell you about
57:51
a news story from 2012
57:53
which was quite good so this was about a
57:56
leak
57:56
in a statue of jesus and it was in the
57:59
catholic church
58:00
in mumbai and the toe of jesus started
58:04
leaking and so a miracle was immediately
58:06
declared
58:08
it was obviously holy water because his
58:09
toe was crying and so
58:11
lots of lots of people came and visited
58:14
that's way more evil
58:18
lots of people came and visited this
58:19
sobbing toe and the church promoted it
58:21
as a site of pilgrimage
58:22
and you know it was quite good for
58:24
tourism in the in this relatively
58:26
back water of mumbai and then this guy
58:28
called sanal edema ruku
58:30
who is a rationalist a buzzkill
58:36
to investigate and he found that it was
58:38
moisture from an overflowing drain that
58:39
was being fed by a pipe issued from a
58:41
nearby toilet
58:42
and he was investigated for blasphemy by
58:45
various police stations then has fled to
58:47
finland where he's been in exile for the
58:48
last
58:50
seven years yeah so that's
58:53
seven years when jesus christ don't say
58:55
it's a toilet
58:57
it's quite right it's weird though isn't
58:58
it like if you have water coming from
59:00
you
59:00
if i have water coming from one of my
59:02
toes i would say it was probably sweat
59:04
yes not like holy water or tears or
59:06
anything no
59:07
i have i mean i've embellished with the
59:09
tears it was it was holy water it was
59:11
holy toe water
59:12
yeah totally water totally water very
59:15
good
59:16
um can i just do one more quick thing
59:17
about leaks um
59:19
so here's a family thing which isn't
59:22
really it's not a legal thing but
59:24
i read it the other day and i think it's
59:25
kind of cool in medieval scandinavia
59:28
they would have civil wars
59:29
and families would often put brothers on
59:32
opposite sides
59:33
of the battles so to hedge their bets so
59:36
that one of them would survive the war
59:38
oh wow that's cool it's quite clever
59:41
it's dark
59:42
it's dark but it makes sense it does so
59:45
that's you want to continue your genetic
59:46
line and yeah
59:47
exactly you want to make sure that
59:49
there's some or someone to look after
59:51
you in old age or to look after the farm
59:52
or whatever so you would put
59:54
um yeah one brother on each side but the
59:55
thing is with war it's not like
59:57
the winning side in a war every single
59:59
person survived and the losing side
60:01
everyone died
60:02
you could very easily put them on either
60:04
side and they're both killed and then
60:05
you look like an idiot
60:07
but what would often happen afterwards
60:09
is like the losing
60:10
group would be punished yeah okay but if
60:13
you put two on the same side
60:15
it gives that side a tiny extra
60:16
advantage it does but then if the
60:18
neighbors have got three kids and they
60:19
put them on the other side oh yeah
60:21
yeah it's always a problem isn't that
60:22
the answer is not to have a wall
60:24
or any kids yeah
60:29
um so there are enclave countries as
60:31
well aren't there which are countries
60:32
wholly inside other countries oh yeah
60:34
uh so lesotho in south africa
60:37
literally in south africa actually is
60:39
one of them and one of them is san
60:40
marino
60:41
this tiny country inside italy it's like
60:44
so italy has two
60:45
smaller entities within it the vatican
60:47
and san marino and
60:49
in night i this is kind of off the
60:51
beaten track a bit but
60:52
in 1999 san marino was really worried
60:55
about its male
60:56
citizens being ensnared by sexy foreign
60:58
women
60:59
and it banned them bandeau women it
61:01
legally
61:02
led us it legislated it banned any
61:05
female domestic servants younger than
61:07
50.
61:08
so
61:16
there was this sort of panic in san
61:18
marino about foreign women
61:20
uh coming as carers and domestic
61:22
servants and marrying the elderly men
61:24
they were looking after
61:25
and maybe not with their best interests
61:27
at heart maybe there was some financial
61:28
motive or something
61:29
so it literally just banned any female
61:32
domestic servants under the age of 50.
61:34
assuming that if once you get to the age
61:35
of 50 you're probably fine
61:37
1999. i know i don't know if it's ever
61:40
been repealed as well actually
61:42
well only one way to find out if there's
61:44
anyone under the age of 50 who fancies a
61:46
trip to san marino
61:47
and then prison yeah i found someone who
61:50
uh was the arch enemy of gravity
61:54
so he was a man called roger babson and
61:58
he was an american businessman he was a
62:00
newton fanatic he made a lot of his
62:02
money using newton's principles in
62:04
business you know for every action
62:06
there's an equal and opposite reaction
62:08
and he
62:09
he had he had a sad life he lost a
62:10
couple of close relatives to drowning
62:13
and he instead of blaming the water
62:15
conditions he decided
62:16
gravity was the culprit because it
62:18
pulled them down
62:20
so he described old man gravity as our
62:23
enemy number one
62:24
he wrote this essay uh he said broken
62:26
hips and other broken bones as well as
62:28
numerous
62:29
circulatory intestinal and other
62:31
internal troubles are directly due
62:33
to the people's inability to counteract
62:35
gravity
62:36
at a critical moment and he founded a
62:39
gravity research foundation
62:40
to basically destroy gravity if he could
62:43
and how is that going it's ongoing
62:46
it's they they now have slightly pivoted
62:50
away from that and um
62:51
they just sort of research it i did read
62:53
about that guy he's pretty amazing
62:55
he believed that there was a metal alloy
62:58
which had anti-gravity
63:00
properties and if they would be able to
63:02
find it they'd be able to like
63:03
he said they'd be able to coat airplanes
63:05
in it to make it possible for them to
63:07
crash
63:08
but he didn't say how they'd be able to
63:09
land
63:12
but he actually this institute that he
63:14
put a lot of money in it was both
63:16
him and captain bird's eye so he put the
63:19
money in
63:20
who i don't know if you have that in
63:21
america actually captain bird's eye but
63:22
he's like a frozen food guy
63:24
uh and but he was real and he made a lot
63:27
of money from frozen
63:30
feels to me like the bigger headline
63:31
it's like captain bird's eyes well not
63:33
here
63:33
but just so you guys know anyone who's
63:35
now listening to this podcast back in
63:36
england has just gone
63:38
what the [ __ ] do you guys not have
63:41
captain bird's eye
63:43
guys you don't know what you're missing
63:44
he's very fun he sells you fish fingers
63:46
and he sort of powers around on boats
63:47
with children they got captain all right
63:49
they've got captain crunch captain
63:50
crunch is different
63:54
seat is no qualification for this there
63:56
is probably a secret club where captain
63:58
crunch and captain bird's eye hang out
63:59
together
64:00
bitching about gravity
64:03
so he was an anti-gravity yeah he was
64:06
and when he first put the money into
64:07
this him and captain bird's eye
64:10
they paid for three people to sit in the
64:12
u.s patent office
64:14
just looking for any patents that were
64:16
anti-gravity inventions
64:18
and then as soon as one came in they
64:19
would go and find that person and go
64:21
have you found it have you found it and
64:22
they never did
64:24
ah he does there's a grant that
64:27
his company give to lots of universities
64:29
and one of the rules of the receiving
64:31
the grant is that they have to get this
64:32
monument
64:33
where he has words about his personal
64:35
but it's quite
64:36
coded but it sort of says i don't think
64:38
gravity is a thing will conquer it
64:41
so they have that sort of planted at
64:42
these universities um
64:44
but a few of the universities from what
64:45
i've read the students like to push it
64:47
over
64:50
i tried to find a site called i tried to
64:52
find if there was a youtuber
64:54
like with it with an a at the end oh
64:56
yeah the website for tuba people oh yeah
64:57
there isn't sadly
64:58
well there's a niche there's a niche and
65:00
then i tried to find youtuber
65:02
like for potatoes oh yeah uh is that no
65:05
well there might be but to be honest
65:07
it's so hard to search youtuber
65:08
with an er with potatoes in mind
65:12
and like you have to put minus quite a
65:14
lot of things you have to put minus
65:15
pewdiepie miners exactly
65:17
zoella and all of this i did find a guy
65:18
who made a self-driving potato two years
65:20
ago
65:21
did you hear about this um bizarrely no
65:25
yeah of course i saw that on youtube
65:27
absolutely
65:30
um i've been looking at the chess
65:32
records
65:33
sorry not chess records the record
65:34
company the wikipedia
65:37
you know chess was a record label was it
65:39
yeah now we do hang on
65:41
no it's a music record label i think it
65:44
was a record label called chess
65:45
that was an extremely esoteric joke i
65:47
think yeah
65:48
it was you meant to unconfuse us and
65:50
you've actually confused yourself a lot
65:51
more
65:52
what i meant to say was i've been
65:53
looking at the wikipedia page for the
65:54
records in competitive chats yeah it was
65:56
a musical called chess
65:58
yes so i think there was a record label
66:00
that might make sense
66:01
there are so many record labels aren't
66:03
there anyway
66:06
i was eating an apple and i don't mean
66:07
the record level
66:10
there's a company called love honey that
66:12
makes uh sex toys and stuff like that
66:14
and they recently revealed the weirdest
66:15
search terms they've ever had
66:17
and that included pepperami lube
66:22
a few others uh pies for women to get
66:24
horny
66:26
and pickled onion condoms
66:29
wow no no
66:32
probably not probably not this time
66:37
pope gregory issued a special decree
66:39
saying that satan was half
66:40
cat wow all right so not all popes have
66:43
been fans of cats yeah wow because there
66:44
was
66:45
paul ii who and he was the 15th century
66:47
pope who had his cat treated by his own
66:50
personal doctor
66:51
and then pope paul the sixth had his cat
66:55
dressed up in mini cardinals robes
66:56
apparently although
66:58
i've never seen a drawing i don't know
66:59
if we have evidence of these tiny cat
67:01
cardinal robes but
67:02
it's called the vatican not the catechin
67:05
yeah
67:05
very nice oh now come on that was good
67:12
i was reading about so spartacus the
67:14
movie spartacus
67:15
uh starring kurt douglas so kurt douglas
67:18
has michael douglas as a son
67:19
but then he also has eric douglas and
67:22
eric douglas is a lesser known uh you
67:24
know you haven't really heard of him
67:25
right so
67:26
he was in the industry as well and
67:27
there's a very famous story of him
67:29
uh going to london to do stand-up comedy
67:31
and he did it in a london club
67:33
and he started telling jokes and he was
67:35
getting nothing from anyone
67:37
and he got really angry on stage for the
67:39
fact that he was getting nothing
67:40
so he suddenly turned on the crowd and
67:43
he was furious with them and he was
67:44
saying
67:44
to them do you know who i am i'm kirk
67:47
douglas's son
67:48
and someone in the audience stood up and
67:50
went no i'm kirk douglas's son
67:57
fantastic i was looking at very very
68:01
loud things
68:02
we mentioned um krakatoa a while ago we
68:04
said it was the loudest noise ever
68:06
i looked into it a bit more how loud it
68:09
is
68:09
so that was the volcano that went off in
68:11
the yes in 18th century
68:13
16 i think was that tambora it was 1883
68:17
yeah yeah 1883 it happened
68:18
um but the krakatoa was the equivalent
68:20
of hearing a noise in new york that
68:22
happened
68:23
in ireland and it would take it would
68:26
take four hours to get to you
68:28
and it was so there was a ship 40 miles
68:31
away from krakatoa when it went off
68:32
uh 40 miles away the ship was blasted so
68:35
much that half the cruise eardrums were
68:37
shattered and the captain had no idea
68:39
what was going on he wrote in his diary
68:40
i am convinced the day of judgment has
68:42
come just because this noise
68:43
was so loud imagine having the
68:45
wherewithal to write update your journal
68:53
you've got like 10 minutes left to live
68:55
max what are you gonna do
68:56
well i better report this
69:00
used to be a thing where the vacuum
69:03
cleaner was only in one place in your
69:04
home
69:05
and you would attach huge tubes to it so
69:07
the vacuum cleaner had its own spot in
69:09
the house
69:10
i mean it stays in one place in my home
69:11
certainly
69:14
so you never you didn't move it around
69:15
you didn't move it around you just have
69:17
a little
69:17
great long tube to the bit you needed
69:19
sucked at or cleaned
69:20
um but then the hubert cecil booth who
69:23
was a huge figure in the vacuum cleaner
69:24
invention process
69:26
he created a giant vacuum cleaner for
69:28
cinemas which was hidden
69:30
basically inside the walls of the cinema
69:32
so imagine see this
69:34
it's in the building and um there are
69:37
pipes going through the walls to all
69:38
sorts of different
69:39
like power points vacuum sockets in the
69:41
cinema
69:42
and when you want to clean you find the
69:44
vacuum point in the floor
69:45
and you open that up and it's just
69:47
constantly sucking away
69:48
cool at that point and you just attach
69:50
the hose to that and get hoovering
69:52
so were there ever accidents where it
69:53
was opened at the wrong moment and a
69:54
whole audience got sucked into it
69:56
thousands that's why they stopped it too
69:58
many deaths
70:00
can see that you know hedgehogs can get
70:02
balloon syndrome
70:04
why have you said that like it's
70:06
something we all know oh well
70:08
i've seen one with it it's amazing yeah
70:09
i've heard of it yeah
70:11
it's just it's mainly just referring to
70:12
balloon syndrome as like they get flu
70:14
you know they can get balloon syndrome
70:16
so sorry balloon syndrome is a condition
70:19
that hedgehogs can get
70:20
there um and it basically it's because
70:24
they have lots of space under their skin
70:27
and this is to allow them to roll up it
70:29
helps them roll up but if air gets
70:31
trapped under their skin and it keeps
70:32
getting in they can just blow up and up
70:33
and up and up
70:34
and then they can be the size of a beach
70:36
ball so and then the best thing to do is
70:39
genuinely
70:39
to pop a needle into it and drain the
70:42
air you're kidding can you take one of
70:43
their own needles
70:46
yeah probably yeah probably god that's
70:48
oh that's the ultimate irony isn't it
70:50
it's like being a balloon made of
70:51
needles
70:51
yeah yeah oh so sad but if they learn to
70:54
cooperate
70:55
then they'd be able to puncture each
70:57
other's balloon syndrome so that's the
70:58
lesson we've learned here right
70:59
if they join forces they'd like a needle
71:01
out of each other yeah
71:02
that's a good point you know they've got
71:04
drawstrings around them what's hedgehogs
71:07
they kind of they have to give a money
71:08
person oh sorry i'm thinking of money
71:09
purses again
71:10
no they have this muscle called an
71:11
orbicularis and it's a ridge of muscle
71:13
which goes all the way around it's like
71:15
a skirt
71:16
basically and it's what allows them to
71:18
roll up so they just tighten the
71:19
orbicularis and the drawstring just
71:21
closes
71:22
and they can stay like that for hours
71:24
but but when they run
71:26
they hitch up their skirt basically and
71:28
they have these weird long legs
71:29
so if you look up footage of a hedgehog
71:31
running it's got much longer legs than
71:33
you're used to because it's just
71:34
lifted up a skirt all around it no way
71:37
bizarre you guys heard of the game
71:38
uh campaign for north africa yes that's
71:42
incredible campaign i don't know if we i
71:43
don't think we've spoken about it before
71:44
campaign for north africa
71:45
the desert war 1940 to 1943
71:49
um it takes roughly they've worked out
71:51
50 days
71:52
without breaks to complete the game and
71:55
you need 10 players
71:56
um it comes with 1600 cardboard tokens
72:00
yeah wow and it's so it's so detailed
72:03
it's stretched the map that you play on
72:05
it stretches out 10 feet
72:06
yeah you see how big it's a big big
72:08
table basically but
72:10
so it's it's mostly sums the game the
72:12
campaign for north africa it's made by a
72:13
guy called richard berg who
72:15
you know just wanted to develop the most
72:17
complicated and realistic
72:20
and it's the campaign for gameplay
72:22
africa is that it's just old desert
72:24
yeah yeah is it yeah it's not a great
72:26
game
72:28
what are you saying i just think you
72:29
could make it smaller
72:31
yeah or even cut out the desert yeah
72:39
um so for example there is a thing in
72:41
the game which you have to do
72:42
you you just get a sheet of paper and
72:44
it's mostly some so
72:45
every game turn 3 of your fuel
72:48
evaporates
72:49
unless you're the british before a
72:51
certain date because they used rather
72:52
inefficient means of storing their fuel
72:54
they use drums instead of jerry cans so
72:56
if you're british before a certain date
72:57
seven percent evaporates every turn
72:59
amazing if you're italian you have to
73:01
have
73:02
uh you have to distribute an extra water
73:04
ration to your troops
73:05
so that they can boil their pasta
73:07
otherwise
73:08
yeah otherwise there is a greater risk
73:11
that they will become disorganized and
73:12
dessert
73:15
this is incredible they worked out that
73:18
if you played this game as a hobby
73:20
um so the game which is the desert war
73:21
in 1940 and 1943
73:23
if it was done as a hobby you could make
73:25
it last longer than the war itself
73:27
for playing it and it was more traumatic
73:30
shall we finish
73:34
you know how you were saying about how
73:35
um you would give
73:37
lambs blood to someone to make them more
73:39
lamb-like
73:40
yes yeah um another thing they kind of
73:42
thought was a good idea was if you had
73:44
fallen out with your husband or wife
73:46
um your discord might be settled by
73:49
giving each other your blood
73:51
so i might swap blood with my wife and
73:53
then it would kind of bring her to my
73:55
point of view all the other way around
73:56
wow and would you so would you maybe
73:59
sneakily inject the other person with it
74:02
yeah yeah yeah i think you'll find i'm
74:04
right though
74:06
wow i do believe you're right that's
74:07
weird um no it would be like
74:10
if you've been if you've had problems in
74:11
your marriage for a long period of time
74:13
ah
74:14
then it might kind of solve things well
74:16
so you're saying it's the last
74:17
resort it's the last result before
74:19
getting divorced this is one thing you
74:20
try
74:21
and did you have to swap when you say
74:22
swap do you mean i can just give you a
74:24
little cup of blood and you can give me
74:25
one or do you have to put it properly it
74:26
was a proper transfusion
74:28
yeah well that's kind of i did the blood
74:30
brothers thing with my best friend when
74:31
i was younger yeah which is basically a
74:33
mini transfusion isn't it it is it's a
74:34
very very small transfusion it was quite
74:36
small yeah
74:37
and the idea behind this um of like the
74:41
the blood giving you whatever um it came
74:43
from that began
74:45
with samuel peeps who at the royal
74:47
society um
74:48
was totally was telling about a guy who
74:51
only lived on women's milk
74:52
as in breast milk uh and apparently
74:56
he used to be angry and fretful but by
74:58
taking this women's milk he became a
75:00
good-natured
75:00
patient and found himself so well and
75:03
they thought he'd somehow got the
75:04
characteristics of a woman
75:06
drinking um breast milk but if that was
75:09
the case
75:10
then every baby
75:13
all right well you don't see many babies
75:15
with mustaches do you very good point
75:18
like like all men like men
75:22
um just one more thing there was a guy
75:23
called petra de abano in the 13th
75:26
century
75:26
and he said that he who drinks menstrual
75:28
blood or that of a leper
75:29
will be seen to be distracted and
75:31
lunatic evil minded and forgetful
75:33
and his cure is to drink of daisies
75:35
powdered and mixed with water of honey
75:37
and to bathe in tepid water and to
75:38
copulate with girls
75:41
sound like he was building up to an
75:44
excuse
75:46
it was the weirdest day off ever but
75:48
menstrual blood was thought to be
75:49
quite a negative thing quite a lot
75:51
wasn't it um
75:53
although pliny yeah i thought a lot of
75:55
fun
75:56
stuff but thought that one of the things
75:58
you could do was collect the menstrual
76:00
blood of someone and i don't know how
76:01
you go about doing that and then you
76:02
sprinkle it over your crops because it
76:03
kills all the bugs because
76:05
they it keeps everything around but not
76:08
the crops
76:09
it doesn't kill the crops crops love it
76:11
bugs hate it
76:12
wow and also in papua new guinea
76:15
there's uh so in an island called gayo
76:19
which is a tiny little island of papua
76:21
new guinea then menstrual blood is
76:23
thought to be
76:24
cleansing and it's thought to be kind of
76:26
a good thing to menstruate
76:27
and men want to do it i mean this is
76:30
really disgusting sorry guys
76:31
but they will sever their willies in
76:33
order to
76:34
mimic the menstruation of women i heard
76:36
they just sort of
76:38
cut them a bit with crab claws oh they
76:41
don't they don't come off
76:42
sorry they i'm sorry it's just the words
76:45
when someone says
76:46
when someone
76:52
they didn't chop them all the way off
76:53
because you can only do that once really
76:55
you need a very willing and patient crab
76:56
too don't you yeah do you think what you
76:58
think was attached
77:00
well yeah i imagine sorry okay it's
77:02
cruel if you cut off the crab's claw to
77:04
cut your
77:04
your own penis i know but you can at
77:06
least control the claw at that point i
77:08
think
77:09
maybe the crab wants to emulate
77:10
menstruation as well so it's actually
77:12
quite grateful
77:12
hmm probably not
77:16
okay okay we'll somehow get something
77:18
out of that so you're right he did kind
77:20
of move his face a lot didn't he
77:22
garrick that was one of his main things
77:23
that he did when acting um there was
77:25
a guy in 1756 who said that his
77:28
realistic style went too far
77:30
his over fondness for extravagant
77:32
attitudes frequently affected starts
77:34
convulsive twitchings
77:36
jerkings of the body sprawling of the
77:38
fingers and slapping of the breast
77:42
and he was really good friends with
77:44
hogarth the artist
77:46
and um so he was probably the most
77:48
painted man in england at the time
77:49
because hogarth used to paint him all
77:51
the time
77:52
but hogarth used to complain because he
77:53
moved his face so much
77:55
all the time that he couldn't paint him
77:57
properly wow really
77:58
there's one portrait of him which is in
78:00
the british museum i think it's
78:01
called a mechanical portrait and it's
78:04
it's a picture of him
78:06
being painted by hogarth but in the
78:09
space where his face is
78:10
there's one of those spinning wheels
78:11
behind the picture and you can have 30
78:13
different facial expressions
78:18
it's very interesting he ran drury lane
78:20
which was
78:21
one of the theaters that he had for 30
78:22
years and no plays that were new plays
78:25
of the time have survived
78:27
it's a very odd thing because there are
78:28
a lot of players in that time
78:30
um and he was someone who he was doing a
78:32
lot of the scheduling
78:34
and despite his absolute love for
78:36
shakespeare he also
78:37
had to do things that he absolutely
78:38
detested pantomime
78:40
he absolutely detested he hated clowns
78:43
um but
78:44
oh no he didn't yeah he didn't
78:47
nice oh
78:56
oh my goodness everybody he's behind you
79:01
this is what we have to deal with
79:06
god that's that's just a proper insight
79:08
into how bad i feel about facts all the
79:10
time
79:11
oh he didn't random guy okay you're
79:13
right
79:15
mustn't have checked my facts you're
79:16
definitely right
79:18
um he uh yeah so he um he made
79:22
the start of an evening be the thing
79:24
that would be the clown
79:25
and um he so like so
79:28
like the pantomime clown stuff that's
79:30
what we do too dan
79:33
yeah yeah slab dug
79:36
okay so what i was saying is
79:40
um i will get to the you will
79:44
so what's probably a wrong fact
79:48
but so before a play started an evening
79:50
they would have an appetizer which would
79:52
be a harlequin style clown
79:54
a grimaldi who would come on and do a
79:55
bit he absolutely hated that
79:57
um he at one time he was at a puppet
80:00
show and he had to
80:01
leave because he thought the applause
80:03
for mr punch was so repulsive
80:05
he was just like i've got to get out of
80:07
here but he had to keep it in because
80:09
people loved it particularly king george
80:11
the third love that
80:12
he'd never laughed so hard apparently
80:13
than when he was seeing a clown swallow
80:15
a whole carrot on stage and that was the
80:18
reason for keeping it
80:20
everyone in this audience is thinking
80:21
god i wish that was what was on tonight
80:25
he apparently swallowed a lot of carrots
80:27
it wasn't just the one as well amazing
80:30
but
80:40
before you find your prince you have to
80:42
swallow a lot of carrots
80:51
what are you applauding
81:02
you

=303
00:04
[Music]
00:10
[Applause]
00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:21
covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:24
here with andrew hunter murray
00:26
anna chazinski and james harkin and once
00:28
again we have gathered around the
00:30
microphones with our four
00:31
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order
00:34
here we go starting with fact number one
00:37
that's my fact my fact is in 1996 a
00:41
windsurfer successfully broke into
00:43
alcatraz
00:44
prison while it was hosting a movie
00:45
premiere of the rock
00:47
a film about people trying to break into
00:49
alcatraz
00:51
wow that's good so he broke he broke
00:53
into
00:54
the prison there's a guy called jeff
00:56
bunch um and he
00:58
was a windsurfer who was on the
00:59
outskirts of it and he wanted to go so
01:00
he wore a sort of tuxedo
01:02
over his uh his wetsuit and he got to
01:05
the island over his wetsuit i know a bit
01:06
weird right
01:07
i guess he didn't plan on falling in so
01:09
if you don't fall in you're dry um
01:12
i guess it's the idea right that is
01:14
sensible actually yeah yeah yeah
01:15
essentially james bond does it the wrong
01:17
way doesn't he like he has a wetsuit
01:19
over his
01:20
tuxedo doesn't he and then he has to go
01:22
to the changing
01:25
put it in the rooms take his wetsuit off
01:27
and it actually doesn't make any sense
01:28
because the wetsuit doesn't stop you
01:29
getting wet underneath
01:30
so actually when he reveals a tuxedo
01:32
james bond it should be drenched
01:35
yeah i started to wonder if that's seen
01:37
in the movie i've just made it up
01:43
yeah he wanted to get into the premiere
01:45
and supposedly he did he was arrested
01:47
and taken off premises but he said he
01:49
managed to get a cocktail with sean
01:50
connery
01:51
i haven't seen the rock what i know but
01:54
i gather
01:54
is michael bay's best film do you like
01:57
well i gather that
01:58
in the like a crowded field of other
02:00
films michael bay has made
02:02
it a transformers three i know i know i
02:05
know it's a controversial opinion i've
02:06
read i've read a thing saying
02:08
it's his i think it's supposed to be
02:09
quite good isn't it i love it yeah
02:11
okay it's an awesome movie and i think
02:12
it's his favorite movie that he's made
02:14
all i saw is it got 66 on rotten
02:16
tomatoes which to me is definitely not
02:18
worth it yeah but
02:19
michael bay that is an absolute trail
02:23
real michael bay slamming today um it's
02:25
awesome
02:26
okay so it's about and it has sean
02:28
connery in it and it has apparently navy
02:30
seals trying to break into the island in
02:31
the film and they use real navy seals
02:33
in the production didn't they absolutely
02:35
so just for anyone who doesn't know the
02:37
movie which apparently no one does
02:39
um the idea is that many many years ago
02:42
someone successfully escaped from
02:43
alcatraz
02:44
and he was put in prison when he was
02:46
caught on the other side he's been in
02:47
solitary confinement for years
02:48
and suddenly the rock as it is known is
02:51
taken over
02:51
by a bunch of military people have gone
02:53
rogue so they need to break back into it
02:55
and they in they get this guy sean
02:57
connery
02:57
out of jail to help them back in with
02:59
nicolas cage that's the basic premise
03:02
the rock is in it the rock is not in it
03:04
the the island plays the role of the
03:06
rock
03:08
alcatraz is known as the rock this party
03:11
sounds really cool actually um there
03:12
were 500 guests and they were told to
03:14
dress
03:15
informally this according to an article
03:17
i read in s f gate
03:18
um and patricia arquette was there and
03:21
she was wearing a chocolate brown
03:23
three-quarter length satin coat with
03:25
matching pants by dolce gabbana
03:27
and an aqua silk blouse that matched her
03:29
iridescent eye shadow wow so that was
03:32
her dressing informally
03:34
and sean connery was wearing a tan
03:36
parker a fisherman's sweater and no
03:38
toupee
03:40
no too according to sfk that's the dress
03:43
down friday
03:45
you never get asked on the red carpet
03:47
and whose toupee are you uh
03:49
wearing tonight um here's a tiny little
03:53
funny fact i found about the actual
03:55
making of the rock
03:56
um the script was done but they brought
03:58
in some writers to sort of punch up the
04:00
script
04:00
add some jokes but also to do some
04:02
rewrites and the two people they brought
04:04
in were the guys who wrote
04:05
porridge the british sitcom wow this is
04:08
a michael bay action
04:09
and yeah the creator of the likely lads
04:11
came into
04:12
us do yeah that's a great bit of trivia
04:16
so the rock of alcatraz this is not the
04:18
only time that a former
04:19
criminal from alcatraz has gone back to
04:22
it as in it happens fictionally in the
04:24
film but it's happened in real life as
04:25
well
04:25
okay they're pretty sure that um whitey
04:28
bulger he was a gangster he was involved
04:30
in lots of murders not a nice guy
04:32
he was there for four years when it was
04:34
operating as a prison
04:35
and then later on he went back as a
04:37
tourist he went there with a girlfriend
04:39
and he was a girlfriend yeah to take you
04:42
back to my old hands
04:43
[Laughter]
04:44
well when they were there they did all
04:46
the tourist stuff so he dressed up in a
04:47
striped uniform
04:48
which they let you do and he had a photo
04:51
taken behind a set of replica bars
04:54
when was this because he was wasn't him
04:56
in there ages ago i think he was in in
04:57
the late 60s early 70s
04:59
and he went close in the 60s didn't it
05:00
62. okay
05:02
63 it was close okay but he went back
05:04
obviously later when it was a tourist
05:06
attraction yeah i wonder what date you
05:08
bring up that you were
05:09
far better alcatraz i think it's on the
05:12
tinder very fast
05:14
it's quite right or else because you
05:17
would if you were going out with someone
05:18
who'd been in alcatraz that would be a
05:19
really cool
05:20
little thing to say about your boyfriend
05:22
wouldn't it and he'd want to go there
05:23
and experience it do you think that's a
05:25
cool thing to say my boyfriend
05:26
was at alcatraz the most secure for the
05:29
worst of worst criminals
05:30
it's not actually for the worst worst
05:32
criminals that is a bit of a
05:33
misconception so that would be the first
05:35
thing i said about my boyfriend
05:36
when someone said that although although
05:38
white bulger was involved in 19 murders
05:40
so i don't know if he's in a minimum
05:43
security
05:44
yeah and look maybe that didn't come up
05:45
to the third date some of them were just
05:47
tax dividers
05:48
like cal capone so this is a real mixed
05:52
ability prison isn't it
05:55
the thing with the alcatraz was really
05:58
was a prison
05:59
to cure people who were in other prisons
06:02
who kept on kind of trying to break out
06:03
or misbehaving and pulling pranks on the
06:05
prison officers that kind of thing
06:07
pulling pranks
06:08
pulling pranks yeah like trying to kill
06:09
them and
06:12
so that's why it's kind of a amusing
06:14
idea in a way because basically
06:16
that's what it was boyfriend whitey he's
06:19
we say murder he's more of a prankster
06:20
really
06:21
he was found guilty of 17 pranks
06:23
[Laughter]
06:25
so it's basically a prison of people who
06:27
had experience of escaping from
06:29
other prisons so in fact i think the
06:31
most famous escape probably
06:33
was of frank morris and john and
06:35
clarence anglin
06:36
and they inspired the film escape from
06:37
alcatraz the 1979 film
06:39
and they got out in 1962 but they'd all
06:42
come there because they'd escaped or
06:44
attempted to escape other prisons
06:46
and their i mean their escape is
06:47
incredible isn't it so good it's
06:49
unbelievable so i just read the count of
06:52
monte cristo and i thought this is
06:53
implausible everything he does to get
06:55
out
06:55
but they so they chipped away at their
06:57
cell walls with spoons
06:59
for ages um and then they would conceal
07:01
their work with kind of painted
07:03
cardboard that they accessed somehow
07:05
they did they made an improvised drill
07:07
from a vacuum cleaner which
07:09
i mean how do you do that and they
07:11
disguise somehow they disguise the noise
07:12
of the vacuum cleaner working as a drill
07:14
by having one of them play the accordion
07:16
the whole time they should have played
07:18
the spoons
07:19
but well the spoon was busy
07:24
who's letting them get all this stuff
07:25
though i mean who's let the accordion in
07:27
i think is the big question
07:28
you know vacuum cleaner sure spoon fine
07:31
but well they had a band there
07:32
like al capone was part of the band as
07:35
one of the famous prisoners yeah i think
07:37
he was on banjo or something like that
07:38
he was yeah he started the band i think
07:41
so this was way way before this escape
07:43
wasn't it
07:43
in the 30s when al capone was there yeah
07:45
but yeah it's a very long running band
07:48
and i guess it's very easy to do a
07:49
reunion tour decades later because
07:51
you're all still in amsterdam
07:54
i think it's like sugar babes it's a
07:55
constantly rotating
07:58
so more on this escape we didn't get to
08:00
the end of it oh
08:02
they had papier-mache they made
08:04
papier-mache heads
08:06
of themselves and they made it not they
08:08
didn't have actual papier-mache they had
08:09
to use toilet paper and soap
08:11
and they made these they sculpted these
08:13
heads of themselves and then they
08:14
covered them in real hair
08:15
which they got from the prison barber
08:17
shop cool brilliant
08:19
yeah so good they stole over 50
08:21
raincoats again
08:22
don't know where they're getting 50
08:23
raincoats properly they stole these
08:25
raincoats and they made them into
08:26
makeshift life jackets
08:28
and they vulcanized them properly uh
08:30
using steam pipes in the prison
08:32
they worked this out from some kind of
08:33
magazine they'd had smuggled in and
08:35
um they also i think converted one of
08:38
them into a
08:39
life raft and apparently they converted
08:41
a musical instrument according to the
08:43
fbi
08:43
into a tool to inflate the life raft oh
08:46
you just use the accordion you squeeze
08:47
it up and down don't you
08:48
that sounds like the one doesn't it but
08:50
then they'll hear you blowing up the
08:52
yeah it can't be that in fact
08:55
the whole point of musical instruments
08:56
is they all make a noise when you pass
08:58
wind through them
09:02
i went on the fbi website and they said
09:04
that they officially closed the case on
09:06
december 31st 1979
09:09
about this escape um but they have
09:11
turned the responsibility over to the
09:13
u.s marshals service who continue to
09:15
investigate
09:16
so if you at home have any leads or
09:18
information to share about this
09:20
escape from 1962 uh then please call
09:24
deputy u.s marshal michael dyke on
09:29
415-436-7677
09:32
[Laughter]
09:34
but he thinks they made it he thinks
09:36
they made it to the mainland definitely
09:37
and that they made it away because some
09:38
people think that the raft which was
09:40
made of um
09:41
raincoats and it was also made of cement
09:43
that was the other ingredient forget her
09:45
after breakfast and samantha but he
09:47
thinks they got away
09:48
um and the family of the anglin brothers
09:51
two of the skps they think that they
09:52
attended their mother's funeral
09:55
really yeah because their mother died
09:56
several years later but obviously the
09:58
funeral the place was crawling with fbi
10:00
agents and they think they might have
10:01
attended dressed as women
10:03
and all three of them will be pardoned
10:05
but only if they make it to the age of
10:06
100.
10:07
there was a team of dutch scientists who
10:10
did some computer simulations about
10:11
whether the rafts would have made it to
10:13
the mainland
10:14
they launched 50 virtual rafts every
10:17
half hour between
10:18
8 pm and 4 am by looking at all the
10:21
tides that would have happened at the
10:22
time
10:22
and from different locations on the
10:24
island and they found that if they left
10:26
at exactly midnight
10:28
on the night they might have made it
10:30
they would have been sucked out towards
10:32
the golden gate bridge
10:33
but at the moment they were close to the
10:34
golden gate the tide would have reversed
10:36
and that would have sent them
10:38
to the north side of the bridge and they
10:39
would have been able to get to the land
10:41
wow and that's the only specific time
10:43
every other time they would have got
10:44
sucked out to see
10:45
but this is assuming that they weren't
10:47
just there controlling the rafts right
10:49
yes they did actually put into the
10:51
computer that they might be able to do
10:53
some steering because they had some ores
10:55
they made a couple of volts they did
10:56
have a couple of r's but they were both
10:58
made out of accordions
11:03
um on the escaping via the only method
11:06
through the through the ocean there was
11:08
there's a theory that so alcatraz was
11:10
meant to be actually quite a pleasant
11:11
experience in terms of food
11:12
in terms of their showers they had hot
11:14
showers prison prisons don't really have
11:16
that
11:17
pleasant's a strong word we should
11:18
clarify well maybe it's not
11:20
it wasn't such awful yeah you got your
11:22
own set
11:23
which actually was uh according to a
11:25
bunch of people who've written about it
11:27
since
11:27
having come out saying that that's a
11:29
really pleasant experience not to be
11:30
here yeah
11:31
you know what i'm saying is it's like
11:33
pleasant experience compared to being in
11:34
prison
11:35
it's not great yeah it's not it's not an
11:37
objectively pleasant it's like
11:38
saying that the rock is a good movie
11:39
compared to the other michael baymo
11:41
yes yes okay no
11:45
but you know you know why they had hot
11:46
showers well this is yeah i was about to
11:48
say
11:48
because of the ocean so the theory was
11:51
that they were so used to
11:52
hot water that when they got into the
11:54
ocean that would immediately give them
11:56
hypothermia or they wouldn't be used to
11:57
it as opposed to cold showers getting
11:58
them used to a
11:59
cold swim it is swimmable so people have
12:02
swamped so
12:03
i think in oh when was it it was
12:06
it the year before the prison opened
12:08
actually
12:09
a 17 year old girl swam it in 47 minutes
12:12
wow and she's not even the youngest
12:13
person who's done it obviously you need
12:14
to be very lucky with the currents and
12:16
the tides
12:16
um because it's pretty treacherous but
12:18
in 2006 a seven-year-old boy swam it
12:21
no also in 47 minutes what isn't that
12:24
crazy
12:24
wow do you think that maybe it's like
12:26
you know when you go to um a water park
12:29
and there's that ride where you just sit
12:30
in a ring and it just takes you around
12:32
in exactly 47 minutes
12:33
it seems like there must be just a
12:35
current that switches on once a day yeah
12:37
and that
12:37
just pretty much helps uh some of the
12:40
people here in alcatraz
12:41
yeah yeah um basil banghart he was known
12:43
as the owl because he had big eyes
12:46
uh ellsworth raymond johnson was known
12:48
as bumpy because he had a bump on the
12:50
back of his head and joseph bowers was
12:53
known as dutch
12:54
because he was born in austria
12:59
presumably they just they heard he was
13:01
european and just gave
13:07
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:09
that is
13:10
andy my fact is that horatio nelson had
13:12
a brother whose name was suckling nelson
13:16
so not the most heroic of the nelson
13:20
siblings no it feels like he was given a
13:23
short
13:23
shrift in life wasn't he yeah by getting
13:25
that name definitely he was never gonna
13:27
become
13:27
the you know the head of the navy well
13:30
maybe it means he was the only one who
13:31
was breastfed do we know if that was the
13:33
reason that was not the reason right
13:34
that's a
13:34
great theory so this fact actually comes
13:36
from friend of the podcast carried lloyd
13:38
who sent it to me saying you're the only
13:40
person who will find this interesting
13:43
um that's great so it's because of the
13:45
suckling side of the family
13:47
so his mother was called catherine
13:49
suckling okay and
13:50
uh she had a brother called morris
13:52
suckling and so
13:54
there was nelson was one of uh 11
13:56
children eight of whom survived to
13:57
adulthood so a lot of siblings and i
13:58
think they were running a bit short of
13:59
names
14:00
and suckling was one of the last
14:02
brothers born
14:03
and he was not very uh impressive i
14:06
think
14:07
so there's almost no references to him
14:09
in biographies of nelson one of them
14:11
just describes him as
14:12
the feckless suckling
14:15
he was a struggling vicar and nelson got
14:18
him a job he was a draper
14:19
in beckles um who tried to be a draper
14:22
but failed
14:23
and then he became a vicar when his
14:25
father who was a vicar retired and he
14:27
became the vicar and then he died a few
14:29
years later
14:30
and i don't think he's very close to
14:31
horatio nelson because
14:33
uh horatio wrote to his wife in 1799 i
14:36
am not surprised at my brother's death
14:38
three are dead younger than myself that
14:40
was his response to the death of his
14:42
brother oh
14:42
god he died quite young and actually his
14:45
father so their father
14:47
wrote to kitty who was nelson's sister
14:50
about
14:50
suckling um he will no doubt pass
14:53
amongst a crowd of undistinguished
14:55
preachers
14:55
and gain some respect in the village
14:57
from his quiet disposition
14:59
his liking to a little conviviality and
15:01
his passion for greyhound racing
15:04
this podcast has turned into a roast
15:08
poor guy dead for ages brought back
15:11
finally
15:12
by a carrier i know i'm just wanting to
15:14
be taken down again
15:16
the name suckling came from the surname
15:19
of the family
15:20
yeah which comes from the word to suck
15:24
and in ancient times it was a baptismal
15:26
or patronomic name of endearment
15:29
so it's like how you have the surname
15:30
darling okay
15:32
oh there's a poet called sir john
15:34
suckling yeah yeah yeah yeah do you know
15:35
so i was reading about sir john suckling
15:37
um and he's related directly so he's an
15:39
english poet he wrote ballot upon a
15:40
wedding
15:40
he also is credited as having invented
15:42
the card game cribbage
15:44
really yeah i studied search on circling
15:47
at school
15:48
did you yeah he wanted this group called
15:49
the cavalier poets who are a lot of
15:51
sort of royce during lads who are all in
15:52
favor of king charles i think you've
15:54
mentioned him before i think so and the
15:55
poem battled upon a wedding contains one
15:57
of the
15:57
is an early masturbation joke
16:01
at a wedding yes
16:05
it's not in the ceremony do you have the
16:07
joke
16:08
um i think it's it's talking about how
16:11
beautiful the bride is and it's saying
16:12
that if
16:13
so hot i had a wine
16:16
i think it's saying that if the if the
16:17
groom had had had
16:19
slept with the if the groom slept with
16:21
the bride as often as all the
16:23
sort of invited male friends had
16:25
imagined themselves doing it
16:27
uh it would have spoiled him surely wow
16:29
yeah
16:30
is that a masturbation joke yeah because
16:32
they're all imagining that they're
16:33
they're
16:34
they're sleeping with her of course
16:35
sorry yeah anyway
16:37
um yeah nice but he was probably the
16:39
most eminent of the sucklings
16:40
it's thanks to the sucklings that nelson
16:42
went to see in the first place because
16:43
it was the um nelson's uncle morris
16:45
suckling who when nelson's mother
16:49
catherine died
16:50
nelson was only i think uh eight or ten
16:52
years old he was quite
16:53
very young and uncle morris said well
16:55
take one of the children off your hands
16:56
and that happened to be horatio
16:58
and then morris got command of a ship
17:00
and nelson wrote to him saying take me
17:01
to sea please i want to go to see i want
17:03
to go and have adventures
17:04
so that's how he got into the navy he
17:05
could have been a draper
17:07
car a missed opportunity we could have
17:09
such amazing curtains
17:10
you could have suckling's column
17:15
um the thing about his mother that he
17:17
remembered so i got that his mother died
17:18
when he was nine so i like that you
17:20
skirted around that with eight and ten
17:21
between eight and ten
17:24
um so i think his mother died when he
17:26
was either eight nine or ten
17:28
and he said he remembered her well he
17:30
claimed to remember her well but then
17:31
the only concrete thing he said he
17:32
remembered about her was that she hated
17:33
the french
17:36
it's the whole thing just an attempt to
17:37
please his mum it sounds like it might
17:39
be
17:40
the whole thing um he was not very
17:43
impressive in adulthood
17:44
i mean to to to crowds who are observing
17:47
racial nelson horatio yeah yeah
17:49
so crowns thought he was rubbish he was
17:51
um you know he was very
17:52
short and a german onlooker who a crowd
17:54
it said a more miserable collection of
17:57
bones and wizard frame i have never yet
17:59
come across
18:00
ouch i know yeah but he had the crap
18:02
kicked out of him at war i mean
18:04
he lost he lost his eye yeah like this
18:06
isn't the guy who
18:07
was yeah he had a hernia there you go
18:10
you can't see that on the outside though
18:11
can you
18:12
you can if you put your top off but i
18:14
don't think he did
18:17
although he was very good at his own pr
18:19
so if he had a six-pack
18:20
and he also invented the phrase the
18:23
nelson touch
18:24
to uh what does that mean it's it's
18:26
about having some kind of brilliant
18:27
naval strategy
18:28
it's amazing and people use it you know
18:30
even today
18:31
yeah yeah it's a phrase it's not used
18:33
much outside navy's i think
18:34
no have we talked about um
18:38
lady hamilton no i'm at hamilton
18:41
so um nelson was married to fanny
18:45
and um but then decided to leave her for
18:48
emma hamilton
18:49
who was married to william hamilton at
18:51
the time and
18:52
nelson was sending love letters to emma
18:55
hamilton
18:56
but william hamilton knew the
18:59
secretary of state for foreign affairs
19:01
so was opening all of his mail
19:02
and reading whatever he was saying and
19:04
sending it to the government so whenever
19:06
he was sending
19:07
letters like to emma hamilton saying
19:09
like i kissed you fervently
19:11
and we enjoyed the height of love ah
19:13
emma i pour out my soul to you
19:15
her husband was reading all that stuff
19:17
and i guess scanning over it and get
19:18
into the important
19:19
naval stuff so he completely knew about
19:23
the whole thing
19:24
but then of course they ended up living
19:25
in some kind of weird manager
19:27
yeah they lived in the same house was it
19:29
and they they seemed pretty open by the
19:31
end of it everyone was kind of cool with
19:32
it was a very modern sort of foursome
19:34
and
19:34
fanny seemed not to have too much of an
19:36
issue and i had a really unhappy
19:38
marriage
19:38
yeah yeah so i think it was probably a
19:41
relief for both of them when he
19:42
buggered off with the lady if they kept
19:45
the family surname she could have been
19:46
called fanny suckling
19:48
oh that would have been the dream
19:49
wouldn't it actually as well emma
19:51
hamilton used to call fanny tom titt
19:53
as a nickname so she could have been tom
19:56
tit-cycling
19:58
oh god and that was because it was
20:00
really not very nice
20:02
so um she suffered from rheumatism in
20:04
her legs and supposedly walked a bit
20:05
like a bird
20:06
and so emma hamilton being a bit not
20:08
very nice that's catty
20:10
it's a bit rebecca vardy isn't it yeah
20:13
i read a really random thing about fanny
20:15
nisbet um so before she married nelson
20:18
she was guardian to these three children
20:21
who were the kids of a plantation owner
20:23
who was away in the caribbean with his
20:25
wife and him and his wife returned
20:27
and fannie nisbet's looking after these
20:29
kids and fanny brought the three kids in
20:31
to say hey here's his daddy uh
20:34
and he said who on earth are these
20:36
children and she fanny said good god
20:38
don't you know them
20:39
you know didn't recognize his own kids
20:41
they're your children and so neither of
20:43
the couple had recognized their own
20:44
children
20:45
and it said that his wife was so
20:47
surprised that she set her headdress on
20:49
fire on a nearby candle
20:52
what on earth is that starry it's really
20:55
random
20:55
it's just so random it's like you come
20:57
home you know you must know you have
20:59
three children
21:00
so when three children stand in front of
21:02
you yeah
21:03
there's a process of deduction going on
21:05
there isn't it you would have thought
21:06
she hadn't figured it out she was
21:08
astonished did she set her headdress on
21:09
fire deliberately
21:11
as a protest against the looks of these
21:12
children or did she stagger back into a
21:15
candle
21:16
it's not clear it's written in a letter
21:17
by her husband and he doesn't specify
21:19
he just says she set her headdress on
21:21
fire that's an amazing story
21:24
it's like an episode of miranda
21:29
um you know the hardy uh kiss me hardy i
21:31
think we've mentioned before with
21:32
his dying words kiss me hardy to hit one
21:34
of his officers handy later became first
21:36
lord of the admiralty he did really well
21:38
in his career cool
21:39
yeah um but this is amazing the nelsons
21:42
and the hardys are still in touch as a
21:44
family wow
21:45
yeah so there was a dinner party in 1990
21:47
and there was a woman there called mary
21:48
arthur
21:49
she is descended from nelson and her
21:51
husband was talking to one of the other
21:52
guests and said oh this is my wife she's
21:54
a descendant of nelson
21:55
and the person they were talking to
21:58
robin steiner said that's funny i'm
21:59
descended from hardy
22:01
and they got back in touch that way wow
22:03
not having known each other they've been
22:04
in touch since then
22:06
uh and they became really good friends
22:07
and the times read about it the time
22:08
said
22:09
mrs arthur who lives in woburn in
22:11
bedfordshire confirmed that the two
22:12
descendants continue the family's
22:14
tradition of kissing
22:16
nice it sounds like it's all an excuse
22:18
for them to have an affair
22:22
i think he said i'm going to send him a
22:23
party and she said kiss me hardy and
22:25
then they crossed the table and snogged
22:27
and the husband can't say anything
22:28
because they're just reenacting the
22:29
historic scene
22:31
well i think that's a really bad story
22:33
[Laughter]
22:37
okay it is time for fact number three
22:39
and that is
22:40
james okay my fact this week is that in
22:43
the 11th century
22:44
hundreds of people in the uk paid their
22:46
rent in
22:47
eels okay
22:50
so this is a website run by a guy called
22:53
john
22:54
wyatt greenlee he's a historian whose
22:56
work according to his site
22:58
examines the cultural history of eels in
23:00
england
23:01
from the 10th through the 17th centuries
23:03
focusing on
23:04
eel's role in economic change the growth
23:07
of a
23:07
national english identity and the
23:09
evolution of spatial practice
23:11
in early modern london and that was a
23:13
quote that was a lot longer than i
23:14
thought it was going to be
23:16
um but he has a bit where he looks at
23:18
rents that were paid in eels
23:19
and this was a thing that happened
23:21
probably before the 10th century but
23:23
that's
23:23
where we have the records from for
23:25
instance the doomsday book records
23:26
payments
23:27
like the village of hamston um who owed
23:30
earl
23:30
hugh 75 000 eels per year
23:34
for their rent dead or alive uh i think
23:37
dead
23:38
okay okay it's harder to collect i
23:41
suppose live deals yes no
23:42
it's easier to collect no it isn't andy
23:45
come on
23:47
i'll tell you why if there were ten dead
23:49
eels on the floor and ten
23:50
live eels in a bucket let's see you can
23:53
pick them up quickest okay it's easier
23:54
to collect dead deals but it's harder to
23:56
find them i think
23:58
hardest find dead deals it's hard to
24:00
find daddy is lying around yeah the
24:01
natural state is
24:02
alive yeah yeah i do get that but
24:05
presumably they're eel farmers right
24:06
it's not people going around just
24:07
looking for those
24:08
there are no farmers you can't farm an
24:10
eel you can't farm an eel can't farm a
24:11
deal
24:12
no and this was basically um people
24:14
catching them
24:16
and then selling them at market and then
24:18
picking them up and using them as kind
24:19
of currency
24:20
oh wow and they were dead because they
24:22
came on sticks so you get 25 eels on a
24:24
stick
24:25
so when you had to give 75 000 deals
24:28
it would be what 3 000 sticks
24:32
it was sort of like a the equivalent of
24:33
candy floss or something you'd take a
24:35
stick of eels
24:36
yeah and look away at it i'm well i'm
24:39
not sure about the licking
24:41
well they were rent collectors so keen
24:43
on eel
24:44
well wasn't there just a huge possible
24:46
popular food yeah it is
24:48
popular food so john white greenlee says
24:50
that
24:51
the reason that he looks into this is
24:53
actually if you look in the doomsday
24:54
book
24:54
there's payments in pigs and fish and
24:57
ale you might pay
24:58
in different foods and drinks because if
25:00
you don't have
25:01
cash you know it's a thing that everyone
25:03
has but people
25:05
these days are really particularly
25:06
interested in eels because we don't
25:07
really eat eels anymore
25:09
so when you look at a list and it says
25:10
75 000 eels you go bloody hell
25:13
where'd you get 75 000 eels from you
25:14
can't farm an eel
25:16
you said i had meal for breakfast at the
25:18
weekend did you really yeah
25:19
smoke too so we don't eat eels anymore
25:22
no no i know what you mean i had
25:23
conflicts but
25:24
what i'm saying is it's less common it's
25:27
less
25:28
i didn't have yeah 75 000 deals but
25:30
there used to be
25:31
maybe it was just there was a lot more
25:33
so i think 50
25:34
of the biomass of european freshwater or
25:37
some parts of it was made of eel
25:39
in the olden days wow say the olden days
25:41
i don't have an exact yeah but around
25:43
this time and east anglia too
25:45
back in the days before the fens were
25:47
drained
25:48
was it was very rich eel territory
25:51
you know you'd go boating around the
25:53
waters and and this guy
25:55
john wyatt greenlee he's brilliant yeah
25:57
his his twitter name
25:59
is surprised eel historian and then the
26:01
biography for him says surprised
26:03
historian not surprised eels
26:05
um he's a medievalist at cornell
26:09
university and he's um
26:10
and he's done a map he's done an
26:12
interactive map of the uk and you can
26:13
look on it and you can click to see
26:15
where your nearest
26:16
local eel rent was and i looked and it's
26:18
about four miles from where i grew up
26:19
kingston
26:20
uh there was a rent of 125 eels wow
26:24
yeah it's really interesting my closest
26:26
was manchester
26:27
nice yeah i didn't i just was busy
26:29
looking at his replies to that tweet
26:30
because it was so successful he was like
26:32
oh my god
26:32
who would have thought eels this is
26:34
fantastic so he was a surprise deal
26:36
historian
26:39
he's done a kind of calculation of what
26:41
eels would get you today in today's
26:42
money
26:43
so he said that he worked out because
26:45
he's at cornell university
26:47
uh that if you had to pay to go to
26:49
cornell university
26:50
you would need between 106 612
26:53
and 213 thousand and 24 eels either of
26:57
which represents the number of years
26:58
that the cornell bursar's office is
26:59
ill-prepared to handle
27:01
i did say that an amazon prime
27:03
membership which is 99
27:05
a year uh would cost only 150 to 300
27:08
eels
27:09
that's about six to 12 sticks of eels i
27:12
really didn't know that
27:13
you cannot eat eel raw so again in sushi
27:16
did you just find that i've had this
27:18
weekend
27:20
bad few days you get it in sushi don't
27:22
you you do and it's always cooked
27:24
so because if you eat it raw it's got
27:26
toxic blood and it causes
27:28
causes your muscles to spasm including
27:30
your heart and it got it's got enough
27:31
toxin that it can kill
27:33
a human being yeah if you suck all the
27:35
blood out of an eel you'll die
27:37
yeah wow i think you deserve to as well
27:41
but so that if we're saying um eel's not
27:43
eaten that much here these days in japan
27:45
it's obviously massive they have an
27:48
annual
27:48
um consumption rate of a hundred
27:50
thousand tons of veals so that's seventy
27:52
percent of the worldwide eel catch
27:54
well we get yeah um but they've declined
27:57
in their eel population so massively
27:59
something like
27:59
genuinely 99 like that's how high it is
28:02
so they now have to import
28:04
eel glacial and so on from america in
28:06
order to
28:07
eat but also as a result because they're
28:09
manufacturing great sushi out there that
28:11
gets sent back to america
28:13
the americans are sending their eels
28:15
over to then have it sent back
28:17
to eat so it's taken two plane rides by
28:19
the time they've eaten
28:20
that's kind of nice in a way because
28:23
eels in their migration are used to
28:25
migrating thousands of kilometers they
28:27
have this extraordinary migration so
28:29
it's maybe it's sort of nice that
28:30
posthumously
28:31
they're still migrating thousands of
28:33
miles back and forth do you think that's
28:34
a little bit of consolation for the
28:36
no i don't think so no probably not i
28:38
think i mean the population decline is
28:40
amazing so
28:40
there are temporary bans that have been
28:42
put in place in the uk and
28:44
it is lots to do with dredging of the
28:46
ocean as well this
28:47
really uh just decimates the population
28:50
but they hatch in the sargasso sea
28:54
which is uh the west indies way bermuda
28:57
it's like north it's it's and it's not a
28:59
sea it's a portion of the north atlantic
29:01
isn't it yeah so it's a portion of the
29:02
ocean yeah
29:03
but then they drift over on the gulf
29:04
stream when they're really tiny
29:06
and then they burrow into river mouths
29:08
and and estuaries and things in the uk
29:10
and across europe and then they stay
29:12
there for
29:13
up to 12 years but some of them could
29:15
live in a pool for up to 30 or 40 years
29:17
just living there and getting bigger
29:18
and then they suddenly they feel the
29:20
call they swim back to the picasso sea
29:22
they spawn they die
29:23
yeah we think we think no one's ever
29:26
seen it happen
29:27
no one's ever seen an ill sport it's
29:29
insane
29:30
so in the olden days people like pliny
29:32
and all those other types until the
29:33
1700s kind of thought they came from
29:34
nowhere and i kind of still think they
29:36
do
29:37
because no one's seen this one we found
29:39
young
29:40
eels very young eels born in the
29:42
sargasso sea haven't we and then we've
29:43
got the old eels that look totally
29:45
different
29:46
by the way um in europe and america but
29:49
that's it and they're constantly
29:50
changing color so when they spawn they
29:52
look like
29:52
these tiny like glass leaves and then
29:55
they become transparent glass eels
29:57
and then they turn into like like noodle
30:00
looking things they go
30:01
brown then they go yellow then they go
30:03
silver
30:04
it's this weird kind of disco effect and
30:06
silver is the one where you know that
30:07
they're going to start heading back
30:09
to the sargasso sea to to die and how do
30:11
they feel the call
30:12
we don't know that we don't know and we
30:14
do know that if you
30:16
farm an eel which you can do these days
30:18
oh no they're happy
30:19
i apologize but if you like have a
30:22
needle farm
30:23
and you raise them there so they were
30:25
born there they still have the instinct
30:27
to return to the sargasso sea which is
30:29
kind of embedded in them somehow
30:31
so do they are they just charming their
30:32
heads into the edge of the
30:34
pond in the direction of the sargasso
30:36
sea fear they might do that kind of
30:37
thing
30:38
wow they're really clever in the way
30:40
they migrate as well so now we have
30:41
fight scientists
30:43
have actually tagged them bizarrely they
30:45
haven't managed to tag them all the way
30:46
into the migration
30:47
come on they're just not looking close
30:49
enough for this spawn are they i know i
30:50
reckon if we go to the sargasso sea
30:52
yeah well i think you can see the spawn
30:54
you've just never seen the eels spawn it
30:56
right
30:57
there was one there was one danish
30:58
scientist who spent 15 years of his
31:00
career looking in the mid-atlantic for
31:02
seven millimeter long
31:04
um to get larvae he never did yeah but
31:07
that
31:07
i mean it does feel like he's not done a
31:09
very good job
31:10
you can surely look for the bigger ones
31:12
on their way back to the sargasso sea
31:14
you would love that you would look at
31:15
the spawn and then you keep looking at
31:17
it at earlier and earlier times
31:19
and then look at the bigger ones later
31:21
at later times eventually the two things
31:22
must come together
31:24
guys it must be harder than it looks
31:25
otherwise i'm sure these people would
31:27
have succeeded
31:28
anyway so i was just saying that we we
31:29
have tagged them now so they've tagged
31:31
them for about the first
31:32
1500 kilometers of their journey and
31:34
what they found out is if you tag
31:36
a european eel when it's going back to
31:38
spawn it doesn't make a beeline for the
31:40
sargasso sea it doesn't do the shortest
31:42
route
31:43
it heads a bit further south so it heads
31:45
towards like where the azores would be
31:47
and that's because they're smart enough
31:48
to know that there are ocean currents
31:50
that they then pick up like a conveyor
31:52
belt and that will get them there much
31:54
faster and that's the only way they get
31:55
a seven-year-old boy off alcatraz
31:58
exactly wow that is amazing
32:01
and they can just sit in it not do
32:03
anything so we've been looking as to how
32:05
they spawned for
32:06
centuries right um but it was only in
32:10
the early 1900s that that was found and
32:11
it was this guy that you're talking
32:13
about it was a danish biologist johannes
32:15
schmidt
32:15
and he he was the one who pinpointed the
32:17
sargasso as the spot
32:19
that they were doing it um and he i was
32:21
just looking into him
32:22
um he was married to a lady called cool
32:26
and he studied under a man called
32:27
warming
32:29
very nice and nice and uh so cool
32:32
uh was the daughter of the old carlsberg
32:35
brewery in copenhagen the chief director
32:37
there and actually the whole thing the
32:38
reason we know about the spawning
32:40
is carlsberg itself sponsored him to go
32:42
and look for it so it's thanks to
32:44
carlsberg beer
32:45
that we know about this and was he the
32:47
15 years guy
32:48
yeah that was probably not the best
32:50
scientific study in the world
32:51
[Laughter]
32:54
and then this other guy warming is a
32:56
danish botanist who
32:58
is a founder of the scientific
32:59
discipline of ecology he's the
33:01
relationship of
33:02
man and earth um he's called warming
33:05
which is quite nice
33:06
because that's a really good scientific
33:08
fact stan
33:10
there is one reported case of a male
33:11
dolphin masturbating by wrapping an
33:13
electric heel around its penis
33:16
what how do we know it was masturbating
33:18
he was thinking about john suckling's
33:20
wife
33:21
[Laughter]
33:23
i mean did it ejaculate at the end i
33:26
haven't seen the video this is too
33:28
personal a question
33:29
i'm sorry but if the dolphin is going to
33:30
tell us it's been masturbating with a
33:32
nail then we want the details
33:34
uh i don't know you're quite right the
33:36
eel might have been trying to asphyxiate
33:38
the penis
33:39
indeed or have sex with it thinking it's
33:41
another real mm-hmm
33:42
i don't know what happened speaking of
33:45
um members
33:46
with uh eels wrapped around them
33:50
okay there is an old tradition in the
33:52
fence of england of using
33:53
a wedding ring made of eel skin ah yeah
33:57
so that's another way you can wrap a bit
33:58
of eel around yourself to symbolize
34:00
a love match yeah but it sounds very
34:02
flimsy
34:03
uh yeah i i don't know if it's the ring
34:05
for life but it's
34:07
maybe maybe the ring used for this
34:08
wedding ceremony okay or someone you
34:10
feel like it's your first husband kind
34:12
of thing
34:13
[Laughter]
34:17
okay it is time for our final fact of
34:19
the show and that
34:20
is chozinski my fact is that according
34:23
to polynesian mythology
34:25
maui who is the god in the disney film
34:27
moana
34:28
died by climbing into a goddess's vagina
34:31
and being crushed to death by the
34:33
obsidian teeth in there
34:35
and they didn't show that in the film
34:38
yeah
34:39
yeah we went to disney and watched that
34:40
film do you remember because we were
34:42
sponsored by moana yeah that's right
34:44
um you guys were quite late getting in
34:46
because you needed to do you remember
34:47
you had to
34:48
sign in or something yeah yeah and so
34:50
you missed the start of it but i went in
34:51
without signing in
34:53
uh and they showed that scene oh you get
34:55
that at the top
34:57
show the death scene at the top okay and
34:59
then the rest is a flashback
35:00
of course so if you did miss that first
35:04
scene of the film um
35:05
or the film you should know that this so
35:07
this is the film moana and moana's sort
35:09
of demigod sidekick in the film is
35:11
maui who was a real god very important
35:13
god and or demigod
35:14
in pacific mythology and he exists all
35:17
over the pacific islands so
35:19
like in hawaii he's very important but
35:22
tahiti
35:23
samoa the maori people they all have
35:25
slightly different
35:26
versions of him but there is a version
35:29
where he's a real trickster
35:30
um character he's a prankster he's a
35:32
prankster he's like whitey bulger or al
35:34
capone he's a yeah
35:35
he's a prankster murderer
35:39
does he murder anyone he doesn't
35:41
actually he's just a little prankster
35:43
and one of the ways he dies is when he's
35:45
trying to become
35:46
immortal and the way he decides to do
35:48
this is to enter
35:49
the goddess of death who's called hine
35:52
nui
35:52
tepo to get in through her vagina pluck
35:55
out her heart
35:56
on the way up to her mouth then emerged
35:58
from her mouth and apparently this will
36:00
reverse the birth process
36:01
and make him immortal i don't know if
36:03
that's scientifically accurate but
36:04
anyway
36:05
he does this and he's got his bird
36:07
friends with him so some
36:08
birds who are his mates and he says
36:10
please don't laugh while i do
36:12
this because she'll wake up and they
36:13
couldn't hold it in because it's quite
36:15
funny watching someone climb through a
36:16
vagina
36:18
and so she woke up and she tensed up and
36:21
the little teeth in her vagina which we
36:23
all have
36:23
um crushed him to death
36:26
wow that is quite a story she's really
36:30
she's described as did you say she's the
36:31
goddess of death yes
36:33
oh wait or of mortality i think death
36:35
and mortality
36:36
she's got very vivid description in the
36:38
myth she's got eyes of green stone
36:41
hair of kelp and the mouth of a
36:43
barracuda
36:45
as well as of course having a toothy
36:48
fanny
36:49
she has a vagina a bit like a moray eel
36:52
they've got really big teeth haven't
36:53
they oh they do
36:54
they've got like a pharyngeal jaw like
36:56
alien oh yeah
36:58
and they've got they've got backwards
36:59
teeth so that if you accidentally swim
37:01
in the mouth you can't swim out
37:02
gosh grandmama what big teeth you have
37:05
and then what a surprising location
37:13
well actually we said that he didn't his
37:15
pranks didn't kill anyone i think that
37:17
is true
37:17
perhaps i don't know of any that did but
37:20
he did once go fishing
37:21
with a guy called erawaru who was a
37:24
husband of his sister
37:25
and he was so annoyed with irawaru that
37:28
he turned him into a dog
37:30
ooh and that was the first ever dog and
37:32
that's where dogs come from because maui
37:34
actually if you know the song from moana
37:37
you're welcome which is his big song
37:39
it's all about the things which he did
37:40
so he created the moon and the sun and
37:42
the
37:43
wind and all these different things he
37:44
pulled the islands up from the ocean
37:46
floor didn't he
37:47
he had um he had a magic jaw bone which
37:50
according to some of the myths is the
37:51
jawbone of his grandmother
37:53
but is also quite big so she must have
37:55
been huge um
37:56
and he did things with useful things
37:58
with it so he used it as a fish hook to
38:00
pull up islands
38:01
from the ocean floor and actually the
38:04
names of north island and south island
38:06
in new zealand now are te ike maui and
38:09
te waka a maui which means
38:11
fish of maori and canoe of maui because
38:13
that's
38:14
from when he caught a fish and turned it
38:15
into an island and he turned his canoe
38:17
into another island
38:19
he was turning stuff into islands that's
38:20
great you raised the sky
38:22
that was the thing he did the sky was
38:24
pressed down close to the earth so it
38:26
was
38:26
if the height of a tall tree it was
38:28
pressed right down to there
38:30
so it's obviously very restrictive for
38:31
everybody and uh he just lifted it
38:34
up and ran to a very high peak and
38:35
chucked it up in the air that would be
38:37
so annoying if this guy was that low
38:38
wouldn't it yeah
38:39
so was it like it wouldn't you wouldn't
38:41
hit your head on it but you would be
38:42
able to fly
38:43
a drone you wouldn't be able to
38:46
nightmare
38:46
yeah so another character in moana is
38:50
tufiti who's that goddess who comes up
38:52
at the end she's actually
38:53
based on pele who is a genuine goddess
38:57
in hawaiian mythology
38:58
and so she's like the most important
39:00
goddess goddess of volcanoes and stuff
39:02
like that
39:02
it's like the big um volcano in hawaii
39:05
is called mount
39:06
pele or pili i think yeah yeah and
39:07
that's kind of her embodiment
39:09
right yeah you meant to i think you
39:11
meant to pay tribute to it when you go
39:13
i went there and i didn't did you not no
39:15
god i wonder you got this cold for so
39:17
long
39:18
um you meant to you meant to give um i
39:20
think it's some it's brandy i think it
39:22
is
39:22
you go you poor gin you go and poor gin
39:25
um
39:26
she loves gin yeah there was a hog god
39:29
oh yeah
39:29
called uh kamapua ah which i'm sure i'm
39:32
pronouncing wrong
39:33
um but he married pele the fire goddess
39:36
and his habits were so bad because he
39:39
was a hog
39:40
that she couldn't cope and they um they
39:42
had huge arguments
39:44
and eventually she won all the arguments
39:46
and he was forced to surrender and
39:47
turned himself into a fish
39:49
oh and that is a hawaiian fish and it's
39:51
the wine fish with the best name i think
39:53
we might have talked about it before
39:54
with a really long name yeah okay i'm
39:56
gonna have a crack at it it's called the
40:02
ah and it makes this grunting noise
40:04
which apparently sounds a bit like a hog
40:05
which is because it used to be a hog
40:08
when he was
40:09
that was always a relationship that was
40:10
going to fail between a volcano and a
40:12
hog
40:14
it's a one-way trip to a barbecue
40:16
basically
40:18
um can we talk about having teeth in
40:20
vaginas
40:22
because this is an extremely common myth
40:25
around the world around the whole world
40:27
in fact there are 22 variants of this
40:30
it's called vagina dentata
40:31
myth in north american cultures alone
40:35
the wichita one has a toothed vagina
40:37
wandering at the ground at night
40:39
castrating men in their sleep
40:41
uh the mandaruku myth has a woman with a
40:43
vagina like a crocodile's mouth
40:46
in orissa in india their myth has the
40:49
tooth vagina not only castrating men but
40:51
also eating the rice crop causing famine
40:55
and basically a misogynistic way of
40:58
saying that
40:59
women are evil and you should stay away
41:00
from them right right wow
41:02
i don't know i thought it was like
41:04
empowering women you know
41:06
we get to chop off men's penises with
41:07
our vaginas if we want to yeah i
41:09
immediately brought it to the misogyny i
41:10
was like greedy vagina
41:11
yeah and most of the time it is
41:15
quite misogynistic very occasionally you
41:17
get one where the woman is empowered in
41:18
the story so
41:19
in the chukchi myths which is in
41:21
northern siberia
41:23
you have a woman who is married to an
41:24
old man and to avoid having sex with him
41:27
um she puts a fish head in her vagina so
41:29
the teeth will cut him every time he
41:31
tries to have sex
41:32
and she takes the piss out of him
41:33
doesn't she he has sex with her the
41:35
first time he's like oh my gosh her
41:36
teeth in there and then she was like i
41:38
can't believe you didn't know all
41:39
vaginas have teeth
41:40
how embarrassing but it's just a fish
41:42
head that she's put in there just to
41:43
fish it and she must take it out i
41:45
assume she doesn't leave it there once
41:46
she's got away with it once
41:47
she doesn't have to she doesn't have to
41:49
have it for her whole life
41:50
just the thing on moana the movie itself
41:52
oh yeah um so
41:54
if that scene the vagina crushing scene
41:56
was in the movie obviously it would have
41:58
been an x-rated movie right
41:59
um but in italy they actually had to
42:03
change the name of moana altogether
42:05
because in italy there was a very famous
42:08
porn star
42:09
called moana moana pozzi and
42:12
parents were worried and they were
42:14
worried in the studio that people
42:16
googling moana to see cinema times and
42:18
so on
42:18
would come across moana posse instead of
42:21
the actual cinema so
42:22
it was renamed to be oceana so in italy
42:25
it was released as oceana
42:26
to stop the x-rated references of course
42:28
to be a very
42:30
disgusting club in kingston oceana which
42:33
is why it couldn't be called oceana
42:35
in the uk exactly they had to change it
42:36
back
42:39
they were they did really good research
42:41
on moana into pacific islanders uh
42:44
culture and history and stuff didn't
42:45
they and they uh
42:47
consulted lots of experts so i think the
42:49
creators of the film traveled to
42:50
polynesia multiple times
42:51
and they put together a committee of
42:53
linguists and anthropologists and
42:54
historians from all over the pacific
42:56
islands
42:57
who i think ended up being called the
42:59
something committee the pacific
43:00
committee or something
43:01
oh no they were called the oceanic trust
43:04
and
43:04
they did things like for instance maui
43:06
for the first year of when they were
43:08
coming up with the film was bulld
43:09
so if you remember the film he's got all
43:11
this curly big curly head of hair
43:13
yeah um and that's because he was booed
43:15
and they went to the pacific island
43:16
anthropologists who said
43:18
that's incredibly offensive because the
43:19
hair is where your man is is where your
43:21
power is and he's very powerful
43:22
you've got to give him more hair so he
43:24
gave him more and more hair until they
43:26
told him to stop
43:26
but he was it was meant to be quite a
43:28
skinny character as well maui in the
43:29
mythology as a
43:30
character but they made it quite large
43:33
but yeah do we know why that was
43:34
why would they go against that so that
43:36
was controversial but that was actually
43:38
at the advice
43:39
of the oceanic trust committee so he's a
43:42
very strong character and people said
43:43
this is playing into stereotypes of
43:45
obesity but they the committee said look
43:48
he's just incredibly powerful imposing
43:49
figure and also it's much funnier if
43:51
you've got this huge thing
43:52
um and he's not fat in the film i would
43:54
say he is
43:55
big boned and strong mighty
43:59
exactly mighty maui do you know one of
44:01
the main
44:02
imports of the pacific islands this is
44:03
now a general polynesia effect
44:05
imports yeah um spam oh it's so close
44:09
oh i think i thought it was yeah yeah
44:11
all right well
44:12
maybe another one that i'll do okay um
44:15
okay but another food stuff so it's
44:17
food stuff that america's not ill food
44:19
stuff that americans in the usa uh eat a
44:22
lot of and it's a bit of it that
44:24
americans never eat but that gets mad is
44:27
it the thai in a happy meal
44:29
it's the toy in a happy meal there's a
44:31
huge part and
44:33
it's controversial because they've got a
44:34
lot of plastic in them and you know
44:35
they'll get eaten a lot in the pacific
44:37
no um oh it's not no it's not that was
44:40
great
44:40
sorry i watched only connect the other
44:42
day and i didn't get anything right and
44:43
i know you guys kicked ass on it so i
44:45
thought james had just pulled out
44:46
another stunner there
44:48
so it's turkey tails so i didn't know
44:51
about this
44:52
but in america each year there are 250
44:54
million turkeys eaten
44:56
and turkeys all have this tail which is
44:57
this weird oily gland at the very base
44:59
and it's basically the gland that keeps
45:01
the feathers
45:02
in of the tail um and it's got this
45:04
fatty chunk of meat at it and it's never
45:06
used
45:07
and america it also gets called the
45:09
parson's nose yeah
45:10
great name for it um but it's not sent
45:13
to shops it
45:13
just never gets eaten in the usa so they
45:15
all get sent to the pacific islands and
45:17
they started base america started
45:18
basically dumping these there
45:19
and now it's a massive part of the diet
45:21
in 2007 the average samoan
45:24
was eating 44 pounds of turkey tails a
45:27
year
45:27
which is three times as much as the
45:29
average american eats turkey
45:31
in in total i think they think it's a
45:33
real problem don't they because they do
45:35
have an obesity problem
45:36
in some of the islands and it's because
45:38
there's so much fat in these turkey
45:40
tails basically yeah
45:41
they really want to stop imparting quite
45:43
so much
45:44
they eat a lot of mutton flaps too today
45:46
that's the thing that new zealand
45:47
exports which is a
45:49
very fatty bit of the sheep basically
45:50
and they don't have teeth on them
45:52
anymore do they
45:56
oh dear um so another disney film
46:00
which um wasn't exactly true to life um
46:03
was pocahontas
46:05
uh and in pocahontas the male
46:08
protagonist is john smith
46:10
i understand having not seen it um but
46:12
all these things i don't think are in
46:14
the film
46:14
so um he was a pirate turned mercenary
46:17
who fought the turks in the balkans uh
46:20
he was captured and
46:21
sold into slavery uh and was a slave for
46:24
ages and ages before he beat his boss to
46:26
death in a wheat field and escape to
46:28
russia
46:29
and then because he was so famous as
46:31
having escaped as a slave he was invited
46:34
to help establish a colony in america
46:36
where he was arrested for mutiny on his
46:38
way and then eventually he did get to
46:40
america and then he did meet pog hunters
46:42
i believe
46:43
um but then had to return to england to
46:45
recover from a gunpowder incident
46:47
which blew his genitals off oh
46:51
no he's got no genitals throughout the
46:53
whole movie
46:55
no this is not in the movie all this
46:57
stuff no no but like you know underneath
46:58
the clothes
46:59
um again i must stress this is not in
47:02
the movie
47:02
oh yeah no no surely it must be the
47:05
pre-genital yeah
47:07
this is when he's sent back to england
47:08
after all the stuff has happened
47:10
in the americas but if you couldn't make
47:12
it with pocahontas when he had genitals
47:14
it's not like he would have stood a
47:15
chance when he didn't is it i guess
47:17
that's why
47:18
these are according to his memoirs he
47:20
said all this
47:21
and historians do assume that they were
47:23
a total fiction oh
47:25
however one historian philip barber has
47:28
said that nothing that he's written has
47:30
yet been found to be a lie
47:32
so it could be true it could be not true
47:33
okay wow
47:35
the story of cinderella is a bit more
47:38
terrifying than
47:39
the one that we know from disney i kind
47:41
of love disney because they took all the
47:42
grims fairy tales that are grotesque
47:44
and made them really child friendly but
47:46
in the original cinderella the evil
47:48
stepsisters when they want to fit into
47:50
the shoes
47:50
just resort to cutting off bits of their
47:52
feet oh so i think
47:54
one of them cuts off her own toes and
47:55
one of them cuts off her own
47:57
heel and they caught apparently because
48:00
of
48:00
uh the blood dripping from the shoes
48:03
although i would have thought it'd be
48:03
quite obvious if you put your foot into
48:05
a shoe
48:06
that you've either got no toes or no
48:07
heel i think so you would have thought
48:09
you'd notice anyway yeah yeah
48:11
well if you just get someone to turn up
48:12
wearing the shoe i guess you might not
48:14
it depends on whether the prince is
48:15
trying to witness the whole
48:16
shoe fitting no because i think what
48:18
happens is that the prince walks around
48:20
with a shoe
48:21
yeah and he tries to put it directly
48:23
onto people's feet doesn't he
48:25
yeah he like kneels down and they give
48:27
them his feet i guess
48:28
they give them their feet i see what
48:29
you're saying because if they went into
48:31
a dressing room
48:32
and then you know quickly chopped off
48:33
the toes and emerged the ugly sisters
48:35
took
48:35
the shoe and said i'm sure i will be
48:37
able to fit into this just give me one
48:39
second
48:39
and they pop into the kitchen
48:43
[Laughter]
48:47
just picking the socks to go with it i
48:49
think i picked the red ones
48:55
yeah the grim version they also had um
48:57
they stopped the sisters
48:58
coming to the wedding by having pigeons
49:01
peck out their eyes
49:02
what yeah so there's a lot more why are
49:03
they not allowed to come to the wedding
49:05
the battle is lost at that point for the
49:06
sisters
49:07
they're still screaming in agony from
49:09
the toe thing they've ruined the vibe
49:10
just don't send an invitation to the
49:12
sisters how about that
49:13
invite them to the evening but we all
49:15
know the thing with the wedding is you
49:17
can only have a certain number of guests
49:18
and at one stage you have to draw the
49:19
line and everyone else gets a ride
49:21
packed out
49:29
okay that's it that's all of our facts
49:31
thank you so much for listening if you'd
49:32
like to get in contact with any of us
49:34
about the things that we've said over
49:35
the course of this podcast
49:36
we can be found on our twitter accounts
49:38
i'm on at schreiberland
49:40
andy at andrew hunter m james at james
49:42
harkin and josinski you can email
49:44
podcast.qi.com yep or you can go to our
49:46
group account which is at no such thing
49:48
or
49:48
our website no such thing as a fish.com
49:51
we have everything up there from all of
49:52
our previous episodes to links to buying
49:54
our books
49:55
and there's also our behind the scenes
49:57
documentary behind the gills check that
49:58
out
49:59
okay we'll be back again next week with
50:01
another episode we'll see you then
50:04
[Music]
50:10
goodbye
50:14
do you know how yields feed themselves
50:16
on the 3000 mile journey
50:17
back to the sargasso sea they keep
50:19
themselves going by consuming their own
50:21
bones
50:22
so their spine loses 65 of its volume
50:26
and the skull loses 50 of its volume
50:29
and they break down these bone cells
50:31
called osteocytes and they use them to
50:32
get the minerals and the nutrients they
50:34
need
50:35
okay because they do look yeah they lose
50:36
all their teeth in their stomach and
50:37
their digestive system so i suppose they
50:39
just have to devour their bones
50:40
that would be like if we were born as
50:42
adults
50:43
and ended as a baby a baby isn't an
50:47
adult without bones and you've got a
50:49
child
50:49
no but i'm talking they have they have
50:50
more bones than adults
50:52
so it's not like that it's time being
50:54
born as a baby and ending as an adult
50:57
well it's good it's good to know which
50:58
way around that is
51:10
you

=304
00:10
[Applause]
00:10
[Music]
00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:21
covent
00:22
garden my name is dan schreiber i am
00:24
sitting here with
00:25
andrew hunter murray james harkin and
00:28
anna jaczynski
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four
00:32
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with you
00:39
andy my fact is that in britain alone
00:42
unnecessary emails create
00:44
nearly 24 000 tons of
00:47
carbon every year wow yeah
00:51
see and you guys always give me crap for
00:52
not replying to my emails i'm the most
00:55
environmentally conscious of us to be
00:57
fair dan
00:58
the number of emails that you send which
01:00
are completely pointless
01:01
[Laughter]
01:02
outweighs that that you don't send many
01:05
okay
01:06
yeah actually we often don't get emails
01:08
in reply to the important stuff from you
01:10
and then we'll be like damn must be away
01:11
from his computer and then suddenly
01:13
you'll be like hey guys
01:14
did you see this ridiculous meme no one
01:15
gives a about he's like
01:17
okay okay listen i didn't watch honestly
01:19
this has gone against what i was hoping
01:21
it would be
01:21
uh so what what this is uh this is a
01:24
calculation
01:25
done by an energy company called ovo
01:28
um and they looked at the carbon
01:30
footprint of an email basically
01:32
so the figures vary but it varies
01:34
between one gram and
01:35
three or four grams it's not very much
01:37
but they did
01:38
also look at how many unnecessary emails
01:40
are sent each day for example people
01:42
writing back to just say thanks and
01:45
sending that email through the system
01:46
is that unnecessary well it depends how
01:49
it depends how good your manners are i
01:50
guess but
01:51
if if it's if we're agreeing that that's
01:53
a sort of superfluous thing
01:55
then what they want us to do is to add a
01:58
little signature to our emails saying
02:00
something like
02:00
this is a thanks in advance so then now
02:03
that sounds really passive to me
02:05
it's like hey andy can you please do
02:08
your qi scripts by the end of the week
02:10
thanks in advance sounds like i said you
02:12
better bloody hell do it yeah that's a
02:13
really good point well that would be
02:15
better than what you normally say which
02:16
is
02:16
better bloody hell so but the
02:19
really cool thing about this researcher
02:20
is that the man who advised them on this
02:22
is a man called mike berners-lee
02:24
and you might know that surname he's the
02:26
brother of tim berners-lee who invented
02:28
the world wide web
02:28
yeah yeah can we just quickly go through
02:31
how it does it so is it
02:32
carbon or carbon dioxide is it from big
02:34
servers processing the information
02:36
it's from all these things so it's from
02:38
uh for example using electricity in the
02:40
first place with the cost of running a
02:41
computer network the cost of keeping all
02:43
the data on servers and
02:44
traveling across the planet so the whole
02:47
thing um
02:48
you know using your computer while it's
02:50
on to send this email like it's all it
02:51
it's very hard to quantify obviously but
02:53
there's a rough figure
02:54
and the calculations they depend on how
02:56
important the email is a little bit
02:58
because
02:59
let's say i send an email back to andy
03:01
just saying thanks
03:02
oh then you don't spend much time
03:05
reading it
03:06
and so it means that it doesn't use up
03:08
as much electricity and it so it means
03:09
that the carbon footprint is lower
03:11
so for instance over 70 of emails that
03:14
are sent are spam
03:15
but they only use up 22 of your carbon
03:17
footprint
03:18
and that's because you hardly ever read
03:20
them or they go straight into your junk
03:21
folder and then get deleted so it's like
03:23
a one-way
03:24
system it's only the making of it the
03:26
user's cab and the reason unless you're
03:28
over the age of 78
03:29
and you're a woman living alone it's
03:31
just donated to a million phony
03:33
charities so far
03:34
yeah um this um mike berners-lee has
03:37
written a book about carbon uh
03:39
footprints and the amount of carbon used
03:41
for lots of different things
03:42
it's called how bad our bananas the
03:44
carbon footprint of everything
03:46
and one thing that is bad as well as
03:48
bananas was the 2010 world cup
03:51
which he says cost us 2.8 million
03:54
tons of co2 and to put that into
03:57
perspective it's the equivalent of every
04:00
man woman and child in the uk
04:02
having 20 cheeseburgers
04:06
in terms of obesity rates or anything
04:08
but in terms of carbon usage
04:10
yeah exactly the amount of carbon or 000
04:13
space shuttle flights
04:15
for the football world cup but it was a
04:16
good world cup right now
04:19
totally worth it mike writes a lot of
04:21
articles online as well so he has an
04:22
article
04:23
series that's called what's the carbon
04:25
footprint of dot dot dot so it's things
04:27
like the carbon footprint of say
04:29
the iraq war he's looked at all the
04:30
numbers and made an estimate
04:32
um and then this one's a bit of a guilty
04:34
uh sort of you don't need this really
04:36
the carbon footprint of the heart bypass
04:38
operation
04:39
i don't think you need to be thinking
04:40
about offsetting when
04:42
you're on your way in it's going to end
04:44
up being too hard bypasses isn't it if
04:46
you wake up
04:46
and they go do you know how many planets
04:48
you've ruined with that
04:50
there's 1.1 tons wow
04:53
um yeah it's not it's not any carbon
04:55
footprint it's all relative
04:56
it is a you know all right lots of
04:58
modern life recreation if you think
04:59
about one email is one gram
05:01
yeah right okay so you could do a good
05:03
perspective yeah but if you obviously if
05:04
you sent an email saying can i book a
05:06
heart by passing then that's
05:07
only adding to the footprint um so
05:10
here's one if you have a blt sandwich
05:12
and you want to lower your carbon
05:14
footprint which one ingredient should
05:16
you throw away
05:17
the bacon yeah yeah yeah throw away the
05:19
bacon
05:20
it's the tomato the tea what is the tea
05:23
okay this is
05:24
nuts tomatoes require so much heating
05:26
and lighting of greenhouses
05:28
that apparently their carbon footprint
05:30
is higher than
05:31
the bacon no way which i i find
05:34
extraordinary
05:35
but what if i just get buy tomatoes from
05:36
a very hot country many many miles away
05:38
and it just gets flown over by jets
05:41
that's it does it need to be a
05:42
greenhouse is it a private jet that your
05:43
tomatoes are being flown in just one
05:45
tomato
05:45
oh yeah yeah okay no no it's one small
05:47
bunch
05:49
i mean that i can't i that is amazing i
05:50
find it extraordinary there are a few
05:52
few sort of counter-intuitive ones like
05:54
apparently a new zealand lamb if you
05:56
imported a new
05:57
zealand land to england to use there's
06:00
less carbon
06:01
um output than a british lamb because
06:03
the rearing is so much more that even if
06:05
you include the shipping
06:06
the lamb is far less if it comes from
06:08
new zealand really and it's not just
06:10
because the
06:10
um natural climate requires less input
06:13
yeah it must be just
06:14
all the procedures that they're doing
06:16
because i would have thought that lands
06:17
are not that hard to rear that one of
06:18
the few things that the british climate
06:19
is
06:20
okay with rearing but that's ridiculous
06:22
lamb and beef do have
06:23
they're the two highest meats with yes
06:25
although that's i think that's total
06:26
ecological impact but a lot of that's
06:28
carbon
06:28
they are but i'm amazed that the new
06:30
zealand lamb is somehow requiring less
06:33
of carbohydrates i mean they send a lot
06:34
less emails don't they in new zealand
06:35
the lambs
06:36
it's mostly just letter writing for the
06:38
lamb still
06:39
um do you know what the third meat is so
06:41
the first is beef
06:43
second is lamb pork i actually think the
06:45
second is pork
06:46
okay and this thing has a bigger carbon
06:48
footprint than lamb chicken
06:49
no it's crustaceans so i can't believe
06:52
this i always think of crustaceans is
06:54
such an ethical
06:55
thing to eat in proportion to other
06:56
meats but they use a huge amount of fuel
06:59
compared to other seafood
07:00
so most seafood has a carbon footprint a
07:02
bit like chicken but shellfish is up
07:04
there with beef in terms of its
07:06
footprint i'm so delighted
07:08
because i hate it i hate eating
07:09
crustaceans but it's just because i'm
07:11
a bit fatty but now i can say it's
07:13
because i want to save the environment
07:15
oh god as if you didn't have enough
07:16
moral high ground do you know one thing
07:18
it has an insanely high carbon footprint
07:20
one practice um oh god i mean
07:24
yeah i mean lots having asthma ah
07:27
is that because you're breathing out
07:28
lots of carbon dioxide it's not it's not
07:30
that
07:30
okay again i don't feel comfortable
07:32
causing people with asthma to
07:32
hyperventilate with guilt no no but i've
07:35
got i i i used to have asthma
07:36
and uh i don't have it any more was that
07:38
an ecological decision
07:41
no but i did used to have it and i used
07:43
to have those you know inhalers
07:45
yeah and you know they they um use a gas
07:48
called hydrofluoroalkane which is a
07:49
propellant that's what squirts the
07:51
medicine out you know it's like a little
07:52
gas cartridge
07:53
those inhalers account for four percent
07:55
of the nhs
07:56
greenhouse gas expenditure those
07:59
inhalers alone
08:00
four percent isn't that massive so if
08:02
you replaced one in ten of those
08:04
inhalers you would reduce carbon dioxide
08:06
equivalent emissions by fifty eight
08:07
thousand
08:08
what can you replace them with do they
08:09
have like eco ones there are other there
08:11
are more ecological ones which some
08:13
people can have i think
08:14
uh not everyone but yeah 58 000 tons
08:16
just to replace one in 10 of those you
08:18
would say
08:20
the nhs actually had an incredible
08:22
carbon
08:23
mistake quite recently didn't they just
08:25
speaking of them so did you read about
08:26
this they had an email
08:27
storm in 2016 where 186 million
08:32
useless emails ended up being sent
08:36
this is the history of email storms is
08:38
so fun so basically this
08:40
apparently is the industry term for when
08:41
someone accidentally sends an email to a
08:44
huge mailing list and in this case it
08:45
was the it
08:46
guy who was sending a test email he sent
08:48
it to 1.2 million employees
08:51
and then they all replied all saying
08:53
please unsubscribe me from this list
08:55
and then there are other ones who
08:57
replied all saying stop replying all
08:58
over one stop replying all
08:59
and eventually it ended up being 186
09:01
million emails and i believe it took
09:03
down the nhs mail system
09:05
there's a very funny quote from a
09:07
spokesperson the nhs digital
09:08
spokesperson
09:10
who said uh some users have experienced
09:12
short delays in the nhs mail system this
09:14
morning but the issue has
09:15
been resolved but she did have to
09:17
dictate that over the phone because her
09:19
email still wasn't working
09:22
so next time the nhs gives you
09:23
about your heart bypass
09:27
2016
09:30
there's a guy called joey m he's
09:33
lives in rhode island and he has the
09:35
world record most number of unread
09:37
emails in his inbox
09:39
uh oh wait can we guess yeah uh
09:42
in the thousands what two thousand i'm
09:45
ready
09:46
i'm pretty sure these two that's me
09:50
uh okay 58 million can i go can i go
09:53
ridiculous say a billion
09:54
a billion billion four billion wow 294
09:58
million
09:59
967 256
10:03
and he evidenced it by uploading a video
10:06
onto um recordsetter.com which allows
10:09
you to
10:10
if you think you've done more keepy
10:11
uppies than anyone else you can put a
10:12
video on this site and
10:13
i'll show you and he showed it on his
10:16
phone just deleting one message to get
10:18
down to just over four billion
10:19
oh what but isn't that amazing is he on
10:22
a lot of mailing lists does he work for
10:24
the nhs
10:28
and there was a survey done by adobe
10:30
quite recently about emails
10:32
that says 55 of people whenever they get
10:34
to zero inbox say it's relieving
10:37
22 say it's amazing and 10 say it's
10:40
impossible
10:43
and the only reason i bring up this
10:45
survey is because they categorize people
10:47
into boomers gen x millennials and gen
10:49
zed
10:49
and they put millennials starting in
10:51
1977 which makes me a millennial
10:55
nice so that's the only reason i bring
10:57
it up as a long build up to emphasize
10:59
that you're a millennial that's the
11:00
place for the record i was going to ask
11:02
you about that skateboard you're holding
11:03
[Laughter]
11:06
so just one weird bit of carbon news so
11:08
in 1981
11:10
ronald reagan made this speech made this
11:12
statement where he said trees produce
11:14
more pollution than automobiles
11:17
so he said that and people thought well
11:19
that's very funny and probably some
11:20
idiots believed him and it probably set
11:22
the world back by about 100 years
11:24
um but he said this but trees
11:27
do emit greenhouse gases so they emit
11:29
loads of methane and we've only just
11:30
discovered this
11:31
it was in 2014 there was this huge like
11:34
methane surplus in the atmosphere people
11:36
didn't know where it was coming from
11:37
and this woman went to the amazon and
11:39
tested its trees and figured out they're
11:40
all pumping out me things they're all
11:42
farted
11:42
they're all fasting tree farts uh ending
11:45
up in the atmosphere but this isn't a
11:47
problem
11:47
is it it's definitely definitely offset
11:50
by the amount of co2 that they're
11:52
absorbing
11:53
and so we don't want to get rid of the
11:54
trees guys trees are good thumbs up
11:56
but it is a thing that we need to work
11:57
out why they're doing it and so it might
11:59
be more in wetlands which have a lot of
12:00
methane within them that they're pumping
12:02
out
12:02
so maybe we don't plant trees on big
12:04
parts of methane for instance
12:06
right hey remember we had that fact a
12:08
long long time ago about
12:09
every tree i think it's in melbourne
12:11
that has an email address
12:12
yeah yeah well that's a bit of a oh my
12:14
god they're really shooting themselves
12:15
in the room aren't they
12:19
[Applause]
12:20
okay it's time for fact number two and
12:23
that is
12:24
james okay my fact this week is that hot
12:26
dogs
12:27
are called hot dogs because people used
12:29
to think they contained
12:30
dog and did they no
12:34
don't think so no i don't think so um so
12:37
this is something i read in the oxford
12:39
english dictionary
12:40
the word hot dog appears to be college
12:43
slang from
12:44
america in the late 19th century and
12:47
according to the oed who cites the
12:50
oxford companions food and drink and the
12:52
historical dictionary of american slang
12:54
the reason people called them hot dogs
12:56
is one they were hot
12:57
and two they had this weird meat that
13:00
they didn't know where it quite came
13:01
from and it might as well come from dog
13:03
has come from anywhere else
13:04
okay yeah in fact i think that it could
13:07
have been
13:08
in there so i got too into these three
13:10
people
13:11
called gerald leonard cohen um and i
13:14
don't think he's related and barry
13:15
poppek
13:16
and and david shulman who have devoted
13:18
over 20 years of their life to working
13:20
out the root of the phrase hot dog
13:23
and so they're they're into it and
13:25
gerald leonard cohen says that
13:27
scandalous but true
13:28
some butchers even hired dog killers in
13:30
the u.s who would go and club some dogs
13:32
and stuff them in sausages
13:34
even though it wasn't it wasn't legit
13:35
but he's found some instances of that
13:37
and then they'd sell the carcass
13:39
to the butcher um and yeah i think what
13:41
was it 1884
13:43
that they started calling sausages dogs
13:45
and then they added the the hot
13:46
in the 1890s i read a bit about gerald
13:49
leonard cohen
13:50
and barry poppik they've written a 300
13:52
page book about the origin of the phrase
13:53
hot dog
13:55
and he does this he publishes his own
13:57
journal which is called comments on
13:58
etymology
13:59
uh the circulation is under a hundred
14:01
you have to be you have to write to him
14:02
and send him money and he will then send
14:04
you a copy of this thing
14:05
he once wrote 167 page paper on just the
14:08
word jazz
14:09
he is a serious etymologist and he is we
14:12
should say
14:12
also a professor so he's a professor of
14:14
foreign languages um
14:16
at a university so he does make an
14:17
income other than from
14:19
these hundred subscribers but he said i
14:22
think he was interviewed and he said
14:23
what else am i going to do with my time
14:24
go
14:25
skiing i'll probably get hurt so i guess
14:28
i've got this research
14:30
i'm supposed to go skiing this weekend
14:32
well i suggest you instead devote two
14:33
decades to researching hot dog
14:36
uh i reckon the first hot dogs must have
14:38
been quite good actually because
14:39
the phrase hot dog which means like
14:42
something which is really awesome
14:44
is only one year younger than the word
14:47
hot dog meaning the food stuff
14:48
so they had hot dogs for one year and
14:50
then people thought it was a word that
14:52
meant
14:52
this is great that's uh mickey mouse's
14:55
first words
14:56
is it here it goes hot dogs plural he
14:59
pluralizes it
15:00
i'm so glad we've done this because i've
15:01
always wondered and it's a wonderful
15:02
life when the james stewart character
15:04
says
15:04
hot dog and it's when it's something
15:06
totally unrelated to hot dogs has
15:08
happened
15:09
his name is some people were annoyed
15:13
about it
15:13
so they started one of the early sites
15:15
they were sold was coney island
15:17
in is that in new jersey no it's new
15:19
york new york
15:20
sorry it's coney island in new york and
15:22
they were so annoyed by the association
15:24
with hot dogs thinking they were a
15:25
slightly
15:26
lower class thing that in 1913 the
15:28
chamber of commerce passed a law
15:29
forbidding the use of the
15:31
phrase hot dog on signs really you
15:33
weren't allowed to have a sign up saying
15:34
hot dog
15:34
i think was that because of the
15:36
implication there might be dog meat in
15:37
them
15:38
yeah um what's that you don't want that
15:40
um so we were in new york not too long
15:42
ago and
15:43
i went for a walk uh one day to central
15:46
park
15:46
and hot dog vendors everywhere along the
15:48
roads and i was just reading that in
15:50
order to
15:51
park their hot dog vending machines in
15:53
these spots do you know what they pay
15:55
prices they're so just should we have a
15:57
guess yeah just
15:58
just okay american dollars just to be
16:00
there for a year
16:01
per year just to park there i'm going to
16:04
say it's probably
16:05
in the region of ten thousand us dollars
16:08
i would have said about the same
16:09
15 let's say 15 i say they pay in kind
16:12
and it's like 10 hot dogs a year
16:15
with mustard okay so um there was one
16:17
guy um who was parked on fifth avenue
16:19
east 62 second street very near central
16:21
park
16:22
um 289 500.
16:25
no for his annual yeah and that's that
16:28
is
16:28
he's got to get that to break even
16:30
obviously because he's got to push and
16:32
then everything is proper from there
16:33
but they all managed to do it yeah
16:35
because hot dogs in new york sell for
16:37
ten thousand dollars each day
16:38
exactly that is quite a lot of money
16:41
yeah
16:42
so on average they have to pay the city
16:44
two hundred thousand dollars
16:45
each year i've never been to one of
16:47
those stands and got a hot dog and i
16:49
feel incredibly guilty that i've been
16:50
driving these poor people out of
16:51
business
16:52
do you know one thing that doesn't have
16:53
to park that is associated with hot dogs
16:56
have you heard of the wienermobile oh i
16:59
maybe have i've never been for a ride in
17:01
the wienermobile i haven't
17:05
so you know oscar may has a big hot dog
17:07
company they have a fleet
17:09
a small fleet of wienermobiles which are
17:11
cars shaped like hot dogs
17:12
which have been going since 1936.
17:14
obviously they've changed them
17:16
you know but basically they uh they were
17:18
a huge promotional thing so they would
17:20
hand out hot dogs
17:21
small hot dogs from inside the big hot
17:23
dog because the car is shaped like a hot
17:25
dog
17:25
and they would hand out things called
17:27
wiener whistles to children
17:28
so that if a child ever saw the
17:30
wienermobile they would blow their
17:31
whistle and attract other children to
17:33
come and get a hot dog
17:34
the opposite of an ice cream van you're
17:36
getting the kid to do the job for you
17:38
yeah
17:38
exactly and they train their drivers at
17:40
a place called hot dog hi
17:42
and then once you're in once you're in
17:44
like starfleet academy for hot dog
17:46
eye you uh you drive around the country
17:48
it's mostly sort of students and things
17:50
they hire
17:51
and you drive in pairs and one person
17:53
has to drive and the other one has to
17:54
wave to people
17:55
which is called riding shot bun shot bun
17:58
yeah
17:59
and sometimes they let you in and they
18:00
ask you to fasten your meat belt
18:02
wow that's disgusting i think if
18:06
someone's driving around
18:07
picking up children and telling them to
18:09
fasten their meat in a car shaped like a
18:11
sausage
18:12
your defense going it's not looking good
18:13
mate
18:15
but he blew up my wiener whistle
18:20
there's only ever been one accident
18:21
involving a wienermobile
18:23
and one of them rammed into a house
18:25
imagine that coming through the window
18:27
yeah it'd be like a battering ram as
18:28
well
18:30
take the whole thing down uh another
18:32
famous
18:33
hot dog company in america is nathan's
18:36
okay
18:36
and that's a really good story about
18:38
them so there was another hot dog maker
18:40
on coney island called feltman's
18:42
and they were really really huge and
18:44
really really popular and they had what
18:45
some people said was possibly the
18:47
largest restaurant in the world which
18:48
just sold hot dogs
18:50
but then they had a guy who came to work
18:52
for them who was a jewish immigrant from
18:54
poland called nathan
18:55
handworker and nathan handworker was
18:58
working
18:59
um just slight i think what you're
19:00
laughing at that work handwork is a
19:02
funny
19:02
yeah it's a funny name yeah but he
19:05
wasn't masturbating people
19:06
he was spending his week slicing buns
19:10
okay so it sounds like masturbating
19:13
[Laughter]
19:14
he was working as a bun slicer and then
19:17
he decided well what i'm going to do is
19:18
i'm going to start my own company
19:20
and he needed to get some money together
19:23
so he lived entirely on hot dogs
19:25
for a year he had nothing but hot dogs
19:28
and he slept on the kitchen floor
19:30
at this place so he got all the money
19:32
together and then eventually he started
19:34
his own business
19:35
and then undercut feltman's by selling
19:37
his hot dogs for half the price
19:38
and became what's quite synonymous as
19:41
well as oscar isn't as well as
19:43
felt but kind of synonymous with hot
19:45
dogs in america though
19:46
wow but he did have to have quadruple
19:48
heart bypasses
19:53
so that's that's the big competition
19:54
isn't it in america they have nathan
19:56
it's called nathan's famous hot dog
19:58
eating contest and the men's champion is
20:00
a man called joey chestnut
20:02
who's won it nine times his all-time
20:04
record is eating 74
20:06
hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes that's
20:08
7.4 a minute
20:09
if my math is correct yeah and there are
20:12
there's such rivalry in the thing so
20:14
look you have to eat the buns as well
20:15
don't you you have to eat the buns so
20:16
there's a guy
20:17
eat the buns otherwise you haven't eaten
20:18
the hot dog yeah that's true
20:23
it's not the bread oh the bread's
20:24
keeping this dog warm it's not like a
20:26
blanket
20:27
i'm on the atkins style i'll just have
20:28
the dog please
20:30
um but the previous champion was this
20:32
guy called takeru kobayashi from japan
20:35
and no one had ever eaten more than i
20:37
can't remember what it was like 20 or
20:38
something and then he walked on stage in
20:39
2001 he ate 50.
20:41
it completely revolutionized the sport
20:43
and the yard but what was his thing you
20:45
know in like um
20:46
the fosbury flop yeah you changed the
20:48
way that you jumped over the high jump
20:50
so that one was his training method
20:52
right his training method was he would
20:53
practice drinking three gallons of water
20:55
in 90 seconds
20:56
meaning that his stomach got used to
20:58
expanding very quickly
20:59
can i say i tried to do that once and
21:02
was extreme like do not try that at home
21:04
extremely sick send us your videos of
21:06
you not trying it at home oh my goodness
21:08
i was just like vomiting water for ages
21:11
afterwards and
21:12
why did you were you trying to enter
21:13
this competition no it wasn't i was
21:15
young and it was a bet
21:17
well you're a millennial that's the kind
21:18
of crazy thing they do
21:20
so the other thing he did he invented
21:21
this method where you split each hot dog
21:24
in two
21:24
and you force both ends in your mouth at
21:26
once because your mouth is wide enough
21:28
for two
21:29
hot dogs right i cannot believe i
21:31
haven't thought of that before
21:33
what i don't understand so you chop each
21:35
hog in half halfway along so you've got
21:37
the two ends
21:38
and then you just shove both ends in
21:39
your mouth at the same time and they
21:41
call this the solomon method which is an
21:43
allusion to king
21:44
solomon because he once threatened to
21:46
split a baby in two
21:47
in a biblical story yeah and it's a very
21:49
high brow contest isn't it so you get a
21:51
lot of these biblical and classical
21:52
references
21:54
wow two parents were arguing over who
21:57
got custody of a baby and solomon said
21:58
well we'll cut the baby in two
22:00
and then we'll get the whole thing in
22:01
his mouth no
22:03
no you didn't no one ate the baby baby
22:06
eating contest
22:07
it's in john part one one of the parents
22:10
said oh that's fine by me a good idea
22:12
let's split the baby in two and the
22:14
other one said no
22:15
don't do that and then king solomon said
22:16
well you should probably have the baby
22:18
is that what happens i think that's
22:19
right i think that's right yeah yeah
22:22
um that's amazing but so obvious i i
22:25
would have split it i don't want to
22:26
claim that i would have won this
22:27
competition but i think i would have had
22:28
a chance because obviously you put it in
22:30
half and shove it in both sides
22:31
i would say into three parts well i was
22:33
just gonna say where do you stop is it
22:35
possible to cut into three four five six
22:37
or seven parts well how wide is your
22:38
mouth
22:39
well you're looking at me the people at
22:42
home don't have this
22:43
option but i don't think i could fit in
22:45
fact i'm not sure i could fit two of
22:47
mine
22:47
i'm not no you're a two man three max
22:51
i think there's a point at which there
22:52
are diminishing returns from cutting
22:54
your hot dogs into an increasing number
22:55
of pieces before you put them in your
22:56
mouth
22:58
still with a knife and fork on the first
22:59
hot dog after the competition is over
23:01
those guys are
23:02
going to feel so as you cut it into the
23:03
hundredth piece i'm gonna get this whole
23:05
thing in my mouth
23:08
um do you know that the pentagon used to
23:10
have a hot dog stand
23:11
yeah and there was a rumor um which the
23:14
tour guides still
23:15
tell to this day when you get taken
23:17
around the pentagon and it got taken
23:18
down in 2006
23:19
um but during the cold war apparently
23:22
the russians were convinced that some
23:24
amazing stuff was going their secretive
23:26
conversations because people would meet
23:28
there
23:28
so apparently they had two missiles
23:30
aimed at this hot dog stand
23:32
the entire time of the cold war and that
23:35
was the root that was the rumor
23:36
no one's ever imagined if the missile
23:38
hit how many pieces those hot dogs would
23:41
be in
23:42
you'd be able to stuff them all in your
23:43
gun stop strategizing for the next
23:48
tournament
23:49
[Applause]
23:51
okay it is time for fact number three
23:53
and that is my fact
23:54
my fact this week is that the oldest
23:56
recording we have of a poet
23:58
reading his own poem is of robert
24:00
browning
24:01
who forgets the words to the poem
24:03
halfway through and ends the recording
24:05
with an apology
24:07
that's amazing so this was in april of
24:09
1889
24:11
this is only a few months before he died
24:12
and robert browning i think he was at a
24:14
party and it was being held by the
24:17
artist rudolph lehmann
24:18
and he had with him one of those edison
24:21
wax cylinder talking machines
24:23
and he got robert browning to recite his
24:26
poem which was called
24:27
how they brought the good news from
24:28
ghent to x
24:30
i no no it's x yeah like example
24:34
yeah andy was just doing his alley g
24:37
impression
24:40
hi is it really yeah i did it youtube
24:43
listen to it
24:43
please forgive me i memorized it when i
24:45
was 10. so did you
24:47
i did i had to do it for a recital
24:49
competition
24:50
and i oh this actual poem the browning
24:52
this poem did you get through it without
24:54
apologizing
24:55
i did better than browning did wow i got
24:57
through it and then i was rereading it
24:59
and i was so ashamed
25:00
at how little of it i could remember i
25:01
think they all i could remember is
25:03
because it's like it's such a good poem
25:05
actually it's done
25:06
galloping you never really know what the
25:08
good news is and it's got this great
25:10
rhythm of horses just
25:11
galloping from ghent to x and all i
25:13
remember is they galloped dirk galloped
25:15
we galloped all three
25:17
you know what you're embarrassed that
25:19
you couldn't remember much of it i still
25:20
think that's pretty impressive
25:22
i think you almost got further than
25:23
browning himself as well
25:25
no you're right it's and the pace when
25:27
you listen to him speak it and this is
25:28
online so if you go on youtube and put
25:30
this in anyone listening can
25:32
can actually hear the man himself um it
25:34
does feel like it's a
25:36
old western he's a galloping girl it's a
25:38
fantastic pace to it
25:40
but he only gets a few lines in and he
25:42
suddenly says i'm most terribly sorry
25:43
that i can't remember my own verses
25:45
but then adds but the one thing i will
25:47
remember all my life is this astonishing
25:49
sensation produced upon me by your
25:51
wonderful
25:51
invention and then you hear people
25:54
cheering for him it's a real
25:55
politician's answer the way he says i
25:57
can't remember the poem you've
25:58
specifically asked me to read but one
26:00
thing i can remember
26:02
amazing pivot it's an incredible pivot
26:04
yeah
26:05
um and uh so one nice thing about it was
26:08
that there were a lot of people
26:09
recording at the time but supposedly he
26:12
was one of the first notable people
26:14
to pass away so soon after the recording
26:16
and it was a year after he died when
26:18
they had a memorial for him that they
26:19
played his voice
26:20
at the memorial and they said it was
26:22
like him coming back from the dead it
26:24
was this
26:24
eerie thing that no one had ever
26:26
experienced before i think it was the
26:27
first time that anyone's voice had been
26:29
played or any more
26:30
notable person anyway after they died
26:32
which that must have been
26:33
pretty weird right yeah yeah it must
26:35
have been weird but also
26:37
it's kind of embarrassing i say please
26:39
don't play the recording where i cocked
26:40
up after i'm dead on my anniversary
26:43
yeah you know they're all just pointing
26:45
and laughing well
26:46
some of his relatives did say it was
26:47
embarrassing that they played it did
26:49
they yeah
26:49
not everyone was happy that it was there
26:51
the fans it was at a browning society
26:53
gathering in london
26:54
they were all huddled around this there
26:57
were societies
26:58
there were societies decades before he
27:00
died not maybe not decades but and
27:02
certainly in the last decade
27:03
um before he died there were people
27:05
meeting up and he found that
27:06
embarrassing
27:07
oh everyone was so embarrassed all the
27:08
time but his
27:10
funeral was a ticketed event because he
27:12
was so popular i think it was yeah it
27:14
was westminster abbey where he
27:15
his funeral was held they got over a
27:16
thousand applications and the dean of
27:18
westminster wrote saying
27:20
everyone has been trying to get into
27:21
browning's funeral and i've had to
27:22
really limit it to people who had a
27:24
really good reason to be there
27:25
really yeah do you know he um because he
27:28
he wasn't popular throughout
27:29
most of his life and then he did get
27:31
very popular towards the end and
27:32
all these people wanting to go to his
27:33
funeral and also he sparked a fashion
27:36
for dressing in brown no
27:39
he did just after he died in america he
27:42
sparked a brief fashion for dressing up
27:43
in brown items of clothing
27:45
just because he was carl browning he
27:47
didn't dress in brown himself
27:48
no it was just the name yeah wow how did
27:51
what did they do when dickens died
27:55
a lot of arrests
27:59
do you have any more on that about how
28:00
that came about i know i'm sorry i've
28:02
only found it in one place and sorry it
28:03
was before he died it was 1979 to 1980
28:06
when he just released one of his very
28:07
popular
28:08
1979 wow so thatcher was just
28:10
[Laughter]
28:14
it was 1879 to 1880 when he just
28:17
released one of his popular works
28:19
wow he um his uh romance with elizabeth
28:22
barrett browning who he
28:24
they became husband and wife and she was
28:25
way more famous to start with than him
28:28
it was really interesting because he
28:29
started uh it started as a
28:31
correspondence
28:32
and she was housebound and she was
28:33
invalid and her father was extremely
28:35
strict about who she didn't didn't see
28:37
despite the fact she was also a famous
28:38
poet which i don't really understand but
28:40
um he started writing to her and they
28:42
started a passionate correspondence and
28:43
then they eloped
28:45
and got married and they had a son who
28:47
they called pen
28:50
he was actually called robert as well
28:51
but they nicknamed him pen and that's
28:52
all they called him
28:53
no he was called um vitamin or
28:56
wiedermann
28:56
robert wiedemann yeah but the reason
28:58
they called him pen is because he
28:59
couldn't pronounce the word wiedermann
29:01
as a baby well not as a baby
29:04
you could pronounce anything they had
29:07
massive arguments about how penn
29:08
should grow up did you read about these
29:10
no no so
29:12
uh basically he wanted the child to grow
29:14
up looking
29:15
sort of very blokey victorian you know
29:18
wearing trousers and having his hair cut
29:19
short
29:19
and she wanted petticoats and
29:21
shoulder-length ringlets of hair
29:23
and she won maybe because she was more
29:25
famous or more authoritative but
29:27
basically until the child was 10 he wore
29:28
petticoats and then as soon as she died
29:31
when penn was 10 years old she um robert
29:33
had the child's hair cut really short
29:35
okay dressing her differently a big bone
29:37
of contention between them but he turned
29:38
out um
29:39
quite different to what she would have
29:40
wanted then because he so he did have
29:42
this quite fey upbringing and he slept
29:44
in her room until he was 12.
29:46
and and i thought i thought hang on i
29:49
thought
29:50
elizabeth browning died when he was 10.
29:52
and you're saying it was a really tragic
29:54
last two years
29:55
really very traumatizing for him oh well
29:58
i've got until he was 12. okay so we'll
29:59
factor
30:00
that but he ended up this real kind of
30:03
well what is described in one of his
30:05
biography and one of browning's
30:06
biographies as a beefy and beery
30:08
middle-aged man in knickerbockers with a
30:10
reputation for promiscuity
30:12
and also his home his house was just a
30:14
filthy pig-sty
30:15
he had people around for parties and so
30:17
his house was nicknamed the palazzo
30:19
pigsty the
30:29
he was a painter but i think not a great
30:31
one and apparently
30:32
his ponchon for painting voluptuous
30:34
female nudes did not encourage
30:37
sales in victorian england well he was a
30:39
sculptor too
30:40
what was he yeah one of his very few
30:42
sculpted works is of a woman communing
30:44
with a python
30:45
and it's quite sexy it's called uh dry
30:47
oak or dry opi fascinated by apollo
30:50
but during the sculpting process the
30:52
python tried to strangle the model that
30:53
he got
30:54
and he then had to shoot it oh my god
30:57
the python yes
30:58
wow i know do they ever paint portrait
31:03
justice outtakes it's um it's
31:06
interesting the
31:07
the idea of his voice coming back from
31:08
the death at his uh
31:10
funeral um i find interesting because he
31:12
was one of the people who was very
31:14
against spiritualism
31:15
he used to sit on seances because
31:18
elizabeth was really into seances and
31:20
this was the time where arthur conan
31:21
doyle was into it and so on and houdini
31:23
and who know houdini was again he was a
31:25
skeptic yeah
31:26
they just sound like all the most famous
31:28
people in the world where it sounds like
31:30
you just go along to a normal sales
31:31
hoping to speak to a relative and then
31:33
suddenly like houdini stands up but
31:34
arthur conan doyle stands up
31:36
browning's there well they were going
31:38
for the rich people weren't they
31:39
yeah comedians well this was a this was
31:41
a very famous medium it was called
31:43
daniel donglis
31:44
hume danglers dungless and douglas
31:47
wasn't he was daniel hume and he added
31:49
dunglass
31:53
and uh it's so weird isn't it because it
31:55
looks like it's a misprint of douglas
31:57
it really does and he was uh he was
32:01
someone who was very famous back in the
32:02
day
32:03
and um he used to do all these seances
32:05
and one seance he did was with
32:07
the brownings and they were sitting
32:08
there and he was really skeptical robert
32:10
and elizabeth was really into it
32:12
and um daniel dunglass suddenly said
32:15
your son who passed away um who was very
32:18
young
32:19
is here with us and there was an
32:20
apparition that was that was
32:22
near them and they were oh my god this
32:24
is amazing and it's so great browning
32:26
word
32:26
this is not this is not my son and he
32:28
grabbed the apparition
32:30
and it was hume's naked foot that was
32:32
hanging in the air
32:36
such a good story it was a bare foot
32:47
the thing was he didn't have a son no he
32:49
didn't know this yeah yeah there was no
32:51
dead son please do your research as a
32:53
medium do the very
32:55
basic research if you're going to claim
32:56
the dead sounds come back make sure
32:57
there's a dead son yeah especially when
32:59
the people around the table are really
33:00
famous
33:01
and he could probably have just gone on
33:02
to wikipedia in chat
33:04
um every qi person's favorite poem
33:08
by robert browning is pippa passes
33:11
and that's because it contains the lines
33:14
sing to the bats
33:15
sleek sisterhoods full compliance with
33:18
gallantry
33:18
then owls and bats cows and monks
33:22
and nuns in a cloister's moods
33:25
and this is because he thought that the
33:28
word
33:29
was a kind of headdress worn by a nun
33:34
he had taken this from a 1660 satirical
33:36
poem called vanity
33:38
of the vanities which says they talked
33:40
of having a cardinals hat
33:42
they'd send him a soon an old nun's
33:45
and he'd read that and thought well they
33:47
could only be talking about the
33:48
headdress
33:49
it can't be anything else so it must be
33:51
that and he probably didn't
33:52
imagine putting it in your own place so
33:55
good and what's great is
33:56
the only reason we know that is the oed
33:59
itself
33:59
chased him up to say do you have some
34:01
sort of secret etymology about this that
34:03
we don't know
34:05
no no just it up did he did the
34:08
did the oed tell him you know what
34:10
you've done here
34:11
well they must have said we're
34:12
approaching you because doesn't
34:13
mean that um or they might have just
34:15
said
34:15
we're interested in you yeah anyone who
34:18
heard that poem
34:19
the very first time he read it out has
34:21
gone to him
34:22
robert did you just say none stuart
34:28
he doesn't need to wait for the led to
34:29
come over
34:31
he's a laughingstock of the whole town
34:35
oh but for a while he would have been
34:37
going through his town going oh lovely
34:38
34:39
because he pointed to a nun's head it's
34:42
so annoying because it's such a good
34:43
word for rhyming with things
34:45
yeah you're right yeah oh
34:48
actually you could have said hats there
34:50
you go
34:51
it would have worked the meaning would
34:53
have been the same perfect
34:55
apparently well i mean so his poems at
34:58
the time were known for being
35:00
kind of impenetrable and impossible to
35:01
understand and you know really great
35:04
poets read them and did not get what he
35:05
was on about so tennyson said
35:07
of his poem sawdello which was an early
35:10
one before he'd become a bit more
35:11
uh accessible tennyson said uh he only
35:14
understood
35:15
the first and last lines of the entire
35:17
thing the first line is
35:19
who will as in who will read this who
35:21
will may hear sordello's story told
35:23
and the last line is who would has read
35:26
sordello's storytelled
35:28
and the in-between was nonsense and then
35:30
henry james
35:31
uh another great author he would have
35:32
thought would understand most things uh
35:34
said he was comforted on hearing
35:35
browning read his poems himself to an
35:38
audience that
35:38
at least if you don't understand them he
35:40
apparently understands them even less
35:43
wow henry jones wrote some of the most
35:44
complicated sentences in the whole of
35:46
english literature he's
35:47
so hard to read and if he didn't get
35:49
browning yeah browning's like
35:51
why did henry james come up to me and
35:52
call me a nun
35:58
okay it's time for our final fact of the
36:00
show and that is
36:01
chozinski my fact this week is that in
36:04
1948 in idaho
36:06
leftover world war ii parachutes were
36:08
used to drop beavers out of airplanes
36:12
for any particular reason no just just
36:14
yeah why not
36:15
you know you've got to do something um
36:17
no this was so this was
36:18
post-war people were feeling kind of
36:20
related in america because they won
36:22
and they started moving to this place in
36:24
idaho called payet lake
36:26
near a place called mccool and there
36:28
were beavers there and beavers get in
36:29
the way of humans sometimes because they
36:31
sort of built dams they disrupt water
36:33
flows
36:34
uh and they just change the surrounding
36:35
environment so the people wanted them
36:37
out
36:38
and there was this guy called elmo hater
36:41
who worked for idaho
36:43
he really did not like sesame street did
36:45
he
36:49
it was spelled differently but he did
36:51
have a problem with puppets
36:52
uh he worked for idaho fish and game uh
36:55
association and he
36:56
knew of a place called chamberlain basin
36:58
200 miles away which he thought perfect
37:00
for
37:00
beavers and he also knew that world war
37:03
ii just ended and there were all these
37:04
leftover parachutes
37:05
so he was like let's marry marry the two
37:08
okay
37:09
and he did he tried well he tried he
37:10
actually tried taking them to this place
37:12
by
37:12
horse and carriage first horse and cart
37:14
because there were no roads going
37:15
between the two
37:16
destinations and the horses hated the
37:19
beavers
37:20
so apparently horses if you put two
37:21
beavers on their cart they freak out did
37:23
you read
37:24
his phrase about it now write this
37:25
gorgeous phrase he said horses and mules
37:27
become
37:28
spooky and quarrelsome when loaded with
37:30
a struggling odorous pair of live
37:32
beavers
37:33
spooky and quarrelsome so the horses
37:36
didn't like the beavers boobs didn't
37:37
like the horses
37:38
and so this guy dropped them in the
37:40
boxes
37:41
into the forest instead yeah have you
37:43
seen the footage of it
37:44
uh yes yeah it's awesome yeah yeah so
37:47
this was only uncovered quite recently
37:49
right so it was
37:50
it was lost for a long time we knew
37:51
there was footage but no one knew where
37:53
it was it's been uncovered a few years
37:54
back i think
37:55
and you see the beaver being packed into
37:58
this box which is a sort of bite-proof
38:00
box it's not locked down so the idea is
38:02
that they're sort of holding it shut
38:04
and the weight of um of heading towards
38:07
the ground is what's holding it shut as
38:08
soon as they land it can open up and the
38:10
beaver can get out
38:11
but they don't drop from a high height
38:13
it's a really quick descent it's like
38:14
only 100 feet or so
38:16
it's really crazy yeah i have no idea
38:18
how they survive the impact
38:20
well they were very happy i think there
38:21
were 76 that were dropped and 75
38:24
survived and it was because they tried
38:25
it
38:29
that one it was very sad that one
38:31
somehow jumped out
38:32
open the lid of the box yeah but they
38:35
had one training beaver
38:37
they did they called geronimo and they
38:40
would
38:40
the the that was the i think that
38:42
geronimo has the record for the beaver
38:44
who's done the most parachute drops in
38:45
the world
38:46
i think even if he'd only done it twice
38:48
that would be a record for the most part
38:51
but he was this imagine if you told him
38:54
that now you mean i didn't have to do it
38:55
there's only 350 times
38:57
in fact i'd argue if geronimo had only
38:59
done it once he would have had the joint
39:00
record
39:03
well he was this old tough old male and
39:05
they they thought he's going to be a
39:07
practice dummy they used dummies first
39:08
and then they thought we'd need a live
39:09
one and every time he climbed out of the
39:11
box someone picked him up
39:12
and then eventually he got so used to it
39:14
that as soon as they saw him approaching
39:16
he'd crawl back into the box of his own
39:18
accord
39:18
ready for the next jump wow so sweet
39:21
he's fine with it
39:22
beavers are beavers are cool aren't they
39:24
so cool great love beavers
39:26
i love most about them i well one thing
39:28
is this
39:29
uh stuff i didn't know about called
39:30
castorium i hope i'm pronouncing that
39:32
right
39:33
what the anal secretions well it says
39:35
what do you love most about beavers
39:37
right lots of creations um so it's right
39:40
let's just clear this up it's not anal
39:42
it's not their anus it's just extremely
39:44
near their anus
39:47
they have these glands uh and they
39:50
if you lift up the tail it's really
39:52
close to the bum and it produces a kind
39:54
of
39:55
scent it's this kind of brown slime it's
39:57
not feces
39:58
it's just very near the feces but it
40:00
smells heavenly
40:02
and um there was a it smells so good and
40:05
it's a product of their
40:06
diet of the bark and leaves they eat and
40:08
it's very hard to get hold
40:10
of um you have to knock a beaver out and
40:11
then basically milk its anus
40:14
not the anus not the energy you're
40:17
milking it wrong no
40:19
no that wasn't custard that's all the
40:21
slime i've got
40:23
but it's it used to be used to flavor
40:25
vanilla it used to be a legitimate
40:27
product
40:28
and it's so npr investigated whether
40:30
it's still used
40:32
and it turns out that there is a
40:33
schnapps in sweden which does still use
40:35
it really but it's so expensive to
40:37
produce because there's only a limited
40:38
number of beavers
40:39
and the global consumption these days is
40:40
only about 132 kilos a year
40:42
anna what's your favorite thing about
40:44
beavers now you've stolen the castorium
40:46
thing
40:47
uh this is a disaster uh my favorite
40:49
thing is related
40:50
it's the beaver myth that was pervasive
40:53
for about over a thousand years
40:55
which is that if you're hunting a beaver
40:57
it would bite off its testicles
40:59
and throw them at you and then run away
41:03
and people just used to think this
41:04
definitely a myth
41:06
do you know what i don't have any
41:07
firsthand proof that doesn't happen
41:10
i think we assume it's a myth now this
41:12
came up in a text called
41:13
a physiologist in the second century ad
41:16
and it's based on the same thing the
41:17
castorium glands which people thought
41:19
were its testicles
41:20
because they look very similar to
41:22
testicles and people
41:24
used this delicious smelling fragrance
41:26
as
41:27
medicine and as various other things i
41:29
think women used to sniff it like snuff
41:31
and so beavers knew this is the idea
41:34
and they were like well this guy's
41:36
hunting me he only wants my testicles
41:38
so he'd bite them off and shut them at
41:39
the hunter and then
41:41
the hunter would give up and as the myth
41:43
went if the hunter continued chasing the
41:45
beaver would turn around
41:47
display his empty testicle area
41:50
and be like look there's nothing for you
41:52
here that's really interesting because
41:54
i was i read an article that said that
41:57
in the 17th century beaver's testicles
42:00
were used to cure toothache and when
42:02
minced they add a delicate flavor to
42:04
tobacco
42:06
but now i realize it's not the testicles
42:08
is it yeah it's
42:09
these anal glands it is and i think the
42:10
algonquins and other american
42:12
uh native american tribes used to have
42:14
it in tobacco because it made it taste
42:15
delicious
42:16
in fact i believe they used to be it
42:18
used to be used to flavor camel
42:19
cigarettes
42:20
and a few other types of cigarettes i
42:21
think they used to use castorium yeah
42:23
camels and winston's that was it yeah
42:26
you used to have
42:27
beaver secretion how many beavers would
42:29
you have to knock out and milk
42:30
to get this stuff it just it's amazing i
42:33
mean there must have been a lot of
42:34
there were a lot more i'm surprised they
42:36
called it camels if you're getting the
42:38
good stuff from the beavers yeah you
42:40
should've been sucking on a beaver
42:44
dan your favorite thing about beavers
42:45
that's a robert browning poem isn't it
42:46
sucking on a beaver
42:50
yeah but he did think it was a lawyer's
42:51
sleeve
42:52
[Laughter]
42:56
damn favorite thing about beavers i like
42:58
that they have a
42:59
second set of lips so they've got their
43:02
they've got their normal lips just
43:03
hanging out there in the front and then
43:05
they got their teeth
43:06
and then they got another set of
43:07
thoughts yes sitting right behind
43:09
no yeah and it's for when they've gone
43:12
underwater and they've picked up a nice
43:13
bit of wood
43:14
and they're coming back up so obviously
43:16
they've got to bite into the wood but
43:17
you bite into the wood
43:18
your lips are open you're letting the
43:19
water in second set of lips
43:22
stops the water coming into your body
43:23
it's a classic yeah how much lipstick
43:25
must they get through
43:27
nightmare because do you remember in the
43:30
b
43:30
series of q i we were looking into
43:32
beavers and we sent molly oldfield our
43:34
good friend to look into what beaver's
43:36
lips look like
43:37
and she went onto the internet and
43:39
googled it oh no
43:40
and she suddenly was a lot less innocent
43:43
than she was at the start of the day
43:47
do you think base you know base one and
43:49
base two invasive and base four do you
43:50
think
43:50
base one for beavers is snogging their
43:52
first lips and base two is snogging
43:54
their second lips
43:59
and then i think two base threes as well
44:02
base three she showed me her nun's head
44:06
gear
44:08
but hang on james what's your favorite
44:10
thing about these
44:11
he's never asked you've been asking all
44:13
of us i know um let me think
44:15
you must be so confident you have an
44:16
obscure one that you allowed three
44:18
people
44:18
i don't okay what about this my favorite
44:21
is the movie zom beavers
44:24
of course yes he's done it he's done it
44:27
which i found on imdb cool which is
44:30
about zombie beavers and what i like
44:33
about it
44:33
is they mention in the script about a
44:36
giardia lamblia parasite
44:38
um which is actually beavers actually
44:41
have it
44:42
and they used to think that it gave
44:43
people something called beaver fever
44:45
it might actually it can infect you um i
44:49
saw a review of it that says
44:50
zombieverse is not a total wash and seen
44:53
at night
44:53
under the right combination of low
44:55
expectations and controlled substances
44:57
it may even seem better than it really
45:00
is
45:01
and also when i went onto imdb it said
45:03
that people who like zombieverse will
45:05
also like
45:06
zoombies which is when a strange virus
45:10
quickly spreads to a safari park and
45:12
turns all the zoo animals
45:14
into zombies thought it was going to be
45:18
a
45:18
zombie bees yeah exactly well actually
45:21
spoiler alert at the end
45:23
credits after the end credits of zom
45:24
beavers there's a brief segment that
45:26
shows a bee
45:27
feeding on the corpse of a beaver and
45:30
the
45:30
bee flies back to his hive and the
45:32
implication is that it's become a zombie
45:35
brilliant sequel that's so exciting yeah
45:38
that's sort of ruined the film for me go
45:41
and watch it now
45:42
it's my night ruined uh one other thing
45:44
about beavers
45:45
um but for a beaver the days in winter
45:47
are longer than they are in the summer
45:49
for a beaver what what what they're
45:51
nocturnal
45:52
um is that a are they yes they are
45:56
but that's not why imagine if james was
45:58
just trying to make the idea of a
45:59
nocturnal animal just sound
46:01
really exciting suddenly how can we
46:03
rebrand this
46:05
repackage it this this is literal
46:08
okay literally the days are longer in
46:10
the um in the winter
46:12
and that is because they live
46:13
underground
46:15
in their dams in winter and without any
46:18
signals from nature
46:20
they don't know when the sun's going up
46:21
and when the sun's going down and so
46:23
their circadian rhythm changes
46:25
and they end up living on 27 hour days
46:28
in the winter when they're living inside
46:30
the dams and then when they come up in
46:32
the summer they live on normal days
46:33
because of the sun going up and down
46:35
wow isn't that amazing i cannot believe
46:37
that given that that zombies was your
46:39
favorite thing
46:42

[Music]
47:32
they got married and they had a son who
47:34
they called pen
47:37
he was actually called robert as well
47:38
but they nicknamed him pen and that's
47:40
all they called him
47:40
no he was called um bideman or
47:43
wiedermann
47:44
robert wiedemann yeah but the reason
47:45
they called him pen is because he
47:46
couldn't pronounce the word wiedermann
47:48
they also called him pen because
47:50
they did some tests and they found out
47:51
he was mightier than a sword
47:54
you're going to keep that in
47:56
[Laughter]
47:59
other words right now that's why i left
48:01

00:14
hello and welcome to another
00:16
episode of no such thing as a fish a
00:18
weekly podcast coming to you from the qi
00:20
offices in covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:24
here with anna chazinski
00:25
james harkin and andrew hunter murray
00:28
and once again we have gathered around
00:30
the microphones with our four
00:31
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order
00:35
here we go starting with you
00:38
james okay my fact this week is that
00:41
thomas edison
00:42
was once almost killed by a flying
00:44
badger
00:46
was this one of his inventions that had
00:48
gone wrong
00:49
you're absolutely right it's a badger
00:51
cannon
00:51
[Laughter]
00:53
and one of the badges got stuck in it
00:55
and he kind of prodded it to see if the
00:56
badge would get free
00:58
and then it went off in his face wow
01:00
that's not it
01:01
that's not it no no dan's thinking i've
01:04
researched the wrong thing oh my god
01:06
two badger incidents uh no he
01:09
was riding on a locomotive on a train
01:12
and he got very friendly with the people
01:14
who were engineers on this train
01:16
and they let him sit on the cow catcher
01:19
which is a little bit of metal in the
01:20
front of the train so
01:22
kind of knocks things out of the way it
01:24
looks like if you picture the front of a
01:26
knight of the realm
01:27
like like sir lancelot's helmet that
01:29
sort of bit that sticks out
01:31
the pies a bit that they look through
01:32
looks like that's a great description
01:34
yeah
01:34
uh he said the engineers gave me a small
01:37
cushion and every day i rode in this
01:39
manner
01:40
only once was i in danger when the
01:41
locomotive struck an animal about the
01:43
size of a small cub
01:44
bear which i think was a badger this
01:47
animal struck the front of the
01:48
locomotive just under the headlight with
01:50
great violence
01:52
wow so it just passed his head and hit
01:55
the train so
01:56
imagine this was when he was quite young
01:58
i think he was about 31 or 32 at the
02:00
time
02:00
so we could have never had all the
02:02
things that he invented weezy got killed
02:04
by a badger
02:05
we wouldn't have had the podcast
02:07
recording our voice that's what the
02:09
world would miss the most
02:12
everyone's walking around in the dark
02:14
because there's no light bulbs going i
02:15
wish i had a podcast
02:16
[Laughter]
02:18
so um this is just a weird thing about
02:21
edison i know we spoke about edison a
02:23
lot but i can't believe i've never heard
02:24
that i know extraordinary
02:25
that was the a year or so before he
02:28
really got on his hot streak of
02:29
inventions wasn't it that was maybe yeah
02:31
he was famous they were still they were
02:34
calling him professor edison at that
02:36
stage okay
02:37
so he had done a few bits of inventing
02:39
uh but he hadn't done the major
02:41
inventions
02:41
so like the cool people were already
02:43
into him who were going to spurn his
02:45
later work
02:47
but it does feel like a time stamp
02:49
moment doesn't it sort of
02:50
time travelers back you know will go
02:52
back to alter history by just
02:54
making the badger hit him do you know
02:56
what i mean like that's the moment where
02:57
you could kill him
02:58
wow yeah you'd have to be very skilled
03:01
to place a badger in the exact place
03:03
that when it hits a cow catcher it goes
03:05
and hits edison in the face
03:06
you're right there's probably a lot of
03:07
failed attempts where you could just
03:09
swap the badger for a cow
03:10
that would probably do it yeah i think
03:12
yeah because cows are so much larger
03:14
than badgers so they're harder to throw
03:16
up in the air
03:17
i actually i don't know what happens
03:19
when a train hits a cow catcher because
03:21
well i read some accounts of what
03:23
happened so they're very you do know
03:24
what happens sorry i don't know exactly
03:26
what happens yeah
03:27
but a so a really good cow catch like a
03:29
very effective one
03:30
could if it hit an ox which would weigh
03:33
up to 900 kilos
03:35
or 2000 pounds it could throw it 30 feet
03:37
into the air
03:38
no way yeah come on you've got a whole
03:40
trade behind it
03:41
i guess so yeah yeah but in those days
03:43
they weren't going as fast were they
03:45
is this like a modern bullet train no
03:47
this is this is a contemporary account
03:49
of like it's a good cow catcher yeah
03:51
yeah
03:51
so someone should do the maths on the
03:53
japanese bullet train and how high a cow
03:54
would go
03:55
under those like it would go into orbit
03:57
and i think it would
03:58
jump over the moon we know what happens
04:02
um they were it wasn't uncommon to ride
04:04
on them turns out
04:06
yeah look them up so i was looking them
04:07
up in the british newspaper archive and
04:09
there were just stories everywhere of
04:10
people who took
04:11
rides on the cow catchers so there was
04:14
this woman in 1893 called lady gray
04:16
edgerton and she was holidaying in
04:18
canada
04:19
and she said she asked the driver so it
04:21
wasn't a regular thing but she went to
04:22
the driver and she said can i sit in the
04:23
cow catcher for the journey
04:25
and apparently he said look all your
04:27
purposes will be answered by riding in
04:28
just the front cabin with me
04:30
and it's very dangerous so no but then
04:33
as she wrote
04:34
he was eventually obliged to allow that
04:36
the scenery could be seen much better
04:37
sitting on the front of the engine
04:39
and so he let me do it i think that he
04:42
did
04:43
edison also said that it was so that he
04:44
could see the scenery and stuff like
04:46
that yeah
04:46
actually there was one more modern one i
04:48
think um didn't jeremy corbin once sit
04:51
on the cow catcher because he couldn't
04:52
find a seat on a virgin train
05:00
that's really so that's it's like the a
05:03
19th century equivalent of going into
05:05
the cockpit on a plane isn't it it's a
05:06
special perk that not many people get
05:08
yeah no it's going on the nose of the
05:10
plane
05:12
oh yeah sorry it's like the 19th century
05:14
equivalent of going on the dlr
05:16
and getting that seat at the front oh it
05:18
looks like you're the driver
05:19
i think you've won around the american
05:21
listeners
05:23
does anyone know who invented the cow
05:24
catcher i mean you must have done
05:25
because you researched it but it's
05:27
amazing yeah it's incredible well done
05:28
it was invented by charles babbage who
05:31
invented the computer
05:33
wow oh that is surprising one of them
05:35
really has stayed with us more hasn't it
05:38
i guess so although like babbage's
05:40
computer he invented a difference engine
05:43
um which was like an early prototype of
05:45
the computer and people aren't really
05:47
sure
05:48
whether he made it i don't think he did
05:49
make it actually and
05:51
actually the cow catcher it was supposed
05:53
to be used between liverpool and
05:54
manchester but it didn't really it
05:56
didn't catch on
05:56
if they ever made it and he also
05:59
invented
06:00
really big shoes for walking on water
06:02
cool
06:03
and also speaking tubes that were
06:05
supposed to link london and liverpool
06:07
and i don't think they ever got made
06:09
either so i'm wondering about charles
06:11
babbage
06:11
yeah what did he actually do did the
06:15
shoes the water shoes presumably didn't
06:17
work or did they no they didn't really
06:19
work because he invented them when he
06:20
was 16 years old
06:22
and he tried them out and he nearly
06:24
drowned
06:25
okay presumably it does work if you just
06:28
have to have really big shoes
06:30
it's basically like you've got two boats
06:31
and you put one foot in each boat and
06:33
that's not an invention it's just
06:34
straddling two boats
06:35
the question is how small can you make
06:37
the boat yes yeah
06:39
how small is a boat before it becomes a
06:41
shoe i think that's what we're wrestling
06:42
with here
06:44
um the first train to have a cow catcher
06:46
on that we know of was called the john
06:48
bull
06:49
which is quite pleasing was it oh that's
06:51
in 1833.
06:53
i read one story from 1963 which must
06:56
have been when cow catchers were
06:57
going out of out of fashion a bit but
06:59
one story from 1963 where which reported
07:02
that 65 year old mrs g
07:03
riordan came riding into brisbane today
07:06
on the cow catcher of a train
07:08
and it turned out that she said she
07:10
wasn't quick enough to get out of the
07:11
way when crossing the track so she
07:13
grabbed on instead and hung on for dear
07:15
life
07:16
she said i thought of calling out for
07:18
help when i was on there but it seemed a
07:19
bit silly
07:20
so she just waited until i got to
07:22
brisbane
07:24
wow so some more stuff about edison some
07:26
weird stuff i had not seen before
07:28
so this trip where he was on the train
07:31
uh where he almost got killed by a
07:33
badger it was because he'd been to see a
07:35
total eclipse of the sun
07:37
uh he'd been to wyoming where this had
07:39
happened and he wanted to try out
07:41
an invention called a taser meter which
07:44
would measure small
07:45
changes in temperature now that
07:46
experiment failed
07:48
because the device was too sensitive but
07:50
while he was there
07:51
he slept out in the open and the man who
07:54
was there at the time
07:55
said that edison told him that when he
07:57
lay down in the open he wasn't thinking
07:58
about resting he lay up and looked at
08:00
the beautiful stars in clear skylight
08:03
and invented the incandescent electric
08:05
light
08:07
ah apparently that is where edison came
08:10
up with the idea
08:12
apart from historical evidence indicates
08:13
that the story is simply a myth
08:16
but who's to say because lighting has
08:19
already been invented years before i had
08:21
it
08:21
and edison came up with his idea of
08:23
using these bamboo filaments years later
08:25
so yeah and this guy kind of
08:27
it was quite a lot of years later when
08:29
he said oh i remember edison told me
08:31
this
08:31
thing but he said that he thought edison
08:33
was sleeping but he wasn't right that's
08:35
what he said okay because to me that
08:36
sounds like when you're sitting on the
08:37
couch watching a movie with your dad and
08:39
he's falling asleep and you wake him up
08:41
no i'm awake i'm awake yeah i'm just
08:42
inventing the light bulb yeah exactly
08:46
one thing edison would do um he was very
08:49
deaf
08:50
he was almost completely deaf in one ear
08:52
and he was completely deaf
08:53
in the other ear so he really couldn't
08:55
hear very much at all and when someone
08:57
was playing
08:58
uh music or the piano he to listen
09:02
would bite the wood off the piano itself
09:05
that was incredibly off-putting for the
09:06
performer i would have thought what what
09:08
are you talking about the wood of the
09:10
piano
09:10
dude it's a big thing the piano i guess
09:12
he'd pick somewhere where the player
09:13
could play and he could sit there biting
09:14
the piano and listening through his head
09:17
because the vibrations would obviously
09:18
make their way to his inner ear and his
09:20
and there are accounts of him doing this
09:21
from his daughter and his old
09:24
his personal phonograph has tooth marks
09:26
around the edge
09:27
no way he was listening to music that
09:28
way he must have been the nightmare to
09:30
go to the orchestra
09:34
you know it wasn't um this badger
09:36
incident wasn't the only time that he
09:37
sort of
09:38
had his life in danger on a train so he
09:40
was actually fired from working on a
09:42
train because he set up a chemistry lab
09:43
inside
09:44
one of the trains and it caught on fire
09:46
while an experiment was going on so the
09:48
train was on fire
09:50
um and he got fired as a result um and i
09:52
found this out weirdly on a site you
09:54
know tv tropes where it just tells you
09:56
all the great tv trips
09:57
edison has a huge entry in tv tropes for
10:00
the tropes of his life that
10:01
apply to the tropes you would use in tv
10:03
so in too dumb to live which is a
10:05
category
10:06
the badger incident is in there as a tv
10:08
trope um
10:09
he's got covert pervert he's he's listed
10:12
in that as well
10:13
um for what incident so for in an
10:16
interview
10:16
when he was talking about the
10:18
application of the phonograph when he
10:19
first invented it
10:20
um he had a list of what you could do
10:22
with it and one of the things was you
10:24
could hide it in the white house
10:25
as a listening device so you're
10:26
recording the conversation and then play
10:28
it back later
10:29
the other one was that parents could put
10:30
it in the homes of their married
10:32
children
10:32
to listen to the sounds of their spoony
10:34
courtship and spoonie courtships in
10:36
quotes
10:38
oh my goodness what a phrase yeah so
10:42
that gets him into the covert pervert
10:44
i have to say i think the website tv
10:45
tracks is slightly extending
10:47
its brief a bit here i know there's not
10:49
a trouble for being hit by a badger when
10:50
you're sitting on the front of a train
10:52
can i also can you imagine if you're
10:54
edison's kids
10:56
and you're just getting down to a bit of
10:58
spooky cockshit
10:59
and then the bed post edison
11:06
okay it's time for fact number two and
11:08
that is anna
11:10
my fact this week is that there are only
11:12
two groups of animals on earth
11:14
that live entirely on seaweed and they
11:16
are a type of iguana
11:18
and a type of sheep they're not in the
11:20
same place
11:21
uh they are not in the same way they
11:22
know each other i don't think they hang
11:24
out we don't know if they
11:25
they make calls to each other at
11:26
weekends or write letters but no
11:28
evidence of that
11:29
so this sheep is amazing it's the north
11:31
ronald sea sheep on so northwesterly
11:34
is the most northern island of orkney so
11:37
it's part of orkney
11:38
and right like to the north of scotland
11:41
and
11:41
50 people live on it and 2 000 sheep
11:45
they're very primitive sheep so they've
11:47
lived on the island for thousands and
11:48
thousands of years
11:49
and they have this amazing thing where
11:51
they subsist on exclusively seaweed
11:53
so cool it's incredible they're my
11:55
favorite sheep in the world
11:57
is it tough competition up there to be
11:59
honest i didn't have a favorite until i
12:00
researched it
12:02
but no i definitely do they're so
12:03
awesome and they've been living on the
12:05
seaweed for so long now that
12:07
um so there's a big wall that's been
12:08
built a big dike that's
12:10
maintained by a lady called shan and
12:12
she's living there and she's been
12:13
she basically has to rebuild this wall
12:15
all the time because when huge wins come
12:17
and and so on it gets knocked down so
12:19
it's a big perimeter she has to do
12:21
um and in the article i was reading
12:22
about saying that they're so used to the
12:24
seaweed now that if they break through
12:25
and get to grassland they can't eat
12:27
grass anymore
12:28
they've evolved away from yeah if they
12:30
if they ate too much of it they think it
12:31
might poison them
12:32
and it hasn't even been that long though
12:34
that they have been living after seaweed
12:35
so it was in 1832
12:37
i think that people decided to cut them
12:39
off from the land basically
12:41
so the islanders built this massive dike
12:42
as you say and it was to keep the sheep
12:44
away from the delicious grassy pasture
12:46
because they were
12:47
um farming their cows on that and so
12:49
they sort of forced the sheep to just
12:50
start living off this seaweed instead
12:52
yeah so now they love it they're still
12:54
on the outer edge of the island yeah
12:55
just living on the beach basically
12:58
basically yeah
13:00
yeah around the perimeter and so
13:01
annoying if you end up sort of on one
13:03
side and your mates on the other side
13:05
because you just can't cut across the
13:06
middle
13:07
you've got to go all the way around
13:07
right now well actually they don't have
13:09
mates on the other side
13:10
they always stick together in their
13:12
little groups oh do they yeah and you
13:14
can't move them from the north to the
13:15
south or the south turn off if you try
13:17
and do that they are having
13:18
none of it at all they just like staying
13:20
in their little group
13:21
they have like certain bits of seaweed
13:23
and they like their bit of seaweed and
13:25
they don't like any others
13:26
and apparently if you have to look after
13:28
them otherwise they swim out to a rock
13:30
where you can't get it
13:30
[Laughter]
13:32
and there are also ones that are called
13:34
loopers uh which are sheep that climb on
13:36
top of each other to try and get over
13:38
the wall
13:39
wow isn't that cool and so
13:41
self-sacrificing of the bottom machine
13:43
yes
13:44
unless the ones at the top kind of pull
13:46
them over though they don't have the
13:47
posable thumbs
13:48
yeah i'm sure they would if they could
13:50
though if they could but they know about
13:52
the tide as well these sheep they know
13:53
where the tide is and they sleep
13:55
accordingly so they don't get caught out
13:57
by it i mean as soon as the tide goes
13:59
out they rush out to get the seaweed
14:01
that's been left behind by it and that's
14:02
why they swim out
14:04
also for more seaweed i love the idea of
14:06
being of a sheep checking the tide time
14:08
table
14:09
against the walk no not until wednesday
14:11
will that be
14:12
accessible um sean um is called sean
14:15
tarrant
14:16
and i found her on twitter so i yeah i
14:19
contacted her
14:20
um in the hope that she might check her
14:21
twitter before we recorded today just to
14:23
see
14:24
if she had any more facts to give us um
14:26
and turns out she's a massive fan of the
14:28
podcast
14:31
we're her second favorite podcast oh
14:33
this is the first one about sheep
14:36
that's guilty feminist it's her favorite
14:38
really yeah but so i i just asked her
14:40
instead of getting facts i said
14:41
when you're fixing this wall to stop the
14:44
sheep do you ever listen to us and she's
14:45
like yeah always
14:46
i'm listening to you guys as i build oh
14:48
my god
14:49
sean i want to come to the island and
14:51
help you build the world he wants to
14:52
meet his favorite sheep bill
14:55
that's something else sean i'm so sorry
14:58
that dan is so obsessed with our podcast
15:00
that he meant to go
15:01
to you for facts and ended up saying oh
15:03
my god so when do you listen to us
15:04
do you listen to us before you go to
15:05
sleep do you listen to us when you're
15:07
with the wall
15:07
[Laughter]
15:09
so you've got no interesting did you get
15:11
it i did but i didn't read them because
15:13
i was just i went down that line as you
15:14
say
15:15
um how long has shannon had the job do
15:17
you know it's quite recent it's a three
15:18
year post and i think yeah
15:19
i think she's out there i think for a
15:21
few more years yeah she just started in
15:22
the last few months i think
15:24
she is awesome just because i read an
15:26
article um from before she got the job i
15:28
think when it was in real disrepair
15:30
and they were trying to fix it and they
15:32
said that the cost of repairs was going
15:33
to be about 3 million pounds
15:36
to build this because it just basically
15:38
they you know they didn't really have
15:39
anyone with the skills and it's not just
15:41
getting the labor it's also getting the
15:42
materials which aren't
15:43
nearly as prevalent as they used to be
15:46
because apparently in 1902 it cost four
15:48
pence an hour
15:49
to repair the wall wow four pence an
15:52
hour that's really good although how
15:54
many hours does it take maybe it added
15:55
up to a million after
15:57
a few years maybe sean charges an
16:00
enormous salary for doing this
16:01
that's what's happening didn't she say
16:03
something about
16:05
the sheep eating sea birds sometimes
16:09
well this was on your twitter feed we
16:11
just happened to click on twitter and i
16:13
only noticed the facts that she'd sent
16:15
us i think she said that the sheep
16:17
sometimes are fat you sometimes find
16:18
bodies of seabirds with the heads and
16:20
the feet
16:20
so anna your fact about them only eating
16:23
seaweed
16:24
oh this is snacking this is luxury yeah
16:26
yeah yeah this isn't this isn't part of
16:27
their diet
16:28
if you're on a 5-2 diet they work two
16:30
days a week they can eat a sea bird's
16:32
head
16:33
so that's what she said said they're
16:35
known to eat the feet and beaks of dead
16:37
birds on the shore
16:38
um so you see dead birds with feet and
16:40
beaks missing all the time
16:42
they get sinister they get fatter in the
16:43
winter because there's more seaweed
16:45
washed up by the storms
16:47
and they run up to the dyke and over it
16:48
if it's leaning and into the island side
16:50
away from the shore and they've been
16:51
found on airfields
16:52
as well so assume there's an airfield on
16:54
the island do you think they're trying
16:55
to catch a fly out of there
16:58
all the planes have sheep catchers on
17:00
the front so they're fine
17:02
wow so it sounds to me like the sheep
17:04
think that the birds beaks and feet of
17:06
seaweed
17:06
because why aren't they eating the main
17:07
bit of the bird well that's a good point
17:09
the main bit of a bird doesn't look like
17:10
seaweed but
17:11
the beak and feet do look a bit seaweedy
17:14
don't they yeah
17:14
ronald see is a weird place isn't it
17:17
anyways i mean it's so small obviously
17:19
it's only school shut down in 2017 after
17:22
the only people
17:23
left it would have been stupid to keep
17:26
it open after that
17:27
they've actually said it's on standby in
17:29
case any other children move to the
17:30
island right
17:32
what does that mean are there teachers
17:34
in position waiting to descend
17:36
i think so constantly poised chalk
17:39
suspended behind a black board
17:42
no they had one pupil there who i think
17:45
she was about 12 in 2017
17:47
and she'd been the only people there for
17:48
two years and her teacher would fly from
17:50
orkney's main island three times a week
17:52
to teach her personally
17:54
and then she'd fly twice a week to
17:55
orkney and then they decided to just
17:57
send her i think i think to openly
17:59
and now the only child i think is three
18:01
years old
18:02
so okay we're going to school next year
18:03
yeah yeah
18:05
get ready tinctures um some stuff on
18:08
seaweed
18:09
yeah sure yeah um so seaweed usable to
18:12
otters
18:13
it's one of my favorite things about it
18:14
because um otter
18:16
babies otter pups can't swim but they're
18:18
extremely buoyant so it's fine they
18:20
don't drown
18:21
and it means their parents can leave
18:22
them alone when they go out hunting for
18:24
them
18:24
but they need to stop them floating away
18:26
so when they go hunting they tie their
18:28
pups up in seaweed wow wrap them in a
18:30
little seaweed cradle and tie them to
18:32
them
18:32
sweet real cute um there is
18:35
a company uh which does seaweed for the
18:39
stars
18:40
okay celebrity seaweed for movies it's
18:42
called the hebridean seaweed company
18:44
and they provided all the weeds for the
18:46
pirates of the caribbean film because
18:47
they obviously needed
18:48
loads wow and when they were filming les
18:51
miserables
18:52
the recent hollywood version of it they
18:54
bought nine tons of seaweed from this
18:56
company
18:57
really yeah is it real seaweed i'll fake
19:00
yeah it's real is it
19:01
if they're in the hebrides i don't think
19:02
they're stitching it i think they're
19:04
just gathering it
19:05
yeah yeah it's just like from movies
19:07
real seaweed is gonna be
19:09
a good point they could but it could be
19:10
made of harris tweed
19:12
yeah it could be made of bird's beaks
19:16
stitched together
19:18
i'm pretty sure it's real seaweed yeah
19:20
there is in a sense no such thing as
19:21
seaweed
19:22
okay because when we say seaweed we're
19:24
just talking about
19:26
benthic macro algae which is just lives
19:28
in the sea
19:30
and is visible to the naked eye macro
19:32
algae so
19:33
and technically that's what you should
19:34
order in a japanese restaurant
19:37
but there are three big kinds of seaweed
19:40
so
19:40
then they get referred to as brown algae
19:42
red algae and there's a third one which
19:43
i didn't write down
19:44
and brown algae and red algae are not
19:47
even in the same
19:48
kingdom of life really yeah they're less
19:51
closely related than a cod
19:53
uh and a jellyfish which are very very
19:55
different life forms
19:56
okay yeah different kingdoms jesus
19:59
you've chosen two things which are not a
20:01
million miles away
20:02
no i should have said a wasp and a
20:05
mushroom mushroom brilliant
20:10
andy i mean you've just written a book
20:12
of fiction and that's how far your
20:14
imagination can stretch
20:16
you couldn't even come up with an animal
20:17
that was
20:20
in 1850 there was there was a moment
20:23
where a frenchman thought he discovered
20:24
a whole new
20:25
species of seaweed he'd never seen it
20:27
before um
20:28
uh unfortunately it wasn't seaweed it
20:31
was the new uk and france
20:33
telegraph cable had just been laid in
20:35
between and he mistook it and it's
20:37
because they didn't do the wiring
20:39
properly it wasn't properly armored so
20:41
he thought it was seaweed brought it up
20:42
cut it and then he thought he'd
20:44
discovered gold because of all the wires
20:45
inside
20:46
um but yeah it was mistook seaweed this
20:49
guy's a idiot i know
20:51
laura this french fisherman and um and
20:54
it was interesting because that first
20:55
cable
20:55
um sorry i know this is not relevant but
20:57
when i found out that this guy thought
20:58
it was seaweed
20:59
um emailed him and apparently he's a fan
21:01
of the puck
21:06
he so that cable because of the armoring
21:09
which made him think it was seaweed that
21:10
wasn't there
21:11
um it also meant that people who were
21:13
listening to each other over the table
21:14
couldn't hear each other properly it was
21:16
really distorted stuff
21:17
but when they first tested it and they
21:19
got reception from france and france
21:21
could hear england they didn't realize
21:23
that what they
21:23
laid down was bad because they thought
21:26
both sides were drunk and partying from
21:28
the success of the thing
21:29
yeah and it was only in the morning when
21:31
they did another broadcast they're like
21:33
oh no this is terrible this is unusable
21:35
they're slimy for a good reason seaweed
21:37
or it
21:38
is so otherwise they decapitated yeah
21:44
well i wasn't and i want to make that
21:46
very clear uh
21:47
so seaweed is slimy because otherwise it
21:49
would decapitate itself
21:50
uh so it's because its fronds are always
21:52
waving around in the sea and so they
21:54
sort of rub up against each other
21:56
and they would get tangled obviously in
21:57
knots and like rip each other's limbs
21:59
off rip their own limbs off they weren't
22:00
so slimy
22:01
that's cool smart that's very cool
22:06
okay it is time for fact number three
22:08
and that is my fact
22:09
my fact this week is in 2017 china
22:13
launched the world's first electric
22:15
cargo ship
22:16
the ship is now being used exclusively
22:18
to carry coal to power stations
22:21
so how ironic how ironic um yeah this is
22:25
uh this is a 230 foot long ship
22:27
and it's it's a sort of it's not out in
22:29
the oceans it's on the pearl river and
22:31
the idea is it's going in between
22:33
the coal pickup point to the power point
22:35
and
22:36
when it docks it sort of plugs itself in
22:38
and recharges its batteries
22:40
the time it takes to load and unload is
22:42
roughly the time it takes to charge up
22:43
um well it is a step in the right
22:45
direction yeah
22:47
it i mean yeah it could have done
22:48
without that bit of press of it having
22:51
powered power stations um this is sort
22:53
of what it's being used for at the
22:54
moment who knows if they might suddenly
22:56
turn it to something else but it feels
22:57
like it's just going to remain doing it
22:59
if it's battery ports at both
23:00
places there but yeah but it is a big
23:02
step forward if that technology becomes
23:04
available to
23:05
to new ships because yeah the ships are
23:07
extremely dirty yeah
23:08
cargo ships especially apparently um
23:11
ships burn the dirtiest oil that you can
23:13
get it's called bunker oil and you
23:14
scrape it from the bottom of the
23:16
refinery and it's all gunky and stuff
23:18
like that
23:19
and it's so thick that if you were to go
23:21
into the engine room of a ship
23:23
and go to where the fuel is you could
23:24
walk on it oh
23:26
cool but don't you do that you wouldn't
23:29
even need
23:29
um magical shoes not invented by charles
23:34
babbage
23:36
but you can travel by cargo ship and
23:39
that is environmentally friendly
23:41
because obviously they don't usually
23:42
take passengers so it saves you getting
23:44
a flight
23:44
and people do this i got really obsessed
23:46
with these guys last year and wondered
23:48
if i'd want to do it but
23:49
there was one man who i read about
23:51
called torbjorn pedersen
23:53
and he basically is blacking his way
23:54
around the world on container ships
23:56
which sounds just awful um and he says
24:00
everyone should do this you got to get
24:01
on board
24:01
so it's months and months at sea and he
24:03
says you just you call up
24:04
not the captain because apparently they
24:06
get offended and they don't like it you
24:08
call up the shipping company
24:09
and you try to blag your way on and you
24:11
promise that you can be on your own for
24:14
long stretches of time at once
24:16
i'm really happy just sitting on the
24:17
very front of the ship
24:19
like i'm on titanic or something just
24:22
pushing cows out of the way you have to
24:25
say
24:26
you you'll be like invisible you'll
24:27
never get in the way of the crew
24:30
you sleep in basically this tiny sort of
24:32
well he says it's all right he's like
24:33
it's got a bed
24:34
he's got a shower and apparently it has
24:37
unlimited hot water because they run the
24:38
water through the engine so it gets free
24:40
heating
24:41
unfortunately it's also full of oil
24:46
the worst thing about that is 33 of crew
24:49
on the world's
24:49
um cargo ships don't have any means of
24:52
communication so no wi-fi
24:54
no 3g wow nothing like that you're just
24:57
away from
24:57
you can't can't go on twitter yeah bring
25:00
a book oh bring a book if you're
25:01
traveling to australia by cargo ship
25:03
take a long book really lonely places
25:06
aren't they yeah because the crews are
25:07
so much smaller than they used to be
25:09
because
25:09
uh automation means you could do so much
25:11
more with many fewer people yes yeah
25:14
only two percent of seafarers on cargo
25:16
ships are women
25:17
is that so yeah okay yeah he did like
25:20
one of the disadvantages as being you
25:22
won't see a woman for three months
25:24
get used to male company yeah it's
25:27
because he was saying actually the crew
25:28
was something like 20
25:29
people and actually these ships are
25:31
massive so the biggest ones are
25:33
longer than the empire state building is
25:35
tall and yet
25:36
yeah so few people on them um do you
25:38
know how ships are launched
25:40
with a champagne bottle very true but
25:43
there's another so in which dimension
25:47
are they launched
25:48
oh which direction are they towards the
25:50
sea towards the sea absolutely correct
25:51
yes
25:54
yeah you've done really really great but
25:55
um is it not i thought they put a load
25:57
of
25:58
um like butter on there i genuinely
26:01
thought this yeah you put a load of
26:02
butter on the um
26:04
slitway that's why it's called slipway
26:06
because it's slippy and then you
26:08
smash the champagne and then you give it
26:10
a little bit of a nudge and then the
26:11
butter lets it go into the water
26:12
but you use do you i thought you shove
26:14
it sideways
26:16
lots of ships are launched sideways
26:18
that's what you're getting at
26:19
it's insane yeah it's there are videos
26:22
on youtube of ships being launched
26:24
sideways and they are great
26:26
i spent a lot of time watching them and
26:27
another me too i watched
26:29
last night it's really intoxicating when
26:31
you start you can't stop
26:32
why why are they launched sideways it's
26:34
crazy sometimes there's no room to
26:36
launch lengthways given the body of
26:37
water you're launching into so you might
26:38
be launching into
26:39
a sort of a river or a you know sort of
26:43
a shipping lane on its way to the sea
26:46
and they tilt over really far and if i
26:48
can give another shout out to the
26:50
youtube video
26:50
compilation of accidents with boats on
26:52
lifts and cranes
26:54
this is a minute and a half of sheer
26:56
mayhem is
26:57
failing to be launched and sometimes the
26:59
crane goes in the water
27:01
and sometimes they let go too early and
27:03
it's so funny
27:04
it's extraordinary i found one ship that
27:06
did sink onto there was only one in
27:08
1907. and it was a really nice sounding
27:10
ship as well it was a luxury
27:11
italian liner it was 149 meters long
27:15
and they launched it into the water and
27:16
it started tilting and then when it
27:18
started tilting obviously everything
27:20
inside
27:20
fell over towards the edge that was
27:23
tilting so that made it feel further
27:25
well that's one problem they can get
27:26
taken they can get sunk by avalanches
27:28
can't they
27:29
um ships container ships and it's
27:31
avalanches inside the ship
27:33
no so if you have um something in your
27:36
ship which might be gravel
27:38
or in fact this would work with
27:39
literally anything as long as there was
27:41
enough of it
27:42
and there was enough space like it
27:44
starts acting like a landslide
27:46
and then once a little bit starts going
27:48
it all goes more and more and more and
27:49
it's like a vicious circle
27:51
and there's an avalanche inside the ship
27:53
and it just goes over and so
27:54
presumably then you have to scream to
27:55
the crew like everyone get on the other
27:57
side of the ship quickly
27:59
jump up and down who's that fat guy get
28:01
over here i'm gonna say
28:03
that the 24 people on bard are not gonna
28:06
outweigh why didn't we take that
28:08
hitchhiker
28:13
[Applause]
28:14
okay it's time for our final fact of the
28:16
show and that is
28:17
andy my fact is that the first ever
28:19
instrument made for food quality control
28:22
was built to test the consistency of
28:24
jelly
28:26
great and this is from an article on the
28:29
science museum's website and they
28:30
have an article all about the history of
28:32
food and food testing
28:34
and this was made by a german chemist in
28:37
i think 1861
28:38
and it's a thing called the jelly
28:40
puncture test and what
28:41
what you do is you just put your jelly
28:43
on a little platform and then
28:46
there's a kind of weight above it like a
28:48
sort of hard-earned weight looks a bit
28:49
like a pendulum actually and it's on a
28:50
stick
28:51
and it slowly just pushes down on the
28:53
jelly with increasing pressure
28:54
and then you can see how much pressure
28:56
it takes to puncture the jelly
28:58
and that's how you test it yeah you pour
29:00
lead shot into the top of it don't you
29:02
until it punctures and then you take the
29:04
lead shot out and you weigh that and
29:05
that tells you what you're scared
29:06
oh yes that's the original one isn't it
29:09
sorry yes the one i'm describing
29:10
did they always remember to remove the
29:11
lead shot or is it like eating game or
29:13
partridge or something
29:15
careful of shot in your jelly you know
29:17
it's a posh children's birthday party
29:19
don't you when you're getting little
29:20
bits of lead shot in your jelly ice
29:22
cream
29:23
yeah it was invented by a guy called
29:24
alexander lipovich who is a german
29:26
chemist
29:28
and he's really cool actually he also
29:30
was the first person to find out that
29:32
lithium dissolved uric acid
29:34
so that you could use it for gout he
29:36
also wrote about
29:37
self-ignition of pete wool and linen
29:40
rags
29:41
he wrote a brief description of the
29:42
poznan guano factory
29:45
he wrote a draft for the establishment
29:46
of the fire insurance bank for
29:48
pharmacists of northern germany
29:50
and he invented a new type of pinch
29:54
which we all use today yeah we all use
29:56
today what the hell is a pinch cooker
29:57
please
29:58
it's a clamp used on a flexible tube to
30:00
control the flow of fluid through it
30:03
but he was like yeah i'm telling him i'm
30:05
sad he's no longer with us because i
30:06
would have loved to invited him to a
30:08
party
30:09
come on imagine sitting next to him at a
30:10
party when he tells you about the poznan
30:12
guano factory
30:14
it's like a babbage
30:18
the consistency of jelly testing is it
30:20
like if it was too soft then you weren't
30:22
allowed to sell it what were they
30:23
checking for oh yeah do they need it to
30:25
be really hard or at least
30:27
actually no just right i think it was i
30:30
i think that must be what it was but
30:32
people afterwards
30:33
kept inventing puncture tests for
30:35
different kinds of foods
30:36
and they kept they didn't notice that
30:38
there was already a decent
30:39
puncture testing machine which had been
30:41
invented for jelly so
30:42
over the next five decades they invented
30:44
different puncture tests for butter
30:46
for solid fats one for egg shells and
30:49
they just kept inventing new machines
30:50
until someone said you're all inventing
30:52
the same machine
30:53
exactly the same machine it's literally
30:55
the same machine you've got to talk to
30:56
each other people
30:57
come home yeah there is one thing you
30:59
need to know
31:00
if you are testing jelly and that is the
31:02
american
31:03
gelometers as we call them these days uh
31:06
have square plunges at the bottom
31:08
whereas european ones have rounded bits
31:10
at the bottom
31:10
and so that means that if you're testing
31:12
an american jelly in a european jelly
31:14
you might get slightly different
31:15
readings
31:16
just a little tip
31:21
the first fact i ever found for qi was
31:24
about jelly was it
31:25
yeah what was that and so i went back to
31:27
my old post it was that thing in the j
31:29
series about how if you attach an eeg
31:32
machine
31:33
to jelly then it gives the same readings
31:35
as a human brain
31:37
oh do you remember that in his wobbling
31:39
yeah
31:40
and that was was it something like if a
31:42
jelly was attached to it
31:44
in theory you wouldn't turn off the life
31:46
support machine it was exactly that
31:48
so it gives it's called alpha rhythm i
31:50
think which is when humans are awake but
31:52
with their eyes closed it's the rhythm
31:54
that your brain waves give off
31:55
and yeah it was an experiment to show
31:56
look guys we're sort of keeping a lot of
31:58
people apparently alive who are just
31:59
definitely dead
32:00
wow or that um actually all jellies are
32:04
sentient
32:04
or yep that was another interpretation
32:06
which was a more niche interpretation
32:08
but some people certainly
32:10
thought it do you guys know about the
32:11
jelly houses of covent garden
32:14
no are they um excellent do they exist
32:17
now no they don't exist now
32:18
it doesn't sound like a durable material
32:19
[Laughter]
32:22
so this was in the late 18th century and
32:24
what it was is um
32:25
this was to do with sex work so a
32:27
high-end sex worker would sit
32:29
in a cafe in covent garden and they
32:31
would have next to them some jelly
32:33
and if you saw them with jelly that
32:34
would say it's basically like a red
32:36
light district kind of thing
32:37
it's saying that that's what i do for a
32:39
living i'm a sex worker is that why the
32:40
phrase i don't think you're ready for my
32:42
jelly comes from
32:47
yeah it's uh yeah that is that's bizarre
32:50
yeah so it was
32:51
just some people were just enjoying
32:52
jelly well it led to yeah a lot of
32:55
awkwardness but
32:56
um what was it was it like meant to be a
32:58
post-coital snack perhaps
33:00
i don't know if the jelly ever was
33:02
consumed as part of the
33:04
transaction um but it was the signal to
33:07
say that this is what i do for a living
33:08
sure i just wondered why particularly
33:10
you choose jelly but if you did have to
33:11
consume it before every time then you
33:13
have to buy a hell of a lot of jelly if
33:14
you're a successful prostitute
33:16
so it's probably not it makes no less
33:19
sense than
33:19
a red light you know red light district
33:22
well
33:22
yeah red light is traditionally
33:24
associated with stop no
33:26
no action no movement yeah i know what
33:28
you mean whereas jelly
33:30
is quite sexy food i think it is kind of
33:32
isn't it because of the movement and the
33:33
wobbling yes
33:34
until the until the children's party
33:36
business got in on it and we're just
33:37
going to very quickly stop becoming sexy
33:40
well there was a book i was reading an
33:42
article called the jello syndrome
33:45
investigating popular culture in jelly
33:47
by sarah e newton
33:49
and she wrote that there was a book
33:51
called recipes to make your honeymoon
33:53
last
33:54
um which was actually in 1987 so not
33:56
that long ago
33:57
and 33 of the salad recipes contain
34:01
jelly what salad wow
34:04
so i i was reading this and it seems to
34:07
me like in america they have
34:08
jelly in their salad okay and not a
34:10
fruit salad no
34:12
how disgusting i know recipes to make
34:14
your honeymoon last
34:15
yeah 1987 1987 year of my birth
34:18
oh let's draw no conclusions oh there
34:22
was a bit of a sexy spoon what was that
34:23
called
34:24
um spooney casserole spoon and see
34:28
spoonie business spoonie courtships
34:34
yeah some other food quality control
34:36
okay yeah
34:37
okay so um in this article that you sent
34:40
around andy from the science museum they
34:42
had something about horlicks
34:44
um who have a dipping refractometer that
34:47
they use for their horlicks
34:48
now horlicks would make sense to have
34:50
next to a prostitute to advertise
34:52
what she did yes very good because it's
34:55
sl
34:55
she makes you small and she licks sorry
34:58
i thought you made it you're sleepy and
34:59
it's time to go to bed
35:04
i've been ripped off at so many jelly
35:06
houses
35:08
oh god sorry horlicks so they test their
35:12
drink
35:13
by dipping a telescope into it
35:17
it's called the dipping refractometer
35:19
it's a tiny telescope
35:20
okay it's not like jodrell bank
35:24
you dip a tiny one and it goes into each
35:26
hole in the hallways because it's quite
35:28
bubbly
35:28
and it sees how much the light is
35:30
refracted and that tells you whether
35:32
you've got good horlicks or not
35:33
cool is there a perfect refraction level
35:35
sort of 38 degrees or something i
35:37
imagine there is but i don't know what
35:38
it is this is incredible
35:40
yeah and it's to test the concentration
35:42
of ingredients in the sample
35:44
right if you've made it right just a
35:46
quick thing on jelly beans i was reading
35:48
up on jelly i went to jelly beans
35:50
and um jelly belly who make all the the
35:53
biggest brand of jelly beans
35:55
um so to get their flavors they have to
35:57
invent
35:58
interesting ways to sort of get this new
36:00
flavor that they're advertising and
36:01
there's a
36:02
there's a line that they have which is
36:03
called bertie bott's every flavor beans
36:05
which is kind of like a harry potter one
36:06
where it's meant to taste of horrible
36:08
stuff
36:09
so the way that they actually do that is
36:10
to make the taste of the beans so let's
36:12
say it's stinky socks
36:14
they actually had a scientist have socks
36:17
worn for weeks then put them into a
36:18
plastic bag he aged them to be even
36:20
smellier and then he popped them
36:22
into a gas chromatograph which is
36:24
basically something that just
36:26
breaks down the molecules to understand
36:27
the smells takes the flavor makeup from
36:30
this specific scientist's socks
36:31
and that is now the smelly socks it's
36:34
jelly bean
36:34
yeah that's the actual socks of a guy um
36:38
that's incredible yeah yeah and they do
36:40
it for a bunch of ones there was they
36:41
tried to do a pizza flavor one but it
36:43
ended up tasting like vomit so they put
36:44
it aside
36:45
and then they needed a vomit jelly bean
36:47
so they just found the pizza one they
36:49
went remember that pizza one
36:50
and that's now the do you know what they
36:52
could have used they could have used a
36:53
parmesan
36:54
flavored bean because parmesan smells
36:56
like vomit
36:57
and if you tell people that they're
36:59
smelling vomit they're disgusted and
37:01
then if you tell them oh don't worry
37:02
it's only parmesan the disgust bit of
37:04
their brain switches off
37:05
really oh yeah i love palms then because
37:07
i was having this conversation yesterday
37:08
with someone actually
37:09
where what let's say it's a hypothetical
37:11
situation where someone
37:13
farts then the other person says this is
37:17
completely hypothetical right
37:19
this is a situation we were imagining
37:21
yeah someone's fasted and then the other
37:23
person says
37:24
that smells exactly like eggs and then
37:26
the first person says well if it was
37:28
actually eggs you wouldn't find it
37:29
disgusting so why are you so disgusted
37:31
and debating whether or not if you fart
37:34
and then you tell someone oh don't worry
37:36
i'm just boiling an egg
37:37
yeah then they're not going to be
37:39
they're not going to find it unpleasant
37:40
are they and that implies that they
37:41
wouldn't
37:42
yeah but you can't always boil an egg
37:44
say if you're
37:45
at the cinema in the lift
37:49
no i think if you always keep a camping
37:51
stove with you all the time
37:53

hello and welcome to another episode of
01:32
no such thing as a fish
01:33
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:35
qi offices in covent garden
01:38
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
01:40
here with james harkin
01:42
anna chazinski and chief gnome john
01:44
lloyd
01:45
and once again we have gathered round
01:46
the microphones with our four
01:48
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:50
and in no particular order
01:52
here we go starting with you john
01:56
right well my fact is that when the
01:59
greek government put a tax on swimming
02:01
pools in 2008
02:03
only 324 athenians admitted to having
02:06
one
02:07
a search by google earth however
02:09
revealed the actual number
02:11
sixteen thousand nine hundred and
02:13
seventy four
02:15
it's incredible it's bare-faced isn't it
02:18
according to the imf
02:20
more than half of all greek households
02:22
pay no income tax at all
02:24
wow uh and greece has got the largest
02:26
black market in the whole eurozone
02:28
accounting for 21.5 percent of its gdp
02:32
um there's a reason for this i believe i
02:34
was when i was in greece uh
02:36
last year somebody explained why this is
02:38
why the greeks are so
02:39
poor at paying their taxes because for a
02:42
thousand years they were part of the
02:43
ottoman empire which they absolutely
02:45
hated and it was considered a patriotic
02:47
national duty
02:48
not to pay your taxes and they just
02:50
haven't caught up with the history that
02:51
the ottoman empire fell apart a hundred
02:53
years ago
02:54
i think there are some traditions that
02:56
you really want to bring back
02:57
immediately and maybe pay and tax is not
02:59
one of them
02:59
maybe that's a bit lower down on the
03:01
list you're right i love these pools
03:03
because
03:03
it feels as if they were prepared for
03:05
this google earth search
03:06
because they all hide them with
03:08
camouflage how do you hide a pool
03:10
okay so they have um floating tiles
03:13
that they put on the top of their pool
03:14
very clever yep they have army nets so
03:16
they camouflage it all together
03:18
and um some even paint the interior of
03:21
their pools to mimic grass
03:25
it's extraordinary so the first google
03:26
earth search said no swimming pools but
03:27
an extraordinary number of army nets in
03:29
people's garden for no apparent reason
03:32
the greeks have a really good history of
03:33
paying taxes because in ancient greek
03:35
they had a really good system
03:37
of paying tax and that is that the
03:39
assembly in athens would pick the
03:41
richest people
03:42
to pay tax uh the top 300 in some cases
03:46
and they would just say you have to pay
03:48
for this parade and this battleship
03:50
and this whatever really and they all
03:52
agreed they
03:53
even competed to spend as much money as
03:55
possible because it was a real kind of
03:58
thing where you get respect from people
03:59
and gratitude and
04:01
if you were one of the people who paid
04:02
tax it really
04:04
increased your standing in the community
04:06
and people really liked you for it so
04:07
everyone wanted to pay tax
04:09
okay everyone wants to be in that 300. i
04:11
wonder if you got your name stamped on
04:13
the event as well
04:14
like the livius parade you did yeah the
04:17
more you paid the more likely you were
04:18
to get your name on something
04:19
so this is kind of like those
04:20
philanthropists who i don't know if you
04:22
mentioned
04:22
after notre dame burned down the
04:24
philanthropists who really wanted to
04:26
donate millions
04:26
and then it turned out they kind of only
04:28
wanted to do it if the bell was renamed
04:30
you know the x-person will remain
04:33
nameless
04:35
yeah ikea wing of notre dame
04:40
they're not the worst taxpayers in the
04:42
world the greeks though
04:43
the chinese only two percent of chinese
04:45
pay any income tax and in pakistan it's
04:47
one percent i mean you wonder how these
04:49
countries
04:50
operate especially china which operates
04:52
entirely
04:53
as government yeah i suppose it's just
04:56
hard to get into those hard-to-reach
04:57
spots isn't it
04:58
we've all had that itch on our back
05:02
i was um i was kind of nervous
05:03
researching this topic because my google
05:06
searches were like
05:07
amazing tax dodges and coming up to the
05:09
end of the tax year
05:11
but um i i find tax dodgers quite fun
05:13
the way that people go
05:14
again researching them right researching
05:16
them
05:17
[Laughter]
05:21
it's my accountant there jimmy um yeah
05:24
no
05:24
um early england taxes like the 1700s
05:27
there was so many great ways that people
05:28
tried to get around all the taxes that
05:30
were being thrown at them
05:31
so um there was tax on bricks for
05:33
example in houses
05:34
so one of the dodgers that they used to
05:36
do was people just used to
05:38
use bigger bricks so you use less yeah
05:41
i do you could just use four bricks one
05:42
for each one
05:45
and then they caught on to that so uh
05:47
they eventually taxed big bricks as well
05:50
did it by that's actually a bit like
05:52
with cheese you know the origin of big
05:54
cheese wheels is based on the fact that
05:56
cheese used to be taxed by number of
05:57
cheeses in switzerland rather than by
05:59
weight
06:00
and so people would just make bigger and
06:02
bigger giant cheeses and that's why we
06:03
have them
06:04
and now the average elemental is three
06:06
feet diameter
06:07
and weighs 220 pounds and uses one and a
06:09
half tons of milk
06:11
because it just gets the same amount of
06:12
tax as a mini one that's a mini baby
06:14
bell and baby bell
06:15
yeah i was just looking at the the quite
06:18
famous case the jaffa cake case
06:20
on tax so you know there's always this
06:22
debate over the biscuits cake the cakes
06:24
or biscuits
06:24
debate and that originates in 1991 i
06:27
think it was
06:28
and it's because cakes are traditionally
06:30
in a lot of countries actually are not
06:32
subject to vat to sales tax whereas
06:34
biscuits with chocolate on our because
06:35
cakes were seen as a necessity because
06:37
it used to be you know your working
06:38
household would bake a cake
06:40
but yeah in 1991 mcfitties insisted
06:42
jaffa cake was a cake
06:43
and they so they agreed it had biscuit
06:45
tendencies but then had to argue overall
06:47
that it had more cake elements
06:49
and as part of the like in court as part
06:51
of the evidence for the fact that it was
06:52
a cake
06:53
mcvitti's baked a one-foot diameter
06:56
jaffa cake
06:57
to show this is actually a cake and the
06:59
courts can could
07:00
and it's been a cake ever since oh cool
07:02
yeah do you know the difference in cakes
07:04
and biscuits how you tell
07:05
how do you tell because when they go
07:07
stale biscuits go soft and cakes go hard
07:10
yeah but they didn't have the time to
07:13
sit in the court for sort of three weeks
07:15
watching the jaffa cake go stale this is
07:18
also actually the case with gingerbread
07:20
men
07:20
so a gingerbread man counts as a cake
07:22
and counts as a biscuit that's exempt
07:24
from tax because it's got no chocolate
07:26
on it
07:26
until it has a certain amount of
07:28
chocolate so if you've got a gingerbread
07:30
man just with eyes
07:31
but naked no tax on it but then it'll
07:34
cost
07:35
20 percent more if it's got one button
07:39
one button on its shirt who in their
07:41
right mind is adding that one button
07:43
i don't know these people are missing
07:44
and tricks it's on the the um
07:46
the people who are best at paying taxes
07:48
are americans strangely enough oh yeah
07:50
that's slightly surprising 81 to 84 of
07:53
americans don't cheat on their taxes
07:54
compared to 68 percent of germans and 62
07:57
percent of italians are these
07:58
self-reported figures
07:59
[Laughter]
08:01
but you know it is really shocking
08:03
actually how much
08:04
tax avoidance goes on you know not just
08:06
apple and
08:08
amazon you know amazon has not paid any
08:10
federal taxes in america even though it
08:12
makes profits of
08:13
you know billions and there's 8.7
08:17
trillion dollars worth of world's wealth
08:19
hidden away in tax havens by the rich
08:21
well there's a lot of money isn't it
08:23
it's something like the fifth biggest
08:24
country in the world if it was a country
08:27
isn't it
08:27
um something like that i think in terms
08:30
of
08:31
yeah income the tax haven country
08:34
whatever we're calling that where is
08:35
that sounds
08:36
sounds great do we know where it is it's
08:38
very wealthy it's wherever you want it
08:40
to be
08:40
the uk is is king of tax havens i mean
08:43
we've got more than anyone else in the
08:44
world yeah exactly we talk about greece
08:46
and whoever but
08:47
yeah you know british the cayman islands
08:49
belongs to britain the virgin islands
08:51
belongs to britain
08:52
bermuda bermuda yeah isle of man yeah
08:55
journal islands
08:59
didn't realize you were tax exempt there
09:01
were a bit like those villages in china
09:03
it's very difficult for the tax man to
09:04
get down to baltimore tough
09:06
to scratch bolton so one of those um
09:08
honest americans is warren buffett who's
09:10
been paying income tax since he was 14.
09:13
wow he had a paper round um and in 1944
09:16
he paid
09:17
tax of seven dollars on an income of 592
09:21
dollars which would be equivalent to
09:22
about 8 000 pounds today it's a pretty
09:24
enterprising
09:25
14 year old that's a lot of newspapers
09:27
isn't it yeah another guy who paid seven
09:29
pound
09:30
tax was the uh longest-serving prime
09:33
minister of pakistan he's a guy called
09:34
noah's um
09:36
sharif yeah who was in office for nine
09:38
years on three separate occasions
09:40
at one point had a personal fortune of
09:42
two billion pounds
09:43
but over a period of several years paid
09:45
only just seven pounds in taxes
09:47
why would he bother to pay any it's like
09:50
yeah this is it
09:51
i'm i'm fessing up here this is your
09:53
full seven quid bag
09:56
should we say some stuff on um swimming
09:58
pools yeah sure let's do that
10:00
um so do you know
10:03
name something that you're not allowed
10:04
to do with a swimming pool uh
10:07
year and year come on
10:10
are there any signs on the walls to say
10:12
you can't do that no that's true
10:14
which is why i always challenge them
10:28
why do they call it heavy petting in the
10:31
swimming pools
10:32
yeah because surely it's just snogging
10:34
or kissing or whatever right
10:36
well the reason is in the 1920s in
10:38
america they had some things called
10:40
petting parties and high school students
10:43
would go to swimming pools
10:44
and they would kind of kiss and cuddle
10:46
and whatever they would never have sex
10:47
in there but they would be getting very
10:49
you know close and people disapproved
10:52
and so they would have signs saying no
10:53
petting
10:54
on the swimming pools and that's kind of
10:56
kept over for
10:57
you know almost 100 years now and you
10:59
still get heavy petting
11:00
really science even though you don't
11:02
have these parties anymore but you might
11:03
have them if they took the signs away
11:05
i'm not saying yeah so is that what a
11:07
petting zoo is
11:10
it is i had a traumatic childhood
11:11
actually repeatedly taken to those
11:13
places
11:15
to a heavy petting zoo yeah they were
11:18
also these petting parties they were
11:19
also known as necking parties
11:21
mushing parties fussing parties and
11:24
snuggle popping parties
11:26
smuggled so i
11:31
which they won't be because everyone
11:32
will feel too sick to pet anyone
11:34
at the phrase snuggle puffing but
11:35
because there are no signs actually
11:37
saying
11:38
no urinating public swing pools contain
11:41
up to 20 gallons of urine
11:43
enough to fill a dusting and the
11:46
proportion in hotel jacuzzi is up to
11:48
three times worse
11:49
whoa why are people doing it more in a
11:51
jacuzzi because the bubbles make you
11:53
want to go don't they
11:54
do you think well i think someone knows
11:58
um that study where they found out there
12:00
was did you say 20 gallons
12:02
yes of urine um it was really clever how
12:04
they did it because it's quite difficult
12:06
to work out how much urine there is
12:08
in a swimming pool because often the
12:09
chlorine would change it into other
12:11
compounds or whatever
12:12
but they found the compound in urine
12:13
that doesn't react with any other
12:15
chemicals
12:16
and that is called ac sulfame potassium
12:19
and it's a sweetener that you get in
12:20
lots of like diet drinks
12:23
and if you put if you urinate that into
12:25
a swimming pool nothing can get rid of
12:26
it so it'll stay there
12:27
so they could take an amount of water
12:29
and see how much of that was in
12:31
and then work out there were 20 gallons
12:32
of urine from that hang on
12:34
are we all urinating this sweetener i
12:36
think they took an average of how much
12:38
people would it's in a lot of foods it's
12:40
not just in soft drinks
12:43
and that 20 gallons as well as being a
12:45
dustbin
12:46
it's approximately 120 wine bottles
12:48
worth of
12:50
urine in each in each swimming pool and
12:52
they sell it in aldi don't they
12:56
that's a terrible slam aldi has a really
12:57
good wine selection
12:59
i'm sorry they win all the awards did
13:01
you know this thing that um another
13:02
thing they could use
13:03
and i think they do in some places um
13:06
silver has got the curious property of
13:07
sterilizing water so they could use
13:10
silver instead of chlorine that's they
13:12
would
13:12
be more expensive there wouldn't be only
13:14
tiny amounts you need only
13:15
10 parts per billion wow and it's
13:18
completely safe
13:20
that's great so in the olympics whoever
13:22
comes second could jump in the pool
13:23
after the race
13:24
and then clean the pool for the next
13:26
race
13:28
that's really good you know when you
13:30
smell that really strong smell of
13:32
chlorine in a pool
13:33
yeah i like it actually and you think
13:34
okay and you some you get high off it
13:36
maybe
13:36
or you think there's too much chlorine
13:38
in this pool do you know what the
13:39
problem actually is
13:41
my nose is too sensitive
13:44
no it's that there's not enough chlorine
13:46
so this is i actually learned this from
13:47
dr carl wrote this in one of his books
13:49
but
13:49
if it smells too strongly of chlorine it
13:52
means they haven't put enough
13:53
in because the smell that you're
13:54
smelling is actually when the chlorine
13:56
reacts with
13:57
the nitrogen from things like urine and
13:59
sweat and dead insects and bacteria and
14:01
stuff it combines with it and it makes
14:03
these chemicals called chloramines
14:05
and the smell comes from this particular
14:07
chemical called trichloramine
14:08
so it's very volatile so you start
14:10
smelling it if you add more chlorine
14:12
then it keeps reacting and it moves on
14:13
through the chemical process and the
14:14
trichloramine goes away
14:16
that's incredible is that amazing this
14:17
smell that i really like is actually
14:19
dead insects and urine
14:20
that's correct yes that seems true to
14:23
form knowing you
14:24
[Laughter]
14:26
did you know that clint eastwood used to
14:28
dig swimming pools for a living
14:30
or was he a very enthusiastic grave
14:32
digger
14:34
he was quite successful quite young and
14:35
he was sacked by universal studios
14:37
because his adam's apple was too big
14:39
what what are you talking about
14:42
we're testing us now aren't you that
14:44
that can't be true
14:45
it well it is true um it was on imdb and
14:48
on www.clint eastwood.net
14:51
oh there you go where i also found that
14:53
his name is an anagram of old west
14:56
action
14:56
that's quite good that's really good
14:59
wow i actually i'm not thinking of clint
15:01
eastwood and he has a big adam's apple
15:04
you can picture it from digging holes
15:07
no he wasn't sacked from the grave
15:08
digging from the movies
15:12
and then he had to get another job
15:14
you're going to scare the mourners
15:16
it was swimming pools it wasn't great
15:18
when did the adam's apple thing come in
15:21
sorry i've lost in the 50s he was he was
15:23
fired by universal
15:24
in that was at the start of his career
15:26
or the yeah he'd been in a couple of um
15:27
sort of b
15:28
movies uh and then the adam's apple they
15:31
suddenly noticed
15:32
hey that guy there oh my god
15:35
it was horrible it was when they started
15:37
having 3d movies didn't it and people
15:39
thought it was
15:44
[Music]
15:48
okay it's time for fact number two and
15:50
that is josinski
15:52
my fact this week is that some
15:53
pterosaurs had heads that were more than
15:55
four times the length of their bodies no
15:59
how big was that adams
16:03
they were such stupid looking creatures
16:05
so um
16:06
the pterosaurs uh were pterodactyl as
16:09
often
16:10
as often used as kind of a word for the
16:11
pterosaur pterodactyl actually not a
16:13
thing the pterodactylus
16:14
was a type of pterosaur um but yeah they
16:18
were the first
16:19
flying species and they started off
16:21
about 250 million years ago with heads
16:23
nearly as long as their bodies
16:24
and they just extended and extended
16:26
until you got some pterosaurs like the
16:28
quetzalcoatlus
16:30
uh where the heads and the necks were at
16:32
least triple the length of the torso so
16:34
it took up over 75
16:36
of their bodies it feels like if you're
16:38
a flying animal
16:39
having a massive head that's three times
16:41
bigger than everything else is probably
16:42
going to be a problem you just tip plumb
16:44
out the sky all the time
16:45
there's been this real mystery about how
16:47
they they figured it out re center of
16:49
gravity and
16:50
generally their massive size and one of
16:52
the ways that they did it was by having
16:53
a very light head
16:54
so they had these openings in front of
16:56
their eyes and their skulls called the
16:57
ant
16:58
orbital fenestra which just the window
17:00
in front of their eyes
17:01
and we don't really know what was in it
17:02
maybe a gland or muscle it might have
17:04
just been a big air cavity
17:06
and this sometimes this huge hole in
17:08
their skull was so big that it could in
17:10
some of them it could fit their entire
17:12
torso through it
17:13
because they didn't put their torso
17:14
through it if they stopped too fast
17:16
would it shoot out through it yeah
17:18
they literally turn inside out like a
17:21
jumper you have to put back the right
17:22
way around i think that is amazing
17:24
and also one reason that we know they
17:26
had very light heads is because the
17:28
bones were very light right
17:29
yes so the bones were quite thick in
17:31
places
17:32
but there was a big gap of air in the
17:34
middle and then the actual edges of the
17:36
bone were like one millimeter thick
17:38
and that means it's really hard for us
17:40
to find pterosaur fossils
17:42
because they just kind of wash away
17:45
there's hardly any of them
17:47
in existence yeah i read one article i
17:49
don't know if this is
17:50
true of all pterosaurs but one person
17:54
said you could put all the fossil
17:55
material of pterosaurs that we've ever
17:57
found in one handbag
17:58
no if you were to crush it all up and
18:01
that's because it's so
18:02
thin and so weak yeah that's amazing
18:04
there's not that many of them
18:06
as well it could be that they were
18:07
talking about specific species i
18:09
couldn't quite tell from the
18:10
you could believe that though if you
18:11
powder it all put it in a blender i've
18:13
seen some big handbags
18:15
that's why they check your handbags at
18:16
the natural history museum when you're
18:18
that's why in case there's a pterosaur
18:20
in it excuse me sir is this all of the
18:22
fossils we've ever found in history in
18:24
your handbag
18:25
busted uh pterosaurs not dinosaurs
18:29
no i'm sure everyone around this table
18:30
knew that but i didn't so it's worth
18:32
saying
18:32
for the people at home um yeah not
18:35
dinosaurs and also birds didn't descend
18:36
from them
18:37
uh which again i think we everyone says
18:39
birds descended from dinosaurs and you
18:40
think well it must be the flying type
18:42
but
18:42
yeah not at all burst descended from uh
18:45
things that could not fly
18:46
when the dinosaurs were around it's
18:48
really amazing that isn't it and i read
18:50
as well
18:50
that the largest thing which survived
18:54
that
18:54
attack from a meteorite not an attack it
18:56
wasn't meteorites it wasn't malicious
18:58
you make it sound deliberate he was just
19:00
flying through the universe and the
19:01
earth got in the way it's not the
19:02
meteorite's fault
19:03
but the largest thing that would have
19:05
survived was around 44 pounds
19:08
uh and that today would be about the
19:10
size of an american beaver so anything
19:12
bigger than a beaver
19:13
would die anything smaller than a beaver
19:15
some would die but some would survive
19:17
uh and the things that turned into birds
19:19
were
19:20
not just the small dinosaurs weirdly it
19:23
was some of the media ones that were
19:24
eating
19:25
seeds because when there's like a
19:28
nuclear winter because
19:29
um the meteor hits and nothing can grow
19:32
the seeds can still live underground
19:34
and so these little dinosaurs could go
19:36
and still eat the seeds until everything
19:37
got better
19:38
and they were the ones that survived and
19:40
i wonder if that's i think that's why
19:42
today
19:42
like birds which are the things that
19:44
survive from there are the things that
19:45
eat seeds
19:46
okay yeah that's really cool um one
19:49
thing that's
19:50
uh descended from those guys are
19:52
woodpeckers
19:53
um oh yeah and i just found
19:56
what they do with their heads they bang
19:58
their heads into trees at speeds of
19:59
about 15 miles an hour up to 12
20:02
000 times a day well i mean what must
20:05
that be like
20:06
yeah why don't they get headaches it's
20:07
just we found this out for qi once yeah
20:10
and they've got a weird tongue haven't
20:12
they um
20:13
yeah wraps around their brains yeah yeah
20:15
yeah i think they've got
20:16
they've got thick skulls or some kind of
20:18
padding they've got some kind of special
20:20
brain casing
20:21
yeah it's sort of wobbles around in
20:23
jelly it is amazing though isn't it
20:25
another headbanger is a death watch
20:27
beetles which repeatedly bang their
20:28
heads on the floor to attract mates
20:31
i've tried that it it doesn't work no no
20:34
no no
20:35
death watch beat that's a metal band
20:36
deathwatch beatles
20:38
metal tribute beatles
20:41
i've got some uh i i decided to run a
20:45
search for four times what what things
20:46
are four times as much as oh yeah
20:49
yeah so there's some quite good ones in
20:51
here so
20:52
spiders milk but you didn't know there
20:53
was any but no some spiders produce milk
20:56
and spiders milk contains four times as
20:58
much protein as cow's milk
21:02
milk though aren't they i reckon like
21:04
you get more from a
21:05
cow's other than you do from a spider
21:08
just going to milk the spiders i'll be
21:10
back in
21:11
two months so and chimpanzees
21:15
expend four times as much energy walking
21:18
on either four
21:18
or two legs than humans do wow really
21:21
hard for them walking yeah
21:23
i wonder why that is exhausting i don't
21:24
know they've got huge upper bodies
21:26
haven't they that must be tiring
21:28
yeah the tg gnome is four times longer
21:31
than the coffee genome so that's
21:32
discovered by chinese geneticists
21:34
and this one is astonishing almost four
21:37
times as many people are murdered as are
21:39
killed in wars
21:41
wow yeah wow yeah i mean
21:44
some of us would say that being killed
21:46
in a war is murder
21:48
all right jeremy corbyn okay
21:54
well we've had a lot of guests today
21:55
jimmy carr jeremy carvin
21:59
actually on pterodactyls they were also
22:00
a bit hairy some of them they had
22:02
what is called terror fuzz in i found in
22:06
a threat in an email thread that i sort
22:08
of found archived between
22:09
uh paleontologists but yeah they found
22:11
hair fibers on some of them
22:13
and they also think this might be what
22:15
helped them be able to fly to do with
22:16
insulation but they were sort of fuzzy
22:18
or fluffy
22:19
that's really cool that's quite cute but
22:21
not on the wings i think just on the bod
22:24
fuzzy bod bat wings they were they were
22:27
also
22:28
the babies you know what they call the
22:29
baby pterodactyl or pterosaur um
22:32
no flaplings
22:35
nice little word and they were so they
22:36
were first identified by a guy called
22:38
george's curvier
22:39
george cuvier jordan
22:43
george at what stage reading that census
22:46
did you realize
22:47
you live in corn garden
22:52
so sorry who was george curvia then
22:54
george is
22:55
george's curvier uh was uh he was a
22:58
scientist
22:59
um and he uh was the person who
23:01
discovered or firstly identified
23:04
the flying uh pterosaur in 1809
23:07
um and he said that in 1812 he said that
23:10
they were unlikely
23:11
we as humans were ever unlikely to find
23:14
any animal as large as that
23:16
and then 10 years after he died we
23:18
discovered dinosaurs
23:23
he was the first person to say that they
23:24
flew but the first person to describe
23:26
them in any way scientifically was
23:28
cosimo collini
23:30
and he was most famous for being
23:31
voltaire's secretary yeah
23:35
such a weird two worlds colliding yeah
23:37
yeah there's a little hobby
23:39
i wonder where he was secretary because
23:40
voltaire um
23:42
just down the road from us in cover
23:43
garden he used to live there
23:45
oh volta yeah i think probably in france
23:48
where he lived most of his life okay
23:50
cool i think cuvier discovered you said
23:52
1809 i think it was 1801 wasn't it yeah
23:54
and it's curvier
23:55
sorry he was also i mean not only did he
23:59
see the baby he was also
24:00
the person who was the foundation of all
24:02
darwin's theories
24:03
he was the person who'd realized that
24:04
animals could become extinct
24:07
i have one last thing before we move on
24:08
which is did you know that there are
24:09
pterosaurs in the movie citizen kane
24:13
what so this is really worth checking
24:15
out so obviously citizen kane held up as
24:16
one of the greatest movies
24:18
ever made orson welles um he had an
24:20
incredible script he had an incredible
24:22
uh cast what he didn't have was an
24:23
incredible budget
24:25
so for a lot of the movie they had to
24:26
reuse certain things from other movies
24:28
and there's a scene in the movie and
24:29
i've watched it where
24:30
they're at some sort of party that's on
24:32
a beach and in the background
24:34
to show a sort of jungly background they
24:36
had to borrow
24:37
footage from king kong or son of king
24:41
kong
24:42
because they couldn't afford to do it
24:43
themselves yeah so in the background
24:46
you see these giant pterosaurs falling
24:48
away
24:49
no way yeah spoiler alert that's what
24:51
rosebud is the name of his pet teresa
25:00
okay it's time for fact number three and
25:02
that is
25:03
james okay my fact this week is that the
25:06
world's first casino had a rule
25:08
that you could only gamble if you were
25:10
wearing a tricorn hat
25:14
so this was in venice uh it was
25:17
in 1638 and it was called
25:20
il ridotto which means the private room
25:24
and ridotto was actually a word which
25:25
was used for like illegal gambling clubs
25:28
at the time
25:29
but they closed them all down and
25:30
everyone was very upset about it but
25:32
they said no don't worry we're gonna
25:33
make an official one that you can all go
25:35
to
25:35
uh so by the rules everyone's allowed to
25:38
go there you're all allowed to gamble
25:39
here don't worry you'll all be able to
25:40
still gamble
25:42
but if you do want to gamble you're
25:43
going to have to wear a tricon hat
25:45
and a mask and tricon hats and masks are
25:48
extremely expensive
25:49
and so actually the poor people couldn't
25:50
do it anymore so these were the kind of
25:52
masquerade masks
25:54
really sorts out your poker face problem
25:56
doesn't it when you're gambling
25:58
that's right that's gone how could they
26:00
have called anything
26:01
i guess i guess usually they don't cover
26:02
the lips do they they're sort of
26:05
so if if your tail is a big problem
26:08
because they normally do say but you'll
26:10
tell is in your eyes
26:11
not like do they yeah not pulling faces
26:13
with your arm but the masks
26:15
you can see out of the mask you can
26:16
still see people's eyes yeah you can see
26:18
well yeah i didn't know the eyes with
26:19
the tail i've been looking in the wrong
26:21
bit i've been looking at the nose
26:22
yeah his nose hasn't moved it's still
26:24
there
26:25
the talking about the casinos in italy
26:27
um in 1963
26:29
sean connery i just couldn't believe
26:31
this fact but it it's
26:33
uh it's there um he successfully backed
26:36
the number 17
26:37
three times running at the saint vincent
26:39
casino in italy
26:40
yeah you've heard that sorry i have
26:42
heard the story i
26:43
know that to be true in a way um but it
26:47
did happen to be that there was a lot of
26:49
press there
26:50
it was basically a publicity sub by no
26:52
you think it was a publicity stunt
26:54
but i like to believe it yeah although
26:56
he did he put it on 17 twice beforehand
26:59
and it didn't work didn't he
27:00
it does seem like he was like oh
27:01
something's going wrong
27:03
but yeah basically most people these
27:05
days think it was a publicity stunt
27:07
because it happened to be the week
27:08
before his movie came out
27:10
and he was with all the press and
27:12
everything like that i saw so i saw a
27:13
bit of footage the other day
27:15
totally unrelated to it but um to this
27:17
to this fact i just happened to be
27:18
watching it
27:19
um i'm convinced it must be a publicity
27:21
stunt but i can't see
27:22
anyone that says it was muhammad ali
27:25
when he was up against sunny liston
27:27
he taunted to get the fight and to
27:29
really get at him he kept
27:31
showing up at his house in a bus and
27:32
yelling through a megaphone at three
27:34
o'clock in the morning
27:35
getting him out of the house just
27:36
infuriating him and there's footage of
27:38
sunny liston at a table in a casino
27:40
rolling dice
27:41
and muhammad ali beside him just yelling
27:43
at him i'm gonna take you down doing all
27:44
this ali stuff
27:46
and just out of nowhere sunny liston
27:48
pulls a gun out of his pocket
27:50
and he fires it at muhammad ali and you
27:52
see footage of ali running out and
27:53
everyone freaking out
27:55
and then it turns out that the gun only
27:56
has blanks in it and he fires a couple
27:58
of shots into his jacket
28:00
and then just goes back to rolling dice
28:02
and everyone's fine with it
28:03
and it moves on he must have crapped
28:05
himself
28:05
[Laughter]
28:08
i found this a great line from stephen
28:10
wright about gambling
28:12
in vegas i got into a long argument with
28:15
the man at the roulette wheel
28:16
over what i considered to be an odd
28:18
number
28:19
[Laughter]
28:22
do you know that all you know this you
28:23
all know the fact that all the numbers
28:25
on a roulette wheel add it up together
28:27
no they add up to six six six yeah it's
28:30
a bad sign people should know not to
28:31
enter casinos
28:33
um but i actually did some research on
28:35
roulette for
28:36
this series the r series um and i was
28:39
really into the number
28:40
zero quite heavily and did you know that
28:42
zero was banned on roulette tables
28:44
in this country in the i think it was
28:46
the late 60s
28:48
um yeah so this way is the odds too much
28:51
in favor of the casino well it swears
28:53
the odds in favor of the casino at all
28:55
basically so
28:56
like you'll know if you go to a casino
28:57
today they all have a zero and they
28:58
absolutely have to
29:00
otherwise a casino wouldn't be able to
29:01
come off making money because there are
29:03
36 numbers
29:04
and you're given odds of one in 36 but
29:06
there's this zero on sometimes there's a
29:08
double zero or a triple zero if you're
29:10
really being ripped off
29:11
but yeah in in the 60s in 1967 the
29:14
lawlords like the equivalent of the
29:15
supreme court
29:16
decided that they didn't approve of this
29:18
they thought it was unfair that the
29:19
casino would have any advantage
29:21
and they banned zeroes from roulette
29:23
tables wow and scotland your policemen
29:25
would go round casinos and like check
29:28
four zeroes on tables and then close
29:30
them down if they had them and how long
29:31
did that last for
29:32
it lasted a year and then they realized
29:34
that all casinos were saying well we're
29:35
not going to do business anymore
29:37
and people like casinos and so they
29:39
changed that law
29:42
i was reading a thing that apparently um
29:44
something that's experienced by quite a
29:46
few casino goers is if they sit down
29:48
as a slot machine they'll sometimes sit
29:50
on quite a damp
29:52
chair um and that's because very very
29:55
dedicated gamblers who've been playing
29:57
on a single slot machine for ages and
29:58
know that if they leave
29:59
it might be the next one that wins don't
30:01
go to the toilet they just go in their
30:02
trousers
30:03
it's a it's a big thing sort of urinated
30:06
uh
30:07
you're in covered seats is a big problem
30:09
in casinos is it really
30:10
yeah yeah it's a big problem well
30:13
i've never noticed it when i've been to
30:15
casinos i must say but i i can believe
30:17
that
30:17
i think that they were like adult
30:19
diapers well this is yeah there's new
30:21
products have been made
30:22
specifically for casino goers it's
30:24
called players advantage
30:25
um yeah and the idea is it's a diaper
30:28
that gets you an additional 10 to 12
30:30
hours of
30:31
continuous play so um you can put
30:34
you know well you've got to take a long
30:36
hard look at your life haven't you when
30:38
you're buying
30:40
amber's advantage or whatever yeah
30:43
through wet wheel
30:44
we don't really know who properly
30:45
invented the modern one but a lot of
30:47
people think it was blaze pascal yeah
30:50
who's like the father of probability
30:52
really uh and the idea
30:54
that a lot of places say i don't know if
30:56
this is true that he was trying to make
30:57
a perpetual motion machine
31:00
which would make it a really bad game of
31:01
roulette wouldn't it very dull the ball
31:03
just comes around forever and ever and
31:05
ever
31:07
well the diaper would come in handy in
31:08
that case
31:10
[Music]
31:14
okay it's time for our final fact of the
31:17
show and that is
31:18
my fact my fact this week is to promote
31:20
his new product
31:21
the inventor of vaseline would
31:23
demonstrate his invention
31:24
by dipping his hands in acid and then
31:27
healing the burn wounds with the bomb
31:30
dedicated to his product i'd buy it
31:31
after that yeah well how quickly does
31:33
vaseline work
31:35
so this is okay so um we've mentioned
31:37
this guy very briefly uh ages ago on the
31:38
podcast his name is
31:40
robert chesabrew which doesn't
31:42
cheeseburger
31:43
i really want to call him cheeseburger
31:44
and i i googled uh how to pronounce his
31:46
name a bunch of times and it came up
31:48
with
31:48
chessabrew okay let's call him cheese
31:50
cheeseburgers way better so yeah
31:52
robert cheeseburger he patented the balm
31:55
vaseline in 1872. so he had this new
31:58
invention he'd spent 10 years
31:59
experimenting on himself to see that it
32:01
would work but
32:02
for the time it was hard to convince
32:04
people that it had any practical use
32:06
so he became one of those traveling
32:07
salesmen and he went to department
32:09
stores
32:10
all over new york where he would arrive
32:12
at the location and do a demonstration
32:14
the demonstration consisted of him
32:15
dipping his hand in acid or sometimes
32:17
holding his hand
32:18
over an open flame burning himself and
32:21
then putting the bomb on
32:22
and then showing his other hand that he
32:24
had done a demonstration on the day
32:26
before
32:27
and how it had healed it up yeah so it
32:29
was one hand at a time
32:30
oh wow so it was the blue peter of its
32:32
day exactly one i made earlier exactly
32:34
there's a lot of trust in that
32:36
demonstration though isn't there yes
32:38
yeah because it i mean you're trusting
32:40
that he had done that the day before and
32:42
he's not just
32:43
every single day putting his one
32:44
withered hand in some acid
32:47
i bet it was his left hand always and he
32:48
pulled him out
32:51
yeah but so he he uh did that and used
32:54
to travel all over it was real
32:55
frontline salesmanship um from old
32:58
cheeseburger
32:59
he would he had a horse and cart didn't
33:00
he and he would give away samples and
33:02
apparently this is the first time people
33:04
gave away samples of any products wow oh
33:06
that's a very good i don't know if
33:07
that's
33:08
it doesn't sound true does it sound like
33:09
someone else must have thought of it but
33:10
this is the first example that we've
33:12
found
33:12
so he used to uh chesapeake or
33:15
cheeseburger whatever his name is
33:17
he um used to have a distilled
33:20
sperm whale oil business yeah and that
33:23
started becoming redundant because the
33:25
oil industry
33:25
became huge and he was basically going
33:28
bust and he used his very last
33:29
few dollars to go to pennsylvania and he
33:32
was
33:33
going to get a job in the oil industry
33:36
and he noticed all these uh oil
33:38
workers who were always complaining
33:39
about the stuff called rod wax which is
33:41
a black gunk that good up the drill
33:43
heads and then keep having to clean it
33:44
off
33:45
and he got curious about this and he
33:47
took a bucket of it home and he thought
33:48
because
33:48
if they got wounds and burns and cuts
33:50
and things they smeared on it seemed to
33:52
get better
33:53
i don't think it's got healing qualities
33:55
actually but what it does it keeps the
33:56
dirt out of it that's one reason it's
33:58
good for you yeah yeah and keeps
33:59
moisture in doesn't it
34:00
he was fascinated because he took this
34:01
home as dan said he went years and years
34:03
um
34:04
experimenting to turn it from this black
34:06
goo into this very clear
34:08
almost translucent bomb um
34:11
and did you know he was a brit no i'd
34:13
say he was american no
34:14
he worked in america but he was actually
34:16
a brit and queen victoria used vaseline
34:19
we don't know why she was a big fan and
34:22
she actually knighted him in 1883. but
34:25
unfortunately the sword slipped off his
34:26
shelter
34:29
because he did used to cover himself in
34:31
it that's the one thing that we
34:32
mentioned
34:33
yeah he thought that it was just this
34:35
amazing thing that would cure everything
34:36
and he thought there was some special
34:38
stuff in it that would make him better
34:39
and he got pleurisy and he covered his
34:41
whole body in it and he did actually get
34:43
better but probably
34:44
not because of that well he had yeah him
34:46
he used to he he he lived to 96
34:49
and he got sick in his late 50s and he
34:52
he hired a private nurse who was
34:54
instructed to rub him down
34:56
whole body rub down in vaseline every
34:58
day come out of that job
35:00
he ate a spoonful of it and literally
35:02
every day and that's
35:03
he he attributed his longevity to
35:05
exactly that yeah yeah
35:07
i mean you would if it's your big
35:08
business right you wouldn't say that
35:10
yeah
35:11
he was secretly taking a lot of sort of
35:13
morphine and
35:14
paracetamol but um i i
35:17
um dug out some other uses of vaseline
35:19
apart from the obvious oh yeah
35:21
um so it has been smeared on fish hooks
35:25
to leo trout
35:26
treat nappy rash and toenail fungus it's
35:28
used for staunching nosebleeds
35:30
removing ring marks from furniture it's
35:33
dabbed on cheeks by actresses to
35:34
simulate tears
35:36
removing makeup protecting gun barrels
35:38
shining patent leather shoes lubricating
35:40
slide rules that's a
35:42
that's a niche
35:44
[Laughter]
35:48
and then mustache wax sunscreen
35:50
anti-fouling for boats
35:52
it's used by ear nose and throat
35:54
surgeons to combat
35:55
nasal crusting
36:01
i like the one i really like is um it's
36:03
supposedly used in boxing before a fight
36:06
so that a punch doesn't quite land on
36:08
your face it sort of slips off
36:10
yeah see them put it on their cheekbones
36:12
do you yeah and they're not allowed to
36:13
do it mid
36:14
fight and some people are caught doing
36:16
it so the coaches will come over and
36:17
subtly vaseline their face up
36:19
in american football you if you're
36:22
trying to stop someone from getting to
36:23
your quarterback you're not allowed to
36:24
hold them that's a big thing you're
36:25
allowed to block them but not hold them
36:27
yeah and so people would put vaseline on
36:30
their whole bodies
36:31
so that when you're putting your hands
36:32
out onto the chest to block them they
36:33
just slip away from you
36:35
wow but the defensive people they kind
36:38
of go against it by putting
36:40
like drawing pins in their gloves and
36:42
like thumbtacks in their gloves so they
36:44
can grip on even better
36:45
is that allowed i don't think it is
36:47
allowed it doesn't sound loud
36:49
but i think people still do it wow there
36:52
was john you're a director
36:54
you've done a lot of advert directly
36:55
right so do you know about the fact that
36:57
it's used as a technique to make
36:59
a sort of soft focus effect yeah yeah so
37:01
they smear vaseline on the lens of a
37:03
camera
37:03
they'd say literally that put some
37:05
vaseline on the lens yeah it's
37:07
extraordinary it's used in a lot of um
37:08
soft core
37:09
porn um you know you get that sort of
37:11
thing where it's it's like a dreamy
37:13
look around the actress or whatever yeah
37:15
i can imagine and i didn't know you had
37:16
such a strong career in the porn
37:18
industry before
37:19
yes absolutely it was lubricated slide
37:22
rules before you
37:25
but um so they use it in star trek for
37:28
example
37:28
any time that captain kirk uh played by
37:31
william shatner
37:32
would see a girl that was going to be
37:34
the girl of the week as it were
37:36
um they would use this soft focus so he
37:38
goes misty
37:40
it looks as if he's gone misty yeah i
37:41
think i sort of remember that
37:43
um and doris day the actress used to
37:46
have in her contract that close-ups when
37:48
she got older
37:49
all had to be done in soft focus because
37:52
she was too worried about her
37:53
um the lines on her face and so on and
37:55
then yeah so
37:56
there's movies with her and rock hudson
37:58
where rock hudson is in clear shot
38:00
as a close-up cut to doris day she's in
38:02
the street and it looks really odd
38:04
that is so weird yeah they also i just
38:06
found one use on
38:08
smearing over glass one use for it
38:10
related to that if you're a burglar
38:12
was uncovered in 2012 when someone went
38:14
around burglaring apartments
38:16
and people realized that they say he was
38:17
doing the same thing every apartment
38:19
burglar which was smearing vaseline over
38:20
the opposite apartment's peephole
38:22
so that when they looked out of their
38:24
people they couldn't see him and i don't
38:25
know why he thought they couldn't open
38:26
their own doors they thought
38:28
who's that dreamy guy
38:33
harrison ford would never rob a home
38:36
obviously you should mention me and
38:37
commercials and captain kirk in the same
38:40
paragraph
38:41
just two of the ads i shot were actually
38:43
with william shatner oh really yeah in
38:45
la for kellogg's yeah
38:47
really he was great he was such a good
38:49
guy i got on really well with him
38:51
very very funny did he demand the
38:54
vaseline for every shot
38:59
um oh just one interesting thing about
39:01
vaseline something else that it was
39:03
very important in the invention of was
39:05
mascara
39:06
so modern mascara was invented when a
39:09
woman called mabel williams uh this was
39:11
in 1915 she sort of singed her eyebrows
39:14
and eyelashes in a kitchen fire
39:16
and she wanted to make her eyelashes
39:17
look longer again and so she came up
39:19
with this homemade technique of mixing
39:20
ash and coal
39:21
with vaseline um and then she'd apply it
39:24
to her eyelashes
39:25
and you know did the trick her brother
39:27
tom weirdly watching on her watching her
39:30
spying on her and decided to try and
39:32
recreate this and commercialize it so he
39:34
used a friend's chemistry set
39:35
mix it all together made modern mascara
39:38
and named it after her named it
39:40
maybelline no that's maybelline that's
39:41
your name
39:42
it's really good yeah that's great cool
39:44
isn't it very cool
39:45
so speaking of burns um there is one
39:49
um thing that's used for treating burns
39:52
and that is
39:53
poo shakes and that is
39:56
like a milkshake but it's made with poo
39:59
and this is in new south wales and it's
40:01
the port macaree koala hospital
40:04
and obviously they had a lot of fires in
40:05
australia recently and love the koalas
40:07
got burned
40:08
and they found that by feeding them
40:10
these poo milkshakes
40:12
the koalas are getting better a lot
40:14
quicker and
40:15
it's basically your old gut bacteria
40:18
thing
40:19
so when you're a baby koala you eat pap
40:22
which is a mixture of digested half
40:24
digested food and bacteria
40:26
is created in the mother's gut and comes
40:29
out through the cecum
40:30
and the joey eats it and so what they're
40:33
doing is they're trying to come up with
40:34
a way of
40:35
imitating this by making these poo
40:37
milkshakes
40:39
and they give them to the koalas and it
40:40
just helps them to put on weight it just
40:42
helps them to
40:43
get generally better and that makes the
40:45
burns heal more quickly okay because it
40:47
sort of builds up their immune system
40:48
against the
40:49
burns that's treating burns from the
40:51
inside which is such a cool
40:53
inside out yeah my favorite burns uh
40:56
burns related story is this
40:59
in the 1940s and scientists wanted to
41:01
come up with a pain scale
41:02
and they wanted to create the pain unit
41:04
the law and they decided the way they
41:07
were going to do this where they were
41:08
going to measure pain
41:10
and work out the scale was by taking
41:12
women in labor
41:13
and then burning them repeatedly and
41:15
then asking them to compare the
41:17
sensation of being burned to being in
41:18
labor
41:19
and the women were keen to do they were
41:20
like interested they tended to be the
41:22
wives of the doctors and the nurses they
41:23
were like yeah fine i'm gonna be in pain
41:25
anyway
41:25
and so they have these women who are in
41:27
labor going through contractions and
41:28
then they just
41:29
they just like burn their finger with a
41:30
lighter and say how bad is that compared
41:32
to your contraction and then
41:34
we'll be like yeah about it's about the
41:36
same and then it got worse and worse and
41:38
they found they said that the problem
41:39
was that as contractions progressed the
41:40
women became less good at coherently
41:42
describing their feelings
41:44
so the researchers had to make
41:45
inferences about their pain based on
41:47
their behaviors
41:48
i think she told me to go myself
41:51
i'll put that down as a 10.
41:56
but that's amazing is the idea a bit
41:58
like how
41:59
you know if you have a splinter and then
42:01
you break your ankle you forget about
42:03
the splinter
42:03
is it that kind of thing it's not that
42:05
idea the idea was that they thought that
42:08
going the peak of labor was maximum pain
42:10
so that would be max on the scale
42:12
and then they wanted the women to sort
42:13
of quantify be like oh that burn is
42:15
about a tenth as bad as the labour pain
42:17
i've just felt
42:18
but women got less and less good at
42:20
perfectly rationalizing that pain
42:22
do you know um before qi was a thing
42:25
they i used to have a little email group
42:27
of
42:27
six of us they were in the group and um
42:31
we said this thing called the quite
42:32
boring challenge do you know this story
42:34
no no and the idea was one of us would
42:36
nominate every week a subject about
42:38
which nothing interesting was or could
42:40
be known
42:40
okay and i started and i nominated
42:42
chelmsford because i grew up from
42:44
near chelmsford and i spent a week
42:46
researching chelmsford's the fascinating
42:48
facts i came up with
42:50
and one of them is this is the largest
42:53
burns unit in europe is in chelmsford in
42:56
essex
42:57
and for 30 years the conservative mp for
43:00
champs
43:00
was simon burns
43:03
yeah he's he was knighted in 2015 he's
43:05
the second cousin of david bowie
43:07
bizarrely but because he was educated at
43:10
worcester college oxford where he got a
43:12
third
43:13
he's known by his friends as third
43:15
degree burns
43:16
[Music]

00:04
hugely exciting one of us has our first
00:07
debut novel out this week that is
00:09
correct which one
00:11
could it be andrew hunter murray it's
00:13
andrew hunter murray who's that guy
00:15
it's that guy he has written a debut
00:17
thriller novel it's called the last day
00:19
um i've read it it is it's unbelievably
00:22
good
00:22
it's really great so it's kind of this
00:25
uh sci-fi
00:26
dystopian future where the world has
00:28
gradually stopped
00:30
spinning half of it's plunged into
00:31
darkness half of its bathe in light it's
00:33
impossible to live in
00:34
any of those areas but what about the
00:36
middle sliver
00:37
this sort of half light half dark and
00:39
that's where the novel takes place
00:41
it's wonderful boldly imagined and
00:43
beautifully written the best future
00:45
shock thriller for years
00:46
those aren't my words those are lee
00:48
child's words lee child
00:50

00:55
genuinely couldn't believe it andy can
00:57

01:50
[Applause]
01:50
[Music]
01:54
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:56
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:59
coming to you from the qi offices in
02:01
covent garden
02:02
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
02:04
here with james harkin
02:06
anna jaczynski and andrew hunter murray
02:08
and once again we have gathered round
02:10
the microphones with our four
02:11
favorite facts from the last seven days
02:13
and in no particular order
02:15
here we go starting with you
02:18
chazinski my fact this week is that
02:21
after being stuck at an opera that went
02:23
on twice as long as the scheduled
02:25
running time
02:26
emperor joseph ii of austria banned
02:29
encores
02:32
so yeah this is 1786 it was the marriage
02:34
of figaro
02:35
very good uh no disrespect to that i'm
02:37
sure he emphasized but it did go on
02:39
twice the length it was supposed to
02:41
because almost every single scene was
02:43
on called that's so much it's rough if
02:46
you've got kids to get home to
02:48
it's difficult so anyway he went the
02:50
emperor went and he thought that was
02:52
fine but he immediately afterwards
02:54
set put up kind of bills in theaters
02:56
saying that
02:57
no piece of music should be encored
02:59
henceforth
03:00
um and to be clear he said no piece of
03:02
music for more than a single voice so if
03:05
you're singing
03:05
you're solitary little solo you could
03:07
maybe get away with it but basically
03:09
you couldn't do anything else it's an
03:11
amazing thing the idea of an encore mid
03:13
show or even at the beginning of the
03:14
show and just carrying on and on
03:16
i've never heard of that before they
03:17
just used to interrupt shows i mean this
03:19
is how encores worked until apparently
03:21
up to the 1930s
03:23
in theater it was common like if you
03:25
were watching a scene you liked it you
03:26
just shout on court and continuity
03:28
couldn't happen
03:29
because you'd have to do the scene again
03:31
sometimes there'd be like a song the
03:32
audience really liked sort of in scene
03:34
two
03:34
and then an hour later they decided to
03:36
uncle that song from scene two and
03:38
they'd be like hey play hit me baby
03:40
again
03:40
and you'd have to go back what's hit me
03:42
baby is that britney spears opera
03:44
yeah the britney spears opera uh i think
03:46
it was 18 10.
03:48
one more time
03:52
um but there was a thing where you would
03:54
sing an encore which wasn't even
03:56
part of the opera you were seeing so
03:59
some singers
04:00
uh in the 19th and even 20th century
04:02
would sing an encore which is just a
04:03
little musical bonus unrelated to the
04:05
piece you'd just seen or the opportunity
04:07
to see and they would do encore after
04:09
encore that was not
04:10
in the opera so there was a polish tenor
04:12
whose name was yan kyopura
04:14
and he made sure there was a piano in
04:16
the wings just in case he needed it for
04:18
an opera
04:19
for an encore for an encore yeah but
04:21
playing something else
04:22
just for pit pitching his other wife be
04:24
like you suddenly reading a chapter of
04:26
your novel
04:26
midge mid show right now for us
04:32
it was a dark and stormy night
04:35
wow okay the last time i heard you do
04:38
that accent was old john the pooh smug
04:42
[Laughter]
04:46
wide open oh that's disgusting
04:52
anyway anywho onto opera yes guys
04:56
oh um figaro was extremely popular
04:59
wasn't it yeah it was it was a huge deal
05:01
well i think it was popular uh
05:04
eventually
05:05
apparently the first performance they
05:06
didn't love they didn't know what to
05:08
make of it so this was in vienna when it
05:10
was first performed
05:11
and apparently it was ruined by hecklers
05:13
so someone who is there
05:14
wrote that it was destroyed by
05:16
obstreperous louts in the uppermost
05:19
story exerting their hired lungs with
05:21
all their might to deafen the singers an
05:22
audience are like oh wow
05:24
what sort of is that from a rival
05:26
composer i assume so yeah
05:27
was it and when it was played in prague
05:29
a bit later um
05:31
it was really popular um so mozart said
05:34
here they talk
05:35
about nothing but figaro nothing is
05:37
played sung or whistled but
05:39
figaro no opera is drawing like figaro
05:43
nothing but figaro all right mate
05:46
get over yourself um yeah i didn't even
05:50
know it was a play before
05:52
it was an opera yeah and it was written
05:54
by a man called beaumarshay
05:56
who is seriously interested he's the
05:58
best he's incredible
06:00
because he it was it was quite an
06:01
incendiary play it had lots of stuff
06:03
about the aristocracy being rubbish and
06:04
layabouts and useless
06:06
and it was all pre this was soon before
06:08
the french revolution so
06:10
uh louis xvi banned performances of the
06:13
play which the opera was based on
06:14
yeah he said actually he said for this
06:16
play not to be a danger the bastille
06:18
would have to be torn down
06:20
first and then everyone went oh that's
06:22
an idea
06:26
he actually referenced himself in a
06:28
later place so i think it was in don
06:30
giovanni in act
06:31
two mozart which mozart also wrote which
06:34
also was an adaptation of the beau
06:35
marche don giovanni
06:37
um he played some taffle music which is
06:39
like table music and it's like
06:41
background music in a scene where people
06:42
are chatting away
06:44
and as part of the table music he used a
06:46
marriage of figaro
06:48
melody that he got the wind players to
06:50
play so in his later opera
06:52
was a callback to his previous opera wow
06:54
he was so
06:55
far up his own ass by that point
06:58
i love another character who's a part of
07:00
this story is lorenzo de ponte
07:03
who was he wrote the words to the opera
07:06
so
07:06
all the trilogy of um those plays were
07:09
done as a collaboration he was the
07:10
bernie torpin to mozart's elton john
07:13
he was a big deal in his time lorenzo he
07:15
was the court poet to joseph ii
07:17
um so that was great but then joseph ii
07:20
died and mozart died
07:21
and he got banned from austria and he
07:23
had to flee
07:24
where he moved to america and opened a
07:26
grocery store he lived in new york he
07:28
lived in pennsylvania new jersey
07:30
in those times he had a grocery store a
07:31
bookstore a traveling general store
07:34
a gin distillery so did he he didn't
07:36
bring the stores with him he did he
07:37
opened up a new store in every new place
07:38
every new place yeah and then the
07:40
general traveling store i don't know
07:42
about that because that was on wheels i
07:43
assume so he might have brought that
07:44
everywhere
07:45
travelling store yeah and he opened the
07:46
first opera house in new york um but it
07:48
closed after two seasons and it was the
07:50
first opera house to play
07:51
italian opera um but unfortunately yeah
07:54
failed but amazing character yeah and he
07:55
was actually really important with the
07:57
marriage of figaro wasn't he because
07:59
mozart wanted it to be close to the
08:01
original story which like andy says was
08:03
really
08:04
anti-aristocracy and it was about was it
08:06
about like someone who wants to shag
08:08
some guy's girlfriend and he's the lord
08:10
and he's like well i'm the lord so i'm
08:11
allowed to shag your girlfriend and then
08:13
the guy who's the girlfriend's boyfriend
08:15
is like oh you're only there because
08:17
you're rich you idiot
08:19
you're just having a part of eastenders
08:22
yeah because then the other guy goes you
08:24
slag
08:32
but there was loads of um quotes about
08:34
why the aristocracy were bad
08:36
in this original story and it was
08:38
deponte who said
08:39
let's get rid of all those passages
08:41
let's just stick with the comedy bit
08:43
with barry and janine let's just stick
08:46
with those ones and get rid of the
08:47
mitchells
08:48
yeah wow i read the plot of it today
08:51
because i've never i've never heard the
08:52
music except obviously i have
08:54
when you when you press play on a
08:55
spotify list it's like oh that
08:57
most famous song ever is that what your
08:59
specified lists are
09:00
they are now it's that in ariana grande
09:01
at the moment don't ask me why
09:03
um it's arya's and ariana
09:06
lovely um so i'd never heard it before
09:09
and i read the plot today and it does
09:11
read like a carry-on film like it's
09:13
total farce the stuff of having to hide
09:15
in the bedrooms
09:16
very funny just even by plot i can't
09:18
wait to see it it becomes less funny
09:20
on stage i doubt it
09:24
apparently the um i read that the uh
09:26
play was so popular the original play
09:28
that in france women would have lines
09:30
from the play inscribed on their fans
09:32
oh cool yeah so that became like sort of
09:34
merchandise but
09:36
um bootleg not official not official
09:39
merch
09:39
it's awful that when you said fans i
09:41
thought you were going to say something
09:41
else god i thought he was going to say
09:43
funnies as well yeah i was going to say
09:45
how on earth do you inscribe words from
09:48
a play on your fanny you need a mirror
09:51
the only person who can read it is
09:52
leonardo da vinci
09:53
[Laughter]
09:56
do you know what do you guys know what
09:57
the french for encore is uh
10:00
encore this is not on call it's not
10:02
uncool oh it's not ankara in the french
10:04
accent
10:05
it's not encore defending any accent no
10:07
it's b
10:08
so encore is the french for can i have
10:10
some more but
10:11
actually the english language nicked it
10:14
from italy's ancora and changed it to
10:16
encore thinking that sounds nice and
10:17
french
10:18
but the french should say b as in a
10:19
second time do it the second time i like
10:21
it
10:21
okay yeah not like a buzzy buzzy
10:23
bumbling baby no
10:24
like we've heard it once a let's hear it
10:26
b twice
10:28
it's interesting because um so modern
10:30
day encores you don't repeat the
10:32
material it's
10:33
bits you haven't played so i don't know
10:36
i once went to watch the band junior
10:38
senior oh yeah and they only had one
10:39
song
10:40
it was called move your feet that
10:41
everyone had heard of and they played it
10:43
four times
10:44
did they wow there are occasional times
10:46
where that happens
10:47
in 1926 there was a musical called betsy
10:49
which is a rogers and heart musical and
10:51
but there was a song that was added to
10:52
it at last minute which was irving
10:53
berlin song and it was blue skies
10:56
and it was so popular that at the end of
10:58
the night
10:59
they requested the song again and it's
11:01
sung by bell baker but they requested it
11:03
in total
11:03
24 times she did an encore 24 times
11:07
and on the final time that she was
11:09
singing it she was so
11:10
dazed from singing it she forgot the
11:12
words um and while she forgot the words
11:14
suddenly a voice could be heard from the
11:16
front row which was irving berlin
11:17
who was filling in for the missing
11:19
lyrics and singing the rest of the song
11:20
for no way
11:21
yeah quite a cool opening there must
11:22
have been some people in the crowd who
11:24
were
11:24
saying after maybe the 20th time well
11:27
we've all had a really good time
11:32
yeah that's as hell you've got to turn
11:33
it down you've got to learn to say no to
11:35
an encore i think
11:36
yeah in that instance there's just no
11:37
way of voting there's no like if a few
11:40
people really want an encore then you
11:41
might get one it's hard
11:42
yeah well there used to be a thing in
11:44
fact where in the 19th century at these
11:46
choral festivals that happened
11:48
it was so irritating that you know you
11:50
kept getting loads of encores that the
11:52
encore decision was reserved for a
11:53
single person
11:55
like the bishop or the mayor or whoever
12:00
and they could decide what they wanted
12:01
to hear again just because you talked
12:04
about
12:04
the bishop yeah do you know that um just
12:07
after
12:07
the marriage of figaro started uh
12:09
beaumashay got arrested
12:10
and got sent to prison and that was
12:12
because there was
12:14
a um a protest outside of the play
12:18
which involved the archbishop of paris
12:20
and he apparently assaulted the
12:21
archbishop of
12:22
paris and got sent to prison for bashing
12:24
the bishop
12:29
that's where we get the phrase from
12:33
and was he assaulting him had he had he
12:35
said had he banned an
12:36
encore or something well the archbishop
12:38
was trying to stop people from going
12:39
into the theater
12:40
because he was like stop this filth kind
12:43
of thing so he was like stopping anyone
12:45
from going in and he was like how can
12:46
you stop these ladies from coming and
12:47
you shouldn't and he
12:48
kind of bashed him out of the way and
12:50
then he got arrested cruising for a
12:52
bruising
12:53
dashing for a bashing he was dashing
12:56
from fashion
12:57
anyway he's available
12:58
[Laughter]
13:02
it's the combination of dr seuss and the
13:04
pirates of penzance
13:09
[Applause]
13:11
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:13
that is
13:14
james okay my fact this week is that
13:16
humans have transported
13:18
european earthworms to every continent
13:21
on the planet
13:22
except antarctica in a process some worm
13:25
experts are calling
13:27
global worming it's really good
13:32
you delivered that like as a fox news
13:34
headline
13:36
well this was an amazing article that i
13:39
read in the atlantic by julia rosen and
13:41
it's all about earthworms
13:43
and the fact that mainly if you go to
13:46
north america they had a big
13:48
glacial ice sheet over there about 10
13:50
000 years ago
13:51
and it killed off all of the worms and
13:53
so you would think there'd be no worms
13:54
there but actually there are worms there
13:56
and that's because humans have brought
13:57
them over
13:58
and this is actually bad news for the
14:00
environment because worms are pretty
14:02
good for the environment
14:03
in some ways but if you put them in a
14:05
place where they're not supposed to be
14:06
then like all animals that's not a good
14:09
thing
14:10
i like the toner with the weather
14:14
no but it's it is it's surprising
14:16
because i would have thought that i
14:18
thought before researching this fact
14:19
that worms were good pretty much
14:20
wherever
14:21
you had them because they what do they
14:23
do in the uk they
14:25
they make your soul better yeah well
14:27
they make channels in it
14:28
some people say it's a bit of a myth
14:30
actually and a worm is a symptom
14:31
rather than a cause of good soil so they
14:34
go to good soil
14:35
is the idea that's that's an idea right
14:37
that's all right that's interesting
14:39
look there is a controversial issue i
14:41
don't get into it right now but that's
14:43
what some people say
14:44
but basically where they shouldn't be
14:46
they are um
14:47
the soil in um the boreal forest
14:50
in the northern you know half of the
14:52
planet um
14:53
it's the largest carbon sink in the
14:55
water has 200 billion
14:56
metric tons of carbon in this boreal
14:58
forest and that's not just in the trees
15:00
i didn't realize that either loads of it
15:02
is actually in the soil
15:03
under a tree you might get twice as much
15:05
carbon in the soil as there is in the
15:06
tree itself
15:07
which i had no idea about and so the
15:09
worms sometimes they eat the top layer
15:11
of the soil
15:12
basically and they just make it thinner
15:13
and thinner and thinner and then all the
15:15
carbon is actually being released into
15:16
the air because the worms are eating it
15:18
up
15:18
and creating channels although there is
15:20
another argument that when they're
15:21
making
15:22
their casts which is when you're eating
15:23
soil you kind of give out some soil
15:26
poo stuff that that actually keeps in
15:28
loads more
15:29
carbon so really actually these days no
15:32
one has really looked into earthworms
15:33
enough to know exactly what they're
15:35
doing to the environment
15:36
i didn't realize there was such a hotbed
15:37
of debate yeah we don't see enough of
15:39
this
15:40
on tv yeah just wait till next week
15:43
piers morgan will be wanging all about
15:45
earthworms
15:45
[Laughter]
15:47
but they eat seeds they eat seeds which
15:50
is
15:50
you'd think would be fine because it's
15:52
just their diet but in the bits of
15:53
america north of the mason-dixon line
15:55
and
15:55
and east of the great plains where they
15:57
used to not exist there used to be
15:58
millipedes and mites everywhere now it's
16:00
just worms yeah so they're hugely
16:02
invasive and so for sure it's quite bad
16:05
for them to be up there
16:06
because like for instance you've got all
16:08
this bits of leaves and stuff on the
16:09
floor and all the millipedes live under
16:11
there
16:11
nice and happy and then suddenly the
16:13
worms come along
16:14
and they just eat all of the leaves and
16:16
stuff like that and there's nowhere for
16:18
the millipedes to live and they all die
16:19
and someone said in this article i was
16:21
reading i think it was in this
16:23
atlantic article that it's um like going
16:25
to the african savannah
16:26
taking out all the animals and just
16:28
replacing them all with elephants
16:30
just tons of elephants everywhere yeah
16:33
and one of the problems seems to be
16:34
that we know very little about them to
16:36
some extent so it was only in 2008 that
16:39
we discovered the common earthworm
16:41
which was thought to be one species is
16:42
actually five wow
16:44
um so that you know one common earthworm
16:46
is different from another as a human
16:48
from an ape
16:50
and in the us i like this
16:53
quote in the u.s i was reading in one
16:55
article a quote which said
16:56
shockingly little is known about any of
16:58
our native earthworms
16:59
there is only one working earthworm
17:02
taxonomist in all of america
17:05
so i looked into this because i wanted
17:06
to find out who it was an easy job isn't
17:08
it of all taxonomy oh taxonomy i thought
17:11
it was taxidermy
17:14
worm taxidermy is very easy you're right
17:18
you just
17:19
cut off the end just blow out the middle
17:22
yeah yeah
17:23
so so i tried to find out about who the
17:25
taxonomist is and anyway i came across
17:26
this 1995 book and i was just so
17:28
impressed at the level of research
17:30
so it was about worms and it says uh
17:33
there's one
17:34
trained professional worm taxonomist in
17:37
america and then it says
17:38
there is sort of a second but she's only
17:40
recently trained uh so not good enough
17:42
and then says okay there's a third
17:44
expert but he was trained by his
17:46
mother and he actually works in a post
17:47
office
17:49
and then it was like he said the fourth
17:52
and last person in north america who has
17:54
any knowledge of earthworm taxonomy
17:56
works as a police lawyer in new
17:58
brunswick canada
17:59
wow this this guy has actually been
18:01
around every single person in america
18:03
to find out if they know about
18:04
earthquakes that's really impressive
18:06
it's so impressive
18:07
yeah you can get three meter long worms
18:10
yeah this is the australian giant
18:12
gypsyland earthworm uh up to three
18:14
meters long
18:15
and apparently they used to be very
18:17
abundant in the
18:19
1800s and if you plowed your fields
18:21
they'd be red with blood from all these
18:23
worms that you'd plowed up
18:25
and stuff it's it's pretty messed up
18:27
yeah they would hang from the plows like
18:29
spaghetti
18:29
someone described it as wow and but
18:32
they're quite cool so you can hear them
18:33
they're so big
18:34
and they're so vocal that when you're
18:36
walking in the territory in the
18:38
gypsyland area in the territory where
18:39
they live
18:45
is that when you say vocal is that what
18:46
you mean that's sort of what i mean
18:48
but if you if you walk along the ground
18:49
you can hear them squelching and
18:50
squirming underfoot because they're very
18:52
fast
18:53
and so they squirm away and so if you
18:55
walk you'll hear a gurgling squirrel
18:57
if they're moving through their burrows
18:58
i think because it's like the water
18:59
draining in a bath
19:01
they've moved through yeah their bodies
19:03
are sliming against the walls of their
19:05
borough
19:06
they're a foot long when they're born
19:08
when they're born yeah they're really
19:10
big are they born in eggs are they in
19:11
like a cocoon type thing i don't know if
19:13
their eggs are born alive
19:14
um right but they do so they have no
19:16
teeth but they do have
19:18
a gizzard you know they're like thicker
19:21
like a chicken yeah they smaller swallow
19:23
little rocks and they use those to grind
19:25
up their food
19:26
inside them do you know how you collect
19:28
worms because there's a worm
19:29
conservation effort going on
19:30
now in the worms are good for the
19:32
environment lobby so i think you tap the
19:35
ground and they think there's a bird
19:37
there no they think there's rain there
19:39
and they come up thinking there's rain
19:40
and then you just
19:41
plop them out you do do a bit of that we
19:43
and we have mentioned the
19:44
worm tapping before haven't we i was
19:46
actually talking about the more brutal
19:47
way which is you just shove a spade in
19:48
the ass
19:49
which is what um people used to do and
19:51
they're doing it much less now
19:53
but it turns out you're just cutting
19:54
them in half all the time and that does
19:56
cause a bit of an issue because if
19:57
you're trying to get rid of them you're
19:58
just doubling the population
20:02
it gets out of control no so what they
20:04
do to avoid using the shovel now is they
20:07
take dna swabs because it's all about
20:08
counting the population of a certain
20:10
species
20:11
and so you swab the mucus from their
20:14
passages so they make these tiny
20:15
channels
20:16
and scientists who are looking into
20:17
earthworm populations will just swab a
20:20
worm tunnel
20:21
and they scrape their saliva off it and
20:22
then they measure it in a test tube
20:24
when you said swapping the passages i
20:26
thought it was like inside the body
20:28
passages
20:28
it's not a small swab isn't it
20:33
worm goes i've got my gp check up again
20:36
a worm sphere test there's only one
20:39
stirrup
20:42
and the doctor uses a cocktail stick
20:46
yeah
20:49
okay it is time for fact number three
20:51
and that is my fact
20:52
my fact this week is that the most
20:53
popular street in america
20:55
is second street the second most popular
20:57
street is third street
20:59
and the third most popular street is
21:01
first street
21:03
so uh and who's on first
21:07
uh yeah so fourth is fourth fifth is
21:09
park and
21:10
sixth is fifth um that just to bring you
21:13
further down the list
21:14
is there not main street anyway
21:17
so there is um this is from 1993 this
21:20
was the census bureau in america
21:22
released this report
21:23
uh in recent years i think it was in the
21:25
like 2013
21:27
sort of period um they released all new
21:30
information about
21:31
um the just general information about
21:33
geography topography and so on
21:34
um but they didn't do the same list that
21:36
they've done before and few people have
21:37
gone through it completely and they've
21:38
compiled lists but none of them
21:40
seem to tally with the others so
21:43
washington posted
21:44
one where they said that park was the
21:45
number one street
21:47
um but then someone on reddit called
21:48
darren hawley he did one that said
21:50
main street was the top one um and so
21:53
they think the reason first is not up
21:54
there is because
21:55
first and main were two versions of
21:58
saying first basically
21:59
yeah so it knocked it down it halved its
22:01
chances also the idea is that if you
22:03
have a first street which is your main
22:04
street in your town
22:06
you might name it after george
22:07
washington or abraham lincoln or donald
22:09
trump or something like that
22:11
yeah did you know that ludford in
22:13
lincolnshire has a street named after
22:14
donald trump
22:15
well i say it's named after donald trump
22:16
it's called fanny hands lane
22:20
it's cheap cheap and unfair but actually
22:23
there's nothing rude about it nothing
22:24
rude about
22:25
yes there is the word valley it is
22:28
it has been claimed that it's affecting
22:29
property prices that having a street
22:31
called funny hands lane but the thing is
22:32
it was just named in the 19th century by
22:34
a man named john hand after his wife
22:37
fanny no there's nothing rude about it
22:43
do you know in london um just down the
22:44
road from here there's a place called
22:46
knight rider street
22:49
very cool and do you know who it's named
22:51
after uh hasselhoff i would say yeah
22:53
well the car no obviously not
22:56
no it was because it was the route that
22:58
knights used to take from the tower of
23:00
london to smithfield where gels were
23:02
held
23:03
so knights would ride across that street
23:05
in their talking carriages wouldn't they
23:10
i i was reading about um nicaragua's
23:13
capital city of
23:14
managua so i was trying to find out
23:16
based on this
23:17
fact about street names i was trying to
23:19
find out if there was anywhere where the
23:20
streets have no name
23:21
like in the south yeah uh because bono
23:23
wrote that while on a visit to ethiopia
23:25
and it's thought that it was about the
23:26
poverty there
23:27
and you know that didn't have proper
23:29
street naming system
23:30
um so in managua in nicaragua it did
23:33
have a modern grid system
23:34
until 1972 and then there was a an
23:36
earthquake which destroyed
23:38
lots of buildings and infrastructure and
23:40
basically they've replaced the system
23:42
with the really ramshacker ones so
23:43
you might be directed to somewhere which
23:45
is a block south of the convent and half
23:47
a block east of the college
23:49
and you just have to get there wow and
23:50
so taxi drivers there are amazingly good
23:52
because they know all these places
23:54
and sometimes your life of directions
23:55
and you'll be told oh yeah go to the
23:57
blue house was it which is actually
23:58
brown
24:01
because locals know that there is a
24:03
house which is brown but it used to be
24:05
blue
24:05
wow so good i know so cabbie's there at
24:07
like next level or you might be told to
24:09
go
24:09
down and that means go west because the
24:11
sun goes down in the west
24:13
oh that's because it's i don't know how
24:15
any stuff gets delivered properly
24:17
also very very difficult if you've got
24:18
one of those travelling shops we were
24:20
talking about
24:23
um but it does talking about this kind
24:25
of thing makes you really respect
24:26
america for having just gone down the
24:28
line
24:28
grid system you know this is the number
24:31
of the street this is the number of the
24:32
avenue it's very boring it's very
24:34
effective
24:35
and so that was that was come up with by
24:37
um penn
24:38
uh after in pennsylvania named not from
24:40
penn teller
24:41
[Laughter]
24:43
just magic streets into existence so
24:46
william penn he came up with a grid
24:48
system in 1682 when he founded
24:50
philadelphia which was only founded
24:52
because basically the king of england
24:54
king charles ii was massively in debt to
24:56
him and had no money to pay him so
24:58
instead said
24:59
have this random tract of land wow uh in
25:02
philadelphia
25:03
and so he gave him this land and so penn
25:06
famous quaker set up this utopian what
25:08
he wants to be a utopian society
25:10
but he really didn't want it to be
25:11
called pennsylvania and
25:13
also pennsylvania is not named after him
25:15
it's named after his dad
25:17
yeah who happens to have the same name
25:20
he was very clear
25:21
i don't want everyone to think i'm a
25:23
cocky he wanted to call it new
25:25
wales
25:26
because it reminded him so much of wales
25:27
of which he was very fond
25:29
um anyway so yeah he really didn't want
25:30
to be caught named after him and now
25:32
pennsylvania forever
25:33
bears his name which is very sad that's
25:36
cool
25:37
and they're quite good at um coming up
25:39
with funny names in america aren't they
25:40
of their streets uh i know they do have
25:42
lots of firsts and seconds but there's a
25:44
few funny ones i
25:45
sure we've mentioned them before like we
25:47
did say once that the number 69 road
25:49
markers always get stolen don't we
25:51
didn't we uh and there's a stoner drive
25:53
in colesville and a blunt road
25:56
and they have had people stealing their
25:58
road signs all the time
26:00
but they've come up with a way of
26:02
stopping that and that is they're making
26:04
them without any vowels
26:06
so what used to say stoner drive now
26:08
says
26:09
s t blank n blank r drive
26:12
and what used to be blunt road is now b
26:15
l n t
26:16
road do they leave the space they leave
26:18
the space
26:19
space oh wow cause that just looks like
26:21
it was made by a stoner
26:24
i just couldn't be bothered finishing it
26:26
unfortunately they've all been stolen by
26:27
fans of only connect
26:32
okay it's time for our final fact of the
26:34
show and that
26:35
is andy my fact is that the game of
26:38
scrabble is partly thanks
26:40
to edgar allen poe
26:46
and that's why spooky with 20 0's is
26:48
actually accepted in swivel isn't it
26:51
so this is about the man who invented
26:52
scrabble whose name was alfred mosher
26:54
butts
26:55
and he he sounds like a good time
26:57
doesn't he
26:58
yeah he's a good time guy yeah that's
27:01
mosh butts
27:02
um he was he was an unemployed architect
27:06
he was a sacked architect in depression
27:08
era america so early 30s
27:10
and um he was trying to work out how to
27:12
come up with a board game because he
27:14
thought this
27:14
could be worthwhile he thought there
27:16
aren't many wordy board games at the
27:18
time which there weren't
27:19
i think he was playing was he playing
27:21
trivial shoot or something he was
27:22
playing
27:22
some game that he absolutely hated and
27:24
like there must be something better than
27:25
this
27:26
yeah exactly um and he was inspired by
27:28
monopoly as well i think
27:30
and so he but he was trying to work out
27:31
how to come up with a word game because
27:32
he thought this might be something
27:34
and he had read as a child uh the edgar
27:36
allan poe
27:37
story the gold bug and there's a code in
27:40
that
27:40
which has to be broken and the way to
27:42
break the code is that
27:44
it's based on how frequently particular
27:46
letters appear in the english language
27:48
so the one that appears most is e
27:51
and so on and so
27:55
and you know the rest and so
27:59
he he decided to to make that the system
28:02
by which letters would score more or
28:03
less in scrabble
28:04
and he studied newspaper front pages for
28:06
ages and you can see there are photos
28:07
online of his tally charts where he's
28:09
methodically counting each letter how
28:11
often it appears
28:13
on the front page of the new york times
28:15
say very dedicated yeah and that's what
28:17
we came up with
28:17
with the scoring system that's cool he
28:20
didn't really like playing his game too
28:21
much
28:22
by the end because his wife always beat
28:24
him
28:25
mrs butts um she once scored 234 for
28:30
quixotic
28:31
against him yeah yeah apparently this he
28:34
sounds like a sore loser because i'd
28:35
assume it was only because he was losing
28:36
it trivial pursuit that he invented
28:40
i've got to invent some game okay here's
28:41
a game whoever has the most stupid name
28:43
wins
28:45
they've stole long cubs funny hands for
28:47
sake
28:49
they've still got the um the score card
28:52
um the
28:52
nephews there was a journalist who fell
28:54
madly in love with the history of
28:56
scrabble and he'd track down the nephew
28:58
who has no interest in playing it but
28:59
has an obsession with collecting all the
29:01
things that look like the track now
29:03
yeah and um and in his house so he has
29:05
everything framed but most of it is not
29:07
up on the walls it's still in the sort
29:08
of brown packaging that the
29:10
the framers handed it over and in one of
29:12
those is the scorecard
29:14
that so mrs butts kept the scorecard
29:18
from her exotics
29:24
if you're framing your victories over
29:25
your husband oh actually james is right
29:27
if you'd scored quick sonic and i
29:28
supposedly it was across
29:30
two triple word scores i mean it sounds
29:32
like an absolute
29:33
story checks out yeah yeah set up
29:38
um do you know who is the best um
29:40
scrabble players in the world which
29:41
country
29:43
uh america no no no france no
29:46
well i'm gonna say from an old episode i
29:49
think it's a guy from new zealand ah yes
29:51
because he managed to
29:52
win the french one didn't he despite not
29:54
being able to speak french
29:56
but no it is nigeria oh okay and the
29:59
nigerian scrabble federation has this
30:01
year
30:01
said that um they really need to be
30:04
given more money from the government
30:05
because
30:06
according to them it's the only sport
30:08
that they're the world's best at
30:10
in the world is scrabble can i just
30:13
quickly um
30:14
because we spoke about nigel richards um
30:16
in episode 79
30:17
long time ago this is the guy who won
30:19
the french scrabble thing
30:20
i just wanted to check an update on him
30:22
see how he's doing in his championships
30:24
yeah he is still the winner of the
30:25
french
30:26
french scrabble championships he won
30:28
2017 2018 and 2019
30:30
in their elite competition so he's still
30:33
just owning it
30:34
really how many people are competing
30:36
it's a biggie i think
30:37
is it though it's scrabble isn't it
30:40
let's face it
30:41
do you know who our scrabble champion is
30:43
no look he's a great guy he's called
30:45
alan simmons
30:46
and he is banned from playing scrabble
30:48
as of 2017
30:49
because he cheated by peeking at the
30:51
letters he was picking out the bag and
30:52
then putting that back in and swapping
30:54
them for other letters
30:55
that is the scrabbled champion of the uk
30:58
wow but that's a thing there's a rule
31:02
where
31:02
i think maybe who knows if it's next to
31:04
simmons or not but there's a rule where
31:05
you have to take the letters out of the
31:07
bag at eye height or higher
31:09
really yeah he was done for holding the
31:11
bag too low
31:12
that's great and there's a thing called
31:14
brailing
31:15
have you heard this oh yeah brailing is
31:17
feeling the letters
31:19
as you're holding them in the bag and
31:21
trying to work out what they are
31:23
yeah that makes sense right because a
31:24
blank would just be a flat surface
31:27
yeah that's true but i i mean i'm not
31:29
ver i can imagine taking a long time to
31:31
work out oh it's an e or whatever
31:33
like it's quite impressive that you yeah
31:35
yeah it's not just blanks and non-blanks
31:36
okay they're more sophisticated than
31:38
i mean you could say that that's it yeah
31:41
i think if you're taking out three
31:42
or four scrabble tiles each time and you
31:45
pick four
31:46
quickly feel them and if there's no
31:47
blank you pick another four that's going
31:49
to over a long run that's going to make
31:50
a difference
31:51
yeah yeah your mind's averages yeah but
31:53
i do think that if you are fondly around
31:56
for what shape the indentation is in
31:57
scrabble tiles you just need to reflect
31:59
on your life
32:00
just with your hand in the bag you need
32:01
to think what the am i doing
32:02
winning
32:04
winning um one thing that was
32:07
a new exciting moment in scrabble is
32:10
that last year
32:10
okay was added and apparently this was
32:13
very
32:14
controversial yeah uh okay do you agree
32:16
i do actually do
32:18
why because isn't one of the things
32:21
about scrabble that you're not allowed
32:22
acronyms
32:23
okay oh my god andy i can't believe
32:25
you're on this side of the argument
32:26
okay has not been a militialism for like
32:28
a hundred years what does it stand for
32:31
oh well though but that's the theory
32:33
that it stands for all correct
32:35
but always correct with the case
32:38
yeah okay don't stand for that that that
32:40
is genuinely
32:42
the first instance of okay is the all
32:44
correct thing but it
32:45
is uh there is another theory that it
32:46
stands for happy birthday but happy is
32:48
spelt with an o
32:49
a birthday is spelled with a k yeah
32:56
but when i say okay i am putting a full
32:59
stop after the o and another one after
33:00
the k and therefore
33:01
no one should be allowed to play it do
33:04
you know what you should start doing
33:05
then you should start
33:06
saying ow which was another thing that
33:08
this magazine tried to get going at the
33:10
time when okay took off
33:11
so al was for all right
33:14
and so it thought that was going to
33:16
become a thing as well you spelled that
33:18
what what
33:19
letters are you at the start of the paul
33:21
it's o-w
33:22
oh oh it's all misspelled it's part of
33:25
the satire guys the comedy was different
33:26
like
33:27
but i'm gonna start saying ow and i mean
33:29
okay people will constantly be asking me
33:31
if i'm all right
33:33
are you okay ow all right yes that's
33:35
what it stands for
33:38
crazy have you heard of coffee housing
33:40
no uh it's another
33:41
practice in scrabble it's another
33:43
frowned upon practice in scrabble can
33:44
you guess what it is
33:45
coffee housing is it when you shove the
33:47
tiles up your ass
33:48
like we all do in a coffee house where's
33:51
your connection to that it's frowned
33:53
upon i was just thinking of something
33:55
you might do in scrabble that's frowned
33:56
upon
33:57
yeah it's true is it because you can
33:59
feel that on the tiles in the back can't
34:01
you yeah
34:02
you can it's a bit of an ass if i go to
34:05
a coffee house i give them my name and
34:06
they spell it incorrectly every time
34:08
so is it putting down a word which is
34:10
correctly spelled incorrectly spelled
34:12
and saying it's correct
34:13
that's a rip that's actually so much
34:14
better than what it is
34:16
the explanation housing is just
34:18
distracting your opponents with chat
34:20
about their day or anything else like
34:22
put anything up your ass recently
34:26
that's quite good that's a good idea
34:28
that's amazing this podcast is all
34:30
coffee housing no
34:32
no scramble isn't it it's like a game of
34:33
scrabble where the coffee housing got
34:35
out of hand
34:38
there's one there's a blog which i
34:40
really like called taiwiki whitby
34:42
and the person who runs it is called
34:43
minnesota stan and
34:45
they play a game of scrabble which i
34:47
think is really good um
34:49
they do a few different things first of
34:50
all double bagging
34:56
where you keep all your consonants in
34:58
one bag and all your bells in another
34:59
bag
35:00
and so you can pick the ones that you
35:01
want depending on what you've got on
35:03
your rack
35:03
no like countdown yeah okay that's a
35:06
good idea right
35:06
and they have another one which is open
35:08
booking which means you have you're
35:09
allowed to have the dictionary open and
35:11
check things as you're going along
35:13
and they also spin their racks around to
35:15
ask the other person for help
35:16
if you get stuck and they reckon they've
35:19
played a game
35:20
where the two people playing got a
35:21
combined amount of 2000 points
35:25
i just think it's a more friendly game
35:27
it is it's more coffee housing
35:29
yeah that is good i think i would play
35:31
scrabble more if i was allowed to do
35:32
those things
35:34
no one let you play scrabble with them
35:35
anyway at school did they i don't know
35:37
what that means it's not a cool sport
35:46
[Laughter]
35:52
um i have a few things on po oh let's go
35:54
should we go
35:58
all right wow this is going to get
36:01
incredibly annoying very fast isn't it
36:03
so uh the goldbug which was the initial
36:06
short story that was written
36:07
that inspired but um so
36:11
poe had in what basically what it was
36:13
was that was a code that he'd worked out
36:15
and he
36:15
the same method kind of looked through
36:17
bunches of books and papers to see what
36:20
a recurring letter was to give them this
36:21
form
36:22
and he was quite a big code setter back
36:25
in the day for the newspapers he worked
36:26
for
36:27
he's to do a thing of setting out a
36:28
challenge of saying to the readers send
36:30
me a code
36:31
anything cryptic and i will solve it and
36:33
he would publish
36:34
his findings he'd publish the solutions
36:37
wow in the next week's paper yeah
36:38
a nice idea it's a lovely idea and he
36:40
used to set them as well and give them
36:42
out to the readers and he was shocked
36:43
when even
36:44
one person was able to crack them
36:45
because he thought he was so good at
36:47
setting these codes inside of him i had
36:48
no idea about it yeah he
36:50
he had the bit of the mozart's about him
36:51
didn't he when he um published a raven
36:55
it was
36:55
basically an overnight success everyone
36:57
thought it was amazing
36:58
turned him into a celebrity and everyone
37:00
said how brilliant it was
37:02
and he told a friend it was the greatest
37:04
poem that was ever written
37:06
yeah wow there were loads of weird
37:09
parodies of the raven though which came
37:11
up straight away
37:13
so as soon as he published the raven he
37:14
became super famous it became super
37:16
famous but also published were the
37:18
gazelle
37:19
the whipple will the turkey the pole cat
37:22
and lincoln actually president lincoln
37:23
read and enjoyed the pole cat the pearl
37:25
and the pole cat before he read the
37:27
raven which was a piss take of the raven
37:29
there's a there's a few people that
37:30
believe that the raven was not
37:32
originally going to be a raven
37:34
that it was going to be a parrot well
37:36
because it can talk yeah exactly and
37:38
it was more it was a dark and stormy
37:41
night
37:43
um yeah poe wrote a philosophy of
37:45
composition uh piece and in it he said
37:47
arose the idea of a non-reasoning
37:49
creature capable
37:50
of speech and very naturally a parrot in
37:52
the first instance
37:53
suggested itself and then he later on
37:55
says but that is superseded
37:57
uh with a raven along the lines but we
37:59
might have had yeah it just definitely
38:00
doesn't have the same kind of
38:01
mounting spooky vibe does this there's
38:04
one theory
38:05
i think this might be true actually that
38:07
um the raven
38:08
that he writes about was charles dickens
38:11
is raven
38:12
is that right oh yeah um so charles
38:14
dickens had a raven called grip the
38:16
knowing
38:17
and he was a character in barnaby rudge
38:19
and when edgar allan poe reviewed
38:20
barnaby rudge
38:22
he thought that this raven was an
38:24
amazing part of it
38:25
and the theory is that the raven in his
38:27
poem was from that and that's why he
38:28
changed it from a parrot wow so he cast
38:30
the raven from someone else's book
38:32
incredible that's awesome it's like
38:34
going i love winston smith in 1984 i'm
38:37
going to bring him into my book and use
38:38
him
38:38
but it's not like that it's the raven
38:40
from what a weird review that must have
38:42
been
38:43
poe did you read any of the rest of it
38:45
it's like reviewing harry potter and
38:46
just talking about hedwig the entire
38:48
time
38:51
that's incredible yeah i mean his
38:53
reviews were a bit weird though weren't
38:55
they
38:56
he liked to slag people off quite a lot
38:57
in his reviews
38:59
um he reviewed a collection of poems by
39:01
william w
39:02
lord in 1845 saying the only remarkable
39:04
things about mr lord's compositions
39:06
are their remarkable conceit ignorance
39:09
impudence platitude
39:11
stupidity and bombast wow
39:14
but he only read the bit about the
39:15
sparrow at the time
39:17
he had his struggles in life he died
39:20
aged
39:20
40 of um drink really drink and poverty
39:25
he was incredibly broke um well this
39:27
death was
39:28
quite spooky in itself wasn't it yeah he
39:31
was found in the street wasn't he in
39:33
clothes that he didn't quite fit him and
39:34
he was taken to hospital and he was
39:36
braving tough times for po a lot of
39:39
people thought when he was found he was
39:41
drunk and maybe been on a drinking binge
39:43
but then his family and friends said
39:44
well it's pretty unlikely because he
39:46
couldn't really drink if he gave him one
39:47
glass of wine he'd go
39:48
tonto so it didn't seem likely that he'd
39:51
been on some binge
39:52
yeah i think it's it's really even more
39:54
controversial than that really
39:56
so he was found in someone else's
39:58
clothes it didn't even fit him
39:59
some people think he was coops which is
40:01
there was an election on the day that
40:03
he was found dead and so some people
40:05
think that he was cooped as in
40:06
this was a weird thing that was
40:08
practiced where people who were
40:09
campaigning for a certain politician
40:11
would literally coop people up would
40:12
drug them would force feed them loads
40:14
and nose of alcohol and would drag them
40:15
from one polling booth to the next force
40:17
them to vote
40:18
and then leave them abandoned and they'd
40:20
change their clothes as they went so
40:21
they look like they were a different
40:22
person but he his reputation as being an
40:26
alcoholic
40:27
and a bit of a disaster walking disaster
40:30
is mostly undeserved it's this weird
40:33
myth that came about as soon as he died
40:35
and it was spread by this guy called the
40:36
reverend rufus wilmot grizzled
40:39
and it only happened because so he uh
40:42
reviewed so poe reviewed one of
40:43
grizzle's poems very badly a few years
40:45
earlier and then poe started having an
40:47
affair with this lady that grizzled
40:48
fancied
40:49
and stenpo died and for some reason that
40:53
no one knows
40:54
poe's aunt made grizzled the executor of
40:56
his will
40:57
and made him the executive of all his
40:59
papers and so he was in charge of his
41:01
papers and he forged a bunch of
41:02
and he wrote this biography of poe which
41:04
slandered him and basically said he was
41:06
this opium addicted
41:08
crazy drunken poverty stroke and he
41:10
deserted the army expelled from
41:11
university none of this stuff was true
41:13
he wrote his obituary as well yeah he
41:16
had the line
41:16
will startle many but few will be
41:18
grieved by it talking of his death
41:21
it's just wow full-on guy um
41:24
the baltimore ravens are an american
41:26
football team and
41:27
their name it comes after the raven
41:30
novel because poe lived in baltimore the
41:33
poem
41:34
oh god it's a sharp poem it's a long
41:37
novel
41:38
i don't know what it is novel to james
41:40
well this is more than two pages
41:43
so they get their name from the poem the
41:45
raven at the baltimore ravens because
41:47
poe lived in baltimore
41:48
and in 2001 they won the super bowl we
41:51
just had the super bowl last night as we
41:53
record this
41:54
and in 2001 the baltimore ravens won the
41:56
super bowl and they won it
41:58
because they had a great defense and
42:00
espn said
42:01
quoth the ravens never score oh
42:04
nice very strong yeah well it will be by
42:07

00:03
hi guys just before we start this show
00:05
here is a warning we have a special
00:08
guest on today
00:09
yes very exciting guest a author a
00:11
published author a publisher i can't
00:13
believe we've
00:14
pinned her down uh but one of the ways
00:16
we have pinned her down is that she
00:17
works in the office with us
00:18
uh it's ann miller you will have heard
00:20
her before that's right anne miller has
00:22
just released her debut
00:23
children's book it's so good it's called
00:26
mickey and the animal spies
00:27
and it is the story of a young girl who
00:30
gets recruited
00:31
into a secret organization called cobra
00:35
but it is not manned by humans but by
00:38
animals
00:39
that's right i realize i'm not a child
00:40
but i have actually read it and i
00:42
genuinely
00:42
loved it it's like a fantasy book that
00:45
you wish you'd had if you were sort of
00:46
seven eight nine
00:47
ten eleven twelve thirty four uh i'm not
00:50
a child either however i do have the
00:52
reading level of a seven year old
00:53
and i have to say i think any kid who
00:55
gets this book will be fascinated
00:57
they'll know morse code at the end of it
00:59
and they will just want more and they're
01:00
going to get more because it's part of a
01:02
trilogy it is yes and it does have code
01:04
scattered throughout it
01:05
so it's almost like a mini activity book
01:07
and yeah it features some cracking
01:08
animals there's cats in it there's rats
01:11
there's complex characters who maybe you
01:13
don't love at first but you grow very
01:15
fond of
01:16
there is a cobra because it's very funny
01:18
pun on the real life cobra
01:20
organization and then cobra the snake uh
01:22
it's it's a brilliant book
01:23
go get it and to get it you should go on
01:26
the internet
01:27
uh where you can buy books or you should
01:29
go to a bookshop where you can also buy
01:31
books and just ask for mickey and the
01:33
animal spies
01:34
by anne miller who joins us on today's
01:37
show so let's get to it
01:38
on with the episode
01:45
[Music]
01:51
[Applause]
01:54
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:57
no such thing as a fish
01:59
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
02:01
qi offices in coverant garden
02:03
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
02:05
here with anna chazinski
02:07
andrew hunter murray and ann miller and
02:10
once again we have gathered around the
02:11
microphones with our four
02:12
favorite facts from the last seven days
02:15
and in no particular order
02:16
here we go starting with fact number one
02:20
and that is anne my fact is that even
02:23
the dust at gchq is classified
02:27
so what does this mean so i went to uh
02:30
it's a brain exhibition on at the
02:32
science museum which is 100 years of
02:33
gchq and they've got things that never
02:35
been seen before and
02:36
one of the facts i found there is that
02:38
when they have things need to be taken
02:39
out of service machines paperwork things
02:41
like that
02:42
it gets ground down to become electronic
02:44
waste and it's dust but it's certified
02:45
so they can't just go in the bin
02:47
because it's so so so secret what
02:49
they've ground up even the ground up
02:50
stuff is
02:51
secret so they dispose of it really
02:54
securely somewhere
02:55
they do not discuss how they dispose of
02:56
it can you imagine being a double agent
02:59
and going to the russians and go i've
03:01
got my hands on it's classified
03:04
yeah and you show them the dust i don't
03:06
think they'd be happy
03:07
i don't think they'd consider it
03:08
classified they might because another
03:10
thing i found at the
03:11
um museum was these things called micro
03:13
dots so this is very tiny recorded
03:16
messages so it would look like just like
03:17
a little very small polka dot print and
03:19
when you bring out a lens it will
03:20
magnify it and you can read like
03:21
um i saw anna on the bridge at two
03:23
o'clock meet at five or something
03:25
so you know the dash things get very
03:27
very small and they're still very very
03:28
secret so everything is
03:30
if you're wearing a polka dot dress for
03:32
example and you know that one of the
03:33
dots is the micro dot
03:35
you have to remember really carefully
03:36
which one it is
03:38
the best place to hide something is with
03:39
lots of things that look the same yeah
03:41
it sounds like a great exhibition
03:44
we've got tiny dots you can't ring i've
03:46
got tons of machines as well
03:48
i just like the idea of p is is it like
03:50
the hardest jigsaw you've ever done
03:52
piecing the dust back together do you
03:53
think you get you collect the dust
03:55
spew it on the floor and then have to
03:56
put it back in order i suspect that you
03:59
can't re-piece the dust
04:01
now but maybe you could one day so the
04:03
worst ikea
04:04
assembling is we've got you a computer
04:08
here so this is not the first
04:12
time that this kind of rubbish has been
04:15
useful in espionage
04:16
so during the cold war there was an
04:18
operation called tamarisk
04:19
you guys heard of this so the usa and
04:22
the uk and france they all had military
04:24
liaisons
04:25
in east germany and the soviets were
04:27
allowed some in west germany
04:29
so it was supposed to be a way of
04:30
lowering tensions by having a bit of
04:31
representation
04:33
on either side but basically it just
04:34
turned into legalized espionage because
04:36
obviously
04:37
people sent spies to do that to work in
04:39
those missions
04:40
and the western officers launched this
04:42
operation where they would gather up
04:43
paper from soviet bins
04:45
and sometimes they had to gather up used
04:47
toilet paper
04:49
because a lot of people were not given
04:51
toilet paper
04:52
in the soviet union or on the soviet
04:54
side so they would use
04:56
confidential paper as toilet paper
04:59
and then the western spies had to go
05:01
through gathering
05:03
puy paper from bins basically which had
05:06
classified information on it
05:07
that's useful though because you can
05:09
also report back on their diets
05:11
yeah yeah yeah all the information you
05:13
possibly want
05:14
yeah yeah and it was one of the most
05:15
successful operations of the whole cold
05:17
war wow i was gathering information from
05:20
from pooey bins but i think part thing
05:23
is you don't like there's so much work
05:24
and you know
05:25
making things secret but there's other
05:26
things you give away just by your your
05:28
choice of toilet paper or your dust and
05:30
you've got to be really
05:32
yeah they all like scented toilet paper
05:34
they must have you know expensive tastes
05:38
that a useful thing to know sure which
05:40
shops you might find them in
05:43
did you know that gchq was not
05:45
recognized officially until 1994. yeah
05:48
so i find bizarre
05:49
mi5 until there was like an official
05:52
acknowledgement
05:52
there was a parliamentary act which
05:54
basically said what its role should be
05:55
basically all anyone knew was from ian
05:57
fleming and john le carre yeah
05:58
and whenever a bond film comes out uh
06:00
recruitment uh applications peak at gcsq
06:04
because everyone's like i'll give that a
06:05
go even though they've said that james
06:07
bond wouldn't get a job there haven't
06:08
they
06:08
and why because alcoholic and also
06:12
um not emotionally intelligent oh which
06:14
is fair enough
06:15
um so i was reading an article which is
06:16
like an inside gchq which all loves
06:19
stuff there's not that much in them
06:20
because they can't tell you that much
06:22
but the article was in the ft
06:23
and it interviewed the head of gchq
06:26
who's called jeremy fleming
06:27
as an ian fleming and the article was
06:31
written by
06:32
the ft security editor david bond
06:39
um do you know that the head of it at
06:43
gchq is ai what okay that's not true
06:46
it turns out i misread the article it's
06:48
a guy called al but it looks like a.i
06:50
when you read it but what's interesting
06:53
about him is he's dyslexic he's the head
06:55
of i team he's dyslexic
06:56
and i was reading this in an article his
06:58
name is actually la isn't it
07:00
so this was an article written in the
07:03
times a journalist was allowed into gchq
07:05
to do this article and it was very funny
07:07
because
07:08
they had as the journalists went in all
07:10
these a4 bits of paper blue tap to walls
07:12
saying caution journalist interviewing
07:15
keep all
07:16
conversations to official and everywhere
07:19
this journalist went that's what they
07:20
saw but they were doing an article about
07:22
the neurodiversity program at gchq so
07:24
there are 300 men and women there
07:26
who all have dyslexia or autism or
07:29
asperger's
07:30
and face blindness for example so
07:32
there's one lady who works there
07:34
who's a former chemist called jill and
07:36
she's their intelligence analysis
07:38
she can do that and she's ahead of it
07:41
but she struggles to recognize her
07:43
employer's face
07:44
who she's worked with for eight years
07:45
because of the space blindness disease
07:47
that she has
07:48
so it's such it's an extraordinary
07:50
article about the people that they hire
07:51
there
07:51
i read one as well where and they said i
07:53
journalist in for the day and like um
07:54
like i'm saying be careful what they say
07:56
and
07:56
someone was told that he was allowed to
07:58
go around the building and that was fine
07:59
he's allowed to go in for like six days
08:01
but he wasn't allowed to go into the
08:02
canteen where people may be discussing
08:03
things informally
08:05
yes the fire room is fine but they can
08:07
starve him out basically eventually
08:10
and that's part of the thing with the
08:12
baristas isn't it um they have a cost of
08:14
coffee and at the time yeah there's a
08:15
coffee shop in gchq as well and they
08:17
have to go undergo regular spy training
08:18
because it's not like a regular
08:20
you can't just it's really got different
08:22
levels of security you need to be able
08:24
to
08:24
write 007 on the side of the cup and say
08:26
is that double 01
08:27
completely different agent
08:30
cover right there they did have a
08:33
building in london which they
08:35
ran for 66 years and never acknowledged
08:38
until they just left they left last year
08:41
and it was apparently intentionally
08:43
boring you know it was designed to look
08:44
just like a really drab office block
08:47
nissan james's park actually is where it
08:48
is anyway they moved out in 2019 and
08:51
then they said haha with gchq all along
08:53
but the bbc the bbc sent some reporters
08:56
to
08:57
you know ask people in the area what do
08:58
you think that building was and they
08:59
said oh it's the spies isn't it
09:01
mi6 secret service i think they're all
09:03
spies anyway
09:05
every day they were going with their
09:06
trench coats on and their
09:09
magnifying glass you're having
09:12
you're having your book launched yeah in
09:14
a spider in the original gchq building
09:17
yeah so i've been when i go for a walk
09:19
on my lunch break i walk past this
09:20
building and you sort of look around at
09:22
the plaques and
09:22
looking for facts and there was a slack
09:24
on the wall that said it was the
09:25
original home of gchq they only unveiled
09:27
the plaque i think last year the
09:28
queen came to unveil it for the
09:30
centenary and here's the best bit there
09:31
are hidden messages on the plaque
09:32
because it's the gchq
09:37
i don't know oh they've just told you
09:39
there's a hidden message but can we
09:40
can we go and find i need to go and find
09:41
it i i actually don't know what it is
09:43
i've been walking past that plaque many
09:44
times i never thought to look for a code
09:46
and now i'm trying to go at lunchtime
09:47
yeah i think we should i love the fact
09:48
that you say you wander around looking
09:50
at plaques looking for ui facts we're
09:51
never
09:52
off the clock here let's have a nice
09:54
lunch break clear my head
09:57
uh we're gonna have to move on in a sec
09:58
to our next fact um just about the
10:00
actual recruitment process
10:02
and what it takes it's quite fun to read
10:03
about so the initial interview that you
10:05
get for gchq is
10:07
designed to test your knowledge of
10:08
technical subjects such as how a
10:09
smartphone works
10:10
so i wouldn't pass that phase uh but
10:12
many do and then you get this
10:14
interrogation about your private life
10:16
and often you're just out of university
10:18
and they interrogate you basically about
10:19
your sexual history
10:21
and so one of the girls who joined i
10:23
think she was 22 at the time
10:24
she said the vetting officer knew more
10:26
about me than anyone else alive
10:28
and you know you have to discuss
10:29
everyone you've ever shared with them
10:31
and
10:31
all of your friends and family you get
10:33
drug tested so you get a bit of hair
10:35
clipped off this seems like a real
10:37
oversight for instance one person got
10:39
this done went to the hairdresser the
10:40
next week and the hairdresser was like
10:41
oh my god you've got this random bald
10:43
patch on the back of your head and then
10:45
you've got to come up with a cover story
10:46
oh yeah just trying it out oh that's
10:48
probably your first test
10:49
as a spy that's another reason why james
10:52
bond probably wouldn't get in as a spy
10:54
actually because the interview process
10:55
to discuss
10:56
everyone he'd ever slept with so long
10:58
it's
11:02
um i read a piece of somebody who does
11:03
recruitment for mi5 just known as joe
11:05
and they basically explained that some
11:07
candidates who come have got some
11:08
strange ideas for what actually the job
11:10
involves
11:10
with james bond i guess people i'm
11:12
really surprised that's not what the job
11:13
is like
11:14
and some of the questions joe was asked
11:15
included do i have to wear my own
11:17
clothes to work
11:18
should i wear a disguise instead and do
11:21
i need to dump my partner to work here
11:22
because if i do i will
11:28
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:30
that
11:31
is andy my fact is that people drive
11:34
more carefully if they have a pavlova in
11:36
the car than their own child
11:40
so this is an experiment that was done
11:42
it was a survey done slightly as a pr
11:44
stunt by
11:44
an insurance firm in australia they
11:46
asked drivers about their behavior first
11:48
of all they just said
11:50
what makes you drive more carefully
11:51
would you drive more carefully if your
11:52
child was in the car
11:53
half of all parents surveyed said yes
11:55
absolutely only 12 percent of those
11:57
people said there would be more cautious
11:58
if they were driving a pavlova around
12:00
pavlova a meringue and cream based
12:03
pudding yeah
12:04
okay good and a child is like a smaller
12:06
version of a person
12:07
anyway they tested it with a small
12:09
sample admittedly only 20 drivers but
12:11
over an eight day period they were asked
12:12
to drive alone
12:13
with a child and with pavlova
12:17
95 of them 19 out of 20 drove more
12:19
carefully with a pavlova on board which
12:21
was
12:22
way more than were more careful with
12:24
their children and what did the school
12:25
say when they dropped off a pavlova at
12:27
school
12:29
nobody noticed the difference it's very
12:30
impressive i think it makes sense
12:32
makes perfect sense dan you're the only
12:34
one who's got a child yeah slightly
12:35
worried
12:36
that's true why do you think it makes
12:37
sense sorry i think you have to explain
12:39
that well
12:39
if you've had anything in the back of a
12:41
car that is of a sensitive nature
12:43
of course you're going to take corners
12:45
less sharply of course
12:47
of course babies are very resilient well
12:49
you can't put a seat belt around a pablo
12:52
you could probably get it some sort of
12:53
transportation device like on those
12:55
cupcake carriers like with a belt
12:57
yes yeah that's true so maybe maybe this
13:00
solves all the driving issues that we
13:01
have in the world
13:02
just anyone who's a bit of a dangerous
13:04
driver papa pavlova in the back and
13:06
we're just going to solve everything i
13:08
am looking at more australian
13:10
studies about drivers and one was about
13:12
how people when they maybe when they
13:13
first get their license they're very
13:14
cautious very careful and as we get we
13:16
drive them for longer some people are
13:17
more
13:17
distracted we sort of start some people
13:19
some people start to see it as time
13:21
taken out of their day so what they did
13:22
was they parked by a road and they took
13:24
photos of anyone they saw doing
13:26
un correct procedure and pictures they
13:28
got included people eating cereal
13:30
at the wheel brushing their hair and
13:32
reading books
13:33
while driving around australia because
13:36
it is
13:36
speed reading i mean
13:39
so do you guys know there's no safety
13:41
difference between using a phone while
13:43
you're driving a handheld phone and a
13:45
hands-free phone
13:46
really yeah so i actually learned this i
13:48
went to a magic show at the welcome
13:49
center and it was about um
13:52
i have i have fact checked this
13:54
afterwards it was about
13:55
the science of misdirection and the fact
13:57
that we don't notice things
13:58
and the fact that we can be so easily
14:00
distracted and study after study has
14:02
found that if you're on a phone you're
14:03
four times more likely to be involved in
14:05
an accident
14:06
completely regardless of whether it's
14:07
handheld or hands-free
14:09
and it's just because it's the
14:10
concentration that's distracted not your
14:13
actual hand
14:14
and so it found that for instance
14:15
specifically if you're on the phone and
14:16
someone on the phone says
14:17
oh do you remember where you put the
14:19
bananas or whatever
14:20
yeah and you have to kind of be yeah
14:22
we're going to need to slice them up for
14:23
the pepperoni
14:25
yeah and then you're at your head's in
14:26
your kitchen rather than your hair
14:28
in your kitchen not literally but
14:31
metaphorically
14:32
and that apparently reduces your field
14:34
of vision to about a quarter you'll feel
14:35
a vision that you can concentrate on to
14:36
about a quarter
14:37
if you imagine that other place i was
14:39
looking into a few road safety things as
14:41
well so
14:42
this was for pedestrians rather than for
14:44
how you drive safely
14:46
um there was one idea that was put
14:48
forward uh back in the 1930s
14:50
which didn't unfortunately happen but i
14:52
love the idea of it
14:54
so imagine you're hit by a car and the
14:56
car does a hit and run
14:57
disappears on you cars and we're going
14:59
to be designed
15:00
with this little disc that shoots out of
15:02
the car when a hit and run happens
15:04
so the person if they were so knocked
15:06
out they couldn't see the license plate
15:08
or anything
15:09
grabs the disc which has the details of
15:10
the owner of the car
15:13
that's a great idea yeah and they never
15:15
implemented it i don't know why possibly
15:16
maybe the disc might have
15:18
you know decapitated someone as a shot
15:20
out of the car
15:22
just involuntary business card dispersal
15:24
basically
15:27
i like this um weird kind of gadget that
15:29
was added to
15:30
volvos actually in 2007 it was a car
15:33
safety thing
15:33
it was a smart key it was a remote smart
15:35
key which we have now so you can open
15:37
your car from 100 yards away whatever
15:39
and it contained a highly sensitive
15:41
heartbeat sensor
15:42
uh it advertised itself as a world first
15:44
and that meant that when you went to
15:45
unlock your car
15:46
it told you if there was somebody hiding
15:48
in it hiding
15:49
it yeah that's right it flashed so if
15:52
you're 50 yards of your car you unlocked
15:53
it it would give you a little flash to
15:54
say
15:55
there's a person in there get your
15:57
weapons out would it distinguish like
15:59
human from like vole no it's specified
16:01
it will tell if there's a human or an
16:03
animal so you wouldn't know if it was
16:04
just a mouse
16:05
scuttling around or a person hiding in
16:08
your boots yeah
16:09
better safe than sorry though but that's
16:10
never a thing that i've ever
16:12
thought to check well it's a good way of
16:14
making you all extremely paranoid now
16:16
when you get into your cars but you know
16:18
there's always that thing where
16:19
you're driving where you have this panic
16:20
you're going to look in the rear view
16:22
mirror and you'll see someone rising up
16:24
behind you i've never that's the movie
16:26
right never had that anna do you get
16:27
that yeah of course every time you're
16:29
driving on your own at night
16:30
wha no someone on top of the car it's
16:32
tapping it's the one you've got to watch
16:34
for
16:34
oh wow that was a ghost story when i was
16:36
a kid okay
16:37
do you have a big rug on your back seat
16:39
which could cover
16:41
the rug well i think we've mentioned
16:44
this but when the berlin wall
16:46
um when people were trying to get across
16:48
there was that couple where
16:49
the lady who shouldn't have gone across
16:52
was sewn into the seat
16:53
of the car oh yeah so that's another
16:56
spot you've got to worry about
16:57
yeah check inside the scene check inside
16:59
check inside your seats check underneath
17:00
the big rug
17:01
if you didn't spot him on the roof
17:03
before you got in that's your own
17:05
problem
17:05
[Laughter]
17:08
um this this uh study that you were
17:10
mentioning andy uh this was done in
17:12
australia right yeah yeah um
17:14
and so australian's very proud of
17:16
pavlova because we invented
17:18
it been a lot of dispute with the new
17:20
zealanders
17:21
about who invented it and then i learned
17:23
neither of us did turns out it's
17:25
german is the latest theory i love that
17:28
those theories of pavlova
17:29
origin nice but yeah so what when's the
17:32
german origin it's named after anna
17:34
pavlov the ballerina
17:36
because she was touring in australia and
17:38
new zealand at the same time in the late
17:40
20s
17:40
so that's why both countries think they
17:42
invented it but really there have been
17:44
pavlova
17:45
style recipes you know you need meringue
17:47
and cream and fruit
17:49
since the 18th century in germany so one
17:51
of them was called
17:52
schaum taut or foam cake and another one
17:55
was called spanish
17:56
wind tort so they had the thing they
17:59
just didn't
18:00
call it pavlova i don't know if i'd put
18:01
the word wind in a recipe now
18:04
just unless it was sort of a bean recipe
18:06
or something yeah she apparently anna
18:08
pavlova
18:09
had more food named after her the only
18:11
one that i could find was frog legs ala
18:13
pavlova is it because she was a
18:15
ballerina yeah frogs had legs
18:17
yeah yeah i was famous for having good
18:18
legs famously no other sports people
18:21
you know she so she was an excellent
18:23
ballerina not just a ballerina
18:25
so good and so popular that when she
18:28
died in 1931 she died of pneumonia
18:30
and in fact when she died she was
18:32
diagnosed with pneumonia told she'd have
18:34
to have an operation
18:35
that would mean she could never dance
18:37
again and she said no i'd rather be dead
18:39
so she died in 1931 of pneumonia and the
18:42
next show that she was scheduled to do
18:43
the audience came and they put a
18:45
spotlight on an empty stage and the
18:46
spotlight followed around exactly where
18:48
she would have been and they just
18:49
watched that instead
18:50
isn't that cool that's cool not a good
18:52
excuse to die though the whole dancing
18:54
thing i would say
18:55
well if it's the one thing you love if
18:57
if i came back home and
18:58
they were like dan you got pneumonia
19:00
we'll give you an operation that means
19:01
you can't podcast anymore
19:03
i think vanilla would have an issue if i
19:05
said actually send me to the grave
19:08
i'd love you for you to have that
19:09
operation personally for myself
19:12
[Music]
19:14
okay it is time for fact number three
19:16
and that is my fact
19:17
my fact this week is that ringo starr's
19:20
grandmother
19:20
performed exorcisms on him to cure him
19:23
from being
19:24
left-handed wow was she reported to
19:26
child services or was that that was
19:28
before so difficult
19:29
different time did it work it did yeah
19:32
oh yeah well for many years it did
19:35
because i thought that he said in one
19:37
interview that he plays with a
19:38
right-handed drum kit but he sort of
19:39
leads with his left hand yeah he does
19:41
most other things left-handed
19:42
yeah sounds like it partially works
19:44
maybe by exorcism she actually just
19:46
bought him a right-handed drum kit
19:47
i think that's what happens will be
19:49
easier for you why was she going around
19:50
doing exorcisms so ringo starr's
19:52
grandmother
19:53
annie bauer uh she was born in 1889 she
19:56
was known in liverpool as the voodoo
19:58
queen of liverpool
19:59
uh certainly within the family that's
20:00
what she was famous for and she was sort
20:02
of known as a sort of 20th century witch
20:04
she used to concoct her own remedies
20:06
uh she would make potions um when she
20:09
was sort of looking after sick people
20:11
she used to invoke satan she used to try
20:13
and expel satan from people
20:15
so to bring him out doing exorcisms on
20:18
various people
20:19
and so when she saw that her grandson
20:21
was left-handed she thought that's the
20:22
devil left-handedness is associated with
20:24
that i'm going to get rid of him and she
20:26
spent years get rid of him
20:28
the devil oh sorry sorry and so
20:31
she spent ages trying to exercise it out
20:34
of him
20:35
but what's what's truly interesting
20:36
about this is that ringo says it's for
20:38
this reason that he developed what
20:40
became the unique drumming style that he
20:42
had because he drums on a right-handed
20:44
drum kit but as a left-hander
20:46
it takes him just a split second more
20:48
like a tiny microsecond more to get to
20:50
that bit of the drum
20:51
and that gives him a sort of lazy
20:53
drumming style that's slightly off time
20:55
which gives it a swing so the negative
20:57
interpretation is that had he not been
20:58
exercised as a child he might have been
21:00
a better drummer
21:01
no because he's an incredible person a
21:04
less
21:05
unique drummer he's an incredible
21:07
drummer
21:08
yeah yeah we should talk a bit about the
21:10
book you got this from dan because this
21:11
is from a book called is it tune in
21:13
yeah it's the biography of the beatles
21:15
by mark lewison
21:16
this is an amazing book because it's
21:18
nearly a thousand pages long
21:20
and it ends in 1962. yeah it ends as
21:23
they're releasing their first single
21:24
it is it's good to have that warning
21:26
that it ends after a thousand pages just
21:28
as they start i think before you embark
21:31
on the book it's like that
21:32
when you're reading a novel and like
21:33
it's sort of like really crunchy and you
21:34
realize you're really near the end and
21:35
you're like they can't wrap this all up
21:37
and then you're
21:37
like no 10 pages till the end what
21:40
they're going to cover their whole
21:41
career
21:41
and then they did quite well end i like
21:45
the fact that he found uh the first fan
21:47
of the beatles tracked her down
21:48
she was an irish woman called pat morin
21:50
who lived in liverpool
21:52
and there's another churchy devil
21:55
connection here because her father sent
21:57
her to confession
21:58
for talking about the beatles too much
22:01
cool apparently classified as a sin
22:03
god you're clutching at straws if that's
22:04
your sin you've got to start rebelling
22:06
more
22:07
well they were they were all because the
22:09
beatles had a very odd effect
22:10
on girls in that period in the 1960s
22:14
there was a book that came out about
22:15
them that said
22:16
john lennon was told girls in the
22:18
audience were actively touching
22:19
themselves
22:20
in the audience and orgasming while they
22:22
were playing on stage they had this kind
22:24
of crazy and that was the 1960s that's
22:26
a very different world too it was a
22:28
liberated time everyone was on ask
22:30
but they were the people liberating by
22:32
causing a lot of public masturbation
22:34
um so on on the way people behaved
22:36
around the beatles they had to be quite
22:37
heavy security for them all the time and
22:39
in fact
22:40
they changed the way that the japanese
22:42
police operate
22:43
so the japanese police today wear white
22:46
gloves so if you ever go to japan you
22:47
see them please they wear white gloves
22:48
and a lot of people have wondered
22:50
why it's a michael jackson tribute isn't
22:51
it and a lot of people think it's
22:53
michael jackson
22:55
but actually a huge misconception it's
22:58
actually because the beatles went there
22:59
in 1966
23:00
and the police chief who was responsible
23:03
for the police force there
23:04
said that there had to be a layer of
23:06
propriety added between the police and
23:08
the women
23:08
they were inevitably going to be
23:10
touching as they dragged them away
23:11
kicking and screaming
23:12
from the beatles and so he said they all
23:14
had to wear these white gloves
23:16
and it was he was interviewed in 2010
23:18
and he confirmed that
23:19
and it was to reinforce this thing
23:21
called reggie tadashisha which is sort
23:23
of
23:23
a notion of propriety but that's
23:25
interesting because i think because the
23:26
japan subway is
23:26
famously very very very very busy and
23:29
they have people whose job it is to push
23:30
people
23:31
into the carriages to cram more people
23:32
in and i'm pretty sure they wear white
23:34
gloves so maybe it's to make it a bit
23:35
more polite rather than shoving you it's
23:36
like i'm
23:37
officially shoving you because that move
23:39
is where they get the
23:41
song in fact that's where they got the
23:42
inspiration for their song all you need
23:43
is glove
23:44
hmm it's very strong love me too
23:49
a lot of their songs have the word love
23:50
in them let's go through them
23:54
so the hamburg days were extraordinary
23:55
this is the two years before they
23:57
basically got into the charts in the
23:58
very start of the 60s
24:00
and they lived in hamburg basically in
24:02
this storage room behind
24:04
the stage where they performed in this
24:05
seedy bar
24:07
and they sort of lived on fold-out beds
24:09
and they had to shower in the public
24:10
bathrooms in the bar
24:12
and that's where they actually got
24:13
spotted by george martin i think who
24:15
basically
24:15
sort of made the beatles but he thought
24:17
they were kind of crap in a lot of ways
24:19
so he thought they couldn't write songs
24:21
they were really keen to write their own
24:22
songs and i think he wanted them to
24:24
release a cover
24:25
as their first kind of number one yeah
24:27
what he intended and he said
24:29
their songwriting was crap the first
24:31
records we issued were love me do
24:33
and p.s i love you which are not exactly
24:35
cole porter are they
24:36
which actually if you listen it is fair
24:38
enough but yeah he thought they were
24:39
crap
24:40
when they were in hamburg they obviously
24:43
not making very much money at all i
24:44
think they got two pounds 50 per show
24:46
and they had to do four shows on a
24:48
weeknight five on a saturday and six on
24:51
a sunday it's like a panto schedule yeah
24:53
it really is um and then they got an
24:55
offer from a rival club
24:56
and so the boss of the first club
24:58
they've been working at reported george
24:59
harrison to the police and got him
25:01
deported
25:02
and then the same manager really headed
25:04
in for them he got mccartney
25:06
i can't believe this he got mccartney
25:07
and pete best arrested and deported for
25:10
setting fire to a condom
25:14
i don't understand why surely it doesn't
25:16
take two people to set fire to a con i
25:18
want to hold the condom one to light the
25:19
match yeah
25:20
i tried riding a match with one hand
25:21
[Laughter]
25:23
we should say we're talking about the
25:24
hamburg days but ringo wasn't there for
25:26
the hamburg days so they were a five-man
25:28
operation uh many people say the
25:30
superior version
25:31
and so that was pete best and stuart
25:34
zarkliff
25:35
yeah um just on the fact pete best left
25:37
the beatles and he didn't go on to
25:39
anything major so ringo starr as well as
25:42
his the beatles his other big thing was
25:44
he was the voice of thomas the tanker
25:45
yeah
25:46
series one um and i found another sort
25:48
of rock connection of someone who
25:50
left a band just before it got big and
25:53
it relates to thomas the tank engine
25:54
timothy
25:55
steffel was the lead singer of a band
25:57
called smile and then he left
25:59
because he thought the band was going
26:00
nowhere so the guitarist and the drummer
26:03
brought in a new singer called freddie
26:04
mercury and that band
26:06
was queen obviously and so smile was
26:09
roger taylor brian may and
26:11
timothy steffel steffel left but he
26:13
found a second career as a model maker
26:15
for all the trains on thomas the tank
26:18
oh my god ringo starr
26:21
that is incredible because the fat
26:24
controller
26:24
in thomas attack engine was played by
26:26
bill wyman after he left the rolling
26:28
stones
26:31
done for god sorry i was getting so
26:34
excited
26:35
to come in three yeah exactly well there
26:38
probably is one more rock connection
26:39
with thomas the tank that we are
26:40
aware of listeners find it uh just one
26:43
another thing about ringo's life post
26:45
beatles
26:45
uh possibly the highlight of his career
26:47
was when he did a pizza advert in 1995
26:50
this was a seminal moment because it was
26:51
when the stuffed crust
26:53
of pizza hut fame came into being um and
26:56
it was this great advert where he
26:57
sort of throughout the ad he's
26:58
pretending he's getting the band back
27:00
together and it's like oh i've got to
27:01
convince them oh they'll never do it
27:03
come on you should watch the adventure
27:05
i mean lennon had been dead for 14 years
27:07
at this point yeah it was a sick advert
27:09
okay
27:12
so he makes it seem like he's going to
27:13
resurrect john lennon's dead body and he
27:16
needed his grandmother for that
27:20
so he's in this advert saying i'll get
27:21
the band back together until it becomes
27:23
clear at the end what he's actually
27:24
saying is
27:25
i'm gonna convince them all to eat pizza
27:28
crust first and then there's this really
27:30
awkward moment where in the final scene
27:32
his three apparent bandmates come on and
27:34
start eating at crust first
27:35
anyway it's a humorous advert the
27:37
amusing thing is he's never eaten a
27:38
pizza in his life if you watch that
27:40
advert as it goes towards his mouth the
27:42
advert ends because he's allergic to all
27:44
the ingredients of pizza
27:45
all the ingredients every ingredient
27:47
yeah he's allergic to onions garlic
27:49
spices he's allergic to all this stuff
27:50
never had a pizza never had a curry we
27:53
need to move on
27:54
um i've got can i just mention one last
27:55
thing and then we'll move on and so pete
27:57
best the original drummer he was kicked
27:59
out
28:00
which was devastating for him but he
28:01
continued to be a musician after he got
28:03
over a bit of a depressive stage
28:04
um and he went on to release an album
28:06
called best of the beatles
28:08
um which a lot of people accidentally
28:10
bought by mistake
28:12
thinking it was a compilation of their
28:13
greatest hits best of not the
28:21
okay it is time for our final fact of
28:23
the show and that
28:24
is cecinski my fact this week is that
28:27
baby albatrosses can take up to six days
28:30
to peck their way out of their eggs
28:32
[Laughter]
28:34
imagine being trapped somewhere in the
28:36
dark six days
28:37
it's like the great escape and this is
28:39
called pipping so what happens is
28:40
they've got the egg tooth which a lot of
28:42
birds have which is a sort of hard
28:43
projection
28:44
on their bills and they peck away at the
28:46
shell from the inside
28:48
and on average albatross chicks take
28:50
about 3.5 days to emerge but some of
28:52
them
28:52
for weaker ones the thicker shelled ones
28:54
they take up to a week
28:55
to get to make their way out yeah yeah
28:57
and i think part of them will emerge and
28:59
they can sort of be fed so you do see
29:01
eggs with sort of a head sticking out
29:03
wow it's like you've got another couple
29:04
of days left mate but if you're going to
29:06
help them by feeding them could you not
29:07
help them open their egg yeah gotta let
29:09
kids
29:10
learn for themselves your albatrosses
29:12
are stuck
29:14
okay time to fledge i'm not ready to
29:15
float
29:17
they sometimes lose their eggs
29:18
albatrosses so most of them keep them in
29:21
a nest
29:22
yeah and we should say there are 20
29:23
species of albatross which i don't know
29:25
but some of them waved albatrosses are
29:27
quite mobile and they will move their
29:28
egg around their territory with them as
29:30
they go
29:31
and frequently they just lose them so 80
29:34
of the eggs don't hatch or because they
29:35
get lost
29:36
really yeah are they always getting
29:37
called some sort of restaurant saying
29:39
excuse me
29:40
i think you've left your egg under
29:41
around you
29:43
but albatrosses are generally apart from
29:45
the ones who lose their eggs quite good
29:46
parents so albus ross is
29:47
couple up and they say these pairs are
29:49
up to 50 years but they're not
29:51
completely monogamous
29:52
so they did a study of 75 different
29:54
albatrosses and 10 of them had different
29:56
fathers to the albatross raising them
29:59
but
30:00
both the male and the female albatrosses
30:02
will go and be with other albatrosses
30:03
but they'll always come back to their
30:05
home albatross yeah well but so they
30:08
are a hundred percent faithful as
30:12
as a let's say as a married couple
30:15
let's say in quotations they they pair
30:17
for life but if this is your view of
30:19
faithfulness as a married man
30:20
and then i tried to think of vanilla's
30:22
listening right now no no what i uh what
30:24
i'd read was there was a book that came
30:25
out called the thing with feathers by
30:27
noah striker and noah striker
30:29
did basically a table of bird divorce
30:32
rates for this book he looked at
30:34
100 or so different species of birds and
30:36
he built the divorce rates and
30:38
at the top of the most uh faithful in
30:41
terms of remaining with a single partner
30:43
for their whole life
30:44
was the albatross and flamingos uh were
30:47
right at the bottom they have a 99
30:49
divorce rate
30:50
wow yeah but basically what we're saying
30:52
is albatrosses have open marriages
30:54
yeah they have on both sides yeah okay
30:56
do you know why albatrosses
30:58
tend not to go to divorce lawyers
31:00
because the bill too big the bills are
31:02
huge
31:03
when one of us can immediately guess the
31:05
punchline to your joker
31:06
is worth reconsidering there's quite an
31:09
interesting thing actually about these
31:10
sort of open relationships and this is
31:12
related to the
31:13
lacin albatross which lives around the
31:15
hawaiian islands they have this weird
31:17
gender imbalance 59
31:18
of them are female on there and that's
31:20
just because a lot of females
31:21
immigrated there so they often separate
31:23
in their flying season
31:25
and this means that 31 of lace and
31:28
albatross pairs are
31:29
female on female they raise chicks
31:32
together so the males will
31:33
inseminate a series of females and can
31:35
only raise one egg
31:36
at a time and so the other women who've
31:39
been abandoned by their man
31:40
find another lady and they raise the egg
31:43
together and they will stay together for
31:44
a lifetime
31:45
just like just like male female pairs
31:47
and they're pretty successful raising
31:48
the chicks
31:49
the license albatross is really
31:50
interesting they do
31:52
their courting via a dance that they
31:55
have which is an established dance
31:57
what they do is when they're about three
31:59
years of age
32:01
they go back to their birth place and
32:03
they all meet there
32:05
and they learn the dance as a group and
32:07
then eventually they
32:08
they find their partner when they're
32:09
ready to course
32:11
it's very intricate yeah it does take
32:13
years of practice so
32:14
actually we've got these these people
32:16
who listen to our show who are so great
32:18
called michelle
32:18
and chris and they work with albatrosses
32:21
out on gough island these really
32:23
endangered albatrosses where's gulf
32:24
island sorry gulf islanders in the south
32:26
atlantic
32:27
so yeah they work with them and anyway
32:28
one of them wrote to me and said the
32:29
display
32:30
is it's like head bobbing it's wings
32:33
spreading they make these bubbling
32:34
sounds in their throats
32:36
and yeah they practice for years and
32:37
years before they're ready imagine if
32:39
you're flirting you have to practice
32:40
flirting for
32:41
i mean i did and for years and years
32:45
yeah i was interested so this is ringing
32:47
a lot it might be an albatross
32:49
they do have kind of singles bars where
32:51
they go some
32:52
species do well yeah they have things
32:55
called gams so this is for southern
32:56
bullers albatrosses
32:58
when they're aged about eight years old
32:59
the males all go ashore
33:01
and they make a nest and then the
33:03
females visit and they have a look
33:05
around and they think
33:06
you know whether they like it or not but
33:08
they only form a pair in their fourth
33:10
year
33:10
onshore they've already been through
33:11
three years of prospecting each other
33:14
and checking each other out it's like
33:16
university it's exactly like university
33:18
pair up at the end yeah and four years
33:20
so we know it's a scottish or american
33:23
right absolutely i have so my favorite
33:25
albatross is
33:26
have you heard of albert the lonely
33:27
scottish albatross
33:29
albert very sadly was blown off course
33:31
um in the south atlantic in 1967 and
33:33
rocked up in scotland where he's been
33:34
living as a bachelor ever since
33:36
has not he's not yet found a mate can't
33:39
he pair up with a puffin or something
33:41
size difference and these things don't
33:43
get in the way of true love
33:45
yeah so he's living between goodness
33:47
yeah he lives between the outer hebrides
33:48
and shetland
33:49
are there people around where he is or
33:51
is he just monitored
33:52
he's been seen by bird watchers but i
33:54
think he's looking for albatrosses
33:58
as a bird watcher if you're spending
34:00
your whole life around blue tits and
34:01
sparrows that is exciting when a
34:03
giant albatross
34:04
appears on their eyes because they are
34:06
massive they've got i think their
34:08
wingspan
34:08
the wandering albatross wingspan is 3.5
34:10
meters is it 3.5 minutes ridiculously
34:13
huge
34:13
um anyway i just want to talk about the
34:15
tristan albatross which is the second
34:17
biggest albatross so people thought it
34:18
was
34:19
in the same species as the wandering and
34:21
then it split away
34:23
in 1998. anyway these are the
34:25
albatrosses that
34:26
our friends and podcast listeners
34:28
michelle and chris
34:29
look after on gough island because the
34:31
most amazing thing has been happening to
34:33
them
34:34
so they're obviously huge but they don't
34:36
have any natural predators because
34:37
they're alone on this island
34:39
and so they have no defense mechanisms
34:40
so invasive mice
34:42
arrived on the island a few decades ago
34:45
and they've just been eating them
34:47
so no these it's unbelievable so these
34:50
tiny little mice you'll get a 20 gram
34:52
mouse and it will just eat away at 10
34:54
kilogram albatross chick
34:56
or sometimes i'll even eat the adult so
34:58
that adults will stay with the chicks
34:59
and let themselves be eaten by mice
35:01
because they're so afraid to leave
35:02
wow they're chick it's really really sad
35:05
and so they become critically endangered
35:07
because of this
35:07
but they must have they sit what do you
35:09
mean they have no diff they can move
35:11
they sit there they lost the ability to
35:13
think if i smack it with my giant wing
35:15
it will
35:16
fling off they don't have the ability to
35:18
think that
35:19
that is incredible so what is happening
35:21
to so what's happening is uh this team
35:23
of people have gone out there and so
35:24
these three guys who have whom michelle
35:26
and christopher are now trying to save
35:28
the albatrosses essentially by killing
35:30
all the mice um and we're getting them
35:31
back guys
35:32
uh but it's yeah it's a good cause there
35:34
i think there are 1500 to 2400 pairs
35:37
left
35:37
at the moment and it's quite funny when
35:39
you look them up on wikipedia it said
35:41
because albatrosses fly hundreds of
35:43
thousands of miles
35:44
so far but they only breed in this tiny
35:46
island so they have an occurrence range
35:49
of 5.4 million
35:51
square miles and a breeding range of 31
35:53
square miles
35:54
wow so flipped on a different uh
35:58
way of talking about it there's another
35:59
podcast out there talking about
36:01
two mice murderers on island who moves
36:04
in they've got they live on this island
36:06
they just murder mice all day
36:08
i mean the mics are impressive they're
36:09
like super mice so to be fair they are i
36:12
think they're the biggest mice in the
36:13
world
36:13
wow in fact uh because they've got
36:15
island gigantism you know where you've
36:17
got
36:17
nothing threatening you you're the only
36:19
ones there so they're huge if you're on
36:20
the mountain side they're doing bloody
36:22
well
36:22
sounds like your two friends are very
36:24
small
36:27
yeah they've got island dwarfism these
36:29
two humans they've been there too long
36:31
have you guys heard of wisdom wisdom yes
36:33
i believe i embody it
36:34
well i'm not sure so wisdom is a
36:38
laser albatross like the ones we were
36:39
talking about earlier so she's the
36:41
oldest albatross in the world she was
36:42
first ringed in 1956
36:45
she's still alive so she's at least 64
36:47
years old
36:48
and in fact we know she's a bit older
36:50
because when she was ringed the
36:51
scientist who ringed her
36:52
said well she's about five years old
36:53
okay she was still alive in 2018
36:56
and this is the really cool thing the
36:57
biologist who first found her in 1956
37:00
and ranked her was
37:01
an ornithologist called chandler robbins
37:03
okay so he ringed her went away then
37:05
in 2002 46 years later he tries to ring
37:09
another albatross
37:10
and says oh this is already ringed and
37:12
it's
37:13
the bird i ringed 46 years ago that is a
37:15
bit annoying though isn't it if you're
37:17
hoping to get to the second alberta
37:20
it wasn't his second album his whole
37:22
life for the same albus
37:24
it's incredible he he is an amazing
37:26
figure in terms of ornithology and bird
37:28
watching he died in 2017 1898
37:31
and that's partly you know albatrosses
37:32
often outlived the researchers working
37:34
on them incredible
37:36
do they do they live do they have
37:37
albatross years like you know how dog
37:39
years
37:40
different to human urine i think i just
37:41
live a really long time so
37:43
they're like they're in conjunct their
37:44
years all year well we don't
37:46
we don't know because people dog uses
37:48
aren't really a thing except for the
37:49
fact that dogs are our pets and so we
37:51
speculate about that kind of
37:52
whereas people
37:53
aren't official many pet albums
37:54
officials dog is not unofficial what do
37:56
you think dog
37:57
years means they don't they don't know
37:58
their own birthdays no it's all about
38:00
celebrations
38:01
it's about time passage and lifespan
38:03
right
38:04
yes that's true so their lifespan is
38:06
about 60.
38:07
yeah in albatross years oh my god
38:10
uh we're gonna have to wrap up in a
38:11
second just one more thing um
38:13
albatrosses when western explorers first
38:15
discovered them they thought they were
38:17
sheep no
38:18
flying sheep that's right big old flying
38:20
sheep really
38:21
well this is according to these
38:23
researchers that were in touch with but
38:24
apparently the explorer marianne de
38:26
fresno when
38:27
when he visited in 1772 he visited
38:29
prince edward island
38:31
and he just saw these huge white figures
38:33
on wandering around the grass and said
38:34
well there's a whole bunch of sheep here
38:36
right so did you get really close up to
38:38
them he did i think the man's an idiot
38:41
he was stroking he was going this wool
38:43
is not the same as ours
38:45
um they measure their speed with their
38:46
nostrils they have these tubes inside
38:48
their nose
38:49
and it's exactly the same as how planes
38:51
measure their speed so planes have
38:52
things called pitot tubes which measure
38:54
airflow and pressure at the end of that
38:56
tube and that tells you how fast the
38:57
plane is moving wow and albatrosses can
38:59
do the same thing wow yeah wonder why
39:01
they need to know their speed do you
39:02
think they get back i can go
39:03
crack 70. personal best i know mate
39:06
there's a bill here for speeding
39:09
and it's a huge bill
39:17
okay that is it that is all of our facts
39:19
thank you so much for listening if you'd
39:21

[Music]
00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:18
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:20
qi offices in covered garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:25
here with anna chazitsky andrew hunter
00:27
murray and james harkin
00:28
and once again we have gathered around
00:30
the microphones with our four favorite
00:31
facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order here we go
00:37
starting with you andy my fact is that
00:40
there is a 16th century exercise manual
00:42
which recommends exercises
00:44
including running tennis and loud
00:46
reading
00:47
so two of those sounded quite sensible
00:49
running and loud reading absolutely
00:51
it's about tennis it's not good for you
00:54
no
00:54
so this uh was actually posted on
00:57
twitter
00:58
by uh colleague justin pollard who was a
01:00
historian
01:01
and um it was an article uh which was
01:03
based on something found by joan
01:05
fitzpatrick who was reading
01:06
a dietary by sir thomas elliott
01:10
it does sound like someone with a speech
01:11
impediment saying the word diary there
01:13
but
01:13
yeah it's a diet it is a dietary and um
01:17
it's called the castle of health so it's
01:19
about all these different ways that you
01:21
can gain
01:22
health in your life and there is a
01:24
category of exercise called
01:26
strong or violent exercise where he
01:28
recommends all these things you can do
01:29
like digging heavy soil or doing
01:32
resistance training which is
01:34
even i don't know if he invented this
01:36
but basically you have to lift up your
01:37
arms to the sides
01:39
um while your friend is trying to hold
01:41
them in place
01:43
i don't think he invented most of it
01:44
because it was all from
01:46
galen wasn't it and from the classical
01:48
people he was kind of translating what
01:50
the classics
01:51
had said there was another guy called um
01:53
lineker
01:54
not gary lineker i don't think because
01:57
it's spelled different
01:58
um but he was doing the same thing at
01:59
the same time but he was translating
02:01
galen from greek to latin
02:02
because he wanted doctors to be able to
02:05
know this stuff but he didn't want
02:06
normal people to be able to tell what
02:08
was wrong with them
02:09
whereas elliot thought no everyone
02:11
should be able to know what's wrong with
02:13
them
02:13
it's basically the googling what's wrong
02:14
with you of this day
02:16
yeah i think we like elliott right yeah
02:18
really sure he did
02:20
well one of the just to finish off the
02:21
original fact one of the things he
02:22
recommended was loud reading which
02:24
allegedly would blast away
02:26
excess humors you could blow into wind
02:28
instruments as well if you wanted to
02:30
help your intestines work better
02:31
yeah yes also singing or crying
02:35
crying and i did look into crying to see
02:39
if it's good for you
02:40
and according to this is admittedly from
02:43
kwara so i'm not sure how true it is but
02:45
it was sauced
02:46
they said if you cry for an hour then
02:48
you would use up 78 calories
02:50
and i worked out that's about the same
02:52
as 40 grams of ice cream
02:54
so if you cry for an hour and eat 40
02:56
grams of ice cream
02:57
you're on a level no one's ever cried
03:00
for an hour and eating that little ice
03:01
cream
03:03
can i just quickly say one of the things
03:04
he recommended in this text because
03:06
we were saying that he's recommending
03:08
things in english to make them clear for
03:09
normal people
03:10
yeah i just want to read a sentence to
03:12
you from the text
03:13
as touching things preceding exercise as
03:16
much as it is to be feared
03:17
least by vehement exercise any of the
03:19
excrements of the belly or bladder
03:21
should hastily be received into the
03:22
habit of the body by the violence of the
03:24
heat kindled by exercise
03:26
also at least something which is whole
03:28
they by heaviness of excrement or
03:30
violent
03:30
so he just goes on and on and on that's
03:33
about
03:34
a third of the way through that sentence
03:35
do you know what that's about i think
03:36
one of the things he's saying is you
03:38
should warm up so you don't
03:39
yourself when you exercise
03:40
yes he is saying that and he also
03:42
because he got this from galen as well
03:43
he's saying that you should always go to
03:45
the toilet just before you exercise
03:47
and the reason is if you don't do that
03:50
then the exercise will kind of drive
03:52
your
03:52
waist deeper and deeper into your body
03:54
and you'll never be able to get rid of
03:55
it oh no
03:57
but the body's not a never-ending pitch
04:00
if you drive your waist further and
04:01
further down it does emerge from the
04:03
other end
04:03
because that's what we know now but no
04:06
did he think he would go into your legs
04:08
i don't think so sure people within you
04:10
yeah
04:12
okay it wasn't like that's why when you
04:13
get old and you've got those swollen
04:14
feet
04:15
yes that's actually is based in some
04:18
truth because
04:19
if you do go for a run you quite often
04:21
get an attack of diarrhea about 40
04:22
minutes in don't you
04:23
okay um
04:26
i don't no i don't either it's a very
04:29
common thing it doesn't affect everyone
04:31
but it affects a large proportion of
04:32
people and
04:33
maybe one quarter of the people in this
04:34
room for instance i guess
04:38
it's a bit like that time you told us
04:39
that when anyone drinks coffee they
04:41
themselves
04:42
again these are all hypothetical they're
04:43
just things that i've read i have read
04:45
up a lot on this sort of thing i guess
04:46
paula ratcliffe but i thought that was a
04:48
fairly solid poo
04:49
oh god from what i read i've never
04:52
i've never run anywhere for longer than
04:54
37 minutes so
04:56
i've actually never had this there you
04:57
go yeah just add an extra three
04:59
james did enough you did a half marathon
05:01
recently i did i ran for a lot longer
05:03
than 37 minutes
05:04
because i didn't run very fast and i
05:06
didn't myself which was the main
05:08
thing i was aiming for
05:09
really made some money for charity
05:11
didn't myself
05:13
a good day all round thomas jefferson
05:15
used to cure his diarrhea by riding
05:16
horseback
05:18
and i believe without a saddle and that
05:20
was yeah he claimed that cured his
05:21
diarrhea in the first bout
05:22
that he had wow yeah what did the horse
05:25
claim
05:25
[Laughter]
05:29
um this um thomas elliott he was a bit
05:31
of a professional suck-up
05:32
um because his first book that he wrote
05:35
was called the book of the governor
05:36
and it basically just said how great
05:38
kings are oh really yeah
05:40
all the way through just says oh king's
05:42
amazing and then a few years later he
05:44
got a job from the king
05:46
who sent him as his ambassador to the
05:48
emperor charles the fifth
05:50
yeah so his job was to basically
05:51
negotiate uh
05:53
the divorce with catherine of aragon so
05:55
he was working for henry viii
05:56
and he was one of the people henry viii
05:58
sent to europe to say look the catholics
06:00
in europe are really pissed off with me
06:01
can you make it all okay and he failed
06:03
um and the church of england was created
06:06
but he was also quite cool because he
06:09
was a supporter of
06:10
learned women which was quite unusual at
06:13
the time this is the thing he sort of
06:14
got from thomas moore but he wrote a
06:16
book
06:16
called defense of good women and the
06:18
idea was at the time a lot of people
06:20
thought it was quite bad for women to
06:21
learn to read or be educated at all
06:23
quite dangerous for them
06:25
but he said in his book defense of good
06:27
women it's good for women to be educated
06:29
so that they can provide
06:30
intellectual companionship for their
06:31
husbands which is a step
06:34
in the right direction guys yeah and the
06:36
really out loud thing being good for
06:38
your health
06:38
it was quite a persistent idea so i came
06:41
across a thing written in 1816 called
06:43
the code of health and longevity
06:45
which is another basically exercise
06:47
manual book
06:48
and it also said that loud reading and
06:51
speaking are often good substitutes for
06:53
other kinds of exercise
06:54
and it says hence the longevity of
06:55
school masters because they don't really
06:58
move around very much
06:59
but they do speak loudly a lot and um
07:03
it also says that uh because speaking
07:05
loudly is a healthful exercise
07:07
it's one reason why women require less
07:09
bodily exercise than men
07:10
since they are often more loquacious
07:13
okay i've got a lot of sexist facts
07:14
today
07:16
i didn't realize until researching this
07:18
fact that reading aloud at
07:20
um parties and social gatherings was a
07:22
thing
07:24
yeah wondering all these looks on the
07:27
tube
07:28
but no it's uh it's such a wonderful
07:31
world to me the idea that you would sit
07:32
in a room and someone would just read to
07:34
you and you'd all join in and there's
07:35
all these examples of in the 1700s
07:37
particularly
07:38
women in correspond letters
07:40
correspondences sending each other
07:42
recommendations
07:43
for types of books to be read out loud
07:45
while they were doing certain
07:47
uh things like notting work for example
07:49
apparently
07:51
uh boswell's tour of the hebrides is a
07:53
fantastic book
07:54
to be read out and you're just tying
07:55
knots in pieces of string yeah while
07:57
you're knotting
07:58
yeah but yeah there's there's many
08:01
examples of like good books to be read
08:03
for
08:03
situations sorry we're sure it's not
08:06
knitting
08:08
it's said notting and so i assume that
08:10
was the 17th century anything that's not
08:12
knitting is nothing
08:16
no good call it's one of those things i
08:18
just assumed oh that's a weird hobby at
08:19
the pass i don't need to look that up
08:20
yeah maybe they were all sailors these
08:22
women
08:23
they could have been making rope yeah
08:25
yeah they is this what you're talking
08:26
about they're in
08:27
um in factories they would have people
08:30
reading to them
08:31
that they used to do that as well yeah
08:32
yeah there was a um a cigar monte cristo
08:35
cigars in fact
08:36
are named after the fact that it was the
08:38
favorite book
08:39
to be read out in the factory and the
08:41
lecture and yeah wow
08:42
so that's that's what they say the guy
08:44
who took over it rebranded the company
08:46
and one of their favorite books was the
08:48
count of monte cristo
08:49
you'd have to work there a of a
08:50
long time to get through the whole book
08:53
i really want to quit my job but he
08:55
hasn't even got out of prison yet
08:57
that's better though you want to have a
08:58
long read to keep the factory workers
09:00
entertained if it was called the very
09:01
hungry caterpillar cigar company
09:03
you have a lot of very bored employees
09:08
[Applause]
09:09
okay it's time for fact number two and
09:12
that is
09:13
chozinski my fact this week is that
09:15
scientists in georgia
09:16
just blew a six meter wide soap bubble
09:19
wow
09:20
wow what room did they do it in
09:23
that's not the first question i was
09:24
thinking of asking
09:26
i just thought that's wider than this
09:27
room i think the room we're recording it
09:29
now
09:29
and it's probably wider than most of the
09:31
rooms i um in my home
09:33
they actually have to have a special
09:35
extra large room built
09:37
just for this bubble i can't believe you
09:40
don't have a job as an interviewer on
09:41
national television
09:46
we're cutting live that's andy who's on
09:47
the scene presumably this wasn't the
09:50
room
09:50
[Laughter]
09:53
prince andrew what what room was it at
09:55
peter express that you were in
09:58
the main restaurant eh all right
10:02
so what room was it it was um it was
10:04
outdoors
10:05
it was outdoors yeah i believe so
10:06
riskier for a bubble though but
10:08
potentially but at least you can get one
10:11
that big
10:13
outdoors the biggest room of all
10:16
i think i've certainly seen him
10:18
practicing outdoors or i didn't see
10:20
uh where they did the real thing yeah um
10:22
but yeah outdoors on the ground so this
10:24
was
10:24
a uh study pub published in a physical
10:27
review
10:28
fluids um and one of the authors was
10:31
inspired when
10:32
he went to barcelona and he saw street
10:34
performers blowing these you know they
10:35
have those massive bubbles that
10:37
kids love and they don't blow them they
10:39
sort of weave them
10:40
you know what i'm talking about sticks
10:42
and a bit of rope in between the sticks
10:43
with sticks and rope
10:44
and he thought how on earth does
10:46
something so thin stay together when it
10:48
gets so big and there's that pressure on
10:50
it
10:50
and so they tried to blow a massive one
10:52
and they did and they worked out the way
10:54
of doing it and it's not very
10:55
interesting if you don't know a lot
10:57
about fluid dynamics is this the biggest
10:59
bubble ever made
11:01
i believe it's the biggest soap bubble
11:02
ever made wow how big can bubbles get i
11:04
mean how big is your room first of all
11:06
but then
11:06
how big can they get is it like they can
11:09
get i think
11:10
we don't know a maximum well there are
11:11
records so guinness keeps a lot of
11:13
records
11:14
okay so 2015 uh the record was broken
11:17
then i don't know if this new
11:18
six meter one has beaten it but the
11:20
largest bubble then was
11:22
3 400 cubic feet in volume and that i
11:25
genuinely have written down is about the
11:26
size of a classroom this is probably why
11:28
i was asking about the room thing
11:30
um but the the weird thing about that is
11:33
how do you measure
11:34
because it's not perfectly round no and
11:36
it's not an independent adjudicator from
11:38
guinness needs to turn up and measure it
11:39
and what they did is they photographed
11:41
it just as it was finished
11:43
and then the a scientist independently
11:45
used photographs from
11:47
i've written this down orthogonal angles
11:50
orthogonal angles which i've net is a
11:52
term i've never heard before but
11:53
basically i think photographs from a lot
11:54
of different angles and you build up a
11:56
picture of how big it is
11:57
um how big do you say that one was that
11:59
was uh 3
12:00
400 cubic feet yeah so this one that
12:02
anna's talking about was 100 000 liters
12:06
so do your maths at home
12:09
and they said it was big enough to
12:10
swallow a volkswagen beetle
12:13
that's big that is big you know that's
12:15
they've as you're saying there's a bunch
12:16
of bubble records
12:17
i think my favorite one i found on the
12:19
guinness site is most bubbles blown with
12:21
a tarantula in the mouth
12:23
that's an existing record did you watch
12:26
the footage
12:27
no i saw a photo there's a video of this
12:29
guy who loves his tarantula but he loves
12:31
bubbles as well and he puts he just pops
12:33
his tarantula in his mouth and then
12:34
blows bubbles with
12:35
is the tarantula allowed to help like
12:37
blowing
12:38
because you've got two people blowing
12:40
aren't you really true has he really
12:41
broken the record
12:42
it's the weirdest record attempt you've
12:44
ever seen because he's just got a
12:45
transfer sitting inside his mouth
12:47
live and it's his pet it's his favorite
12:49
and then he blows bubbles for a while
12:50
and then it just crawls out of his mouth
12:52
onto his hand
12:52
and what was the previous record were
12:54
there lots of people
12:56
this is something that many people have
12:58
done he got 119 bubbles blown in 30
13:00
seconds
13:01
surely he could just do one and he's
13:02
broken the record
13:05
why bother there's also most people put
13:07
inside
13:08
a soap bubble in 30 seconds and that's
13:10
13 and this brings me to an important
13:12
point which might speak to what andy
13:13
said before about the guinness bubble
13:15
so the putting inside the soap bubble
13:17
again it's one of those ones on sticks
13:19
where you sort of people jump inside it
13:21
and it's woken up through them
13:22
and that's not a bubble as far as this
13:25
study was concerned okay
13:26
because well the bubble just needs to go
13:27
all the way around be a full sphere so i
13:29
don't know if the one that broke
13:30
the record was still being blown out of
13:32
the aperture um but i think the
13:35
bubble needs to be self-contained yeah
13:37
yeah
13:38
complete and it's an example of science
13:40
being very clever the fact that bubbles
13:41
will always try and be a sphere
13:44
so if you've got a piece of string and
13:46
you're told to lay out on a table
13:48
with the biggest possible area then
13:50
you'll naturally put it in a circle yeah
13:52
so if you've got a piece of string of
13:53
the same length a circle is a shape
13:55
which will give it the biggest area
13:56
and in the same way the bubble kind of
13:58
knows that well one of the first people
13:59
who studied this was a guy called
14:01
antoine plateau
14:02
he is probably the world's first bubble
14:04
scientist and he
14:06
worked out that not only the bubbles
14:08
always turn into spheres
14:09
if left on their own if you put them
14:11
together they always join at an angle of
14:13
120 degrees
14:15
and again there's mathematical reasons
14:17
why this is the case it's all about
14:18
packing and stuff like that
14:19
um but this guy plateau is really
14:21
amazing um he had problems as a child he
14:24
lost his parents and he had mental
14:26
problems and so they sent him away to
14:27
the country to get better
14:29
unfortunately it was june 1815 and they
14:32
sent him to the village of waterloo
14:34
[Laughter]
14:36
oh my god i know and so he was there
14:38
when the battle was happening
14:40
uh but then was he alright he was fine
14:42
because he managed to live to
14:44
um to be a bubble scientist uh and
14:47
the best bubble scientist there ever was
14:49
probably well his career started very
14:51
well didn't it
14:52
plateau but then unfortunately
14:55
just kind of very good much further very
14:57
good um and he did his bubble work
14:59
despite being blind
15:01
a lot of his work because when he was
15:03
older he was blind uh he lost his sight
15:05
in an experiment to see how long he
15:06
could look at the sun
15:07
oh no no no that's the guinness world
15:10
record of its day
15:11
yeah uh just an experiment oh that's
15:13
awful yeah but i mean he's one of the
15:15
greats
15:16
in in this field he doesn't sound like
15:18
that smart guy does he
15:20
he really doesn't because newton did
15:22
that as well didn't he
15:25
and he yeah that his eyes are afterwards
15:27
and he went blind for a couple of days
15:28
and so i don't know why people continued
15:30
to do it newton was an idiot he used to
15:31
put bodkins in the back of his eyes
15:33
see if he could look behind them um
15:37
do you remember i think i might have
15:39
told you guys that i used to
15:41
go on stage every day after a bubble
15:43
performer did you yeah we were doing
15:45
ostentatious at the fringe the act
15:47
before us was the amazing bubble man
15:48
cool what did he do unbelievable things
15:51
were they big was it a number of bubbles
15:53
was it the size the shape
15:54
you name it were the torrentials
15:55
involved no tarantulas that i saw but i
15:57
only ever saw the last ten minutes of
15:59
his act but he was how big was the room
16:03
it was quite a big route it was he
16:05
always demanded playing huge
16:09
[Laughter]
16:14
um he did bubbles that he stabbed and
16:16
then they survived
16:17
or he would make bubbles inside other
16:19
bubbles oh yeah uh he would do bubbles
16:21
filled with smoke
16:22
i've made a bubble inside another like
16:24
every child who's had bubble mix has
16:26
done that
16:27
what that's hard wow that's so
16:29
embarrassing andy less time reading more
16:30
time blowing bubbles as a kid for you
16:32
that's what i would recommend
16:33
anna was in one corner of the playground
16:35
blowing bubbles and andy was doing his
16:37
jane austen improvisation on the other
16:38
side
16:40
[Music]
16:41
did he um spill some of his bubble juice
16:44
on the
16:44
stage and you kept slipping on it
16:47
because it would be slippy wouldn't it
16:48
it was very slippy but he always mopped
16:50
up very carefully
16:52
but it was no it was a messy old thing
16:54
yeah they call it bubble juice
16:56
do they yeah the um bubblers do like
16:59
they're called bubblers so people who
17:00
like bubbles are called bubblers
17:02
or if they really like it they're called
17:03
bubble heads and they call
17:06
their juice bubble juice i think if
17:08
you're being called
17:09
a bubbler you must like bubbles enough
17:11
to be called a bubble head
17:13
maybe not come on mate in all these
17:14
subcultures you need levels
17:16
that's true yeah you have to how are
17:18
they going to fall out of the stuff
17:19
so i quite like bubbles what does that
17:21
make me anything in this world no i
17:22
don't think so now okay
17:23
yeah it's like saying i've read all the
17:25
harry potter's and someone says what
17:26
house are you sorted into and you say oh
17:28
i haven't done that
17:29
you're not a potter head you're just a
17:31
reader of potter
17:32
okay that's a good analogy yeah it was
17:36
pretty close and i am fine with that
17:37
are you fine with not being a bubble
17:38
head no i love it and then you better
17:40
get into it because it is a quite a big
17:42
subculture
17:43
the bubblers and this actually getting
17:45
bigger all the time
17:47
i think it's going to burst at some
17:49
point
17:51
so they were consulted heavily in the
17:54
study that i mentioned at the start of
17:55
this fact
17:56
uh when the the physicists were looking
17:58
for advice on how to blow the best
17:59
bubbles
18:00
all these nerds suddenly their use
18:01
became apparent
18:03
when you know because they're always
18:04
exchanging like this is the best liquid
18:06
to use
18:06
this is the best juice juice juice sorry
18:10
sorry it's best juice to use and
18:12
actually do you know what the best
18:14
soap is no no well it's it's not
18:16
surprising actually if you could watch
18:17
the adverts
18:18
imperial leather oh it's not it's very
18:20
liquid it's very late
18:22
this is actually according to another
18:23
study i read so studies on bubbles just
18:25
abound it's a huge area and it's a 2006
18:28
paper called
18:30
giant soap curtains for public
18:32
presentations
18:33
and soap curtains sounds disgusting i
18:36
don't even know what it's supposed to be
18:37
but it sounds disgusting
18:38
also very ineffective soap curtains i
18:41
had a pair of slime curtains
18:43
they kept almost none of the light
18:46
and there was always a rainbow outside
18:49
uh so this it was actually quite good it
18:50
was by some physicist who first of all
18:52
said
18:52
the question we're always asked is are
18:54
we paid to do this no we're
18:56
like high-level researchers we're just
18:58
doing this to spread the word and it was
18:59
saying soap curtains are a really good
19:01
thing to engage kids so it's basically
19:03
like a huge soap bubble but it's very
19:04
flat it's
19:05
drawn between two big poles and
19:08
you sort of wash soap down it like a
19:10
waterfall and it creates this constantly
19:11
moving long bubble
19:13
anyway they looked into it and they said
19:15
the best washing up liquid for surface
19:16
elasticity
19:17
is a procter gamble which is marketed as
19:20
draft in europe and dawn in the us
19:22
and fairy in the uk
19:25
but if you're in france terrible news
19:28
doesn't contain the crucial ingredient
19:30
that makes it elastic
19:31
doesn't it so you can't blow such big
19:33
bubbles in france what is it can you add
19:34
it to it
19:35
i don't actually know what it is i think
19:37
it's probably some long chemical word
19:38
but yeah you'd have to add it you'd have
19:40
to order your own from elsewhere
19:44
[Laughter]
19:45
on the bubble wikipedia um they also
19:48
asked what's the best bubble juice in
19:50
the faqs
19:52
and the answer is not quite so clear-cut
19:54
it says
19:55
everyone has a different definition of
19:57
the best bubble
19:58
there is no actual best juice because
20:00
what one person defines as the best
20:02
bubble
20:03
may not align with how another person
20:05
defines the best bubble
20:06
it feels like there's a divorce behind
20:08
that statement
20:10
is there a bubble do you mean like a
20:12
separate mini wikipedia for bubblers
20:14
yes so um these guys from georgia who
20:16
and i was talking about
20:18
um they went into a big online community
20:20
of bubblers like hannah says and i think
20:22
one part of it was the bubble wikipedia
20:25
yeah that's so cool and actually bubbles
20:28
is really important if you're studying
20:30
it bubbles are really important because
20:32
when you work out how they exist it can
20:35
help you in glass making it can help you
20:37
in other industrial processes
20:39
um i read one article that it helps in
20:41
building
20:42
lab on a chip bubble logic devices
20:51
and also artificial viruses for vaccines
20:54
you need to learn about bubbles if you
20:55
want to make those i found one other
20:56
bubble that's not on earth it's in space
20:59
the these are two super bubbles uh
21:03
at the center of a distant galaxy
21:04
they're massive cavities filled with gas
21:06
and they're full of
21:07
charged particles and the particles are
21:09
100 times stronger than we've even made
21:11
at cern they're
21:12
100 times stronger than any particles
21:14
found on earth in terms
21:16
of their charge oh okay the charge is
21:17
stronger uh
21:19
one of these bubbles is 3600 light years
21:23
across
21:24
and the other one is 4 900 light years
21:27
across
21:27
think of the size of room you'd need to
21:32
wow yeah so yeah what happens if they
21:35
pop
21:35
i don't know but yeah neptune's orbit
21:37
around the sun is
21:38
less than one thousandth of one light
21:40
year across just to put that in
21:42
perspective into a perspective that you
21:44
still can't begin to
21:46
understand yeah cheers right that helps
21:48
one other space bubble that's uh
21:50
dangerous to humans is the space bubble
21:52
that we create
21:53
so astronauts in the international space
21:55
station when they go to sleep
21:57
when they exhale they build this bubble
22:00
of carbon dioxide that sits in front of
22:02
their face
22:02
that can be very dangerous so every
22:04
astronaut when they go to sleep they
22:05
have to sleep with their head near an
22:07
air vent
22:08
because they need that bubble pushed
22:09
away from them otherwise they can
22:11
suffocate on
22:12
it wake up with huge migraines
22:13
potentially die you could just sleep
22:15
with a very long
22:16
straw in your mouth no because then the
22:18
bubble would
22:19
start at the end of the straw you're
22:22
just
22:22
just moving the problem if you were a
22:26
nasa designer it was a really long straw
22:28
though i'm sure it would be fine
22:29
what if you had you went to sleep and
22:32
you invented this thing it's like a tiny
22:34
straw
22:35
but as the time goes on the straw gets
22:37
longer and longer and longer that's a
22:38
good idea that's a good idea
22:40
straw yeah yeah okay you are lying after
22:43
all aren't you
22:44
absolutely right so good this thing
22:47
sells itself
22:49
uh one more thing about bubbles which i
22:51
really like is
22:52
penguins um we're not quite sure how
22:55
they do this but we think they basically
22:57
blow bubbles out of their beaks
22:58
and then the bubbles go onto their body
23:01
and when they're swimming
23:02
it means they can go quicker through the
23:04
water because the bubbles
23:06
mean there's less friction with the
23:07
water really and that's the only way
23:09
they can get the speeds where you know a
23:11
penguin kind of swims up and then could
23:13
jump out of the water onto the land
23:15
yeah they won't be able to do that if
23:16
they didn't have bubbles around their
23:17
whole body
23:18
wow and there's an idea that we could
23:20
make ships
23:22
with a load of bubbles around the hull
23:24
and then that could cut
23:25
fuel consumption by about 15 percent
23:27
that's worth doing
23:28
very good cool penguins to dribble on
23:31
our ships and then
23:33
just tie one penguin at the front of
23:35
every ship
23:37
with a straw could get bigger as well
23:40
yeah put it in the place of that
23:41
pointless like
23:42
fit statue of a woman that's always at
23:43
the front of ships
23:45
last time you saw a ship it was last
23:49
time you got a ferry to france
23:51
i only travel on viking
23:56
okay it is time for fact number three
23:58
and that is my fact
24:00
my fact this week is that before she
24:02
became famous
24:03
marilyn monroe was named the artichoke
24:05
queen of castroville california
24:08
miss cheesecake by stars and stripes
24:10
magazine and
24:11
queen of the radio plane company where
24:13
she worked assembling
24:14
military drones during world war so cool
24:18
a little interesting career moment she
24:19
sort of had a lot of early prizes before
24:21
she became
24:22
the true marilyn monroe yeah she even
24:24
caught marilyn monroe she wasn't she was
24:26
norma jean
24:26
at that point she was at the time she
24:28
got the artichoke queen yes that's
24:30
true yes because that was at a time when
24:32
she wasn't
24:33
famous but she was almost famous
24:36
because she was on a promotional tour
24:38
for diamonds there was a guy who was
24:40
selling diamonds
24:41
and he also was a movie star promoter
24:44
and he wanted to promote his star by
24:45
getting
24:46
a young starlet in and he asked this
24:48
starlet called doreen nash if she would
24:50
do it she said yes she canceled at the
24:51
last minute and then marilyn monroe came
24:53
along and did it instead
24:54
but she was famous enough that she was
24:56
doing autographs and stuff yes exactly
24:58
she was at that point she was given
24:59
the sort of honorary role rather than
25:01
having to compete for it she became the
25:03
queen
25:03
of the artist what actually happened is
25:06
she was in another
25:07
she was in some like room or something
25:10
and then some guys
25:12
like a room tell me more
25:15
and there was a load of artichoke
25:16
salesmen who just saw their chance
25:18
and then ran over to her and gave her a
25:20
sash held a load of artichokes took a
25:22
photo and that was it yes no
25:24
there was nothing else happening so
25:26
these other things that marilyn monroe
25:27
or norma jean did before she became
25:29
super famous were really they were in
25:30
the 40s weren't they really
25:32
and she her first small break i reckon
25:35
was probably in
25:36
world war ii when she was working for
25:38
this kind of as you said it like a drone
25:40
company
25:41
where she was so that what they did was
25:43
they had these remote control planes
25:44
which the americans wanted to use for
25:46
basically reconnaissance i think
25:48
and she was spraying the parachute the
25:50
mini parachutes for these planes is that
25:51
right
25:52
yeah target practice too some of them
25:53
were used for some of the drones were
25:55
just
25:56
for anti-aircraft gunners to have a go
25:57
on okay and
25:59
okay because then you don't have to fly
26:00
the drone as far away as you'd have to
26:02
fly a full-size one
26:03
in order to get the corresponding target
26:05
practice yeah you don't have to kill a
26:07
pilot every time you're doing it
26:12
um so anyway there was this idea that
26:14
people should start photographing women
26:16
who were working towards the war effort
26:18
as part of this pr campaign pro-war pr
26:20
campaign
26:20
and she was one of these women
26:21
photographed and that was her first
26:23
small break
26:24
and the person who instructed this
26:26
campaign to happen was one captain
26:28
ronald reagan
26:29
what was it indeed marilyn monroe may
26:32
never have existed
26:34
uh if it weren't for reagan um so when
26:36
marilyn monroe first
26:38
became more famous one of her things
26:40
they tried to sell her as was an
26:43
mmm girl okay that's mmm
26:47
girl and that was in response to anne
26:50
sheridan who was a previous
26:51
actor actually still there at the time
26:53
but she was known as the umph girl
26:55
because she had a lot of oh yeah okay
26:59
and when people said well why are you
27:01
calling marilyn monroe that mmm
27:02
girl her publicist said well it's
27:04
because whenever she goes to detroit
27:06
that's what people say whenever she
27:08
walks past they all go
27:10
detroit why detroit well according to
27:12
her publicist it's because people in
27:13
detroit can't whistle
27:16
what is this that's what the publicist
27:19
said
27:20
why didn't the publisher just say her
27:21
name is marilyn monroe
27:23
i know and her middle names are margaret
27:25
michael
27:29
it's a really stupid story that's why i
27:30
bring it up people in detroit can't
27:32
whistle
27:38
i was looking a bit into her first
27:40
marriage which is probably her least
27:42
known marriage to a guy called james
27:43
doherty
27:44
and they were married for four years in
27:46
the late 1940s and
27:48
he went on so he he always said that he
27:51
never claims to have any insights on
27:52
marilyn monroe i never knew marilyn
27:54
monroe i knew and loved norma jean
27:56
spelt with an extra e on the end by the
27:58
way which no one ever does so gene was
28:00
spelt j-e-a-n-e
28:02
um but he had a weird career he went on
28:05
to work for the lapd for basically his
28:07
whole life
28:07
where he helped to found and train and
28:10
like he was the lead trainer of
28:12
america's first ever swat team
28:14
you know like a swat team like elite
28:16
police marksmen who go into like hostage
28:18
situations and stuff like that he also
28:20
um
28:21
he when he was working as a policeman at
28:23
one stage he was doing crowd control at
28:25
the movie premiere of a marilyn monroe
28:27
film
28:28
which was
28:34
[Laughter]
28:39
because he was never allowed to actually
28:40
watch a brilliant monroe because his
28:42
wife banned him
28:43
i think you would be a jealous of you
28:44
yeah if you were
28:46
the second wife to marilyn monroe but he
28:48
had a really awkward incident
28:50
when in the 1950s he was asked to be on
28:52
a reality tv show
28:54
which was to tell the truth it was
28:55
called to tell the truth the game show
28:57
and they had a segment which they do on
28:58
buzzcocks which where they bring sort of
29:01
a number of people out and you have to
29:02
guess which one of them is the real wow
29:04
yeah yeah and they have the contestants
29:06
have to guess which one is the real
29:08
ex-husband of marilyn monroe wow did i
29:11
guess him do you know
29:12
i actually don't know if they guessed
29:13
him right what i do know is he lied to
29:14
his wife so he could be on the show and
29:16
when she found out
29:17
terrible lie because obviously she was
29:18
watching tv there was only one channel
29:21
at the time
29:23
incredibly stupid so when she found out
29:25
she threw a pan at him
29:27
oh do you throw a pan yeah yeah well
29:30
they did do that in those days didn't
29:31
they throw pens at each other
29:34
so this fact was partly about marilyn
29:36
monroe being artichoke queen
29:38
yes i found out a few other um queens
29:41
okay food related queens that america
29:44
has there's a great article in the wall
29:45
street journal
29:46
which described the national pork queen
29:49
the ohio queen of beef and various other
29:52
queens
29:52
and this is a thing where they all face
29:54
off against each other to be miss
29:56
agriculture it's like a massive derby of
30:00
queens of different foods
30:01
do they fight each other with massive
30:03
cuts of the meats
30:06
who would your money be on would it be
30:07
on the bacon the sausage
30:09
i'm thinking a big cow cops
30:12
yeah a queen of beef if you could wield
30:15
one of those
30:16
yeah you're unbeatable definitely
30:17
because you're not gonna get be in much
30:19
trouble
30:19
up against the egg queen which is
30:21
another one of these queens the porn
30:22
queen wheat queen
30:23
separate lamb and wool queens which is
30:26
very weird
30:27
anyway they they they have to be um
30:30
you know there's a sort of element that
30:32
they're all quite good-looking young
30:33
women obviously because that's one of
30:35
the things they have
30:36
there but they also have to give
30:37
speeches on the products they represent
30:39
and they have to converse while being
30:41
watched by judges about their chosen
30:43
products
30:44
and the judges are looking to see who
30:45
best represents farming spirit
30:47
okay and then the winner gets crowned
30:49
queen of agriculture and goes around
30:51
speaking about agriculture and how
30:52
important it is and all of this
30:54
yeah so if you're the egg queen yeah do
30:56
they ask you just questions about eggs
30:58
or are they asking because you're
31:00
actually representing the whole of
31:01
agriculture so you need to know about
31:03
beef and lamb and
31:04
well and everything i think in these
31:05
regionals you only have to answer
31:07
questions on your specialist
31:08
food i'm not certain but i think that's
31:10
it but yeah if you're promoted to queen
31:12
of agriculture it's like if you've just
31:14
been home secretary for years and then
31:15
you become prime minister or something
31:17
how do you know about all the other
31:18
departments it's a really big step it's
31:20
a huge step
31:21
yeah i don't think they should be
31:22
allowed this kind of responsibility i
31:23
think you should have to be
31:24
every single minister before you become
31:26
prime minister
31:29
and every single queen i think boris
31:31
johnson needs to be a sausage queen
31:36
actually never mind sounds like a bit of
31:37
prison terminology there
31:41
um yeah industry queens have been quite
31:42
a big thing for 100 years haven't they
31:44
they i think they kick which are mascots
31:46
for certain industries
31:48
and i think we covered them a bit in the
31:49
q series of q i did yeah
31:51
but it's if it's gone out yet i'm not
31:53
sure if it's gone out yet that episode
31:54
might have done
31:55
you may have seen this or you're about
31:56
to see it on qi but
31:58
they were people who represented their
32:00
industry so you'd have a coal queen
32:02
or a railway queen and uh there's
32:05
actually we did cover the sausage queen
32:06
who was 15 years old
32:08
and they were so important and
32:10
considered such diplomats for their
32:12
industries
32:12
that they did things like this 15 year
32:14
old sausage queen was put straight on a
32:16
train to moscow in 1936 to meet joseph
32:18
stalin
32:19
and talk about how great british
32:21
sausages were did she
32:22
have sausages to present she must have
32:25
done
32:25
i suppose so i've seen a picture where
32:27
she's sort of wearing sausages around
32:29
her neck and on her head and stuff
32:30
it's a very odd picture that's a weird
32:33
crap she's wearing a sort of hula skirt
32:35
made of sausages
32:37
yeah as darling you would have to think
32:39
these people are trying to take the piss
32:40
aren't they yeah
32:42
i'm in charge of russia and they're
32:44
sending their sausage queen
32:45
apparently it did great diplomatic work
32:47
that's one of the main reasons that
32:48
russia eventually joined outside
32:50
in the second world war i thought it was
32:52
because of her
32:57
okay it's time for our final fact of the
32:59
show and that is
33:00
james okay my fact this week is that
33:02
there is a salamander in bosnia who
33:04
hasn't moved from the same spot since
33:06
2010.
33:08
and we're sure well i'm not sure it's
33:12
currently alive i'm sure it was alive in
33:13
2018 when they last checked
33:15
uh it might have moved since then but
33:18
i'm assuming if it stayed in the same
33:19
place as between 2010 and 2018
33:22
it probably is still there yeah yeah is
33:24
that fair to assume i think so although
33:26
in the study uh that was done there was
33:29
a suggestion
33:30
that they can't be positive it hasn't
33:32
moved it might have gone away and just
33:34
returned
33:34
yeah by the time they go back every time
33:36
they checked it was always in exactly
33:38
the same spot yeah but that doesn't mean
33:39
that it's sneaking off and then when it
33:41
sees them coming it runs back in
33:42
yeah it's like toy story toys exactly as
33:45
soon as they see the kid come back in
33:47
the room
33:47
obviously they're going to be back in
33:48
the same day back to your places yeah
33:50
okay so this is an ulm it's a
33:54
white um salamander it's known in bosnia
33:58
as the human fish
33:59
because it has a pink skin colour
34:02
and there is a couple of scientists in
34:05
budapest
34:06
whose names i'm not going to try and
34:08
pronounce gurgley balash
34:10
maybe
34:13
[Music]
34:15
choking on water or something
34:19
it's it's a strong name imagine someone
34:21
imagine it's not that at all
34:23
like you've just completely someone said
34:24
hey you're on the there's such thing as
34:26
a fish podcast this week
34:27
listen james
34:30
but i imagine he was once asked to
34:32
introduce himself and his name's just
34:33
balash but he was just swallowing a
34:35
mouthful of water at the time
34:38
well actually i mean he was diving into
34:41
the water to inject
34:44
these alms with a pigment and each arm
34:47
they injected with a different shape of
34:48
pigment
34:49
and then every now and then they'd come
34:51
back and see where they were
34:52
and the idea was to see how much they're
34:54
moving and it turns out
34:56
that most of the alms move less than 10
34:58
meters
35:00
and about five meters per year was
35:02
typical
35:03
and the most active home they found
35:05
moved 38 meters in 230 days
35:08
and then the guy who i'm talking about
35:10
was found in exactly the same spot
35:13
after 2567 days
35:16
more than seven years it's really
35:19
amazing
35:20
and the other thing i mean alms are
35:21
incredible um
35:23
because they can survive a very long
35:25
time without eating yes so and they've
35:27
got i think
35:28
they've tested uh some because they have
35:29
a lab in france where because they're
35:31
very endangered these things
35:32
and one alm is known to have survived 12
35:35
years without eating
35:36
anything yeah yeah they just like one
35:38
little crustacean comes along and they
35:40
just gobble it all up they can eat it
35:42
whole
35:42
and then it will just take them all that
35:44
time to digest it and they'll just sit
35:45
around doing nothing until the next one
35:47
comes along
35:48
well thinking i think they're meditating
35:50
they're all sitting there just going
35:51
oh
35:52
[Laughter]
35:55
i've actually seen alms live in the pale
35:58
flesh yeah i went to slovenia
36:01
and in the um caves
36:05
uh they have this you're underground
36:09
you're in this incredible cave system
36:10
and then they've just got this booth
36:12
it's so weird seeing this metal booth
36:15
and it's like a terrarium for these arms
36:17
and they you can look at them and they
36:19
keep them there partly to educate the
36:20
public and partly to conserve them
36:23
and they're there did you see the move
36:25
uh
36:26
i no i didn't see the move they stayed
36:28
very still in fact i have a prop with me
36:29
which i've left downstairs
36:30
related to this great should i go get it
36:34
um
36:35
is it going to be good radio no get it
36:45
[Laughter]
36:47
he just said because you can't hear him
36:48
he said don't say anything more about
36:49
alms while i'm gone
36:50
look i want to get the bra these guns
36:52
get the prop
36:54
so um what we going to say about andy
36:55
well he's away
36:57
who is going to replace him oh yeah the
36:59
next few months uh if you want to
37:00
replace
37:01
andy on no such thing as a fish then
37:02
please write to podcast.qi.com yes
37:06
qualifications uh great props
37:09
uh always bring your props with you it's
37:11
very important
37:13
[Music]
37:14
okay so andy has returned
37:18
please he's gonna turn the heat into
37:19
something that can't survive in higher
37:21
temperatures kind of because
37:22
it's a model home okay
37:26
so um dan do you want to explain what
37:28
andy's just put on the table
37:29
yeah so it's a soft toy penis
37:33
and it's an home if your penis has four
37:36
legs down and you really need to get
37:37
that look
37:39
uh yeah it's a it's a little soft toy
37:40
ohm i just brought it because
37:43
i bought it at the caves and i wanted to
37:44
show you yeah it's really cool
37:46
i mean it is quite phallic it is this is
37:49
a lot bigger than the ones they have in
37:50
the caves
37:52
tiny and they've really beefed this up
37:53
for the plush toy version well you've
37:55
just turned the heat enough so it'll
37:56
probably get smaller in the next few
37:57
minutes
37:58
anyway um anyway i've just i
38:01
couldn't we couldn't do it without me
38:03
bringing in the soft toilet it wouldn't
38:04
have worked this whole podcast wouldn't
38:05
have worked without you bringing this
38:06
soft toy
38:07
maybe you should put a picture of the
38:08
arm on your on your twitter account
38:11
yes um what does it have a name no
38:14
doesn't yet
38:14
i would call it sherlock holmes
38:16
brilliant
38:21
[Laughter]
38:25
it's like eating you just have to hope a
38:26
crime happens directly in front of you
38:32
um so what what more can we say about
38:33
alms well david attenborough loves them
38:35
does he so he picked them in 2012 as one
38:37
of the 10 endangered species he'd take
38:39
on his own personal arc
38:40
and guys we're not even there i guess
38:42
we're not endangered this is so weird
38:44
because i have a
38:45
salamander related no noah's ark fact
38:47
okay
38:48
which is that so this is not unrelated
38:50
so this is just a brief step away from
38:51
alms but
38:52
um there's a giant salamander in china
38:55
which is
38:56
absolutely massive they're about five
38:58
feet long they
39:00
weigh about 60 kilos and the very first
39:02
fossil of it found was one of the
39:04
earliest fossils
39:05
discovered by humans and it was named
39:08
homo de luvie testis which means human
39:11
witness of the flood
39:13
because people didn't know what this
39:14
salamander fossil was
39:16
and it was thought to be a person who
39:18
had died in noah's flood
39:20
wow and if any of you at home thought it
39:22
meant human
39:23
flood balls then that's just you know
39:26
learn your latin better not just at home
39:30
those giant chinese salamanders are
39:31
eaten in some parts of china
39:33
um they're i think they are on the
39:36
they're in danger
39:37
they are endangered so don't do it kids
39:39
but they used to eat salamanders
39:41
in the southern usa especially in times
39:44
of poverty
39:45
and there is one theory that the term
39:48
hush puppies
39:49
originally referred to as salamander
39:51
because um
39:52
a hush puppy before it became like a
39:54
type of shoe is it
39:56
yeah um it was like a tiny bit of food
39:59
that you would eat
40:00
uh and the idea was um that these
40:02
salamanders were also known as water
40:03
puppies
40:04
and the hush came for the fact that
40:06
people didn't want to know that they
40:07
were eating this stuff because it was a
40:09
poverty food
40:12
it's either that or it was a like a
40:14
little bit of food you gave to a dog to
40:16
keep it quiet it could be that as well
40:19
how did that become a shoe well no it's
40:22
the branding is a dog right
40:24
i didn't know that yeah yeah yeah i
40:25
don't really know so sorry is the
40:26
branding about
40:27
hot to make your puppy hush kick it with
40:29
this shoe no no
40:30
no no the adverts were controversial at
40:33
the time but
40:34
just one more thing about the giant
40:36
chinese salamander
40:38
it's very cool because it also generates
40:39
glue and this is
40:41
really glue that might be actually very
40:43
useful so it secretes this mucus
40:45
and it will secrete the mucus if you
40:46
gently scratch it apparently
40:48
and so researchers have been
40:50
investigating this to see if it can be
40:52
used as a medical adhesive
40:53
and apparently it's a more effective
40:54
medical and adhesive than any other
40:56
naturally occurring glue found in the
40:58
world and it's much more flexible than
41:00
synthetic adhesives
41:02
and so they think that maybe we could uh
41:04
we could use it to seal wounds in the
41:05
future
41:06
so people who are good at latin who are
41:09
all of our listeners
41:10
but not me would know when i say that
41:14
salamanders often have mental glands
41:17
where on their body they would be um
41:20
it comes from the latin mentum not men's
41:23
so
41:24
men's mind but it's from momentum
41:27
is that a joint their tongue oh they're
41:29
chin how did you get that
41:33
yes so um they have mental glands from
41:35
the latin mental meaning chin
41:37
and they um secrete pheromones so
41:40
when salamanders want to have sex the
41:43
male rubs his chin
41:44
on the back of the female and he
41:46
secretes the pheromones onto her back
41:48
with his chin
41:50
and then that gets her in the mood very
41:51
sexy yeah i think so
41:53
sexy i didn't find out how olms
41:56
made themselves i guess it's hard if you
41:59
don't ever move from your spot they made
42:02
i think they're
42:02
some of the only amphibians they're not
42:04
the only amphibians that mate
42:06
in internally rather than laying eggs is
42:09
that right okay
42:10
so i think they have actual sex which is
42:12
nice yeah
42:13
i think they do have a period of
42:14
activity where they just suddenly all
42:16
just go okay let's do the stuff we need
42:18
to do in just one go
42:20
yeah that's great yeah that's like a
42:22
saturday morning just get everything out
42:24
of the way and then the rest of the
42:25
weekend you can just relax
42:26
exactly so just on salamanders they're a
42:28
type of salamander right and i didn't
42:30
realize there was this
42:31
persistent belief throughout all of
42:32
history that salamanders are fireproof
42:36
from ancient times people there was this
42:38
rumor that salamanders are born from
42:40
fire and they're totally resistant to it
42:42
they're so cold
42:43
they can just walk through fire it was
42:44
also thought that asbestos
42:46
was salamander hair because you know
42:48
asbestos looks kind of hairy
42:49
yeah yeah and it's fire resistant and so
42:52
everyone thought the asbestos was just
42:54
the shed hair of salamanders i mean it
42:55
only takes one experiment
42:58
bizarrely pliny actually did it and it
43:00
was proven to be incorrect and he went
43:02
on to believe it
43:03
this mustn't be a salamander
43:06
that's what he thought he was disproving
43:08
yeah um
43:09
and it was so persistent that even in
43:11
the 19th century people still thought
43:13
salamanders were
43:14
fireproof to the extent that you had
43:15
human salamanders which were popular
43:18
entertainers and they were performed at
43:19
fairs and this is across europe
43:21
and their trick was they wore these big
43:23
asbestos cloaks
43:24
um so a lot of them probably ended up
43:26
quite ill
43:28
with these big asbestos cloaks and
43:29
gloves and shoes and then they'd walk
43:31
through bonfires
43:32
and they were called human salamanders
43:33
cool and their trick was
43:35
it was most impressive if they take a
43:36
raw steak into the middle of a bonfire
43:38
and then they'd stand in there and then
43:40
they'd come out and the state's cooked
43:42
because hopefully they're not quite
43:43
clever they could have the human alm in
43:45
the other part of the
43:46
circus just kind of sitting there
43:49
waiting for the crowd to come past
43:54

43:55

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices
00:21
in covent garden my name is dan
00:23
schreiber i am sitting here with
00:25
andrew hunter murray anna chiczynski and
00:27
james harkin
00:28
and once again we have gathered around
00:30
the microphones with our four
00:31
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order
00:35
here we go starting with you
00:39
anna my fact this week is that
00:41
travelling salesmen used to carry around
00:43
miniature versions of everything they
00:45
were selling right
00:47
it's such an amazing fact it's so cool
00:50
um so i found this i don't know how i
00:51
ended up on this site but i was on
00:53
tim's antique site tim's very well
00:56
respected
00:57
antique steelers um and they had an
00:59
article which was titled
01:01
what is miniature furniture and it
01:04
started by saying this question has been
01:05
asked time and time again
01:08
again
01:11
tim's and tims again and
01:14
so there's a whole myriad of answers but
01:16
we're here to answer definitively and
01:18
they said
01:18
the vast majority of miniature furniture
01:20
that you see in antique places
01:22
was carried around by traveling salesmen
01:24
because if you're going around the
01:25
country you're going to be away for
01:26
weeks and weeks away from your workshop
01:28
then obviously it's a hassle to take all
01:30
the full-size stuff with you
01:31
so they made up tiny samples but
01:34
perfectly sculpted samples
01:35
so incredibly good quality you know with
01:38
the proper materials
01:39
well put together samples but there were
01:41
so many different things they tried this
01:42
way so there are amazing
01:44
pages online of there's a great website
01:46
called collectors weekly
01:47
which has a load of stuff it's so good
01:49
so there were stoves there are mini
01:51
stoves
01:52
and sewing machines and telephones
01:54
coffins
01:55
you can i found on ebay in america
01:57
there's a one going at the moment it's
01:59
eight inches long it's selling for
02:00
a few hundred dollars right and it's
02:02
it's a traveling salesman's coffin
02:04
oh okay as in a it's a proper antique
02:06
traveling yeah exactly
02:08
have you seen the under the stuff that
02:10
undertakers would take with them because
02:11
it was not only they'd have a briefcase
02:13
full of miniature coffins
02:15
but you can also get as antiques their
02:17
briefcase of a graveyard plot
02:19
and again if you go online you open up
02:21
the briefcase
02:22
and it's proper fake grass around it and
02:25
then it's got the gravestone as they
02:27
would suggest that they'll make up your
02:28
grave
02:29
when you die wow that's so cool and is
02:31
there a sort of a
02:32
um a hearse and do you role role-play
02:35
the whole event
02:36
i don't know maybe they did i didn't see
02:37
any briefcases with the miniature hearse
02:39
in them
02:40
you could in the um late 19th century by
02:44
miniature stepladders and ironing boards
02:46
and this was from a guy called ollie
02:48
kirk
02:49
christensen in denmark and
02:52
he had a woodworking company and he was
02:54
making these stepladders and dining
02:55
boards
02:56
but then he thought you know what i
02:57
prefer making these little things and
02:59
making the big things
03:00
why don't i start a company where i make
03:01
lots of little things and he started the
03:03
lego company
03:04
no yeah isn't that cool so he started
03:08
off making miniature things for his
03:09
travelling salesman and then he became a
03:10
lego guy
03:11
that's so cool that is amazing so these
03:14
don't
03:14
because there were a lot of sort of
03:16
miniature version toys back in history
03:18
kind of like i guess how lego came out
03:20
miniature guillotines from the french
03:22
revolution
03:23
yeah this is during the french
03:24
revolution they used to sell them for
03:26
kids to play with
03:27
and you sell dolls with it you sold
03:28
dolls with them and you would chop your
03:30
doll's head off
03:31
yes but if you don't if you don't have a
03:33
if you're too poor to afford the dolls
03:34
you can just put your fingers through
03:35
and that makes it
03:36
a finger puppet you could use to get
03:38
those guillotines that you put your
03:40
fingers in didn't you like in
03:41
a magic sets and stuff yeah and then it
03:43
looks like you're gonna chop them off
03:44
and you don't actually chop them off
03:45
yeah
03:46
imagine if one in every ten guillotines
03:48
was one of those
03:50
and so it means that some people get
03:51
away from their crimes like the old
03:53
real good yeah that's really nice
03:55
russian reprieve
03:56
yeah there was another reason for having
04:00
miniature
04:01
furniture that sometimes wasn't to show
04:03
off your furniture
04:04
and that was it was practice furniture
04:05
so this is something if you're an
04:06
antique dealer you get good at is
04:08
distinguishing
04:09
the proper miniatures from the
04:11
apprentice pieces
04:12
so you can also buy them and as if
04:14
you're auditioning an apprentice and
04:16
then the craftsman would give the
04:17
apprentice a really cheap crappy piece
04:19
of wood and say
04:20
make something awesome out of this
04:21
completely understand when you said
04:22
practice furniture i thought it was
04:23
something you practiced sitting on
04:25
before you got your real chat can't be
04:28
trusted with a real chair
04:29
it's a cotton wool one but would those
04:31
apprentice pieces go out on the road
04:33
as well no ah no they're just for the
04:35
workshop
04:36
and then it kind of stopped didn't it
04:37
once we got photos people just sent
04:39
round catalogs
04:40
although you still get people selling
04:42
things duster don't you um
04:44
in 2010 in the uk the sales sector was
04:47
officially valued at 4.7 billion a year
04:50
in the uk in the uk and that's only the
04:53
legitimate things because people are
04:54
obviously selling other things dota doll
04:56
yeah
04:57
and in 2012 the number of complaints
04:59
about dodgy doorstep sales hit a record
05:01
high with 35 000 complaints made
05:04
so people are still doing this all the
05:05
time um i didn't know that you
05:07
you are technically a peddler
05:10
p-e-d-l-a-r i didn't know that peddler
05:12
was still a trade
05:13
as in it's still properly turned but you
05:15
need a peddler's license to peddle
05:17
because it's such an old-fashioned term
05:19
exactly yeah but you go you go to your
05:21
local police authority
05:22
and you tell them who who you are and
05:25
you know you have to have lived in the
05:26
area for a little while i think
05:27
and it cost 12 pounds 25 to get a year's
05:30
license peddling
05:31
does it yeah wow it just shows like
05:34
obviously what a common profession it
05:35
was how many
05:36
synonyms there are for this job so you
05:39
could be a munger
05:40
um obviously you could be a solicitor
05:42
that was an old word for it before it
05:44
was a lawyer a costa monger
05:45
you don't want to confuse those though
05:49
over here
05:56
[Laughter]
06:00
what you're saying before munger like
06:02
because obviously you have fish mongers
06:04
and
06:04
costumes and all that kind of stuff were
06:06
they dotted or things or is that just a
06:07
seller of things or what
06:09
i think it was a seller of things but
06:10
then it would often
06:12
like you say the mongers coming coming
06:14
down the street now cool
06:15
um i've never heard it on its own
06:18
without some kind of noun before
06:20
it no well you would you don't mung
06:21
nothing so that's why it's often
06:23
proceeded with the thing you're among it
06:24
what do you do if you sell mung beans
06:26
[Laughter]
06:31
sounds like an insult that is a real
06:32
minger
06:35
um but yeah you have so in the in the
06:37
olden days there are some peddlers that
06:39
you don't have as much today you had the
06:41
tooth puller
06:41
and that was quite common you'd have the
06:43
tooth pullers you'd come around and bang
06:44
on your door to pull your teeth out okay
06:46
other wouldn't get off the horse
06:47
would they tie your tooth to the door
06:49
that's what you would do wouldn't you
06:51
you would tie your tooth to the door and
06:52
then when they open the door they pull
06:54
your tooth out
06:55
you don't have to pay them anymore so
06:57
you don't open the door until they've
06:59
said who they are
06:59
they say it's the tooth puller and
07:01
[Laughter]
07:04
i think they tied it to the horse
07:06
because it just just as specific that
07:07
they don't get off their horses quite a
07:09
lot so i imagine maybe they tie it to
07:10
the reins of the horse
07:12
or something no come on and then it's
07:14
like galloping off of you still attached
07:16
like you're a just married car
07:20
it's not as wobbly as i thought so the
07:23
tooth pillars as well as being tooth
07:24
pillars were often traveling dentists
07:26
and you can also get some of the dentist
07:28
kits so they would have a whole
07:29
selection of teeth
07:30
and because it was the 19th century the
07:32
teeth would be graded from sort of
07:34
just light yellow to very dark brownish
07:37
black
07:38
and they'd come to replace your teeth so
07:39
they'd open their briefcase and be like
07:40
hey which do you want and you'd say oh
07:41
that nice yellow one and they'd say
07:43
um i think like maybe more looks color
07:46
chart but yeah
07:46
where all the colors are disgusting
07:50
so one famous uh travelling salesman of
07:53
history
07:55
was jeremy clarkson's dad he was famous
07:58
was he well he
07:59
he is now i would say as the father of
08:01
jeremy clarkson
08:03
but jeremy clarkson uh his dad in fact i
08:05
think his parents they specialized in
08:06
selling tea cozies
08:08
didn't they sell um paddington bear
08:11
yeah they did jeremy clarkson's first
08:13
job
08:14
was going door-to-door
08:19
exactly that he was he was the
08:20
travelling salesman bedding from bear
08:22
and he cozies what a weird combination
08:24
of things to be selling i know
08:26
do they have a range of stuff in between
08:27
paddington guarantee cozy there are
08:28
sources online that say condoms but that
08:30
seems like such a
08:31
strange third element to add to them all
08:34
it says to me is they must have been
08:35
woolen club numbers
08:37
are too cozy for some people is a condom
08:40
for others
08:42
it was the slogan on their land
08:46
i can't so i can't believe that you
08:47
would have a firm selling chico's these
08:49
pokedex
08:50
because it's too late one of them is too
08:52
sexy
08:55
um some stuff on small things very
08:58
quickly yeah
08:59
um so this year in fact last year there
09:02
was
09:02
the world's biggest ever historical
09:05
tabletop
09:06
war game cool cool okay so do you know
09:08
what i mean by that because dad you look
09:10
confused yeah so
09:11
um i don't think either of them knows
09:12
because they both said the word cool
09:13
after
09:14
what you said recreating a real battle
09:17
it's recreating a real battle with
09:18
little soldiers so kind of like
09:20
warhammer basically
09:21
like that not with orcs with actual
09:24
people boring so there was
09:28
more than 20 000 miniature soldiers and
09:30
it was at the university of glasgow and
09:32
they
09:33
replayed the battle of waterloo on a 192
09:36
square meter historical map and um
09:39
it took them a year to paint all the
09:41
soldiers this group of over 100 people
09:44
they've been investigating the
09:45
archaeology of the waterfall battlefield
09:47
since 2015.
09:49
wow and then they did this game and
09:51
there were
09:52
4 000 casualties in their battle
09:55
uh and the allies won because it wasn't
09:57
definite they were going to do it
09:58
properly like a proper game and it could
10:00
have been that napoleon would have won
10:01
it
10:02
but the allies won uh and at one stage
10:05
the duke of wellington in the battle had
10:07
a traffic code on his head
10:09
because in glasgow which is where it was
10:12
famously there's a statue there where
10:14
they
10:14
always put a traffic cone on that's so
10:16
funny that's
10:18
although that bit not historically
10:20
accurate right
10:21
i'm not sure they even had traffic cones
10:24
no they've misread tricorn
10:25
it's been mistranslated somewhere along
10:27
the way
10:28
and do you know who invented sorry just
10:30
while i'm on the subject do you know who
10:31
invented
10:32
the first set of rules for playing with
10:34
thai soldiers
10:35
oh is this someone we would have heard
10:36
of yes jeremy clarkson's dad doesn't it
10:39
it's nuts no it's his mum no
10:42
it is the novelist h.g wells he did that
10:46
yeah
10:46
in 1913 he wrote a book called little
10:49
wars which had the first ever set of
10:51
rules for playing with
10:52
toy soldiers and the full title of the
10:54
book was
10:55
little was a game for boys from 12 years
10:58
of age to 150
11:00
and for that more intelligent sort of
11:02
girl who likes boys games and books
11:05
[Laughter]
11:06
i've never met such a woman
11:12
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:15
that is
11:16
andy my fact is that female grizzly
11:18
bears can get half
11:19
pregnant intriguing
11:23
what does that mean it means they get
11:26
pregnant
11:27
or they are fertilized uh their eggs are
11:30
fertilized
11:31
by a male during mating and then
11:34
they don't do anything about it for
11:37
several months
11:38
so lazy the the egg is fertilized and it
11:41
turns into this tiny bundle of cells
11:42
uh called a blastocyst and that's that's
11:45
normal we have those two
11:46
but in almost all mammals that then
11:49
develops into
11:50
a an embryo uh but in bears it just
11:53
floats around
11:54
in their uterus doing absolutely nothing
11:56
for months on end
11:57
uh and then the bears put on weight for
12:00
winter because they need to hibernate
12:02
they see how much weight they gain and
12:05
if they're up to the right
12:06
level of body fat by the autumn if
12:08
they're 24 body fat
12:10
they will go to their den for winter and
12:11
the blastocyst will implant into the
12:13
wall of their womb and then it will
12:14
develop into a cub
12:15
but if they're not it just gets
12:17
reabsorbed into the body of the female
12:19
so they have this weird internal
12:21
barometer of how
12:22
how well they're doing in terms of
12:24
putting on weight for winter oh my god
12:25
have you seen the pictures
12:27
of these are the specific pictures
12:28
actually published by catmai national
12:29
park in alaska
12:31
is it cat my k-a-t-m-a-i that's how i
12:34
would pronounce it but
12:35
um we've never pronounced anything right
12:37
on this show so
12:38
don't break a tradition so there are
12:41
photos published by this national park
12:43
in alaska
12:44
where the public votes every year on
12:46
which bear wins the
12:47
fastest the best fattening bear and you
12:50
have to check it out because they have
12:51
these photos on their site of
12:52
every bear in their national park and if
12:56
you move this slider along the pictures
12:57
you can see the before and after
12:59
and it's only in the course of two
13:00
months and it is incredible
13:02
that's so cool and it's like like the
13:04
opposite of fat shaming isn't it exactly
13:06
yeah it's like they're going to a weight
13:07
watchers meeting every week and they've
13:09
put on an extra free stove and that's
13:11
getting applauded
13:12
and and it's a huge amount they they eat
13:14
in a huge amount they put on so it's
13:15
called hyperfaggia
13:17
when they just eat constantly for a
13:19
while and they gain
13:20
about two stone per week and so it's
13:23
it's really fun to do i spent most of my
13:25
research scrolling back and forth on
13:26
these photos
13:29
um it's interesting with pregnancy and
13:30
bears i was reading about zoos in
13:32
america
13:32
polar bears the polar bears that they
13:34
have there they don't know how to tell
13:36
if they're pregnant
13:36
it's really hard to tell if a bear is
13:38
pregnant because they often have
13:40
pseudo-pregnancy so it looks like
13:42
they're pregnant they have the hormones
13:44
that show up in labs that say they're
13:46
pregnant but
13:48
they're not it's it just it matches the
13:50
same thing so do you know
13:51
how they find out if they have a
13:53
pregnant polar bear
13:55
no did they just wait and see if a baby
13:56
comes out they often do but that's not
13:58
useful for them because when it comes
14:00
out
14:00
if none come out then they're like damn
14:02
it we need our breeding program to be
14:03
better uh they
14:05
put them in a a ct scanner
14:08
no oh wouldn't that be exciting to see
14:10
um they
14:12
take some urine samples and like no
14:13
because he said the hormones is the same
14:15
yeah they squeeze they run in very
14:17
quickly and they squeeze the middle of
14:19
the bear and then they run out before it
14:21
tears them in two no no no they do
14:24
they send their poo to a dog called
14:27
elvis
14:34
they send the poo to this dog called
14:36
elvis who has a 90
14:38
rate of saying whether or not they're
14:42
pregnant
14:48
they trained this dog um elvis with
14:51
another dog
14:51
and they kept they gave them 200 samples
14:54
to see whether they could break down so
14:55
there's more than 2000 proteins in
14:57
polar bear fecal samples five are
14:59
consistent with pregnancy
15:00
and that's what he was smelling out and
15:02
he has a nice dog this one
15:05
the other dog uh just guessed it at some
15:07
points just faked it just went yep
15:08
and because they needed a reward or
15:10
whatever so they kicked him out of the
15:11
system it is just elvis that they send
15:13
it to oh my goodness yeah
15:14
but yeah that's what they have to do one
15:16
dog is helping them out
15:17
elvis well done elvis here a dog um
15:21
andy you're saying how um most mammals
15:23
um don't do this thing uh
15:25
it's called embryonic diapers isn't it
15:28
um
15:29
rodents do quite a few of them bears do
15:31
as we know armadillos do weasels badges
15:34
and kangaroos
15:35
all do um and some people think that
15:37
maybe humans do
15:39
on a small level um so there have been
15:42
a few case studies where women have had
15:45
in vitro fertilization
15:46
and then found out that they were
15:48
pregnant more than a month later
15:50
like maybe two months later or stuff
15:52
like that and they reckon it might be a
15:54
very minor diapers
15:56
that happens in humans wow but still
15:59
more research needed
16:00
it's a bit of a crap diapers though
16:02
because it is only ever really a week or
16:04
two weeks
16:05
maybe three whereas these bears can hold
16:07
in for a year can't really yeah yeah
16:08
do you guys want to hear something
16:09
mental yeah yeah okay a team of
16:12
scientists
16:13
they put sheep blastocysts these little
16:15
bundles of cells
16:16
into the uteruses of mice okay now sheep
16:19
can't do this diapers thing they just
16:21
can't do it mice can do it
16:23
and the when these sheep blastocysts
16:26
were inserted into mouse uteruses
16:28
they went into pause mode the mice were
16:30
able to pause the blastocysts of a
16:32
different species
16:33
i'm not surprised stressful
16:37
stressful situation for a moment it's a
16:40
difficult birth
16:41
isn't it but then
16:44
they will remove these blastocysts okay
16:46
after the mice pulls them and then they
16:48
will put
16:48
back into um a sort of you know petri
16:52
dish
16:52
um you know fertilization whatever it's
16:54
an artificial thing with cheap
16:56
and they grew into normal lambs right so
16:58
they're not inside the sheets
17:00
they were i think they were put back in
17:02
the sheep or put back in the testy but
17:03
whatever
17:04
they were grown into they grew into
17:06
normal lambs having been
17:08
in a mouse's uterus wow i think it's
17:11
pretty tasteless that you won't
17:12
differentiate between a test tube and a
17:13
sheep mate
17:17
it bears all pregnancy let's go
17:20
bears some brown bears have oral sex
17:24
oh yeah okay okay so this is this is in
17:27
a zoo in croatia it's been noticed
17:28
they're both males
17:30
over 116 hours of observation these two
17:33
males did it 28 times
17:34
in 116 hours once every four hours
17:38
over several days okay impressive really
17:41
yeah
17:42
official study on the matter said it
17:44
might have been because they've been
17:45
deprived of suckling
17:46
and that the provider may have found a
17:48
substitute for teat sucking that also
17:49
resulted in a letdown of substitute milk
17:53
right that
17:59
the is for the most disturbing fact of
18:01
the year
18:04
good grief do you suffer from premature
18:07
letdown of substitute milk
18:11
i think that was i think that was
18:12
presented in a safer worker way as i
18:14
could manage it
18:14
it was very good yeah you did you did
18:16
well and well maybe humans can learn
18:18
from that uh because i don't think
18:21
anyone should be taking lessons
18:25
this is why you're milk peddling
18:31
i'm sorry i don't have any of the milk
18:32
would you take my substitute
18:36
so we can learn some stuff from bears
18:38
though if not that
18:40
we can learn a lot from their
18:42
hibernation period right or their tulpa
18:43
that they go into so
18:45
they are enormously fat as we've said
18:47
when they'll go into this torpor and
18:49
they'll dig their dens and they'll just
18:50
lie there and they don't get so there's
18:53
lots of stuff that we think we should
18:54
look into to find out why they don't get
18:56
for instance um muscle and bone
18:58
deterioration so if people are in
18:59
hospital
19:00
let's say you're in a coma or you're
19:01
confined to hospital for months on end
19:03
you get terrible muscle wastage and bone
19:05
wastage and you get bed sores
19:07
and they don't really get any of that
19:08
and also they remain
19:10
quite alert so i think when animals
19:13
properly hibernate then you really can't
19:14
wake them up
19:15
this is a good thing to be aware of with
19:16
grizzly bears actually they will wake up
19:19
as soon as you go anywhere near them
19:20
if they're in hibernation and they can
19:23
like suddenly snap out of it
19:24
and go for you so i think people were
19:25
studying grizzly bears and they said
19:28
they um i'm just thinking that the worst
19:32
way that a grizzly bear can go for you
19:34
is if it's
19:35
not been suckling very well
19:38
they'll go for any part of you that's
19:40
nearest to be honest
19:42
but uh they did us oh my god
19:45
well no just imagine that scenario
19:47
happening you've got your life but
19:49
you've got to walk back to camp and they
19:50
say how did you survive
19:54
you won't believe this guys i just got
19:56
sucked off by a grizzly bag
19:58
oh my god i took 12 hours 28 times poor
20:06
thing wanted to go back to sleep
20:07
[Laughter]
20:15
disgusting oh my god i've got i've got a
20:18
disgusting bear story just to match
20:20
oh yeah disgusting bear story um so i
20:22
found this really odd account from the
20:23
1700s so there was a
20:25
clergyman from court called arthur
20:27
o'leary
20:29
and he was in northern france and he saw
20:32
a dancing bear
20:34
and this was an incredible dancing bear
20:36
everyone was talking about how amazing
20:37
it was
20:38
um it could sort of count in numbers by
20:40
putting its paw on the ground
20:41
uh it would nod to gentlemen it was uh
20:44
it just did all these sort of really
20:46
graceful things and this guy was
20:47
thinking how is this possible but then
20:49
the giveaway happened when the bear
20:51
suddenly yelled out
20:52
the devil take him the guy has me
20:54
persecuted
20:55
and it turned out what happened and he
20:57
yelled that in irish so this guy
20:58
understood because he was from court
21:00
it turns out that a man had been washed
21:02
up in
21:03
france and sewn into a bear suit
21:07
of a real bear no and was made to
21:10
perform and was stuck inside and that
21:12
was his moment to get out i don't know
21:13
if he knew an irishman was there who'd
21:15
understand his language but
21:17
yeah this is an accounting from the
21:19
1780s
21:20
yeah that is amazing why did he wait so
21:22
long to do it even if you don't
21:23
understand
21:24
irish you know if you hear a human voice
21:26
coming out with something weird yeah
21:27
well it's just you know as a dancing
21:29
bear they thought this was a very
21:30
talented face
21:30
spelling stuff out on the ground you
21:32
could spell out help i am an irish
21:34
man washed up on the beach but you're i
21:36
mean if you're french you might not
21:37
speak
21:38
irish that's true i guess my point is i
21:40
still i don't think
21:42
irish sounded to french people like the
21:44
growl of a bear
21:45
yeah i think if he just shouted
21:47
something
21:48
yeah you'd probably pick up words yeah
21:51
people around you
21:52
yeah exactly bonjour bonjour
21:57
that is quite a story it's bizarre which
21:59
i do not believe
22:00
neither do i but it's it's out there
22:02
really good um so just
22:04
one or two things on pregnancy maybe
22:05
yeah cool um do you guys think it's
22:07
possible to get pregnant
22:09
via a bullet um there is i've heard that
22:12
but it must be a myth
22:13
so there's a civil war article it was
22:16
just after the civil war american
22:17
medical journal it was a proper entry
22:19
from a doctor
22:20
called um legand capers and he had been
22:23
sorry he was called leg and capers oh
22:26
yeah i guess he was
22:27
like like what a weirdo anyway he was
22:28
treating a soldier
22:30
he was the soldier who'd been shot in
22:32
the civil war
22:33
in a skirmish and his testicle had been
22:35
shot off very very painful obviously
22:37
the doctor treated him as quickly as
22:39
possible dressed the wound
22:40
and then was immediately approached by a
22:42
woman who said oh my daughter's been
22:44
very badly wounded
22:45
a stray bullet had hit her in the
22:47
abdominal cavity right unfortunately
22:49
didn't have time to treat her properly
22:50
and the army was fleeing so he left
22:53
seven months later
22:54
he returned and the woman was very
22:55
heavily pregnant
22:57
wow
23:00
the baby was born a little while later
23:03
and the doctor observed
23:04
that after the baby boy was born inside
23:07
the testicles of the baby boy
23:09
was a bullet this sounds like a
23:12
penantella
23:15
and it was written the name of the very
23:20
doctor
23:35
that is i can't remember who made it up
23:37
now i was too involved in the story
23:41
megan and his capers
23:46
[Applause]
23:47
okay it is time for fact number three
23:49
and that is
23:50
james okay my fact is that when the
23:52
vandals
23:53
sacked rome in 455 a.d
23:56
they agreed that they would just take
23:58
the money and not damage
24:00
any of the property
24:04
well this is what i'm trying to do i'm
24:05
trying to rescue the reputation of the
24:07
vandals
24:09
and it is a little bit controversial
24:10
because it obviously happened a long
24:11
long time ago
24:12
and a lot of people who were writing
24:14
about it were roman who were you know
24:16
wanted to say bad things about the
24:17
vandals
24:18
um but it does seem that the reputation
24:21
that we have given
24:22
the vandals for being vandals might not
24:24
be
24:25
fair and actually during this sack of
24:28
rome
24:28
um they'd done a deal with leo the first
24:31
who was the pope at the time
24:32
and he said okay you can come here
24:35
because obviously
24:36
you know we can't really defend
24:37
ourselves so you can come over but
24:39
whatever you do please
24:40
leave all of our churches and all of our
24:42
buildings intact we'll give you the
24:43
money we'll give you the jewels
24:45
we'll give you the gold and silver but
24:47
please don't do that and it seems for
24:48
the most part
24:50
although there was a few deaths and they
24:53
did take a few people as slaves for the
24:54
most part
24:55
as far as pre-medieval sacks go um this
24:58
was actually not one of the worst ones
25:01
but they didn't steal shed loads right
25:02
why don't we just use vandalism to mean
25:05
stealing all the stuff somewhere and
25:07
kidnapping quite a few of the people
25:08
we're just using vandalism to mean the
25:10
wrong thing the one thing they didn't do
25:11
was smash anything else
25:12
really convinced by james's thesis on
25:14
this i had no idea that the vandals were
25:16
relatively nice guys who they were all
25:19
christians
25:20
they were good christian boys and girls
25:22
with it they weren't well they weren't
25:23
good christians if you believe the other
25:25
christians who didn't believe the same
25:26
christian stuff as they believed
25:28
their christian stuff just kind of stuff
25:30
that's that's a that's not relevant but
25:31
they had been pushed out of their
25:33
native lands by the huns yeah the
25:36
vandals were just trying to get down to
25:38
north africa which is where they settled
25:40
and they took over
25:41
carthage and ibiza where they lived for
25:43
80 years
25:44
which i always think is quite cold
25:47
but they're yeah they eventually did
25:49
move down and they lived in north africa
25:51
and they were kind of happy there but
25:53
they were because they had carthage and
25:55
they had a really good
25:56
fleet they were occasionally stealing
25:57
from people and you know going on
25:59
little forays and stuff um but then
26:02
uh in rome there was all sorts of dodgy
26:04
stuff going on so the roman emperor
26:06
valentinian iii
26:07
was murdered by petronius maximus
26:10
because they had a little bit of beef
26:12
between them
26:13
and when petronius maximus took over
26:16
he forced valentinian's widow to marry
26:18
him and forced valentinian's daughter to
26:21
marry his
26:21
son and valentinian's daughter was
26:23
supposed to get married
26:25
to the king of the vandals son and so
26:28
the king of the vandals said well you
26:30
know what if you're going to cancel that
26:31
marriage
26:32
i'm going to cancel our deal and i'm
26:33
going to come over and i'm going to sack
26:35
your city
26:35
and that's what he did and then
26:37
petronius tried to run away from the
26:38
vandals
26:39
but he was stoned by his own people and
26:41
thrown into the tiber
26:42
nice i think it's fair i think it's
26:44
completely fair there was a deal
26:45
petronius maximus broke it the battles
26:47
had every right to sack the city
26:49
yeah yeah it's very game of thrones
26:50
isn't it it really is yeah yeah pope leo
26:52
the first
26:53
um pretty cool character from what i've
26:56
been reading i mean
26:57
he to imagine talking an invading army
27:00
into just not hurting people and just
27:01
taking the valuables and going out
27:03
apart from the people they murdered
27:04
apart from the they murdered and they
27:05
and the temple they brought together
27:07
they didn't break stuff yeah yeah well
27:08
no but he was also the same pope who
27:11
talked until supposedly talked to tiller
27:13
the hun out of
27:14
actually coming to rome at all they sent
27:16
him out they knew attila was on the way
27:18
and he met up with them and he said
27:19
would you mind not coming and attila
27:20
went now okay
27:21
and went off he that's two times that
27:24
he's kind of responsible for
27:25
yeah does he feel like there's more to
27:27
that story isn't there feels like there
27:28
must have been more to the conversation
27:30
than that
27:31
yeah some sort of black male or bribery
27:34
i think he came up and he said you okay
27:35
hun
27:39
you just burst into tears i didn't want
27:41
to hurt anyone
27:42
it's got out of hand i didn't know about
27:44
sacking what
27:46
i don't know why we said sac places why
27:48
you sacrifice why do you say
27:49
because you put everything in sucks when
27:51
you're running off yes is it
27:53
yeah oh it's yeah it's from it i looked
27:55
this up in the uh
27:56
oed and it's from the latin verb sakari
27:59
which means
27:59
put it in a bag nice put it in a bag you
28:02
smoke it
28:03
nothing not everything fits in the sack
28:05
all right all right clever clogs
28:08
i mean they've got other maybe you've
28:11
been using the miniature sex that the uh
28:15
and then
28:16
being a vandal was actually a good thing
28:19
for quite a while
28:20
okay so people thought that the vandals
28:23
were kind of cool
28:24
and a lot of royal families claimed
28:26
descent from the vandals
28:28
the swedish and the danish royal
28:30
families for instance um continued to do
28:32
so until only about 30 years or so ago
28:34
wow
28:35
but there was then a person called henry
28:38
gregoire who was a bishop of blah and he
28:42
used
28:42
[Laughter]
28:48
he used the term in 1794 to describe the
28:52
destruction of
28:53
artwork following the french revolution
28:55
and so that's when the word vandalism
28:57
became
28:58
to mean sort of wrecking things really
29:01
yeah he got obsessed with it didn't he
29:03
there was no one to defend the
29:04
good name of the vandals because at the
29:06
time there wasn't a geographical region
29:08
which which was claiming dissent from
29:11
them well certainly not in that bit of
29:12
france anyway no hadn't been for some
29:14
time
29:14
but i mean because they were quite crap
29:16
in the end and they didn't last very
29:17
long
29:18
and actually they should be grateful for
29:19
de blue because otherwise we wouldn't
29:21
remember them at all i don't think
29:23
they pretty much lasted a years sort of
29:26
fannie around in carthage and bits of
29:27
north africa and the iberian peninsula
29:30
peace loving people they were not a
29:33
peaceful
29:33
people they weren't reasonably peaceful
29:36
i read an account where they
29:38
butchered people up into tiny little
29:40
pieces
29:41
judging them by modern standards which
29:43
is not the way it works
29:45
okay that's fair enough they were all
29:46
doing that in those days yeah exactly
29:48
thank you do you know who their main
29:50
allies were
29:51
no who they were in coalition with was
29:54
the allens it was the vandals on the
29:55
island
29:56
yeah so the vandal kingdom was actually
29:58
the vandal in the allen kingdom
30:01
one more thing about the vandals oh yeah
30:02
uh is that george iii
30:05
married charlotte of mecklenburg
30:06
strelitz and
30:08
she claimed descent from the vandals she
30:10
was one of those so we
30:12
briefly had a queen uh who was a vandal
30:14
and um
30:15
it was really trendy at the time and so
30:18
in the late 1700s they were going to
30:19
make a british colony in north america
30:21
which they were going to call vandalia
30:23
and there are still places in america
30:25
called vandalia including one city that
30:27
was briefly the capital of illinois
30:30
and sports teams from the university of
30:32
idaho are always called the vandals
30:34
because of this trendy time when
30:35
everyone was called vandals that's
30:37
awesome
30:37
that's really good oh they've left their
30:39
mark yeah very odd way
30:42
can i have one favorite vandal oh yeah
30:44
who was the last
30:46
king so the guy who snacked rome was
30:48
actually really good it was geyseric
30:50
and he was impressive the last king was
30:52
a guy called gelimer
30:53
and he spent his whole time running away
30:55
from people who were trying to beat his
30:56
armies
30:57
and fleeing and at one point the only
30:59
reason his life was saved was because it
31:00
was always the byzantines who were after
31:02
him
31:03
at one point the only reason his life
31:04
was saved was because he was fleeing
31:06
john the armenian who was the ruler
31:08
where was he from
31:12
so he's fleeing john the armenian who
31:14
was gonna get him but then pearl john
31:16
the armenian ended up being accidentally
31:18
killed by one of his own bodyguards
31:19
who'd got pissed and was trying to shoot
31:21
a bird with an arrow
31:22
and accidentally got john instead so
31:25
gelimer escapes john this is gelimer mr
31:27
vandal
31:28
and he fled to algeria and he didn't
31:30
like algeria because the diet was bad
31:32
and they lived quite um ascetic lives
31:33
and he was used to luxury
31:35
so then the ruler of the byzantines uh
31:37
said do you want to surrender then if
31:39
you hate it there surrender to me
31:40
and he sent a letter back saying no i
31:42
refuse to surrender but please send me
31:44
some bread a sponge and a liar
31:47
and he explained this is like a tea cozy
31:50
a condom in a
31:51
huntington bed
31:54
he was a distant ancestor of clarkson
31:57
when you say a lie
31:58
you don't mean someone who turns up
31:59
saying i haven't brought a bread or a
32:00
sponge
32:03
uh what are you holding behind your back
32:05
then uh no he said he wanted the bread
32:07
to eat he said he needed the sponge to
32:09
wash his eyes because they were so
32:10
swollen with tears because he was so
32:12
unhappy
32:12
and he said he wanted the liar to play
32:15
alongside a lament that he had composed
32:16
about what a tough time he was having
32:18
and the leader of the byzantines cried
32:22
in sympathy and sent him all the stuff
32:23
he wanted
32:24
oh nice guy yeah that is a peace-loving
32:27
people
32:28
the byzantine people
32:31
well that was rome wasn't it i didn't
32:33
realize that rome
32:34
didn't really collapse until 1453
32:37
a.d but the byzantines were the is that
32:40
the eastern
32:41
lot and they called themselves the
32:42
romans they did not see they didn't say
32:44
we are the byzantine empire and
32:46
what a shame about rome they completely
32:47
saw themselves as the continuation of
32:49
the roman empire
32:50
yeah they just happened to all be
32:51
christians and have moved with the times
32:53
because we called the christians romans
32:55
for a bit and then we just decided no i
32:56
sold it
32:57
i think because these guys have been
32:58
christians for a hundred years or so
33:00
yeah um
33:01
everyone's calling everyone stupid
33:02
things are they
33:04
and everyone called everyone barbarians
33:07
as well
33:07
so barbarian the word barbarian comes
33:10
from the greeks
33:11
used it to mean anyone who wasn't greek
33:13
yeah right and they gave it the word
33:15
because they thought that
33:16
everyone who spoke something that wasn't
33:18
greek was just going blah blah blah blah
33:20
blah blah blah
33:24
so they call them barbarians and so um
33:26
then the romans
33:27
called um all of the germanic tribes
33:30
barbarians but actually the romans were
33:31
barbarians as well according to the
33:33
greeks
33:34
okay they're all barbarians the greeks
33:36
even called other greeks barbarians
33:38
sometimes
33:38
it was just people who didn't weren't
33:40
exactly like you basically
33:42
yes barbarian and there's that weird
33:44
folk etymology that it was
33:46
people who have beards barber means beer
33:48
but i don't think that is true
33:49
no but we're just on beards so there was
33:52
something like i read that was about
33:54
seven sacks of rome over different
33:56
periods of time
33:57
um and in 1527 there was one but that's
34:00
post when you're saying rome the ancient
34:03
rome yes
34:03
so but it still counted as rome i
34:05
suppose it's still growing
34:07
still going is it i don't know
34:08
congratulations guys the city is still
34:10
is always
34:10
yeah yeah yeah okay cause i'm going next
34:13
week so it's gonna be very awkward if it
34:14
disappeared a thousand years ago
34:17
and so in 1527 it was sacked so bad that
34:19
was a really really bad one it was it
34:21
was oh sac city
34:22
it was yeah big sack um that the pope at
34:25
the time clement vii
34:26
grew a beard in mourning it was a sort
34:29
of a display of mourning
34:30
um and he had it until his death in 1534
34:33
but he kick-started a trend amongst
34:35
popes to have beards
34:37
because they didn't have beards up until
34:38
that point there were a few that had but
34:39
the idea is if you were a man of god
34:41
that you had to be clean-shaven
34:42
um but so it was it was seen he was so
34:45
loved i think um that for 24
34:48
subsequent popes they all had a beard
34:51
yeah so he he started a trend of beards
34:53
and pope so that's great oh my god so
34:54
this whole hipster beard trend we keep
34:56
thinking is gonna end clearly by dan's
34:58
face it doesn't seem like it is
35:00
but this could go on for the length of
35:01
24 pope's reigns
35:03
yeah that's a long trend and if you want
35:05
to be a man of god then you can get your
35:07
free trial set
35:13
okay it is time for our final fact of
35:15
the show and that is my fact
35:17
my fact this week is a people who have
35:20
died from laughing
35:21
include a 5th century greek artist who
35:23
couldn't stop laughing at his own
35:25
painting
35:26
and an australian dog trainer who died
35:28
after reading the price difference of
35:30
some commodities in 1915
35:32
as compared to 1920. they were very
35:35
funny
35:36
prices yes with the price gone down or
35:39
up
35:39
i think they'd gone up has anyone looked
35:41
at the price commodities from
35:43
from 1915 i think you have
35:46
well i just about managed to survive
35:49
no i did um it was during the war wasn't
35:52
it so um
35:53
everything went up in price uh including
35:55
wheat that increased by over 50 percent
35:58
to more than six times the pre-war rate
36:00
what by 1920
36:02
um 1915 that was yeah compared to 1920
36:05
though
36:05
i i didn't check those james you just
36:08
like
36:09
you've done half the research here no
36:11
wonder you haven't died laughter
36:14
that's the thing it's dangerous right we
36:15
know it to be dangerous so very risky
36:17
there are lots of stories aren't there
36:18
about people dying laughing but they're
36:20
all a lot of them are a pinch of salt a
36:22
lot of them seem to have had underlying
36:23
medical conditions yeah
36:24
they've been aggravated absolutely but i
36:26
mean that's but they did go out
36:28
still count in the lab yeah um there's
36:30
an ancient story about a seer
36:32
called calcas who died after another
36:35
seer had predicted his death
36:37
and then the others here had been proved
36:38
wrong his prediction had been so wrong
36:40
and calcus laughed and laughed and
36:41
laughed and then died thus proving the
36:44
prediction
36:44
right it's one of those bullet testicle
36:47
baby stories
36:49
i think a lot of these are aren't they
36:51
yeah um so why don't you tell us the
36:52
story of the
36:54
greek artist the greek artist was called
36:56
zeus uh
36:57
z-u-x-i-s zwixus
37:00
like zoegma it's zwitz so the greek
37:04
artist is called zwixus
37:05
uh fifth century bc was he from
37:07
manhattan yeah he was a marx brother
37:10
um he um zwixus uh
37:13
[Laughter]
37:14
he's zoixis so he he died laughing
37:17
because he
37:18
painted because he heard you try to
37:20
pronounce his name
37:24
he was painting the goddess aphrodite um
37:30
um and the uh the old woman who
37:33
commissioned it from him
37:34
insisted that she be the model for the
37:36
portrait right which he thought was
37:37
ridiculous she didn't look like
37:38
aphrodite so
37:39
he painted it and i imagine it's as he
37:42
got to the end final dab on the painting
37:43
he stood back he thought this is so
37:45
ridiculous
37:46
uh that he went into laughter
37:48
convulsions and died
37:50
is the story that we uh that we to
37:52
believe that's good
37:53
yeah whenever she got the painting for
37:54
free you'd just take it away wouldn't
37:56
you yeah
37:56
that's like you roll it up he's amazing
38:00
though zwixus there's one story that's
38:02
related by plenty the elder which is
38:04
that
38:04
he was um he basically got into an art
38:08
battle
38:08
with another massive painter of the time
38:11
um
38:12
what was he called he was called
38:13
parhacius so zwixus and parhacius
38:16
decided to have an art off and they
38:18
arrived
38:19
to this battle both bringing the best
38:21
painting that they could possibly do
38:23
so zoixis pulls back his painting
38:27
to reveal grapes so he pulls a little
38:29
sheet away grapes are there
38:30
the grapes are said to be so real that
38:32
birds fly down from the sky
38:34
and start pecking at the painting
38:36
brilliant huge huge deal it's doing
38:37
really well
38:38
perhapsius then says okay well let me
38:42
unveil my painting which is behind these
38:43
curtains only to reveal
38:45
that the curtains themselves are the
38:47
painting
38:48
so real omg yeah he is an illusion
38:52
uh and he won he beat us yeah i heard
38:54
that zeoxas
38:56
was the one who was trying to push the
38:58
cloth away all right
39:01
okay and so he was like i'm going to
39:03
show what yours looks like
39:04
and he couldn't do it because it was
39:06
painted on there that makes sense
39:07
astonishing yeah
39:08
there's another anecdote that says he
39:10
drew a boy holding the grapes
39:13
and the bird came down to try and peck
39:14
the grapes but he was really unhappy
39:16
about that why might that be
39:18
uh with who zoixes was unhappy when he
39:21
was painting
39:22
no he was unhappy with his own skill
39:25
because the bird wasn't scared of the
39:27
boy exactly yeah
39:29
so the grapes were good enough but
39:31
obviously the boy wasn't good enough
39:32
because the birds weren't scared
39:34
like embarrassing i like it uh there are
39:37
a few more famous
39:38
ancients who died laughing my so my
39:41
favorite which i think
39:42
i read in mary beard's book was the fact
39:44
that
39:45
two famous figures in ancient greece
39:46
were separately recorded as having died
39:48
laughing after seeing a donkey eating
39:50
figs
39:51
and drinking wine okay funny it's funny
39:54
it's ridiculous it's obviously the same
39:56
story that's been pitched by two people
39:58
but so there's one of them which is
40:01
could be
40:02
one very funny donkey doing the rounds
40:04
the greatest comedian of the third
40:05
century
40:06
donkey of death it could have been an
40:07
irishman in a donkey
40:10
just trying to say let me out they
40:12
didn't speak irish in ancient greece
40:16
um so one was recorded by valerius
40:18
maximus
40:19
in the first century a.d but it was
40:21
talking about
40:22
philemon in the third century bc who has
40:24
so he was this master
40:26
chap and his slave had put figs in the
40:29
room with him
40:30
and he watched a donkey start eating the
40:32
figs and he was quite pissed off so he
40:34
called his slave and said come here
40:36
chase that donkey away i don't know why
40:37
he couldn't get up and chase the donkey
40:39
away himself
40:39
um and the slave took a while to arrive
40:41
so by the time the slave had got there
40:43
to chase the donkey away all the figs
40:45
are gone so philemon said
40:47
well you might as well now give the
40:48
donkey some wine
40:50
because and then he found himself
40:54
so hilarious that he laughed that he
40:57
died apparently
40:58
crushing his feeble windpipe with his
41:00
own panting
41:01
and then could i just say so he was
41:04
laughing at his own joke really
41:05
absolutely absolutely
41:06
yeah wow he was a funny guy and then
41:08
exactly the same thing is told about the
41:10
stoic philosopher chrysippus
41:11
apparently he died laughing at the very
41:14
similar joke that he told
41:16
when a donkey was caught eating his figs
41:19
yeah maybe it was just a classic funny
41:21
thing and
41:22
that doesn't quite translate these days
41:24
i can't do
41:25
there must be something we're missing
41:27
well or it's like
41:28
exactly what anna says it's just one
41:30
story i think it's very funny joke
41:34
someone else who supposedly died
41:36
laughing was anthony trollope
41:38
and he was um supposedly reading a book
41:41
called
41:42
vice versa a lesson to fathers by f
41:45
anstey
41:46
and he found a bit in it that was so
41:48
funny that he died laughing
41:50
um but what i find really interesting is
41:52
that this is a really old book
41:54
um but it's about a um businessman who
41:57
finds an indian magic stone and swaps
41:59
body with his
42:00
young son he's basically freaky friday
42:03
[Music]
42:06
all these all these movies 13 going on
42:08
30. yeah
42:09
my as yet unpicked up uh screenplay the
42:12
wrong tree which is a dog body swap
42:14
comedy or does he swap with a tree no
42:16
two dogs swap with each other but one of
42:18
them is a big scary dog and one of them
42:20
is a small
42:21
lap dog why is it the wrong tree because
42:23
they've both been
42:24
because there's a magic tree which
42:26
they're both running around
42:28
god i thought this was a joke but
42:29
actually it's becoming apparent that
42:31
you've had no no
42:31
i i want to jump in and say let's not
42:33
indulge it because this couldn't go on
42:35
for half an hour it's
42:36
really detailed i've got the copyright
42:37
just to make that very very clear what
42:38
about
42:39
two grizzly bears who swap bodies with
42:41
each other
42:51
i got a more recent one that's happened
42:52
1988 someone passed away from laughing
42:54
while they were watching a fish called
42:56
wonder hmm and they were watching a
42:58
scene funny
42:59
yeah funny film they were watching a
43:00
scene where michael palin gets some
43:02
french fries stuffed up his nose
43:04
so michael palin through a bit of comedy
43:06
led to someone's death and what is
43:08
amazing about that is
43:09
in the very first episode of monty
43:10
python palin was part of the team that
43:12
wrote about the funniest joke ever that
43:14
was used in war
43:15
and it kind of life-imitated art there
43:17
really yeah
43:18
on qi the tv show that we all work for
43:21
someone wrote to us probably about 10
43:24
years ago maybe longer i think it's
43:26
before all you guy or youtube started
43:27
and when dan was still there
43:29
and they said that their father was
43:31
watching qi and died laughing
43:33
no yeah and it was obviously sad that
43:36
the father had died but actually he
43:37
really loved the show and it was
43:38
a fitting thing to happen do we know
43:41
which moment
43:42
was it where the acropolis is did they
43:44
not specify no it was before that i
43:46
think it was
43:47
when we brought a donkey on and at some
43:49
things
43:51
it was either the d series or the f
43:53
series i can't remember
43:55
but yeah that's that happened that's how
43:57
nice that he wrote in to say that as
43:59
well
43:59
but laughing was often seen as not a
44:01
good thing to be doing
44:03
so there are lots of people who
44:04
prescribed against it there was a 16th
44:06
century doctor called laura juber
44:09
who described laughter as quite a
44:10
dangerous thing because it could bring
44:12
on fits and fainting and stuff
44:13
and he described it as laughter he
44:16
defined as sparkling of eyes redness of
44:18
face
44:19
sweat coming out of the entire body a
44:21
fusion of tears rising of veins and
44:23
emptying of bowels and bladder
44:26
wow that's why it's so dangerous taking
44:28
a cleaning job at drunkless
44:32
because people empty their bowels and
44:33
bladder if they're laughing is that a
44:34
comedy club
44:35
yes it's a comedy club sorry that was
44:37
really funny but i was just trying to
44:38
hold control of my belt
44:41
um supposedly newton never left and
44:44
there's a story that says that he
44:46
only laughed once in his life when he
44:47
was asked what is the point of studying
44:49
euclid it's classic that is a funny one
44:54
and someone who doesn't laugh is called
44:55
an agelast oh really
44:57
yeah i love the word gelastic laughter
45:00
laughing related
45:01
so i think there are people who have
45:03
sort of gelastic seizures where they
45:04
can't prevent themselves laughing even
45:06
if the occasion doesn't call for it or
45:07
if it's very inappropriate that's right
45:08
and someone who's a misogynistic someone
45:10
who hates laughter
45:12
is that so yeah gets really annoyed but
45:14
gets irritated by it it's all someone
45:16
who loves at japanese soup
45:18
[Laughter]
45:21
i have a stud another study on laughter
45:23
which found that
45:24
um the best way to make a baby laugh oh
45:27
yeah
45:27
yeah and this works for babies between
45:29
about six months and two years shall we
45:30
guess yeah
45:31
um did they are they ticklish oh okay so
45:35
this is normal comedy club rules people
45:37
can't tickle the audience
45:38
[Laughter]
45:41
used to do that okay so
45:44
is it yeah did you just say people said
45:47
it peekaboo but i have a son so i've
45:48
tested
45:49
how to make them laugh have you tested
45:50
the other methods okay so scientists
45:53
measured what made babies laugh
45:54
and they tried four methods one of which
45:56
was peekaboo
45:58
one of which um putting a cup on you on
46:00
your head
46:01
okay i haven't done that it's funny it's
46:04
really funny james is doing it now and
46:05
i'm laughing
46:07
and i'm now just wondering how flat
46:09
james's head must be
46:11
still sitting there i don't think i can
46:13
really talk properly while it's
46:15
oh okay keep it there keep it there so
46:17
one of them is putting a cup on your
46:18
head one of them is pretending a toy
46:19
animal is making the wrong noise have
46:21
you tried that
46:22
taking a toy cat and going no okay
46:24
that's
46:25
worth trying and then the the last one
46:27
is apparently stuffing your mouth with
46:28
material
46:29
just like filling your mouth with cloth
46:31
okay um apparently
46:33
there are five categories of action type
46:36
laughter
46:37
so there are categories of verbal
46:38
laughter like types of joke that make
46:40
you laugh and then things you can do to
46:41
make someone laugh
46:42
this i should specify is according to
46:44
this 16th century doctor
46:46
uh called lauren juba who had
46:48
disapproved of laughter
46:49
but he said laughter's divided into five
46:51
categories category number one
46:53
is exposure of the genitals
46:56
one whole category it's an old faithful
46:59
louis c.k rides again
47:03
category number two a separate category
47:05
exposure of the ass
47:07
different different kind of humor all
47:09
together it is different
47:10
category number three is a pratfall
47:12
which is falling on the ass
47:14
and then there are two more which are
47:16
unrelated misapprehension of taste so
47:18
mistaking something that smells really
47:20
bad for
47:21
something that smells really good and
47:22
stuffing your mouth full of
47:24
cloth
47:28
that's correct i just love that drop
47:31
mooning someone and showing your
47:32
testicles or fanny to them and two
47:34
completely different categories of
47:36
comedy they hated the category one stuff
47:39
tonight but they really went for the
47:40
category too
47:47
okay that's it that is all of our facts
47:49

hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden
00:21
my name is dan shriver i am sitting here
00:24
with anna chazinski andrew hunter murray
00:26
and james harkin
00:27
and once again we have gathered round
00:29
the microphones with our four
00:30
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:32
and in no particular order
00:34
here we go starting with you
00:37
james okay my fact this week is that
00:39
when the world's largest bottle of wine
00:41
sprung a leak this year the owner called
00:44
the local fire department who stopped
00:46
the spillage with sand bags
00:49
wow how big are we talking we're talking
00:52
big
00:52
it was 9.8 feet tall
00:56
2.6 tons in weight and 1590 liters
01:01
i was about the equivalent of 2 000
01:03
bottles of wine
01:04
wow if we lived in a truly uh sort of
01:07
circular recycling
01:08
economy then they would have gone solved
01:10
the wine problem retained the wine and
01:12
used it to put out their next fire
01:14
well they could have done that apart
01:15
from the wine is still drinkable
01:18
believe it or not not the stuff they
01:20
squeegeed off the floor
01:22
well it depends on your standards right
01:24
that's true
01:25
so they took this bottle of wine and
01:28
they
01:28
got all this stuff off the floor and
01:30
then they took the wine from the bottle
01:32
and put it into barrels
01:34
and they've checked it they took it to a
01:36
winery to test
01:37
and it's been deemed fit for consumption
01:39
and they're going to sell it by the
01:40
glass
01:41
at an upcoming event cool that's going
01:43
to take pages
01:44
yeah so why did they build it in the
01:46
first place well they build it because
01:48
people like building large things
01:51
it was just like a publicity stunt i
01:53
suppose it was sold
01:54
to a chinese restaurant in austria
01:57
and they had it on display it was in a
01:59
giant climate-controlled glass chamber
02:02
really cool so it's like a big fridge um
02:04
and they think that's where the problem
02:05
came from they think the
02:07
electricity went off and so when it was
02:09
not as heated
02:10
then wine expands um or liquids expand
02:13
in a bottle when the temperatures are
02:14
changed and they think that's what led
02:16
to the leaking
02:16
yeah well it got cooler in it no it got
02:19
warmer
02:20
so it was in the fridge and it got
02:21
warmer so it expanded and it pushed the
02:23
cork
02:24
up and left a little bit of a gap where
02:26
the wine could come out
02:27
yeah and i guess they brought the fire
02:29
department because they're a bit scared
02:30
about what was going to happen they
02:31
couldn't tell where it was leaking from
02:33
to begin with
02:34
well it's a big lot of glass and they
02:35
worried it might explode exactly so it
02:37
could have just shattered onto them and
02:39
you know that's a lot of ways yeah
02:43
if you order a glass of wine out of this
02:45
bottle do they have
02:46
a sort of bodybuilder who has to come
02:48
and pour it how does that work
02:51
yeah i think that the idea was that the
02:53
wine in the big bottle was probably
02:54
never supposed to be drunk it was just a
02:56
display thing
02:57
but then once it started leaking out
02:59
they were like oh i'm gonna have to
03:01
drink it now
03:02
it's like you know when you have a
03:03
bottle of wine in your fridge
03:05
and suddenly the electricity goes off
03:08
and you're like well i'm going to have
03:08
to drink all the wine in the fridge now
03:10
i don't think that's the thing james i
03:12
don't think so i've had a lot of
03:13
electricity problems in my house
03:15
recently
03:17
so yeah so you were mentioning another
03:20
rival bottle of wine okay yeah i forgot
03:22
about that so
03:23
this has the world guinness world record
03:26
for being the largest
03:27
filled glass wine bottle but when i was
03:29
doing the research for this fact i found
03:31
another one in switzerland that was way
03:32
bigger
03:34
like way way bigger and so i can only
03:36
think that there's some technicality
03:37
that it's
03:38
not made of glass because i couldn't
03:39
quite tell from the images
03:41
or maybe it wasn't full of wine right i
03:43
couldn't really tell so these
03:44
giant bottles of wine they are a thing
03:46
but i didn't know that they're
03:48
that most of the wine on earth is
03:51
transported
03:52
in giant bottles or a huge amount of it
03:54
yeah
03:55
so i okay i didn't know this and then i
03:57
told a few people who are a generation
03:59
older than me and they all knew it so
04:00
maybe this is a generational thing
04:02
but loads of wine when it's shipped it's
04:04
not shipped in bottles it's shipped in
04:06
bulk tankers do you guys know this what
04:08
do you mean like uh
04:09
like a petrol tanker kind of yeah really
04:12
like in a shipping container but
04:14
obviously a special
04:15
container they don't just pour it into a
04:16
shipping container and then seal it up
04:18
but basically a 45 of of the wine
04:21
imported into the uk arrives
04:23
not in a bottle it arrives in these
04:25
massive containers the crappier one
04:27
right because i think if you're getting
04:28
the really hardcore good south of france
04:30
stuff then it's bottled
04:31
in the place yeah quite a lot though i
04:33
mean they bottle so much here and they
04:34
have labels which are
04:36
from you know overseas wines just here
04:38
that they put on so there's a place in
04:39
southwest england uh called avonmouth
04:41
and
04:42
avenmuth uh near the mouth of the river
04:44
avon
04:45
avon muth okay anyway they've got a
04:50
they have a hangar there which is the
04:51
size of 12 football pitches
04:53
and it's owned by a firm who are a
04:56
specialist bottler and they fill up 720
04:59
000 bottles of wine there alone every
05:02
day
05:03
they believe that and they the wine
05:05
arrives in these massive plastic
05:06
bladders basically
05:08
they're called flexi tanks right and
05:10
then they have a special pump and tilt
05:12
system they call it to get the last 150
05:14
liters out of each
05:16
bladder is that when you're sort of
05:17
shaking to get the drugs
05:19
basically and you have to get it you
05:20
have to get it directly into the bottles
05:22
that must be quite difficult
05:32
[Laughter]
05:35
but these these bags are then soaked
05:37
with wine because they're obviously
05:39
you know liquid proof on the outside but
05:41
on the inside they're completely soaked
05:42
with wine
05:43
but those bags are then shredded and
05:45
turned into traffic cones
05:47
no way that's why traffic cones are like
05:49
orangey red in color
05:50
exactly
05:54
but it is maybe why drunk people are
05:56
drawn to traffic cones
05:57
they just know at some level just
05:59
another hit that's amazing isn't that
06:01
that's really
06:02
really good that's like the um kind of
06:05
inheritor of
06:06
butlers because butlers were originally
06:08
bottlers right that's i didn't know that
06:09
was where that comes from
06:12
uh is the king's bottler who would
06:14
bottle up all his wine
06:15
and i suppose they're your modern day
06:16
butlers and even
06:19
um you know that from 1636 to
06:22
1860 it was illegal to sell wine by the
06:24
bottle in the uk
06:26
you would go to the shop and you'd have
06:27
your own bottle with your
06:29
initials on it and then they would fill
06:32
it up
06:32
and they'd work out how much you'd
06:34
bought and by volume and you'd pay by
06:36
volume
06:37
and the reason was wine bottle making
06:40
was kind of quite common in the 17th
06:42
century but not until the 19th century
06:44
could you make it so they were all the
06:45
same size
06:46
and so duplicitous shopkeepers might
06:50
kind of sell you a bottle which is a lot
06:52
smaller than the normal bottles so
06:53
that's why they've made it illegal
06:55
it's gonna be hard to hide your alcohol
06:56
problem when you rock up with 10 bottles
06:59
another big party mr shriver
07:02
isn't that just the same as leaving the
07:04
shop a minute later with 10 bottles
07:06
which is what we do today
07:07
exactly how do you ever hide your
07:09
alcohol problem normally if you're
07:10
leaving
07:11
the supermarket with 10 bottles of wine
07:12
every day i've got a mustache
07:17
you've got a full facial beard how is
07:19
the mustache going to help
07:20
i know it's so distracting they're like
07:22
whoa that guy's weird let's not question
07:23
his story
07:25
i'm kind of annoyed with wine bottles
07:27
though having done the research for this
07:29
fact
07:30
well they're so inefficient they're so
07:32
heavy yeah
07:33
they're made for most of them are made
07:34
from green glass which is quite hard to
07:36
recycle
07:37
and also we import so much and bottled
07:40
so much here that actually even if you
07:41
recycle it it's quite hard to find uses
07:43
for all of it oh well you can get or you
07:44
could get paper wine bottles
07:46
which are an answer to this because i've
07:47
read about those yeah but it's kind of
07:49
sad because it was in 2014 wasn't it
07:51
that they start they sort of went
07:53
um global with them this company and
07:55
they're made from compressed recycled
07:56
paper and so they're incredibly light
07:59
and they so they weighed 65 grams which
08:01
is a seventh of a wine bottle if a wine
08:03
bottle is empty
08:04
and then they had the littles of bagging
08:05
inside you get inside boxed wine
08:07
and really quickly the company um folded
08:12
very clever so that was a real shame is
08:14
that intentional though that when you
08:15
said folded
08:16
it was but i stole it so okay yeah
08:20
but it did the company folded okay you
08:21
could have said crumpled
08:24
it's like that common phrase the company
08:25
crumble that's the way the company
08:28
crumbles
08:29
as they all say um do you know who is
08:32
known as the father of the modern
08:33
bottle oh is it someone famous who we
08:36
would have heard of it's someone not
08:37
famous who you will have heard of
08:39
oh who we will oh is it someone who's
08:40
around around guy fawkes area
08:42
quite close to guys one generation away
08:44
from guy
08:47
it's not no but it's someone i was
08:49
confused with him he's uh kendall
08:52
son
08:57
for anyone just listening this is a four
08:59
year callback you really have to put the
09:01
hours in to be
09:02
having a good time there okay so everett
09:05
bigby
09:06
who was the gunpowder plotter his son
09:09
was sir ken on digby
09:10
and he kind of came up with ways of
09:12
making really good glass
09:14
uh because he was an alchemist and he
09:16
was like taking
09:17
i really felt like you're gonna say
09:18
alcoholic
09:19
[Laughter]
09:21
and he was like adding metals and oxides
09:23
to his sand and making it really really
09:24
hot and making really good glass
09:26
and he could make darker glass as well
09:28
which would make the
09:30
wine not spoil as quickly yeah and so
09:32
that's
09:33
a high achieving family the digby's
09:35
weren't they i found a story about
09:37
um so this fact is about wine leaking
09:39
out and losing
09:40
precious wine um i found a story similar
09:42
to this um
09:43
in canada there's a company called
09:45
mission hill they make wine
09:47
and they had an employee called brent
09:49
crozier and he was a sellerman so he
09:51
worked inside the factory
09:52
and for years his job was blending wines
09:54
and he was transferring them between
09:56
tanks
09:57
um he accidentally left a valve open
09:59
when he wasn't meant to
10:01
as a result six hundred and eighty
10:04
liters
10:04
of sauvignon blanc spilled to the ground
10:07
and went down a drain
10:08
so it cost them a hundred and sixty two
10:10
thousand five hundred dollars
10:12
he was fired obviously um for losing
10:14
that amount but it's not the first time
10:16
he did it
10:17
so back 18 months earlier he left a
10:20
valve open and he flushed 11
10:22
000 liters of wine down the drain and
10:25
they gave him a second chad
10:26
but it does sound to me like there's
10:28
someone in that drain with a massive
10:30
bladder an accomplice doesn't it
10:33
you're right it's a con job yeah did you
10:35
guys see the story or remember the story
10:37
last year
10:37
that tweet that was put out by
10:39
hawkesmore restaurant in manchester
10:41
which was to the customer who
10:43
accidentally got given a bottle of
10:45
chateau le pameral 2001 which is 4
10:49
500 pounds on our menu last night hope
10:51
you enjoyed your evening
10:52
to the member of staff who accidentally
10:54
gave it away chin up one-off mistakes
10:56
happen we love you anyway wow
10:58
okay what a good employer yeah yeah
11:00
that's amazing has that happened again
11:02
since though
11:02
he's been fired repeatedly
11:06
wow that must but the thing is a lot of
11:08
enjoying wine they've shown
11:10
is if you know it's more expensive you
11:12
like it more right
11:13
and if you're thinking you're buying the
11:15
3.99 bottle of wine off the hawkesboro
11:17
menu which
11:18
i don't know if they go down that low
11:19
but if you think you'll buy the cheap
11:20
one you get the expensive one you might
11:22
not enjoy it as much money
11:23
they probably would have i mean no no
11:25
one can be good enough to surely be
11:27
to be i can't differentiate anything
11:29
above about eight or ten quid
11:30
basically okay no but have you ever
11:32
tasted the four thousand five hundred
11:34
you never know that might be yeah i just
11:35
have one every other week and i can't
11:37
taste the difference
11:40
um this massive bottle of wine that i
11:41
talked about at the start you
11:43
could um if you had drank one bottle of
11:46
wine to yourself
11:47
every day since we started this podcast
11:49
six years ago or so
11:51
you'd just be draining the bottom of the
11:52
bottle now that's a great calculation
12:02
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:04
that is
12:05
anna my fact this week is that when
12:08
michelangelo
12:08
sculpted david the town mayor told him
12:11
that the nose was too big
12:13
so michelangelo picked up some dust
12:15
climbed to the top of the statue
12:16
sprinkled the dust down
12:17
and claimed they had fixed it uh so was
12:20
he making like
12:21
um sculpting noises while he was
12:27
he went even further he went even more
12:28
method he did take up a hammer and
12:30
chisel and stuff
12:31
so this is in 1504 and it was when david
12:33
was just being displayed in florence it
12:35
was revealed
12:36
and pierrot soderini was the towns of
12:39
mayor or chief
12:40
anyway soterini said probably displaying
12:42
his artistic uh
12:43
appreciation you know i think the nose
12:45
is a bit out of proportion with the rest
12:46
of the uh
12:47
rest of the thing isn't it trying to go
12:49
up and fix it and michelangelo everyone
12:50
was surprised at the time because
12:52
michelangelo was
12:53
very touchy and really dislike criticism
12:55
and but he said yeah absolutely i'm so
12:57
sorry you're absolutely right it's
12:58
enormous
12:59
and so he picked up a hammer and a
13:01
chisel and secretly a handful of dust
13:03
climbed to the top pretended to chip
13:05
away at it and then sort of really went
13:07
ah that's absolutely perfect just nailed
13:09
it
13:09
stopped there came back down again this
13:11
is like the wine tasting thing with the
13:12
prices
13:13
absolutely if you're told something is
13:14
better you believe it you believe it
13:17
this do we know that this fact is
13:18
completely true
13:20
well it comes from this amazing book
13:22
which is sort of the
13:23
foundational book of all art history
13:25
which is by uh giorgio vasari
13:28
and it's called the lives of most
13:29
excellent painters sculptors and
13:30
architects and
13:31
yeah so he founded art history and it's
13:34
incredible biographies of
13:35
all the great artists up until then um
13:38
or you know not all of them but many of
13:40
them
13:40
many of the florentine ones especially
13:42
and so there's
13:43
a lot of facts are very very true and
13:46
then we think he
13:46
had an eye for drama and like to
13:48
embellish so yeah he was friends with
13:50
michelangelo
13:51
and he was yeah but even this book the
13:54
lives of the artists so the origin story
13:56
of this book is that he was sitting at a
13:57
dinner this is in the 1500s
13:59
at the roman palazzo with the cardinal
14:01
at the time and the cardinal was talking
14:03
about
14:04
a collection of paintings along with the
14:06
other people and
14:07
he kept noticing they were getting dates
14:08
wrong and certainly they're attributing
14:10
certain bits of art to different people
14:11
so he said
14:12
um that if someone was going to collect
14:14
all this information together they
14:15
should have someone who knows it really
14:16
well and they suggested that he do it so
14:18
that was his sort of claim for it
14:19
but the reality is that two of the
14:21
people he claimed that were at the
14:22
dinner with him
14:23
had died already and they don't think he
14:26
was even in rome at the time
14:28
when that dinner was said to have
14:29
happened so he was someone who
14:31
who did have a bit of a um sort of like
14:34
bright blessed or
14:35
yeah he was definitely the brian bless
14:37
yeah maybe because he also claimed that
14:38
he rescued david at one point
14:41
so he was born he was very young when
14:43
david was sculpted but in 1527
14:46
there were these massive riots in
14:47
florence and uh one of the writers it
14:49
was anti-medici riots and
14:50
one of the rioters threw a bench from a
14:52
parapet which knocked off david's arm
14:54
through all three yeah who was this
14:58
goliath
15:00
yeah so his arm came off and vasari says
15:03
that he was a boy at the time he was
15:04
about 16
15:05
and he fought his way through these
15:07
rioting marauding crowds to rescue the
15:09
various pieces of the army it can't be
15:10
true take them to safety
15:12
actually what they didn't say is that
15:13
this was a miniature bench that a
15:15
travelling salesman had brought
15:18
we're going oh i'm mega on call i love
15:19
mixed episode call back
15:21
i love it he had a broken nose
15:23
michelangelo like yeah
15:25
david supposedly did yes oh yeah because
15:28
he
15:28
he got into an argument with one of his
15:30
friends or something yeah right his
15:31
friend threw a bench at him
15:34
uh it was cut he was called pietro
15:36
torriga torigiano
15:38
and he was supposedly envious of
15:40
michelangelo's skills
15:42
and then but he was also had a very bad
15:44
temper and so
15:45
smashed him in the face and he said i
15:47
gave him such a blow on the nose that i
15:49
felt
15:50
bone and cartilage go down like biscuits
15:52
beneath my knuckles
15:54
and this mark of mine he will carry with
15:56
him to the grave
15:58
blimey but it basically screwed its life
16:00
because everyone loved michelangelo
16:02
because michelangelo was with the
16:03
medicis at the time wasn't he so
16:05
um like he had the protection of the of
16:07
the people who ran everything
16:08
right and so terrigiano had to leave
16:10
florence
16:11
he went all the way to england where
16:14
possibly he was hired by henry viii
16:16
and then he started sculpting um nobles
16:19
in england
16:20
and then wanted to go back to florence
16:22
to try and get some help some
16:24
like students and stuff but when he went
16:26
back no one would go with him because
16:27
they remembered what he did to
16:28
michelangelo
16:29
wow this is why you should bully and
16:32
pick on people who are inferior to or
16:34
smaller or less talented than you are
16:36
because if you pick on people above you
16:38
then you will reap the consequences
16:39
won't you you're absolutely right how is
16:41
your
16:41
bully's league coming thanks andy
16:44
you're next by the way
16:48
um so i was looking for michelangelo
16:50
like just what he looked like and he's
16:52
in the sistine chapel
16:53
as a self-portrait we think which is but
16:56
it's not him as a person
16:58
it's not him looking healthy it's him as
16:59
a piece of flayed skin
17:01
oh yeah yeah so there's there's an image
17:03
of the last judgment that's one of the
17:05
bits of the sistine chapel
17:06
and there's some bartholomew trying to
17:08
get into heaven and kind of get god's
17:10
attention say hey
17:11
i'm i'm saying uh let me in and in one
17:13
hand he's holding a knife and in one
17:14
hand he's holding his own flayed skin
17:17
yeah and it says it's he has got skin as
17:19
well so it's not clear when he grew this
17:21
second skin well you can't see him 360
17:25
presumably so maybe it's off his back
17:28
it's the face he's got what he's saying
17:29
is he's got two faces it's not
17:30
completely accurate
17:33
it didn't paint a completely flayed same
17:34
bartholomew might have been a bit grim
17:36
but the hanging skin that this guy's
17:38
clutching
17:39
is michelangelo and we know because he's
17:41
got a little broken nose but then again
17:43
if you break your nose it's the bone
17:44
that breaks it's not the skin
17:46
that breaks and so how can you tell if
17:48
you flay someone's skin how can you tell
17:50
if they've got a broken nose
17:51
that's a good point that's true so he
17:53
knew nothing about anatomy did he but he
17:55
used to paint
17:56
um sort of very uh buff people with an
17:58
eight pack as opposed
18:00
to a six pack um does that exist in
18:02
eight pack
18:03
yeah because it's extremely rare oh okay
18:06
but it does exist i've got one
18:08
yeah we're not talking about cans of
18:11
beer
18:12
oh i haven't got one though so six-pack
18:14
is your basic
18:15
um like muscles of your abdomen yeah but
18:18
a
18:19
very small percentage of people do have
18:20
eight uh muscles down there
18:22
and they think this is a clue as to who
18:24
might have been one of his
18:26
main um people who he based his
18:28
paintings and his sculptures off
18:30
because if you look at a lot of his
18:31
sculptures they all have this particular
18:34
unusual anatomical thing well in 2015 it
18:37
helped to verify
18:38
two pieces that they were tiny bronze
18:39
statues that
18:41
someone had claimed was michelangelo's
18:43
and they said there's no way proving
18:44
they did years and years of research on
18:45
it and
18:46
they had eight packs um they had sort of
18:49
oddly shaped toes which was another
18:50
classic feature of michelangelo's
18:53
and they confirmed them as a result uh
18:55
one of his other things so toes
18:57
eight pack what's another thing that
18:58
might be classic michelangelo
19:00
tiny todger uh no but you're in the
19:02
right area
19:03
enormous testicles anatomically correct
19:07
pubic hair okay that's supposedly
19:10
something that just looks like
19:12
in did you say bronze these are yeah
19:13
these are in bronze that's a tough cast
19:15
in bronze
19:15
yeah very fine yeah i mean
19:18
if you're doing pubic hair i'd be
19:20
surprised if it wasn't anatomically
19:21
correct
19:22
where are you going to put it on the
19:23
belly button as soon as you're choosing
19:25
to do pubic hair
19:27
you're putting it over the pubic region
19:29
aren't you it's classic leonardo to have
19:30
the pubic hair in the ears
19:32
of the people
19:35
um if he wanted to send someone a
19:37
present michelangelo would send them 33
19:39
pairs
19:40
of what of apples
19:44
33 pairs as a present okay one for every
19:46
year of christ's life
19:48
okay do you know why he did that one for
19:51
every year
19:52
christ's life okay so i now understand
19:54
the number but i don't understand why
19:56
that particular object
19:57
no i don't know i don't know he was very
19:59
stingy i know that i think he had a
20:01
reputation for that so maybe they were
20:02
the cheapest thing around at the time
20:04
yeah apparently he was kind of horrible
20:06
uh quite mean bit of a brat
20:08
very difficult to work with a terrible
20:10
snob
20:12
and he when he died they found absolute
20:14
fortune in his house because he was so
20:16
penny pinching throughout his life
20:17
uh he had just duckets in jars all over
20:19
the house he was very old he was like
20:21
88. that's scrooge
20:22
that is scrooge isn't it wow oh it's
20:24
scrooge mcduck
20:26
isn't it kind of swimming in his own
20:28
ducats
20:29
yes yes you're right scrooge mcduckett
20:32
yeah as you say he was very rich do you
20:36
know what his estimated worth was
20:37
of all what is that growth on that 1.6
20:40
million ducats
20:43
uh so 50 000 florins oh great there we
20:46
go yeah
20:46
come on so james was bang on fifty
20:48
thousand florence yeah so it's about
20:50
thirty five million
20:51
in today's money a lot for an artist
20:54
that is
20:54
well he was one of the big ones i
20:55
suppose yeah yeah and he lived a long
20:58
old time 88 is ancient for someone to
21:00
get to so he kept
21:02
working as well yes he didn't he so he
21:04
would have been getting royalties i
21:05
guess from earlier works
21:07
all the way through does the royalty
21:08
system exist with that
21:10
um well it was more kind of dukes wasn't
21:12
it at the time
21:13
yeah i spoke about the medici family
21:16
it's very good if you're an art
21:17
historian
21:18
cool i know i'll do some research and
21:19
get back to you with a lot of historians
21:21
out there absolutely
21:24
um he apparently despite all his wealth
21:26
um was not into personal hygiene
21:28
um he's this is there's a lot of legends
21:31
about him
21:31
and you know giorgio vasari is one of
21:33
the people to perpetuate a lot of those
21:35
um
21:36
so this is not from him i don't believe
21:37
but another legend is that when he died
21:39
because he showered so little of bathe
21:41
so little they had to peel
21:43
his clothes off him because he hadn't
21:45
changed in so long it had sort of
21:47
congealed to his body yeah he wasn't a
21:49
very
21:50
striptease ever
21:53
i'm your michelangelo ground tonight
21:55
i'll be having to feel my congealed
21:57
clothes off my body
21:58
just wait for me to die don't be shocked
22:02
when you see where my pubic hair is
22:03
[Laughter]
22:06
jesus i was upset not to go to your stag
22:08
dude last weekend andy but now i'm
22:09
saying anything i
22:10
got off
22:15
okay it is time for fact number three
22:17
and that
22:18
is andy my fact is that a plane was once
22:21
built which had
22:22
nine wings you would think it would have
22:26
to be an even number
22:27
i know i think this plane actually had
22:29
18 wings
22:30
but that is a controversial theory
22:33
well what okay explain what it is and
22:35
we'll decide whether it's 9 or 18.
22:37
all right so this comes from an article
22:39
on airspacemag.com which is a great
22:41
website about uh
22:42
air and space and this plane was built
22:46
in 1921
22:47
it was called the novi plano and so you
22:49
know how you have a
22:50
normal plane two wings then you've got a
22:52
biplane
22:54
which has two layers of wings
22:57
although that technically the top one
22:59
only counts as one wing supposedly
23:01
okay so does it buy plane have four
23:02
wings or two okay
23:04
the november planner was another level
23:06
it had three
23:08
sets of wings front to back and each one
23:10
was three layers high
23:12
okay okay so like a biplane but turn it
23:15
into a triplane
23:16
yeah and then do that three times yes so
23:19
if you're going by by plane logic it
23:20
just had
23:21
it just had six wings right no no
23:23
because it had three decks
23:24
no i know but didn't have three wings
23:26
each i know but
23:28
aren't you saying that a biplane has two
23:29
wings i i thought you were saying that a
23:31
biplane had three wings
23:33
because it's got two wings as a normal
23:35
plane and then it's got one
23:36
and there's one i thought he was saying
23:38
that too but he wasn't he then confirmed
23:40
that it has
23:40
you think a biplane officially has two
23:42
wings because they count as
23:43
one each it's very weird a monoplane has
23:45
two wings and so does a biplane
23:47
that's frustrating i think then by your
23:49
logic it doesn't matter how many layers
23:51
up it still does one wing
23:52
no way okay this plane wait stop trying
23:54
to destroy the fact
23:55
that it is amazing it looks insane i'm
23:57
gonna put a picture up on twitter
23:59
it's i think you better have it so why
24:02
do we not have this same
24:04
plane taking us to you know tenerife
24:07
well
24:07
it crashed almost immediately oh it's
24:10
second ever test flight it crashed
24:12
um it was i'm amazed it didn't crash on
24:14
its first flight just because
24:16
it's so hard to land on water because it
24:18
was a what's a sea plane though right it
24:19
was a
24:20
it was a flying boat which is slightly
24:21
different to a sea plane
24:23
a floating plane or a flying boat and
24:26
they're different things
24:26
they are different things yeah yeah is
24:28
this about how they identify is it like
24:29
the flying goat sees itself as mostly a
24:31
boat
24:32
so this the seaplane is you know the one
24:35
where indiana jones gets onto it's got
24:37
floats under its feet right
24:39
yes so that they land on water obviously
24:42
all these things
24:42
land we don't have time it
24:45
okay those are the planes which are
24:47
basically look like they're wearing
24:48
massive shoes okay because they float on
24:49
those
24:49
okay thanks then there's flying boats
24:53
and they have the buoyancy built into
24:54
the fuselage so they
24:56
they land basically on water the main
24:58
body of the plane is the thing that's
25:00
floating on the water
25:01
but in the usa sea planes are called
25:03
float planes and
25:04
they use the term seaplane to describe
25:06
both float planes and flying boats
25:08
jesus christ so which one was this
25:12
this is a flame flying flying the flying
25:15
guy so the fuselage
25:16
was basically a boat yeah but then it
25:18
had wings exactly yeah
25:20
yeah and it got smashed up on its second
25:22
ever flight
25:23
and it now exists as a model uh and a
25:25
few bits of wreckage in the museum
25:27
it was in italy it was flying lake
25:28
maggiore really yeah and it was it was
25:30
meant to be a passenger plane wasn't it
25:32
yeah
25:33
yeah the wings were made of linen as far
25:35
as i can tell
25:36
linen well canvas you know it was really
25:38
early days of flight obviously
25:40
god if someone's just attached a sheet
25:42
to the outside of my planes and is
25:43
hoping it's gonna fly i'm not surprised
25:44
it crashed nine sheets
25:47
that's what the phrase nine sheets to
25:48
the wind means isn't it
25:50
is that a phrase i think it's three
25:51
sheets to the width oh it depends how
25:53
you're counting them
25:56
so there's been lots of really cool
25:57
planes in history haven't they there's
25:59
loads of
26:00
especially during military times they
26:01
always try and invent new things and
26:03
you know even when they started making
26:06
airplanes they didn't really know how
26:08
they worked and stuff like that so
26:09
there's lots of different
26:10
ideas um i really like these parasite
26:13
flight
26:14
fighters that they tried to do for most
26:16
of the 20th century
26:18
and the idea is you have one big plane
26:20
and then inside it you have lots of
26:21
little planes and then they fly out and
26:23
attack
26:24
like the town and so the big plane takes
26:26
you there and saves
26:27
all the petrol for the other guys and
26:29
then they can go on little forays
26:32
has it landed or you flying out of a fl
26:34
plane you're flying out of the plane
26:35
mid-flight
26:36
yeah and they've tried to do it loads
26:38
and loads of times usually the problem
26:39
is that they just all crash into each
26:41
other
26:42
that happens quite a lot um but they
26:44
experimented from the 19 from 1915 all
26:46
the way through to late 1950s
26:48
the ussr were the only ones who really
26:50
made anything that was kind of useful
26:52
everyone else tried it and couldn't
26:53
and the reason we don't do it anymore
26:55
and i didn't realize this is a thing
26:57
is these days you can refuel your
26:59
aeroplane while it's flying
27:01
oh isn't that amazing i don't i've never
27:03
noticed they're playing i'm on stopping
27:04
out a petrol station
27:06
well that's when you're in the airport
27:08
that's what the petrol station is they
27:09
come and fill you with petrol right
27:11
yeah but so how do you refuel while it's
27:13
flying it's really weird you just get
27:15
one
27:15
airplane with loads of petrol in it and
27:17
you fly it next to the other plane with
27:19
not much petrol in it and then you
27:20
attach them together
27:21
oh so it's not my planes that i've been
27:23
on that are getting refueled no no no no
27:25
probably not yeah
27:26
but if you've seen the movie air force
27:28
one they refuel the plane
27:29
mid-flight yeah and harrison ford uses
27:31
that as the big moment to sort of get to
27:33
another plane i think i'm wrong you also
27:34
have to have a really long um
27:36
you know the toggles you put in because
27:37
you know it's sometimes quite hard when
27:38
you park your car on the wrong side of a
27:40
petrol
27:40
yeah and you have to stretch it all the
27:42
way around yeah
27:44
yeah if you fly on the wrong side of the
27:45
airplane that's gonna be really awkward
27:47
here okay so
27:48
okay on this on this mid-air thing yeah
27:50
that is insane so there was a
27:51
flying boat okay in the 1930s called the
27:55
short
27:55
empire right and the problem was they
27:58
couldn't get enough fuel into it for it
28:00
to make it all the way across the
28:01
atlantic
28:02
okay so that's the problem but it could
28:05
be loaded with more fuel than it could
28:08
take off with
28:09
so it can only get into the air if it
28:12
has under a certain amount of fuel on it
28:14
but once you get it into the air you can
28:15
load it with extra fuel yeah
28:17
so the idea was this plane took off
28:21
towards the usa from uh britain uh with
28:24
not enough fuel to get there
28:26
yeah and then while it was over ireland
28:29
it would be refueled
28:30
by another plane as it went it would
28:33
take off without enough fuel to get to
28:34
where it was meant to go and it had to
28:36
refuel
28:37
yeah with 800 extra gallons of fuel
28:40
that's extraordinary
28:41
we do have we do have planes now that
28:44
can carry other
28:45
um well flying machines uh there's a
28:48
plane called white knight two
28:50
and this is the well so it's not
28:52
operational yet but it will be within a
28:54
few years i think it looks like a
28:55
catamaran really so
28:57
it or it looks kind of like two planes
28:59
or siamese twins and
29:00
one of their wings is fused yes and oh
29:03
yeah
29:03
it's this incredible looking thing but
29:05
it's actually built to be able to take
29:06
off
29:06
like two planes stuck together and then
29:09
hanging underneath this shared wing
29:11
will be the virgin rocket which will
29:13
then take tourists into space
29:14
so not only do you get to go to space if
29:16
you pay for this but you get the bonus
29:18
of being suspended under a weird double
29:19
siamese plane catamaran thing
29:22
it's it's extraordinary have you ever
29:23
seen footage of it when it
29:25
drops the plane oh no i haven't seen
29:27
that so that's the thing obviously the
29:28
rocket
29:29
can't thrust its uh or boost its
29:32
thrusters
29:33
while it's still attached to this uh
29:34
other plane so it literally
29:36
plummets and they have to turn on the
29:38
engine as they're dropping
29:40
and pump the fuel and then it kind of
29:42
just finds its way so you're in sort of
29:44
freefall
29:44
for a while when you're inside is this
29:46
in the rocket or in the plane in the
29:47
rocket rocket
29:48
wow yeah that's got it imagine if people
29:50
have bought tickets and they're
29:51
listening to this now having not
29:52
realized
29:53
because that sounds terrifying i think
29:54
you would have watched a youtube video
29:56
before pressing
29:57
purchase you're right you just mentioned
29:59
two planes being stuck together is what
30:00
this looks like yeah
30:02
there is only one time as far as i'm
30:04
aware that two planes
30:05
have stuck together mid-flight right
30:08
this is in 1940 this was a training
30:11
flight above australia
30:12
two bomber planes crashed together okay
30:15
disaster obviously except that one of
30:18
them basically jammed
30:19
over the other one and they just got
30:21
stuck together in mid-air
30:23
so the one on top had its wings and its
30:25
controls still intact and the one
30:27
beneath had the engine working
30:29
the pilot of the plane on top managed to
30:32
land
30:34
successfully
30:37
that sounds like it's made up by dan's
30:39
italian
30:40
brian blessed girl i know nobody died
30:44
one person um jumped out and was hit by
30:46
a propeller even he was fine eventually
30:48
he
30:49
covered but it's amazing that it just so
30:51
happens that the engine works for this
30:52
one i know
30:53
the steering was it's like oh the coffee
30:56
machine worked for this one but luckily
30:57
the sandwich maker works on the other
30:59
one
31:00
do you think they had a chat between the
31:01
planes going with like jack spratt and
31:03
his wife aren't we
31:06
just on this um thing that you were
31:08
talking about carrying space shuttles
31:10
um the largest plane that's ever been
31:12
made which was the anatov
31:14
am225 maria which was made in ukraine
31:18
uh in soviet times um this has the
31:21
record
31:21
for the biggest payload ever taken and
31:24
they carried shuttles from one part
31:26
russia to the one part of the soviet
31:28
union to the other
31:29
that was the main job of them uh and one
31:32
time they carried
31:33
a generator for a gas power plant in
31:35
armenia which weighed 247
31:38
000 kilograms which is the weight of 80
31:41
elephants
31:42
and that's the largest payload of any
31:44
aeroplane ever
31:47
amazing and then um it went into
31:49
commercial service in the early 2000s
31:52
and there's no way do you have extra
31:54
luggage because it doesn't matter
31:57
i've got an emotional support
31:59
[Laughter]
32:02
commercial i don't mean you could buy a
32:04
flight okay okay it was used for
32:06
companies
32:06
and actually at one stage the american
32:08
military took
32:09
it and took 216
32:12
000 ready meals to military personnel in
32:16
oman
32:16
wow we are not out of chicken or
32:19
fish it was transparent on 375 pallets
32:25
weighing 187.5
32:27
tons of ready meals oh man um
32:30
do you know why nuclear planes have
32:31
never been tried because
32:33
they sound dangerous they do sound
32:35
dangerous they are dangerous
32:37
so people have kept trying all the way
32:39
through kind of like the um thing you
32:40
were mentioning james the parasite once
32:42
the parasite plants yeah so i think the
32:44
usa have tried i'm sure the soviet union
32:46
tried as well
32:46
basically they could not work out how to
32:48
deal with radiation
32:50
uh and to keep the planes light because
32:52
obviously to protect against radiation
32:54
you need a very heavy
32:55
thick stuff so one thing they considered
32:58
doing this is in the 50s in the usa was
32:59
just hiring pilots who were so elderly
33:02
that they would certainly die before any
33:04
effects of radiation
33:06
got through to them right that was their
33:08
plan what a move
33:10
that's crazy jfk canceled that plan yeah
33:13
yeah yeah
33:14
that being said i found a few sort of
33:17
as we were saying earlier those that
33:18
military period of plane innovation
33:21
which is
33:22
extraordinary decisions they had to make
33:23
so uh when when the navy was out and
33:26
they needed planes that were on their
33:27
ships in the early days they didn't have
33:28
landing strips that were long enough so
33:30
they could launch
33:31
um with some help but they couldn't get
33:33
back because it was too short
33:34
so what they did was they started toying
33:36
with ideas like building a plane which
33:38
this was prototype called the blackburn
33:40
black bird and the idea was that you
33:42
could take off but you weren't meant to
33:43
return the plane
33:45
was designed to be ditched in the ocean
33:47
by the ship
33:48
but luckily all the pilots were so old
33:51
that they were expected to die before
33:53
they got to the
33:54
yeah exactly wait sorry these are
33:56
single-use planes
33:57
they bet no if you were successful you
33:59
came back and you ditched the plane as
34:00
close to the ship as possible
34:02
and hopefully the ship got to you before
34:04
both you and the plane sank
34:06
if it did they would lift the plane back
34:07
onto the ship and then they would
34:09
rebuild it and you could reuse it
34:10
what well they had no choice because
34:12
there was no i'm confused when you say
34:13
ditch the plane do you mean fly into the
34:15
sea yeah fly into the ocean
34:16
yeah yeah so the pilot would be waiting
34:18
with the plane while it's sinking
34:20
another thing they tried um to solve
34:22
that was something called the flying
34:24
pancake
34:25
which and the flying pancake either had
34:27
no wings
34:28
one wing or an infinite number of wings
34:33
it's all winged and it's pancake shaped
34:35
so it's flat yeah and it's kind of
34:37
tilted
34:38
and it's got massive propellers on it
34:40
and so
34:42
if you are sailing into a headwind then
34:44
the wind can help you just take off by
34:46
using the shape of your flying pancake
34:48
and if you weren't going into a headwind
34:50
it had these massive propellers that you
34:51
could create your own headwind
34:53
and so it could like blow air over your
34:56
aerofoil and help you take off that way
34:58
that sounds amazing yeah and they look
35:00
kind of like a flying saucer right they
35:02
do yeah yeah
35:02
don't like the idea of flying something
35:04
called a pancake because i imagine
35:05
pancakes flipping
35:06
180 degrees in the air yeah and the
35:09
reason we don't use them now is
35:10
basically because jet engines came in so
35:12
we didn't need them anymore
35:13
once you had jet engines you could get
35:15
to a really high speed really quickly
35:18
so it did it worked fine yeah it worked
35:20
oh god we've got to talk about the
35:22
inflator plane quickly
35:23
okay just very quickly this was the sort
35:26
of foldable collapsible plane that was
35:28
commissioned by goodyear
35:30
uh of course in the 1950s and it could
35:32
deflate and be transported in like a
35:34
three and a half foot container a little
35:36
container
35:37
and it was actually a brilliant idea so
35:39
it was built in just 12 weeks which does
35:41
not have a worryingly short time in
35:42
which to build an entire plane like
35:44
designed and built
35:46
but goodyear the idea was that a single
35:48
person would be able to hand
35:49
pump it and so you could drop it behind
35:51
enemy lines so you drop it from your
35:53
plane
35:53
behind enemy lines where you know your
35:55
men were captured and they'd have that
35:57
little hand pump on the ground i suppose
35:58
waiting for this moment
35:59
and they'd pump it up uh until it got
36:02
big enough and then they could take off
36:03
so i didn't have like a little uh little
36:05
tube in case your pump wasn't working so
36:07
you could blow it by mouth
36:08
i think it must have yeah yeah
36:15
anyway look it had a test flight in 1957
36:18
and
36:18
uh it sort of went into a spiral and one
36:20
of the wings got floppy and folded on
36:21
top of it
36:22
and uh got chopped off by the propeller
36:24
and
36:25
so it never really it really never took
36:27
off
36:29
i'll tell you what with that at your um
36:31
paper company folding
36:33
it's been a bad day it's been a bad day
36:35
for puns worldwide
36:38
okay it is time for our final fact of
36:40
the show and that is my fact
36:42
my fact is that this year a sperm bank
36:45
lost a court case
36:46
to a man named dick weiner
36:49
so this has happened in oregon in
36:52
america and
36:53
um the jury who was uh dealing with the
36:55
case awarded 400 000 american dollars
36:57
to two oregon dog breeders because the
37:00
international canine semen bank
37:02
accidentally destroyed both of their
37:03
labrador sperms why did you not tell us
37:05
the name of the other breeder
37:07
yeah um because fanny vagina
37:10
is not as interesting to be fair so this
37:14
is from oregon live
37:15
which is is a big newspaper in oregon
37:18
but um
37:19
in every other report i've seen it's
37:21
richard weiner uh and only just
37:23
discovered that before we came
37:24
upstairs to record this so but he's
37:26
still it's still you know
37:27
my parents should have known his name's
37:29
dick wiener his name's dick wiener
37:30
exactly
37:31
so yeah this is amazing yeah i didn't
37:33
know there wer was an international
37:35
canine
37:36
semen bank did you know no i didn't do
37:38
your banquet
37:42
i just keep all of mine in barclays
37:46
[Music]
37:48
barclays
37:50
yeah it's crazy it's big industry isn't
37:52
it and it seems to be getting bigger so
37:53
it used to exist mainly for
37:55
professional dog breeders so that if you
37:57
had you know a top dog then you could
37:59
pass on their jeans for generations
38:01
but now it seems to be just sentimental
38:03
dog owners who want an exact copy of
38:05
their beloved pet
38:06
before you know after they've died and
38:08
they send off people who don't know how
38:10
genetics works
38:11
basically you won't you will get a
38:13
quarter of the dog you had
38:15
well it's better than nothing isn't it
38:16
andy yeah yeah we should say
38:18
this mistake with the dog seaman that
38:21
dick weiner
38:22
um found this happened 20 years ago yeah
38:24
this story goes all the way back wow
38:27
i know well no no it's it's they they
38:29
knew that they stuffed up 20 years ago
38:31
exactly dick weiner only found out a few
38:32
years ago
38:33
because of ex-employee told him randomly
38:35
he was like by the way
38:36
yeah he was a whistleblower yeah so that
38:38
he deposited the sperm in the 90s i
38:40
think
38:40
yeah in the maybe late 90s early
38:42
naughties it was accidentally thought
38:44
out
38:44
making it worthless and then 20 nearly
38:47
20 years later a disgruntled ex-employee
38:49
must have told him
38:50
unfortunately this guy who thought out
38:52
the um sperm had done the same thing 18
38:54
months earlier hadn't he
38:58
500 000 liters was flushed away
39:04
okay well i looked up their costs the
39:06
international semen bank
39:08
canine seaman bank very important um
39:11
for to store your dog semen for a year
39:14
it's 324
39:15
to deposit and store it for a year but
39:17
then every year after that
39:19
is 79 a year which is i think
39:22
uh what amazon prime used to cost
39:26
it's a very different service isn't it
39:28
you've got to weigh it up when you're
39:29
making your budget choices
39:31
but a new another thing you can do with
39:33
this these banks and this is not we
39:35
should say other dog semen banks are
39:36
available we're not you know
39:38
um but another thing you can do i think
39:41
is ship your dog's testicles to them
39:43
after your dog has been neutered
39:44
you absolutely can yeah what snip them
39:46
off and ship them off snip them off and
39:48
ship them off
39:51
this is what you do wow you can get
39:53
instructions of how to do it yourself i
39:54
think so most people do it at a vet and
39:56
say would you mind sending these balls
39:58
to the bank but um they
39:59
sometimes do
40:03
some banks do give instructions on how
40:04
to package up your testicles and you
40:06
have to send them off
40:06
asap within two or three hours
40:10
yeah you must have to send them in a
40:12
special cool
40:13
cool box yeah i think you must do yeah
40:15
you've got to order the packaging
40:16
just walk into the into the royal mail
40:19
with a pair of
40:21
dog knackers and buy an envelope can you
40:24
no and well if you do you've got to go
40:25
first class because it really is time
40:27
[Laughter]
40:28
do you know um who did the first ever
40:30
artificial insemination of a dog
40:38
no it was none of the digby clan it was
40:40
an italian physiologist called lazzaro
40:42
spallanzini
40:44
uh and we probably have you guys heard
40:46
of him i'm sure
40:47
what was his thing frogs frogs
40:53
[Laughter]
40:55
he is most famous among ui researchers
40:58
at least for putting
40:59
male frogs in form-fitting rubber pants
41:03
um to prove that um that they couldn't
41:06
fertilize eggs
41:07
if they couldn't get what was in their
41:09
genitals out over the eggs right if you
41:11
know what i mean yeah so he
41:12
basically proved how reproduction worked
41:15
he also was the first person to
41:17
note the effect of cooling on human
41:19
sperm so you know how they say that you
41:21
should wear
41:23
at least warm-ish underpants if you want
41:25
to conceive babies is that right then
41:27
you've
41:27
um yeah they're not too tight but yeah
41:30
you need to keep it loose flowing um
41:32
no loose is not as as good for you they
41:34
need to be kept
41:35
reasonably warm yes and you don't put
41:37
your testicles
41:39
in on ice basically okay you don't heat
41:41
your own baths so it's a very odd
41:43
sort of warm you need to keep it at the
41:45
right temperature but he was the first
41:46
person to notice that and he
41:48
noted that um if you put sperm on snow
41:51
they would stop swimming around wow wow
41:55
so he would have he would have had
41:57
microscope technology i guess this was
41:59
uh
41:59
this was after what's his name yeah live
42:02
and hook
42:03
oh yeah yeah yeah gosh that is really
42:06
very cool yeah cool guy
42:12
they just don't go to public school and
42:14
the first person to uh make
42:16
um puppies from frozen dog seamen uh was
42:19
a guy called stephen w
42:21
j sega uh he's still alive actually he's
42:24
a veterinarian from ireland who uh moved
42:26
to oregon
42:27
and this was in 1969 and they
42:30
um made some baby labradors uh
42:33
and they called them popsicles because
42:35
they came from frozen
42:37
semen wait very cool did you say
42:39
popsicles
42:40
well that would have been good wouldn't
42:42
it the article i read says popsicles but
42:45
popsicles would be way better yeah
42:46
so maybe that's not a correct thing guys
42:49
have you ever seen fish
42:50
being artificially inseminated no oh my
42:53
gosh
42:54
it's incredible i can't emphasize enough
42:56
how much you have to watch this video on
42:58
youtube but basically
42:59
on a lot of fish farms it's more
43:01
efficient or if you really want to
43:02
control like how many fish are being
43:04
inseminated
43:05
then you do it artificially and the way
43:07
they do it i actually learned this
43:08
in an interview with a guy called mike
43:10
freeze which seems kind of almost
43:12
suitable
43:13
who is a fish farmer in the u.s and then
43:17
i was led to this video of koi fish
43:19
breeding so koi karp
43:21
very expensive and they are being bred
43:23
at kentucky state university
43:25
look it up basically they get the female
43:27
out of the water
43:28
and she's alive and gets laid down in
43:30
some paper towel for some reason
43:32
and then just lift it up and massage
43:35
from top to bottom
43:36
and you squeeze the eggs out and what
43:38
the eggs are is this thick
43:40
brownie green slime that just spouts out
43:43
is incredible it's like sludge coming
43:45
out
43:45
so they put that in a bowl pop her back
43:47
in the water get the ladder out do
43:49
exactly the same with him and it's a
43:51
little bit less
43:52
but you squeeze it out like it looks
43:53
like mayonnaise coming out of mayonnaise
43:55
thing
43:55
and then you just stir it up together
43:56
like you're making a cake wow and they
43:58
mix it together
43:59
and then you leave that for three to
44:00
five minutes and pop it back
44:04
it sounds like a recipe yes
44:08
[Laughter]
44:09
it's very important to do this with koi
44:10
cup because they're very shy aren't they
44:12
[Laughter]
44:14
i have uh something about uh crafts
44:16
because
44:17
it's about champion dogs yes only one
44:19
dog has ever pooed live in the middle of
44:21
a crushed event
44:23
did he win or she win instant
44:25
disqualification
44:27
it's it's the video is on youtube we're
44:29
doing a lot of youtube recommendations
44:30
today youtube's going to be getting some
44:32
real hits after this podcast
44:33
it's incredible it's 2012. uh this is
44:36
the only one i've found
44:37
it's we should sorry quickly would you
44:38
say for international listeners cross is
44:40
the biggest dog show in the world so i
44:41
don't think this is well known outside
44:42
of this country but it's
44:44
a massive industry it's all we talk
44:45
about but yeah sorry craft biggest dog
44:47
show in the world
44:48
and and it was in 2012 and
44:51
the video is online of the full attempt
44:53
because you know they have to do the
44:54
full course
44:55
the slalom and they do the seesaw and
44:57
then they do the jumping over things
44:59
anyway the reaction of the crowd is so
45:02
funny because it's an amazing run it's
45:04
going so well and then the dog just
45:06
absolutely stops dead and squats down
45:08
and the whole crowd goes
45:10
oh amazing
45:14
and the owner gets handed a plastic bag
45:16
by a crushed ball
45:21
[Laughter]
45:24
it's a really funny video what are they
45:26
such mad names in crafts
45:27
it's bizarre so you have to your dog
45:30
name has to be
45:31
involved the name of the breeder
45:32
somewhere but i was looking at the best
45:34
in shows
45:35
and the list so the most recent was
45:36
called planet waves forever young
45:38
daydream believers
45:41
i think last year the year before it was
45:42

45:55
good reason why except that you know
45:56
you're not supposed to have replicated
45:57
names
45:58
but they can't have run out of words so
46:00
much that all you could use is iraqi

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:18
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:20
qi offices in covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:25
here with james harkin
00:26
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:30
the microphones with our four
00:32
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with you
00:39
andy my fact is that pompeii's new drain
00:42
system is 2
00:43
300 years old yeah so this is
00:47
um in pompeii they have a set of storm
00:50
drains
00:50
underneath the city that were several
00:52
meters down so they weren't really
00:54
affected when vesuvius hit
00:56
and i don't think any storm train would
00:58
have been able to drain away
01:01
from vesuvius that's a good point um but
01:04
yeah so there's the system which they're
01:05
450 meters long they're quite big so if
01:08
you're a human you can crawl along it
01:09
without too much discomfort right and it
01:12
turns out
01:12
they've been looked into they're so
01:15
clean and empty and
01:16
well built that they're going to be used
01:18
again
01:20
and they're looking into another stretch
01:21
of 500 meters of drains just to see if
01:23
we can open those up as well
01:25
and so this kind of system is for taking
01:28
water that comes out of rivers or comes
01:30
from the air and taking it down to the
01:32
sea
01:32
it's not so much for sewage right right
01:35
yes
01:36
because this is what the roman sewers
01:38
were all about
01:39
if you had a toilet in your house it
01:41
would probably go into a cesspit it
01:43
wouldn't be attached to the sewage
01:45
system every now and then they could do
01:46
but the problem was there was no
01:48
grating between the sewer and your
01:51
toilet and so
01:52
if you had a toilet and you attached it
01:53
to the sewer everything could come the
01:56
other way as well as you said
01:58
yes yeah yeah yeah oh that's great so
02:00
that's why we know so much about their
02:02
eating habits because they were just
02:03
sitting in these cesspits because
02:05
they had bizarre menus like we've
02:07
discovered things that they ate there
02:08
that include sea urchin
02:10
flamingo and the only example of a
02:12
giraffe leg
02:13
in all of ancient rome it's found in
02:15
pompeii wow i think it's the shops that
02:18
they found did they not look at the
02:19
shops in pompei and they found all that
02:20
stuff what do you mean they had it in
02:22
the shop so
02:22
there's a shop front with a giraffe leg
02:25
on the window in the window
02:26
so um obviously everything was kind of
02:28
preserved quite well in
02:29
pompeii right because of the the old
02:31
volcano
02:33
but they did a survey of 20 shops near
02:35
pompei's gates
02:36
and they looked at what was in the shops
02:38
that was preserved and they found
02:40
like dan says the shellfish and the
02:42
jurassic bone and also
02:43
um spices that came all the way from
02:45
indonesia oh wow wow
02:47
because actually if you reflect on it it
02:49
would have been weird if they'd found a
02:50
full giraffe leg in the sewer that
02:52
someone had
02:52
excreted out wouldn't it that would have
02:54
been a painful session that's a hell of
02:56
a log yeah
02:57
oh god a good point they did used to be
02:59
terrified of things
03:00
leaping back up didn't they and there
03:01
used to be rumors that there were demons
03:03
that would jump up from the sewers or
03:05
giraffes
03:06
or giraffes with only a leg remaining
03:10
and um yeah i think rats would crawl up
03:12
quite often
03:13
there is one story and this is from i
03:15
think about the first century id there
03:17
was an author called alien
03:18
uh alien uh it's an a-e-l-i-a-n all
03:21
right he was not an alien he's a roman
03:23
historian
03:24
very serious guy we're not certain um
03:27
but basically all of these suspect
03:28
toilets that james has just mentioned
03:30
they were kept in the
03:32
kitchen quite frequently of the house so
03:34
you'd literally have the hob and then
03:35
next to it you just have a little wooden
03:37
toilet seat and you just do your
03:39
business convenient
03:40
if you're in the middle of cooking a
03:42
risotto and you can't step away for too
03:43
long it's very convenient
03:45
and i think a lot of people who have
03:46
flats in london can really empathize
03:48
with this
03:49
i was going to say in my father i used
03:51
to live in the toilet is basically in
03:52
the kitchen
03:53
is it the end of the kitchen and the
03:54
door's never closed right well that's
03:56
disgusting
03:56
so okay why is the door that's your
04:00
decision not to close that door
04:02
it actually is quite annoying when you
04:04
close the door you can't open the fridge
04:05
to access the freezer it's a really
04:06
silly build system
04:07
it's quite a bad design sorry if you've
04:09
closed the toilet door you can't open
04:10
your own fridge
04:12
the door handle gets in the way it was a
04:13
cock-up in the construction process
04:15
that no one's ever remedied okay so
04:17
right just stepping away from anna's
04:19
horrible horrible life for a minute this
04:23
this author alien he wrote about a
04:26
merchant in a city because
04:27
they were all suspect they didn't really
04:29
have traps you know they didn't have any
04:31
barrier
04:31
yeah so there was one merchant wealthy
04:34
iberian merchant living in the city
04:35
and every night there was this giant
04:37
octopus that would swim up
04:39
his toilet and it would come out into
04:41
the kitchen and eat all the pickled fish
04:43
that he had in the pantry sounds like
04:44
nonsense
04:45
it's true it's true this is the story he
04:47
wrote obviously it may not be completely
04:49
true and also it's written by
04:50
alien just in pompei
04:54
so we're finding out a lot more about it
04:56
at the moment because archaeologists
04:58
keep digging up new things
04:59
and one thing they've just discovered
05:01
quite recently is that
05:02
pompeian red which is the walls are all
05:05
if you go there it's beautiful
05:06
stunning red what turns out that's the
05:08
wrong color a lot of that
05:10
was yellow and it was as a result of the
05:12
gases from the volcano
05:14
that it changed the color so a lot of
05:16
pompeii was red but
05:18
not as much as it is now well that's
05:20
like much of the rest of pompeii doesn't
05:22
have any color on it anymore
05:24
so i think in the amphitheater it used
05:25
to be covered in stunning frescoes and
05:28
sort of pictures of
05:29
bull fights and chariot races and
05:30
gladiators fighting each other
05:32
and when it was excavated in 1815 so
05:35
they excavated it and that had all been
05:36
perfectly preserved for almost 2
05:38
000 years and within a few months it
05:41
completely vanished
05:42
because as soon as it was being eroded
05:44
and destroyed by frost and stuff no
05:45
trace of it was left so after 2000 years
05:47
you just lift the lid on it it goes away
05:49
i have a fact about the amphitheater the
05:52
pompeii men were so rowdy fighting the
05:55
neighbors
05:55
in their nearby town that their
05:57
amphitheater got closed down for 10
05:58
years as a punishment
06:00
really yeah what do you mean like
06:01
hooliganism yeah exactly yeah really
06:03
imagine that a 10-year ban from all
06:06
sports
06:06
yeah that's quite a lot it's your dream
06:08
isn't it yeah
06:10
in the amphitheaters what would they be
06:12
watching i assume that was like
06:13
gallaudet people killing each other
06:16
right if you're not gonna behave but
06:18
you're not gonna watch people murder
06:19
each other
06:20
you're only allowed to murder each other
06:22
in one place in the town whenever you go
06:24
and watch a sport you don't
06:25
automatically start doing that sport in
06:27
the terrace
06:28
you don't go to the horse race then you
06:30
turn around in all the crowd you're on
06:31
horses
06:32
every time i watch stand-up with dan he
06:34
gets up in the middle of the audience
06:36
and starts reciting his eight-year-old
06:37
jokes it's really awkward
06:40
when you say eight-year-old jokes you
06:41
mean jokes that eight-year-old will be
06:42
proud of
06:43
or no their jokes are exclusively about
06:46
eight-year-olds
06:49
um so do you know what people did when
06:51
the volcano first
06:52
erupted so there was one day where it
06:55
was raining small rocks from the sky and
06:57
it was you know clearly something had
06:59
gone on and there'd been an eruption
07:01
did they go to the um volcano and look
07:03
at it like rubber neck it
07:04
oh i don't i don't think so but the
07:08
main thing that people did to protect
07:10
themselves was
07:11
to tie pillows onto their heads and they
07:14
just walked around with pillows on their
07:15
heads all day
07:16
and then a lot of people actually got
07:17
away most most people who lived in the
07:19
town escaped yeah and then the next
07:21
morning the pyroclastic flow came which
07:23
was
07:24
thousands of miles an hour i think and
07:26
that just blasted anyone who was
07:28
still left in there but did people could
07:30
do anything no
07:31
the biggest pillow in the world
07:32
[Laughter]
07:35
you know how we've got the famous
07:36
plaster casts that of people so you've
07:39
seen them have you've been haven't you
07:40
done yes yes
07:40
there's a famous shape so the ash
07:42
covered bodies and then there's a big
07:43
hole where the body used to be
07:44
but there's not just plaster casts of
07:46
the bodies of the people
07:48
there's also plaster casts of the plants
07:50
so this is just a secondary very
07:52
exciting thing that no one talks about
07:54
but basically it's a really good way of
07:56
finding out what they were growing in
07:57
their gardens because
07:58
as well as covering the people the ash
08:00
covered kind of all the plants and the
08:01
trees and the herbs and stuff
08:03
and it got into their root systems and
08:05
then the roots disintegrate
08:07
and they poured plaster in when they
08:08
excavated and now they've got a perfect
08:10
plaster cast of the root
08:12
systems of pompeii that's so cool that's
08:14
really really cool although
08:15
i can understand why they went for the
08:17
humans first
08:18
[Laughter]
08:20
it was so clever just making those just
08:22
discovering a hole and realizing this is
08:23
a person-shaped hole
08:24
do you think so is would you not think
08:26
if you saw a hole that was in the shape
08:28
of a person you would know
08:29
immediately that it was or no i well i
08:31
guess if i was just digging downwards
08:33
i wouldn't automatically think this is
08:34
shaped like a person i guess it's how
08:36
quickly you're right actually because
08:37
i'm kind of imagining
08:38
you remember that game show hole in the
08:40
wall where celebrities
08:41
had to make a shape and that the shape
08:43
of the body would come towards them yeah
08:45
it wouldn't be quite as obvious as that
08:46
would it i guess not because you're
08:48
excavating a whole
08:50
plane of rubble and dash yeah
08:54
[Laughter]
08:57
and it's quite a dangerous place to go
08:58
to pompeii still
09:00
yeah for one bizarre reason which is if
09:02
you walk in the wrong spot you might be
09:04
blown up by a world war ii bomb
09:06
so it's unexploded bombs so this was in
09:08
1943 the allied forces
09:11
had rumors come out that there was a lot
09:13
of nazis
09:14
huddling up in pompeii because actually
09:16
i was going to say what's the point of
09:18
bombing
09:18
a place which has already been destroyed
09:20
by a volcano yes it seems a bit like
09:22
overkill yeah
09:23
so that's what they thought they thought
09:24
the germans were there so these were
09:26
rumors so they went over and they
09:27
dropped 165 bombs
09:29
over pompeii uh exploding a lot of stuff
09:32
um but
09:33
nazis just had pillows
09:37
eight to ten percent of bombs that were
09:39
dropped during the war is said to be
09:40
unexploded when they land in a spot so
09:42
um they actually have found a few while
09:44
excavating looking for humans they
09:46
suddenly come across oh that's a bit
09:47
bomb-shaped
09:48
um
09:52
there weren't any nazis hiding there so
09:53
did they just drop a bunch of bombs
09:55
it was completely wrong yeah it was
09:56
completely wrong there was a few there
09:57
was a few things like those
09:58
artillery and a few tanks but they
10:01
definitely weren't people it wasn't a
10:02
camp
10:03
so yeah so they found a few but they
10:04
expect that there's about 10 in total
10:06
to find and so they're finding it in all
10:08
the spots that are not open to the
10:10
public they're sort of
10:11
the areas that they're now excavating
10:13
there is a link between the
10:14
bombings of pompeii and the eruption at
10:17
pompeii
10:18
happen on the same day and in the same
10:20
place and in the same place
10:22
really at the same really 24th of august
10:25
wow yeah i don't know if that was chosen
10:26
as a
10:27
tribute to the volcano i suspect not i
10:29
suppose though
10:30
all you can take from that data is don't
10:32
go to pompeii on the 24th of august
10:34
absolutely
10:35
yeah um just because you mentioned bombs
10:38
and to take it quickly back to latrines
10:41
they used to explode sometimes so people
10:43
in pompei were used to the old explosion
10:45
so they could explode up your bottom
10:47
you'd be sitting on the opening so
10:49
you've probably seen the
10:51
latrines in ancient rome where you'd
10:52
have public latrine you need to sit on
10:54
this hole and it was that keyhole shaped
10:55
hole
10:56
so you had a little a bigger opening
10:59
near the bottom so you could get your
11:00
sponge
11:01
brush in so you could wipe your bun with
11:03
it but
11:04
sometimes there'd be an explosion that
11:06
would come up through that hole and that
11:07
was because of the mixture of
11:09
methane and hydrogen sulfide which
11:11
caused explosions
11:13
yeah set fire you could always wear a
11:15
pillow on your bottom whenever you go
11:17
to the toilet remind me not to come and
11:20
stay at your place it's all right i've
11:22
left a mint on your pillow
11:26
oh god um and also these public toilets
11:30
it was like 20 at a time wasn't it
11:32
there was loads of people there and
11:33
there was basically there was no privacy
11:35
it wasn't like cubicles or anything like
11:36
this
11:37
but you didn't really need it because
11:38
you were wearing a toga so you could
11:41
hide your shame by covering yourself in
11:44
a toga yeah because we have this
11:46
impression that they really didn't care
11:47
and i guess
11:48
i don't think they did care about
11:49
privacy nearly as much as people did
11:51
subsequently
11:51
but uh there is one latrine that's been
11:54
found with a revolving door
11:56
or what we think was a revolving door
11:58
you could do with one of those
12:00
next to your fridge couldn't you totally
12:04
this is actually based on like a hole in
12:06
the ground which they think they put a
12:07
pole in and a door would just spin
12:09
because what people were doing when it
12:10
was a normal door was just leaving the
12:12
door wide open because it stanked like
12:13
in there right and they wanted to
12:14
erase it
12:15
but then people could just look in and
12:17
so they included a revolving door so you
12:19
couldn't leave it open but revolving
12:20
doors we've said before
12:21
they keep air in very effectively so
12:23
what is my worst
12:24
yeah it probably would have smelled
12:25
worse but you couldn't leave it open you
12:27
were just stuck with the smell but at
12:28
least you had your privacy
12:29
okay okay you've got to make a sacrifice
12:31
sure yeah yes
12:32
uh we're gonna have to move on in a sec
12:34
to our next fact
12:35
have you heard of unblocktober on or you
12:38
go around unblocking people's toilets as
12:40
a charity service
12:42
is it that you just don't eat meat so
12:43
your stools are not quite as heavy
12:46
it's not bad is that why people are
12:48
vegetarian
12:50
they're sick of the heavy stools
12:54
shout out to righteous leg the other
12:55
time gosh
12:57
no guys it's to stop fat bugs and to
13:00
stop
13:02
whole sewage systems from being blocked
13:04
up so they send you a resource pack for
13:06
your workplace at home
13:08
and they advise you about how to improve
13:10
the country's sewers and basically it's
13:11
all things like
13:12
not putting uh oil down the sink because
13:15
when the oil
13:16
clubs together in the sewers it creates
13:18
a fat burger and it creates a nightmare
13:19
and they send you a list of things not
13:20
to throw down the sink or the toilet
13:23
like nappies which i would have thought
13:24
was quite obvious but uh right
13:26
wet wipes and condoms and cotton buds
13:28
and butter
13:31
butter is one of the things he's putting
13:33
butter down the toilet
13:36
no one is are they the only reason i can
13:39
think of that is if you're buttering
13:41
yourself up because you want to slip
13:42
down there yourself
13:44
to go and retrieve that wet wipe you
13:46
accidentally dropped in
13:50
okay it's time for fact number two and
13:52
that is james okay my fact this week is
13:55
that there is a factory in iran
13:57
that makes 2 000 u.s british and israeli
14:00
flags
14:00
every month specifically for people to
14:03
burn
14:04
wow this is how quickly after buying
14:07
them
14:07
are you allowed to burn it well i don't
14:09
think there are any rules in iran
14:10
against burning u.s flags
14:13
i think it's positively encouraged but
14:15
this was a report last month by ap
14:18
associated press which was in all the
14:20
newspapers afterwards and basically it's
14:22
about this factory
14:23
in a town that looks like it could be
14:25
called come in but i think it's probably
14:27
called
14:28
hameen or something like that um but
14:30
it's in iran
14:31
and um they have workers who work really
14:34
diligently adding all the stars and
14:36
the stripes and everything to all these
14:37
flags even though they know that as soon
14:39
as they've made them
14:40
they're just going to be set on fire and
14:42
the guy who runs the factory
14:44
has said in recent years the production
14:45
of u.s flags has tripled
14:47
and what eventually happens to my
14:49
products is on its end user
14:51
so he's kind of washing his hands what
14:53
happens to it afterwards
14:54
um but this company is called diba
14:56
parcham
14:58
and all i could find about them really
15:00
is they have a nice instagram
15:01
channel is it burning flex no it's flags
15:05
oh okay it's
15:06
unburning flex okay but no that i think
15:08
this is what the owner's saying
15:09
basically it's not up to me what people
15:11
do there i'm not bothered i'm just going
15:13
to give you the flag and if you want to
15:14
burn it then that's up to you
15:16
he did also say i hope there is a day
15:17
that the flags we produce are presented
15:19
as a gift
15:20
yes which kind of feels true although
15:24
a lot of them are probably given as
15:25
gifts today they're just given us gifts
15:26
saying hey i know you want something to
15:27
burn at the end
15:28
later but it's yeah and they make three
15:31
kinds of flags one is for display
15:33
purposes one is
15:34
tablecloth flags which is if you have a
15:36
conference or something and then the
15:38
third is demonstration flags and that
15:39
really spikes on
15:40
days of national holiday for example
15:42
because you want an american flag to
15:43
burn on a national holiday
15:44
yeah so you're not supposed to burn the
15:46
tablecloth once presumably no no no no
15:48
that's
15:48
because that's the ruins at dinner is
15:50
the town
15:51
where is the town where i ayatollah
15:53
comedy uh was born
15:55
so that's why the town is called common
15:56
or maybe why he was called comedy
15:58
yeah and uh his house is now a major
16:00
tourist site but it's not the it's not
16:02
the only tourist site there because
16:03
there are some
16:04
caves nearby with some rock art with cup
16:07
marks which
16:08
may be up to 40 000 years old what
16:11
yeah what's a cup mod i am not
16:13
completely sure what a cup market is
16:15
so i'm always getting told off at home
16:17
for putting my hot cup of tea on the
16:18
table
16:19
and leaving a mark and i'm always like
16:21
look it'll erode eventually it'll
16:23
disappear but if you're telling me
16:25
they're 40 000 years old
16:27
right they should have used a coaster
16:31
it's funny isn't it how people burn
16:34
flags
16:35
and find it offensive and stuff
16:36
considering that really no countries had
16:38
flags until
16:39
like the late 18th century and most
16:41
countries didn't have them until the
16:42
late 19th and early 20th century
16:44
it's really a modern thing the idea of
16:46
national flags
16:48
yeah you would get them on boats and
16:49
stuff but as a country
16:51
quite a lot of countries are really into
16:52
their flag so there are quite a few
16:53
where the red stripe signifies the blood
16:55
lost in war and stuff
16:56
yeah and quite a lot of countries don't
16:58
allow you to burn them whereas america
17:00
is fine
17:01
well in america they have a day for it
17:02
june 14th still
17:04
absolutely it's the day that you retire
17:06
flags
17:07
so the idea is that you are meant to
17:09
burn flags when they're over
17:10
and there's an actual day that you can
17:12
save the flag for so if you want to burn
17:14
an american flag
17:14
june 14th that's the day if you want to
17:17
be respectful absolutely
17:18
if you want to offend everyone do it any
17:19
other day of the year yeah the day
17:21
before
17:21
yeah they do say in the flag code don't
17:24
know the us has a flag code and they say
17:26
how to dispose of it which is in a
17:27
dignified way
17:28
preferably by burning but there are lots
17:31
of other sites and lots of other
17:32
companies which advise further on
17:34
exactly how you should burn it
17:35
and so places like the boy scouts or
17:37
flag cellars or the newspapers will say
17:39
what you've got to do is you've got to
17:40
fold your flag up very carefully place
17:43
it in the very middle of a fire
17:45
recite the pledge of allegiance and then
17:46
observe a minute silence slimey as it
17:49
burns
17:49
the flag sellers say and you must do
17:50
that on the day after you buy it and
17:52
then buy another one immediately
17:54
have you heard of flag disposal boxes no
17:57
these are a thing in america
17:58
they are specific boxes for your old
18:01
flags that have become worn or weathered
18:04
and you drop them in there and every
18:05
often a boy scout will come around and
18:07
he'll
18:07
open it up take all the flags out and
18:09
then burn them like a flag respectfully
18:11
it's like a flag
18:12
and they have these in supermarkets
18:14
that's how big the flag is
18:15
so it's like basically like recycling
18:18
you have your clear glass
18:19
and your brown glass and then your flag
18:21
yeah exactly
18:23
that's so specific a thing to have yeah
18:27
you think there could be one collection
18:28
day a year where someone just goes
18:29
around saying how many flags have you
18:31
got through this
18:32
there are so many flags there are so
18:34
many flags in america there's like wine
18:36
bottles here we have a huge bottle of
18:37
wine bottles at the end of the week
18:38
they've just got i can't believe we went
18:40
through so many flags this week do you
18:41
get a bit embarrassed putting out all
18:43
these flags and
18:44
all your neighbors seeing oh god really
18:45
went crazy last week
18:47
we had a black party we had a flag pass
18:49
we've got a flag problem mate
18:53
it did used to be illegal to burn the
18:54
american flag didn't it for quite a
18:56
brief time
18:56
so it was in 1968 when people were
18:59
getting quite into it during vietnam
19:01
according to burning the flag in protest
19:03
and it was made federal law that you
19:05
couldn't do it and then in 1989
19:07
there was a guy called gregory lee
19:08
johnson who burned the flag it was like
19:10
an anti-reagan and anarchist sort of
19:12
protest
19:13
and he said he should be allowed to burn
19:14
it was violating his free speech his
19:16
freedom of speech
19:17
that he couldn't express himself by
19:18
doing that and he won it was a quite
19:20
famous case the texas versus johnson
19:22
case
19:23
he won and since 1989 it's been
19:25
completely fine to burn the flag
19:27
and what i found interesting was he's
19:29
still going and in
19:31
he's still doing the same thing he's
19:32
still flag burning all over america and
19:34
in 2016 he this guy gregory lee johnson
19:36
was arrested
19:38
during a staged flag burning at the
19:39
republican national convention in
19:41
cleveland
19:42
and the reason he was arrested because
19:43
obviously you can't be arrested for
19:44
burning a flag
19:45
is that police said that he lit his
19:47
pants on fire and there's another
19:52
[Laughter]
19:55
anyway i just want to say in gregory
19:57
johnson's defense and against all the
19:59
news reports at the time
20:00
he didn't like himself or anyone else on
20:02
fire this was just like classic u.s
20:04
police
20:05
and he actually got compensations of 225
20:08
thousand dollars
20:09
hang on anna did the boy scouts
20:12
burn flags to dispose of them between
20:14
1960
20:15
whatever it was 1969 and 1980 they must
20:18
have done that there must have been a
20:18
loophole
20:19
yeah so it wasn't for the purposes of
20:21
this that was sort of allowed
20:22
it must have been unless maybe they had
20:24
an enormous flag pile up and didn't know
20:26
i mean there might be a prison still
20:27
with thousands of scouts in it
20:30
we were all put away for life sentences
20:32
they would have been able
20:34
they've been trained this one this badge
20:37
is for escaping alcatraz
20:39
[Laughter]
20:41
just a quick thing on um flags and
20:43
protesting
20:44
have you guys heard of the danish
20:45
protest pig no no this is a pig that was
20:48
basically bred in protest to the fact
20:51
that during the prussian rule in denmark
20:53
there was bits of denmark that were told
20:54
they were not allowed to raise
20:56
their flags so they bred a pig that had
20:59
the exact
21:00
colors of the flag as a sort of walking
21:02
flag
21:03
yeah red and white yeah the colors of
21:05
the flag right yeah exactly
21:07
it's probably kind of pinky and white if
21:09
it's a pig
21:10
yeah it doesn't look like a flag when
21:12
you see the pig i've seen pictures
21:14
but it obviously was just symbolic about
21:15
it but yeah that's amazing yeah
21:17
it's just a nice little screw it's a
21:19
relatively simple flag to replicate i
21:21
guess
21:21
as opposed to the seychelles flag
21:26
what's the seychelles flag it's just got
21:28
lots of colours on it right got it
21:30
thank you everyone laughs if they all
21:32
knew the seychelles plants
21:34
that was guilty guilty i just assumed it
21:36
would be
21:37
why would he pick it
21:40
you gotta ask that you can't do the
21:42
knowing laugh the people at home will be
21:44
thinking
21:44
maybe i should know the seychelles
21:46
flag and they'll be hating themselves
21:48
and then they'll look it up and
21:49
laugh their ass off and they realize
21:51
there's like lots of
21:52
it's almost like rays of light coming up
21:53
from the bottom corner and they're all
21:55
different colors
21:55
james we've got one on the wall right
21:56
here massive flag why do you think
21:58
that's what
21:59
we're recording from this week and it's
22:01
facing the wrong direction
22:03
that's the one we're going to burn after
22:04
the show that's right
22:05
[Laughter]
22:07
um so another thing which people use for
22:10
protesting against america is shoes do
22:13
you remember this this
22:14
um kind of started or one of the first
22:16
people to do this was an iraqi reporter
22:18
called montaj al-zaidi
22:20
and he threw both of his shoes at george
22:22
w bush in 2008
22:24
and it was quite good for one person and
22:27
that was the maker of his shoes
22:29
he could then start selling them as
22:31
special
22:32
bye-bye bush models amazing
22:36
did they come with grips so you could
22:38
throw them better if
22:39
george w bush visited you uh they were
22:42
just the same shoes but they just
22:43
renamed them okay and in fairness to him
22:46
the brother of the guy who threw the
22:48
shoes said that actually
22:50
he bought iraqi-made shoes and this
22:52
company who was selling the bye bye bush
22:54
ones was a turkish company
22:56
and apparently there was also a syrian
22:57
company who were claiming that they made
22:59
the shoes
22:59
um but the turkish ones was the one that
23:01
took off and they had to get a whole lot
23:02
of new workers in to make shoes because
23:04
they were selling so many
23:06
and yeah he said that he saw it on tv
23:08
and he said i know that shoe anyway
23:10
that's definitely one of mine
23:11
i wonder if people will retrieve the
23:13
shoes afterwards because it's not like
23:14
burning something once you've thrown
23:15
your shoe at someone do you then go and
23:17
pick it up and put it back up
23:18
so do you know what happened to the
23:19
shoes to the ones thrown
23:22
were they taken by the secret service
23:24
they were but what does secret service
23:26
do put them in guantanamo bay
23:27
[Laughter]
23:32
you will talk you've got a tongue you
23:34
will
23:38
um no they were and it's exactly what
23:41
we're talking about with flags they were
23:42
burned oh god
23:44
so that is one of the reasons why this
23:45
turkish company and the syrian company
23:47
and the iraqi company could all say that
23:49
they made them because they'd been
23:50
burned so no one knew exactly what they
23:51
were were they burned respectfully by a
23:53
boy scout who had done up the laces
23:54
first
23:55
tied them neatly
24:00
there's a record there is a record for
24:02
the biggest flag which is also a pizza
24:04
of course there is but was it flappy it
24:07
has to flap to be a flag
24:08
this was actually just on a table this
24:10
was a tablecloth it was the stars and
24:11
stripes pizza
24:13
which they made with mozzarella and then
24:14
dyed mozzarella
24:17
that's cheesy i think we need to find
24:19
the blue food
24:20
they really tried and they just couldn't
24:22
do it blue m m's blue m
24:24
m's i think for the people who were
24:26
ending up eating the pizza they thought
24:28
wouldn't do that but that was small it
24:30
was quite small it was nine feet by four
24:31
feet
24:32
it was the size of the overall flag
24:33
slash pizza yeah okay that doesn't shock
24:35
me
24:36
that no one else has thought to make a
24:38
pizza flag
24:39
it's an easily breakable record though
24:41
if you're looking to break a rack that's
24:42
what i'm saying yeah
24:43
and go for a flag which is quite easy to
24:45
do yeah not the seychelles
24:48
and that's the low enough now
24:49
[Laughter]
24:53
[Applause]
24:55
okay it is time for fact number three
24:57
and that is my fact
24:58
my fact this week is that the old word
25:00
for intestines
25:01
was ropes
25:04
are we trying to bring it back i i love
25:06
it i think it's yeah
25:08
i think it's evocative isn't it yeah the
25:10
only issue is i don't talk about my
25:11
intestines that much so it'd sort of be
25:13
a wasted swap
25:14
if they were called ass ropes you might
25:16
i might bring them into every
25:17
conversation
25:19
um so when was this this was in the 14th
25:22
century
25:23
so there's there's a great instance of
25:25
it being included in the wycliffe
25:26
bible which was one of the first modern
25:29
translated english versions of the bible
25:31
by a guy called john wycliffe i believe
25:33
his name was
25:34
no wyclef sean i'm pretty sure
25:37
i've heard that name you know you might
25:39
be right he's right i think
25:40
there is a link between john wycliffe
25:42
from white house is there yeah
25:44
wyclef sean was named after john
25:46
wycliffe
25:48
yeah there's a tweet of him online
25:50
saying my father named me after john
25:51
wycliffe the biblical
25:53
scholar right amazing i know but i don't
25:56
know why you've reversed the names john
25:57
wycliffe from wycliffe shaw well maybe
25:59
his surname was sean
26:00
this one happened to be jean and they
26:02
thought this is an opportunity we can't
26:03
miss
26:05
i can't think of any other biblical
26:07
scholars over martin luther was martin
26:10
luther king named after martin luther
26:11
he must have been yeah yeah i think
26:13
people would have been called that
26:15
because he was such a famous
26:16
heroic figure yeah well so was john
26:18
wycliffe he was great
26:20
john ropes wycliffe
26:24
anyway i think it was used to mean
26:25
rectum right um specifically or i think
26:28
i read an encyclopedia from a couple of
26:30
hundred years ago
26:31
that was saying it was used to mean
26:33
rectum and then they sort of referred to
26:35
the whole gut as being one continuous
26:37
thing which is in a way
26:38
and the end of it at the end of the
26:39
large intestine in the rectum was what
26:41
they said for ass ropes
26:42
and then they called the small
26:43
intestines the small ropes but it wasn't
26:45
a robe
26:46
i mean it's it's not a rope your bottom
26:49
you can see well you can see
26:50
you know if you open someone up you can
26:52
see the ropes inside them of their
26:53
intestines
26:54
it's just so strange that they use that
26:55
to mean your your backside well it's a
26:57
you know it's still a tube
26:59
yeah you're both making really good
27:01
points
27:03
a couple more arse words from the olden
27:05
days that are obsolete
27:06
ass poss was an obsolete word for a
27:09
heavy fall on the buttocks
27:13
nice uh and us winning was the money
27:16
earned by prostitution
27:18
obsolete words
27:21
that's good so pratt was also talking
27:24
about
27:24
your bum and your hip and i really yeah
27:27
i'd never known that so pratfall
27:28
is off because of that did not know that
27:30
i've never read that when you call
27:31
someone a pratt you're saying they're
27:33
they're an ass yeah or
27:34
a hip yeah it could be could be
27:38
um so just quickly one more thing on
27:40
john wycliffe yeah
27:42
so he was kind of a proto-reformation
27:45
person because he was an english scholar
27:47
of the bible but he also
27:48
disagreed with a lot of standard
27:50
catholic church practices like
27:52
selling indulgences and praying to
27:54
saints instead of just to god or to
27:56
christ
27:57
and he was really unpopular in rome for
27:59
all these reasons so he died in 1384
28:01
really soon after his version of the
28:03
bible in english was published
28:04
and then there was this church meeting
28:06
called the council of constance
28:08
which was 40 odd years later and they
28:10
were so annoyed with him still
28:12
at this church meeting that they
28:13
declared he should be dug up and his
28:15
bones should be burned and then thrown
28:17
into the nearest river
28:18
no and it was done but was it done
28:20
respectfully
28:22
it was done very very disrespectfully
28:24
wow and they that's harsh
28:26
i know this is harsh that council of
28:27
constance just quickly they only
28:29
met because there was a really
28:30
embarrassing church situation where
28:32
there were three popes at the same time
28:34
that's a bureaucratic cock-up isn't it
28:37
it's a sitcom rating
28:40
yeah there were two from 1378 onwards
28:43
and that was a bit embarrassing
28:44
and then in 1409 player 3 entered the
28:46
game
28:47
was pretending to be the pope so one of
28:49
them was at least one of them was a
28:51
pretender
28:51
yeah so the council met to resolve this
28:54
matter and they did but they also said
28:56
let's dig up wycliffe while we're about
29:00
all meeting while we're here as a
29:01
bonding thing maybe
29:04
um on intestines yeah the quite famous
29:07
fact the
29:08
small intestines what's the surface area
29:11
oh it's something like a tennis court
29:13
or a tennis court it's not a tennis
29:15
court wow that's what you got get taught
29:17
at school all the time right the small
29:18
intestines has its incredible surface
29:20
area because it's covered in the little
29:22
philly
29:23
lumps and bumps and it's very windy and
29:25
you're always told it's got the surface
29:26
area of a tennis court or a football
29:27
pitch
29:28
and then a few years ago scientists
29:30
realized no one's ever actually properly
29:31
measured this
29:32
so they bothered to measure the surface
29:35
area of the intestines
29:36
and it was a bunch of swedish scientists
29:38
and they actually worked out it's only
29:39
40 square meters which is half the size
29:41
of a badminton court
29:43
sorry guys it's pretty small wow that is
29:45
small yeah i mean it's still quite big
29:46
to squeeze inside
29:48
yeah it's quite a relatively small body
29:50
but that's true um they did think
29:52
for a while and i've not actually seen
29:54
this disproven
29:55
that russian people and japanese people
29:58
had longer intestines than anyone else
30:01
okay okay so what it was they measured
30:04
some intestines
30:05
back in the olden days and they found
30:07
that the russian intestines were about
30:08
five
30:09
feet longer on average than anyone else
30:11
in europe and
30:12
we think that probably the reason was is
30:14
because they had quite a small
30:16
sample size and actually your intestines
30:18
different people have different lengths
30:20
and that is you know they're quite
30:21
different
30:22
in size and they think probably they
30:24
just got lucky that they got some
30:25
russians with big intestines
30:27
but they blamed it on economic
30:28
conditions saying that they lived on a
30:30
vegetarian diet and so they needed to
30:32
grow longer intestines so they could eat
30:34
all these vegetables
30:37
then on the other hand in japan there is
30:40
a theory
30:41
thought by japanese people that japanese
30:44
people have longer intestines
30:45
okay and i saw this really good article
30:48
shame on me i can't remember where it
30:49
was where
30:50
this person looked into this and they
30:52
surveyed a load of japanese students and
30:53
65
30:55
of them believed that japanese people
30:57
had longer intestines
30:59
and four of the people who they asked
31:01
said that
31:02
they were exactly 1.5 times anyone else
31:05
in the world
31:05
they had this belief is like a myth that
31:08
but then this guy asked the actual
31:10
doctor
31:10
and this doctor said it's kind of known
31:12
in the field of
31:13
you know cutting people up um that if
31:16
you get
31:17
young asian women they have extremely
31:20
long
31:20
intestines okay and i just can't find
31:24
any actual evidence of people other than
31:26
these people
31:27
actually measuring them so for all i
31:29
know it's true and the idea is that if
31:31
you're on a vegetarian diet or that kind
31:33
of diet you might
31:35
for some reason have longer intestines
31:37
now obviously this does sound like
31:38
31:40
but it is widely thought in some parts
31:42
of the world that that's true
31:43
that's true so koalas have really long
31:45
intestines and they use
31:46
exclusively eucalyptus and they have to
31:48
break that down a lot because it's quite
31:50
poisonous eucalyptus
31:51
but that's over millions of years so i
31:53
don't know how quick it doesn't take the
31:54
millions of years to break down a bit of
31:55
eucalyptus
31:57
particularly no you are right um but it
32:00
is definitely true that
32:02
between individuals like my intestines
32:04
might be way longer than yours or way
32:06
shorter
32:07
could they test it by presumably we
32:08
could get you know some japanese people
32:10
some russian people one of us to swallow
32:12
something indigestible maybe some
32:14
chewing gum or something
32:15
and then we'll time how long it takes to
32:17
come out and then
32:18
whoever's probably interested in through
32:20
ct scans or
32:21
yeah you know just taking dead bodies
32:25
and cutting them open maybe i don't know
32:26
just by touching your body's a coming
32:28
moment i would struggle to get the
32:30
wherewithal to cut open a dead body
32:32
if we all tried it i thought arranging a
32:34
ct scan was hard enough
32:37
i see what you're saying you're thinking
32:39
of a practical way for us to do it
32:41
because we know some russians we know
32:42
some japanese people we could try it i
32:44
thought that might that could be a first
32:45
step and then we'll think about the
32:46
cadaver exhibition
32:48
if that doesn't work is that a thing
32:50
though where we could race
32:51
chewing gum no it's unlikely to be
32:54
accepted for the olympics
32:56
24. yeah what do you mean is that a
32:59
thing
33:00
i mean there's a thing i just made up i
33:02
just i was just wondering if there's a
33:03
mean average speed of digestion
33:06
there must be well there must be an
33:08
average but people must
33:10
vary i suppose well because they got
33:11
five foot longer intestines yeah yeah or
33:13
you might have a narrower
33:14
tunnel so that might your food might be
33:16
pushed along it faster or take longer to
33:17
get along
33:18
and like candy said it's not a spectator
33:19
spot really is it that's not much of fun
33:22
at a dinner party if you had a little
33:24
gps tracker
33:25
inside the chewing gum let's say yeah
33:27
yeah um andy's making his way down there
33:30
yeah you give it like a slalom ski route
33:33
and you head it up on screens
33:34
i can see that being fun and they
33:36
actually do that sort of thing now in
33:37
medicine don't they they send trackers
33:39
down through your system it's quite a
33:40
common thing
33:41
to swallow something and they've got a
33:42
new thing which is you know how if you
33:44
need to diagnose stomach issues
33:46
sometimes they'll have to do an
33:47
endoscopy and you'll have to actually
33:49
swallow something
33:50
and it's quite uncomfortable and then
33:51
they'll scrape the mucus from your
33:53
stomach lining and then it'll get a
33:54
sample of mucus
33:55
and it'll work out what's wrong with you
33:57
and now they've invented and i think
33:59
it's going to
33:59
be released onto the markets in the next
34:02
year or two
34:02
a sort of hoover which you swallow and
34:05
it does that for you
34:06
so it's a tiny little capsule and you
34:08
swallow it and it's got this amazing
34:10
mechanism where
34:12
it's got an opening at the top which is
34:14
clamped shut by a weird like
34:16
blob of wax but once it gets down to
34:18
your stomach
34:19
there's a magnet placed outside your
34:21
body that triggers an electric current
34:23
that melts that little wax pellet so it
34:26
opens the sack up
34:27
and then the sac can hoover up all the
34:29
mucus in your stomach lining
34:30
and then it'll carry it out like a
34:31
little hoover bag and then you pour it
34:33
out and you
34:34
return the hoover back to the doctor i
34:36
can tell you what's wrong with you that
34:37
is
34:38
clever it's weird that's weird
34:42
you know bees yup they have
34:45
expandable rectums do they yeah
34:48
don't we all yeah very good point yep
34:52
nothing special okay these have
34:55
extremely
34:56
expandable rectangles how expandable can
34:58
they be well
34:59
bees sometimes go into the hive for the
35:01
winter yeah
35:03
and what they can do is they cannot have
35:05
a poo for several months
35:07
so some bees just stretch out their
35:10
rectums between november and march
35:12
they just carry around all their poo
35:14
inside their bums for the last four
35:15
months and then when march comes when
35:17
it's spring again
35:18
they can leave the hive and then they
35:19
have a poo outside they take an enormous
35:21
copy of war and peace or something
35:23
i'll be a couple of days
35:29
okay it's time for our final fact of the
35:31
show and that is
35:32
anna my fact this week is that
35:34
researchers have 3d printed sex dolls
35:37
for turtles
35:40
because this is what they do this was an
35:42
article in the conversation about a
35:43
researcher
35:44
who was pointing out that we actually
35:46
know surprisingly little about how a lot
35:48
of turtles mate
35:49
and it's quite hard to study how they
35:50
make without disturbing them because
35:51
you've got to go
35:52
swim down with your snorkel and mask and
35:53
watch them and so what they've done is
35:56
they've 3d printed decoys
35:58
and so they 3d printed these two decoy
35:59
females and one of the things they were
36:01
looking at was what's attractive in a
36:03
female to a male turtle so they printed
36:05
one that was your average size
36:06
and one that was like the very upper end
36:09
of the maximum size that female could
36:11
get to
36:11
and they stick cameras on the turtles
36:13
sink them to the bottom of a lake or a
36:14
pond or a river
36:16
and uh see what happens and it turned
36:18
out the large one the big decoy
36:20
got twice as many visits and five times
36:22
as many mating attempts
36:24
medium-sized that's very cool these are
36:26
map turtles
36:27
right yes northern map turtles yeah so
36:29
they're really cool the reason that this
36:31
3d printing exercise worked quite well
36:33
is because to me they all gather
36:35
together into a massive
36:36
orgy spot so this is every autumn
36:39
hundreds and hundreds will get together
36:40
at the bottom of the lake
36:41
and then they'll have sex and then
36:44
they'll sort of wedge themselves under a
36:45
rock so they don't float away and
36:47
they'll basically go to sleep for five
36:48
months or hibernate
36:50
and it's often under 50 centimeters of
36:52
ice so they'll just be on the bottom
36:54
and they don't breathe well they breathe
36:55
through their skin they don't breathe
36:56
through their through their mouths while
36:58
they're doing that
36:58
and they wake up in spring first thing
37:00
they do is mate again so they just have
37:01
a long hibernation
37:03
sandwich where the bread is the mating
37:08
and the filling is the sleeping yes yeah
37:11
it's a very big filling compared to the
37:13
very thin
37:14
slices of mating bread i think you
37:17
stretch this analogy
37:19
enough i think it's willing to crack
37:22
but anyway that was why it was quite
37:24
easy because you know exactly where to
37:25
drop the decoys and there are plenty of
37:27
them around
37:27
and it's just really sad to watch have
37:29
you seen the videos of the little guys
37:31
trying to mate with the females it's
37:32
just awful knowing that the 3d printed
37:34
females yeah it's just not going to get
37:36
anything out of it
37:38
there's so much awesome 3d printing
37:40
stuff that's going on
37:42
so some scientists again with uh turtles
37:45
they've been making fake sea turtle eggs
37:49
and then burying them on the beach can
37:52
you guess why
37:53
is it so that because humans sometimes
37:55
go and collect eggs and try and steal
37:57
them bingo
37:58
that's it it's just it's to catch
38:00
poachers okay so you bury the fake eggs
38:02
on the beach and then the poachers come
38:03
along
38:04
and steal the decoys along with the real
38:05
eggs but the decoys have gps trackers in
38:08
so then you just map where they're all
38:09
going to wow and if
38:11
like eggs from two different gps
38:12
trackers end up in the same place you
38:14
think there's your hub of poaching
38:15
and you go there and make your arrests
38:16
and if they accidentally eat the egg we
38:18
can then play that game that i really
38:19
want to do of tracking
38:20
the intestinal race yeah perfect
38:24
i like the way that these people are
38:25
poaching eggs oh yeah
38:27
[Laughter]
38:30
so many people wrongly imprisoned did
38:32
you poach an egg yeah i did
38:35
um did you guys see spy in the wild i
38:38
actually didn't but it was a series that
38:39
made a load of fake animals and then
38:41
sent them into animal colonies in the
38:43
first series of it they made a fake
38:45
langer monkey and then they sent it in
38:47
to you know infiltrate a real
38:49
lango monkey society and then 120
38:52
gathered around it
38:53
and they were all really freaked out by
38:54
this thing it looked exactly like one of
38:56
them but was not quite right
38:57
and then it fell over because they were
38:58
getting a bit boisterous around it
39:00
and they all went really quiet because
39:01
they thought oh no we killed it
39:04
oh no terry's dead um and then they all
39:06
were really talented and started hugging
39:07
each other
39:08
oh i think it's a sign of emotions
39:11
spreading among those groups they
39:12
thought they'd accidentally
39:14
how did they think they killed it just
39:15
by staring it down well they nudged it
39:17
and it fell over
39:18
and didn't move yeah it's so interesting
39:20
so this was a guy who works at the bbc
39:22
or for the bbc with these programs
39:24
called john downer
39:25
and he made a series ages ago where he
39:28
didn't quite do animals he'd put cameras
39:29
in boulders he'd boulder cam basically
39:32
and they thought that worked so well why
39:34
don't we try and make animatronic
39:35
animals so they did a prairie dog
39:37
they did a walking crocodile they did a
39:39
female orangutang
39:41
and with each one they gave them a very
39:43
specific trait
39:44
that would help them survive in the wild
39:46
so like the prairie dogs
39:47
the animals have they kiss each other a
39:49
lot and so they have that ability to do
39:51
that and there's a thing called the jump
39:52
yip which is a way of bonding and so
39:54
they were able to make this
39:55
do a jump yep yeah so they took all
39:57
these traits um
39:58
yeah there was a spy puffer fish that
40:00
they used it it's incredible
40:02
meerkats made in feces that's right
40:04
that's because they
40:05
try to make it smell like the other
40:06
meerkats by collecting their poo and
40:08
then smearing that animatronic one with
40:09
it
40:10
with the pile of poo in its bun
40:14
have you heard of these decoy deer they
40:16
have i'm not sure if these are
40:18
3d printed in fact i think they are kind
40:20
of made by engineers and by
40:22
by sort of hunting experts but this is
40:24
another way of luring poachers
40:26
so this happens in washington state and
40:28
various different bits of the usa
40:30
because finding poachers is unbelievably
40:32
hard to do because what you need is you
40:34
need
40:34
a wild animal and a poacher and a law
40:36
enforcement officer all to be in the
40:38
same place at the same time
40:39
which is really hard it's a nightmare so
40:41
they've started making these dummy deer
40:43
and then putting them out in fields and
40:45
that lures the poachers to them
40:47
but you also whenever you put the deer
40:48
out you just have a you know wildlife
40:50
officer
40:50
who sits near it and waits for someone
40:52
to pop up and shoot it and they've made
40:54
them so good that they can now turn
40:56
their heads these
40:56
fake animals or lift their legs nice
40:59
yeah and so a deer costs about
41:01
three thousand to make three thousand
41:03
dollars to produce right because you
41:05
need an animal skin and you need some
41:07
mechanics
41:08
you need to kill a deer first so you
41:11
kill the deer
41:12
yeah get the skin off it yeah you hire a
41:14
poacher to kill you
41:17
but once you've got that in place you
41:19
can make thirty thousand dollars in
41:20
fines
41:21
finding poachers oh yeah there was one
41:23
where they put it out and within five
41:25
minutes of poacher turned up and tried
41:26
to shoot it yeah
41:28
because i was thinking how do you
41:29
guarantee a poacher's gonna find it you
41:30
could be sitting there for weeks
41:31
if you put it near a road that's quite
41:33
helpful because obviously then they'll
41:34
see it and they'll
41:35
they'll you know they might stop the car
41:37
and try and have a crack at it if
41:38
they're not allowed to if it's off
41:39
season or something
41:40
so yeah and they can be shot a hundred
41:42
times without breaking
41:44
some of that's going to make the them
41:48
suspicious on the 90th gun shot that's
41:51
going to make that um
41:52
version of bambi very long isn't it
41:56
such a traumatic scene this would be a
41:59
bambi made by tarantino
42:04
i love decoy animals i like all the ways
42:07
that scientists use them and i was
42:08
looking at probably like the most kind
42:10
of well-known maybe
42:11
widely used decoys the duck decoy the
42:13
the classic hunters would take
42:15
taken out ducks for hundreds of years
42:16
because you plant a flock of fake ducks
42:19
on a pond and then the real ducks flock
42:21
to it
42:21
and so i thought i'd look into this
42:24
first of all i didn't realize how many
42:25
you had to bring out so when you went on
42:27
a duck hunt in you know the 1700s 1800s
42:30
then you wouldn't just take a couple of
42:31
wooden carved duck decoys
42:33
you had to mimic a flock so on your hunt
42:35
you'd take up to 500.
42:39
a little bit 500 no way
42:42
you've got to plot this massive flock on
42:44
your pond
42:45
to catch one dunk
42:48
i don't know how they ever made a profit
42:50
it doesn't make any sense
42:53
to be fair if i was a duck and i saw a
42:55
party with 500 friends
42:57
i'd immediately want to join it exactly
42:59
and then you also had to have live decoy
43:01
ducks with the 500s
43:03
well because they have to make the
43:04
realistic calls so you'd have 500 quiet
43:07
ducks
43:07
made of wood and then you'd have to have
43:09
a couple of live ones that they keep on
43:10
a lead
43:11
sort of in amongst them to make the
43:13
noise this all sounds
43:14
untrue doesn't it it's pretty sinister
43:17
as well for the two ducks in the middle
43:18
of these 500 dummies
43:20
luring their mates to their deaths yeah
43:22
that's incredible it's a rough gig
43:25
uh we should wrap up soon right okay um
43:27
just a quick thing on
43:28
turtles tortoises you guys read that
43:30
diego the hood island tortoise has
43:32
retired
43:33
from shagging finally and finally this
43:36
is this
43:38
recent news uh this is this year so
43:40
diego is a hood island tortoise and they
43:43
were tortoises who in the 1960s
43:46
they realized that there were only three
43:48
males left and only about a dozen
43:50
females left on a galapagos island
43:52
and so they started a breeding program
43:53
so there's about 50 years ago
43:55
and so they had these three tortoises
43:57
and they tried to make them mate and
43:58
diego
44:00
has mated and he's now produced about
44:02
800 offspring
44:04
and this other one uh even better than
44:06
him has produced about 1200 offspring
44:09
whoa the third one just didn't do any
44:12
it was just really and uh diego's
44:15
just retired and he's hit the headlines
44:17
and i find him really interesting
44:18
because first of all like well done him
44:20
he's shagged all these tortoises
44:21
he's repopulated the galapagos with this
44:23
type of tortoise
44:24
but also he's super famous and the one
44:27
who's done more shacking and is still
44:28
going
44:29
is not that famous and i was reading an
44:31
interview with one of the professors who
44:32
works on it
44:33
and he was speculating he was saying so
44:35
the other one who's actually
44:37
signed 60 he's called e5
44:40
so not as good a name um and the
44:43
one was called e3 and so bit rubbish
44:45
and also apparently is more reserved and
44:47
less charismatic
44:51
well diego is also an exhibitionist
44:52
which you probably would expect with the
44:54
name as well so he shags very loudly and
44:56
very aggressively
44:57
and does it in the daytime so you can
44:59
see him whereas e5
45:01
sort of no one's really seen him mating
45:03
very much they think maybe he does it at
45:05
night and he's a bit quiet about it
45:06
and so he's just apparently not as big a
45:08
personality and we know the only reason
45:10
we know is they did a paternity test on
45:12
every single
45:13
one of the nudes yeah tortoises two
45:16
thousand paternity tests amazing episode
45:18
of the jeremy kyle
45:21
we'll be showing the results for the
45:22
next four seasons of this show
45:26
they start moving towards each other
45:27
really slowly to have a fight
45:35
okay that's it that's all of our facts
45:37
